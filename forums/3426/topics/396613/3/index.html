              <p>To hit $300 - $400 everyday, one must OMO and work 16 hours everyday. No other way. I have met several of these SMRT guys doing SATS jobs. They dont play cabby forums or lakeview and showed me their collection notes of $300 - $400 (gross) everyday as proof.</p>
              <p>But to get $300 (nett) in a 12 hr shift everyday? I dont think it is possible.</p>

              <p>For some ministers , they really deserve it .</p>
              <p>They worked in their offices for 6 days , Sunday went for a walk about at their housing estates .... they fully deserve it .</p>

              <p>please elaborate on what kind of policies is needed to protect cabbies? protect cabby from? robbery or wad?</p>
              <p>Cabbies here are already protected. no FTs allowed in this trade</p>
              <p>Anyone who hantum, rob a cabby , run off with fares can go to jail</p>
              <p>wad else do u wan protected? build a cage in the taxi?</p>
              <p>&lt;LTA n their alliances are supposed to be there to create a
              better Singapore , not ruin Singapore&gt;</p>
              <p>Other than not allowing TDs to own their own taxis and letting the blood sucking cos bleed us dry of daily rentals and levies , wad policies have they come out with to ruin us? if they did ruin us , will u still be here shouting abt 4k? 1k also duno have or not</p>

              <p>tell me , how many taxis are there still today? wad can 60% of the hirers do??</p>

              <p>i can excuse u if u were a newbie. someone who just got into this trade when taxi business is above average.</p>
              <p>Like u , i been thru SARs, economic downturns to know how bad taxi business can be. i always tell myself never be complacent and hao lian. what u can make today does not mean it will be the same tomoro.</p>
              <p>to me , talking abt earnings in the open is just one way of boosting either your ego or your self belief that TD is the 'best'.</p>

              <p>Crap all that I typed all disappear........30 min worth of typing all gone.</p>

              <p>Ok I try to type again. sigh...........</p>
              <p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>After reading all the posts, I agree somewhat if not fully with what Poolman has said.</p>
              <p>Singapore tried to be a meritocracy society, ie in short - you work hard you deserved to be rewarded. However, we all know that is not the case MOST of the time. When I read Poolman post, I have a sense that he feels very strongly the 2 mentioned TDs has worked hard and has risen above the norm and got rewarded with the income they have.</p>
              <p>If u have attended the TD course recently like me, you will know that LTA is quite aware of our income and so is IRA. Like many business who tried to avoid paying tax, many TD under declare. As such, there is no need for us feeling so strongly when certain TD income is being posted.</p>
              <p>I have not felt Poolman is being in anyway egoistic when he talked about the TD income. He has clearly stated that not all TD earned that kind of money and those 2 are well deserved.</p>
              <p>After driving taxi for about 8 months now, I become more appreciative for our government. Sure, they are not perfect. Some of the things they do is detrimental to middle and lower income group. However, I can see that they are trying very hard to satisfy the whims and fancies of Singaporeans. Like what Poolman has said, I can see changes finally taking place to secure the jobs of normal Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>When pple talk to me, they will think I am a PAP man. Infact, I am not. But I am grateful for the fact that they are wise enough to govern Singapore.</p>
              <p>To conclude (man I wished wad I typed just now is not gone, it would better represent wad I said), if there is any problem with Poolman, it is for the fact he has used Singapore way of expressing instead of proper english. That may explain why TCL react as such.</p>
              <p>I think if Poolman choose to type like me (eh steady lar, I hao lian liao), he should be able to express himself more clearly. ^^</p>
