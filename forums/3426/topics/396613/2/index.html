              <p>There is another problem with SMRT. The $1000 or $1500 deposit
              that you place with SMRT can only be returned after 1 year.
              Anything earlier, u have to forfeit $50 after 6 months or
              $300 before 6 months.</p>

              <p>i remembered their annual driver renewal fee was $78. phui comfort only 21.60 if im not wrong. just imagine based on their fleet of 3,000 then , they collected 3 times more than comfort.</p>

But now, me armoured liao, left ear go in, right ear out. Do I care? Unless it's really my fault, otherwise they are just another unreasonable pax to me.</p>
              <p>It will take some times for newbie to adjust to the life of a TD, but don't gave up just after 1-2 mths, u never know you could really make it in this line.</p>
              <p>I must thanks ceo pool for all the helps he have given me since I join lakeview. He takes very good care of me. I see my earning jump since I joined. I am looking to hit $4k as my target this month. I don't know if I can make it since now sats job change abit, but I am taking up this challenge.</p>
              <p>The only way I can repay people helping me is to give back more when I more stable in LV. This is in line with ceo pool mottoes.</p>

              <p>Ngkialeong888 has practically said all that is about SMRT. I am a new driver 8 months ago and I take SSanyeong MPV. The vehicle is good for tan jia but unfortunately because of what Ngkialeong888 has said, u will find it fustrating to drive SMRT cabs.</p>
              <p>If you are new driver and dun wan commitment, join as a relief. Otherwise NEVER join SMRT just because it look cool or attractive. Trust me they are not. That scheme that says garantee $2k is ****(fill in the word urself).</p>
              <p>You are sort of a businessman when you are a taxi driver. U dun owe anyone anything. You are a businessman that rent from the best taxis company who offer the best deal. U dun drive for anyone but urself. The taxi company merely offer the vehicle for u to tan jia because of government ruling that all taxi driver can no longer own their private vehicle to earn a decent and honest living.</p>
              <p>The scheme that SMRT offer practically makes you an employee. In that scheme, you become a worker and not a businessman. Why do u wan to be enslave by them? As if working outside is not enough. On top of that, the vehicle being offered is the one everyone is avoiding. Why take over the shit that no one want. if u like playing with shit may as well be a gardener or a landscape artist. Trust me, they are better paid and more dignified.</p>
              <p>I can rant whole day about SMRT, but the last thing I wan is to see defamation suit coming to my house. So I gonna stop here. You are a freeman, u decide for yourself. If u in the end really wan to join SMRT, by all means. But my advice is that there is, in my own opinion, 3 vehicle that is worth renting. The Crown, the Nissan and SSanyeong(dun cry ah for the first 3-6 months).</p>
              <p>Seriously, go Transcab better.</p>
