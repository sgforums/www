              1) registratn 20 oct 09
              2) medical 01 dec'09 (can be aft '1'...DELAYED my own time)
              3) applicatn for online orientatn 26 jan'10 (date given, no choice)
              4) excursion bookin 09 feb'10(aft orientation, jus go 'click' 'click' 'clicl' to get ya by to book an available excursion date)
              5) excursion date 14 mar'10
              6) test date date 23 mar'10 (STUDY only after '6')
              7) re-test 29 mar'10 - passed (dis purely unneccessary- paid extra S$15.00+++ on top of time wastage!)
              8) 09 apr'10 - tvl license
              
              i got my tvl in bout 6mths cos m stil und employmt, so quite in a comfort zone (no gd!). but if ya fast &amp; can spare bout S$400 on hand, can get it in bout 2.5 mths or less!

              joining a co.
              
              m yet a cabby here (tho v soon to be) but if even so, stil super junior, regardless of age or experience outside cab drivin. 
              
              me took one wk to read back some 'relevant' postings to my ques. if ya wld, do e same...you appreciate why certain co.(s) mentioned is/r better not to be taken seriously if your intendin to be 'one of theirs'. 
              
              end of d day, its your hardworking attitude + some 'smart' decision as to which co.(s) to join that make your income much satisfactory + Justifiable. read back if ya wana be serious. some time spent here is worthy rather than Real time (&amp;$$$) wastages out there in real :)

              <p>Angku, me currently counting down to returning smrt crown. Let me highlight where is the problems of smrt :</p>
              <p>1) New car (azera) you cannot tahan cng (ask mangodew and you know why), old car you cannot tahan their workshop. Cos you will spend more time in workshop than on the road.</p>
              <p>2) Merc cab, space, in my opinion not for newbie. Must salute mangodew gor his courage. Cos you need lots of lobang to survive. No point getting a merc or space to sweep road, you are better off getting a standard taxi.</p>
              <p>3) Smrt call system have improve, but don't expect too much lah. They only sound off when other company got no taken, and nowsaday alot no location one. Thanks to the automated booking system. (As to why no location cannot take, you will understand later when you start driving)</p>
              <p>4) Workshop - Horrified experiences. Be prepare to wait 3-4 hours or more for the repairs, that haven't include repetitive jobs that need to be done everytime you come out. That why they prepare such nice lounged for you to rest mah. They scared you boring sia.</p>
              <p>5) One more point to you. The revenue sharing scheme with the guaranteed $2k income, they are using it the Azera on CNG. It doesn't come guranteed $2k unless you hit the target sales they set, if you fall short, you have to top up the balance . That exclude the facts that Azera using CNG that goes only 180 L/tank. You will die cock stand. Trust me.</p>
              <p>So my conclusion to you</p>
              <p>1) Don't OMO, start as a relief</p>
              <p>2) Do a thorough check on other taxi company scheme and rental before you commit. SMRT know they do not have a edge, that why they keep coming with stupid scheme to attract people like u (and me previously).</p>
              <p>3) Turn your situation into strength. It could be motivational factor</p>
              <p>4) Learn as much as you can from this forum. If in doubt ask. I am sure TD in this forum will share with you. Go lah kopi one day with us</p>

              <p>1 person say, 2 say, so many say.... i will be silly not to take their comments seriously.</p>
              <p>So, SMRT on paper soounds like the best deal - but no need anyone tell me, merc or ssangyong not for 1st timers.</p>
              <p>So if i still go for train &amp; place scheme due to $ deposit problem, then smrt is no-no left comfort/citycab..... any complaints about comfort - i heard big, ngeow, lots of paperwork, kenna deduct this that a lot ... true.... nothing perfect....</p>
              <p>If i got 5k deposit, i sure go for kia magentis auto diesal some more from premier, i saw from brochure at taxi acdmy today... premier deposit how much, i can't find from online?</p>

              <p>Bro Angku,</p>
              <p>There is another problem with SMRT. The $1000 or $1500 deposit that you place with SMRT can only be returned after 1 year. Anything earlier, u have to forfeit $50 after 6 months or $300 before 6 months.</p>
              <p>Comfort/Citycab is the most deposit friendly. You can pay your $1000 in 4 installments. $250 x 4. So at most just cough out $250 first.</p>
              <p>I suggest u be a comfort/citycab relief first. Dont be hirer. It worked for me, and should work for u too.</p>

              <p>Correction : 5k deposit is for Prime (The burgundy color taxi), Kia Magentis is from Premier, silver color one.</p>
              <p>Let see this summary</p>
              <p>Premier got 3 schemefor kia</p>
              <p>a )No contract - $100 safety incentive mthly, $150 Good performance incentive mthly, $300 Loyalty service bonus every 6 mths, $180 road tax rebate yearly. Rental is $102.72. Deposit $1K</p>
              <p>b) 3 mths contracts - $50 safety incentive mthly,$200 Good performance mthly, $100 diesel rebate mthly, $180 road tax rebate yearly. Rental is $102.72. Deposit 1K.</p>
              <p>c) 1yr + 1 yr + 1 yr Contract - $300 safety incentive half yearly, $300 Good performance half yearly, Loyalty bonus (Yr 1 = $400, yr 2=$800, yr 3 = $2000), $180 road tax rebate yearly. Rental depends on payment mode from $86.24-$90.00. Deposit 1K. If break contract, penalty is $4K</p>
              <p>i) All Kia Magentis don't have booking system (MDT), they uses walkie talkie (free for 3 mths).</p>
              <p>ii) Accident access 1st=$1500, 2nd=$2000, 3rd=$2500.</p>
              <p>iii) Kia Magentis no free rental day, only toyata crown have.</p>
              <p>iv) Diesel price is $0.96.</p>
              <p>v) Rental deduction is on every Monday &amp; last day of the month.</p>

              <p>From my point of view;</p>
              <p>1) SMRT - "Good" scheme for beginners to start a taxi career but be aware of the points listed earlier on. Diesel is $0.93. Accident access is low, better booking system now. But choice of auto taxi sucks.</p>
              <p>2) Premier (Kia) - Not a good choice for beginner. Cos overhead expenses is high and the benefit is not attractive. Accident access is very high. No satelite Booking system. Kia is on diesel.</p>
              <p>3) Comfort - Good for beginner to start as a relief, not as an OMO cos overhead high. Used to have good booking, but now bookings alot of taiko one. But for a beginner it a good enough way to start off. Sonata all are diesel and comfort offer cheapest diesel, if i remember should be around $0.88</p>
              <p>4) Prime - Not for beginner cos got to commit $5k deposit for 5 years contract. All prime taxi are CNG. Can only relief 2 days (correct me if i m wrong)</p>
              <p>5) Transcab - Good for OMO cos benefits attractive, cons is toyota wish is on CNG, making it difficult to find relief.</p>
              <p>So to say comfort offer a good way to start as a relief. But if you wanted to start off as OMO, transcab is better cos attractive benefits.</p>
