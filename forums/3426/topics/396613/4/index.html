              <p>My opinion is that what Poolman shelling about 4K or 5K taking in TD is not everyone's cuppa.  Most TD won't make it  and the other two that Pool emphasize is not everyone came make it.  Mind you that even with 4K or 5K is nothing in context to a "high flier decent salary".  Because Pool is not talking about Medical, PA insurances,etc...and blah blah blah....... So what if occasional hit 4K or 5 K ---Come On man , Not every day is a Sunday...So what if occasionally i hit $400 once?  That's not include minus Rentals, Fuels and it's not even counted as NETT profit.</p>
              <p>TCL - I totally agreed that bragging too much of taking is useless in this forum as many people are watching with "IGNORANCE".  WTF, those taxman,LTA, Taxi Co, Reporters and Publics of Ignorances Peoples are waiting to rant about this issues.</p>
              <p>Sometimes or even somedays might be very difficult, during crisis, during downturn, during cyclical economic issues.  All this affect a TD day takings and not even to mentioned about Nett Earnings.</p>
              <p>I agreed with TCL that taxis co are acting like a cartel...KNN, why i say that is look at their style of managing.....Act of Ignorances.   Pretend and Act with Where the Wind Blows and Follow the Winds.  If LTA said that the fare structures is up to the Taxi Co, Why not Transcab or Premier of Whoever try to be different with CDG?  Why CDG not try to be different with the RSW $3 surcharge issues?  So call face saving, So call blah blah blah.   Pool always blast about FARE Structure....!!! I think better blast at taxi co if the Taxi Co is free to implement it.</p>
              <p>Why no Individual Taxi Ownership license?  SIMPLE Lah....Look at our SG history of controlling Union's.  I don't have to emphasize on this.  Go after the bigger Co's then going after each Individual is easy.</p>

              <p>All I can tell u is this, IF their job so great, how come all their driver never hit $300 everyday. How come pple keep complaining. Or is it their job only apply to certain group of pple? U need to ask such questions and u will know that there is some unanswered questions.</p>
              <p>Taxi driver like to talk c**k lar. Listen can liao, dun believe too much. If they earn so much, then u should be seeing them like the old days sitting in coffee shop all the time la kopi. </p>

              <p>It is not a matter of believing TD talking cock. I know for sure if I OMO drive 16 hrs a day, sure got more than $300 after deductions one. Dont need Comfort taxis actually. Yes everyday and anyday as long as I put in the required hours. The only question for myself is whether I want to work so hard everyday? No I do not want to, and also I am a relief driver with a 12 hrs limitation, so hitting $300 after deductions on a daily basis is not possible.</p>

              <p>Bro JLKL, your info helps a lot !</p>
              <p>To clarify,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> u can book excursion &amp; exam at same time?</span> I thought after excursion, then can book exam date ? ! So although u 'completed' your online course in 2 hr, due to booking lag, the fastest time to booking exam date is about 17-18 days - also can use this period to revise/prepare for exam.</p>
              <p>2 hr !  must pass end-of-module quiz before u can proceed to next module right ? the quiz so simple or can refer/open-book type ?</p>
              <p>I understand the express course 3 wks is an integrated course (no more excursion) so subject to course commencement &amp; exam booking date, the period is roughly similar 18-20+ days .......</p>

              <p>It is not a matter of believing TD talking cock. I know for sure if I OMO drive 16 hrs a day, sure got more than $300 after deductions one. Dont need Comfort taxis actually. Yes everyday and anyday as long as I put in the required hours. The only question for myself is whether I want to work so hard everyday? No I do not want to, and also I am a relief driver with a 12 hrs limitation, so hitting $300 after deductions on a daily basis is not possible.</p>

              <p>Yap thats what I am trying to say. I should have made myself clearer. My previous post is not intended as a pun. Wad I am saying is that dun believe too much of those pple who do job from certain company and claim that it is good income.</p>
              <p>For those who signing up as a new student in the Taxi Academy, my advice is that if u can do it, go to the course. It is more relaxing and got tips. No need to study like siao.</p>
              <p>If u dun have much cash and really wan to bond with an establish taxi company, join only Comfort. It is more worth it. U learn faster with all the calls. Otherwise join as a private student and ask around before you decide.</p>

              <p>My opinion is that what Poolman shelling about 4K or 5K taking
              in TD is not everyone's cuppa.  Most TD won't make it 
              and the other two that Pool emphasize is not everyone came make
              it.  Mind you that even with 4K or 5K is nothing in context to
              a "high flier decent salary".  Because Pool is not talking
              about Medical, PA insurances,etc...and blah blah blah....... So
              what if occasional hit 4K or 5 K ---Come On man , Not every day is
              a Sunday...So what if occasionally i hit $400 once?  That's
              not include minus Rentals, Fuels and it's not even counted as NETT
              profit.</p>
              <p>TCL - I totally agreed that bragging too much of taking is
              useless in this forum as many people are watching with
              "IGNORANCE".  WTF, those taxman,LTA, Taxi Co, Reporters and
              Publics of Ignorances Peoples are waiting to rant about this
              issues.</p>
              <p>Sometimes or even somedays might be very difficult, during
              crisis, during downturn, during cyclical economic issues.  All
              this affect a TD day takings and not even to mentioned about Nett
              Earnings.</p>
              <p>I agreed with TCL that taxis co are acting like a cartel...KNN,
              why i say that is look at their style of managing.....Act of
              Ignorances.   Pretend and Act with Where the Wind Blows
              and Follow the Winds.  If LTA said that the fare structures is
              up to the Taxi Co, Why not Transcab or Premier of Whoever try to be
              different with CDG?  Why CDG not try to be different with the
              RSW $3 surcharge issues?  So call face saving, So call blah
              blah blah.   Pool always blast about FARE
              Structure....!!! I think better blast at taxi co if the Taxi Co is
              free to implement it.</p>
              <p>Why no Individual Taxi Ownership license?  SIMPLE
              Lah....Look at our SG history of controlling Union's.  I don't
              have to emphasize on this.  Go after the bigger Co's then
              going after each Individual is easy.</p>

              <p>Once you book the excursion, they will give you an exam date [either the following thurs or friday, am one session, pm one session]... but they will only confirm which date is your test 1 or 2 days before your excursion.</p>
              <p>you take the quiz via internet mah.. open book lah.. like me, i know i have 3 weeks to study before the exam date so i think should be enuf lah.. important is to quickly pass the quiz so that u can book the excursion and test date.. by the time u really study and then do the quiz, it will take ages...</p>

              <p> So wad trade secret r u looking for? Wad income info u wan to know?</p>
              <p>As far as I am concerned, I have already shared such information on how to drive a "big car". Seriously, wad wrong with u with all the income thingy blah blah.</p>
              <p>Some can hit $300-$380. Some cannot. Those who cannot must examine why.</p>
              <p>- Do they understand their vehicle, fuel consumption? How much u spend per km?</p>
              <p>- Do they always "kang chia" (ie empty car) and roam from one area of the town to another?</p>
              <p>- Do they bother to sell themselves? Some driver tell me they hate to go Changi, but thats where all the business comes from. U bother to share with them about Singapore and its politics or rather spend time passing negative remarks about what government should do? Did u bother to offer them trip to tourist attraction and with ticket income u can earn more? Did u offer them a return service?</p>
              <p>I tell u, even I drive Transcab I will charge at least $35-40 for such services. That will make ur job easier.</p>
              <p>- Do u always go Casino and Airport excessively? Do u think alway go airport when u are Bedok/Tam[ines/Pasir Ris is always good at all the time? Do u think Casino is worth the travelling? 15 min waiting time is good, but do u bother to think how much time to reach there? </p>
              <p>- Do u bother to understand airline terminal info? Do u bother to roughly check wad period or tiiming of the year/day that there are more pax at AP and which timing has more planes landing?</p>
              <p>- Do u understand wad is going on in the world and Singapore so that when u talk to foreigner they will tend to like u and tip u more? This is especially to older westerners (the more so for US older couples)</p>
              <p>- Do u know which Taxi stand to go and which to avoid if u drive certain kind of taxi? This is only possible if u bother to try and fail for the first 3-6 months. Dun believe wad other taxi driver all the time. Go there try urself and see whetehr true or false. If no good, u think veteran taxi driver queue there for wad? Sight seeing? To retire at Changi Villiage?</p>
              <p>- Do u measure Time vs Money earn/spent? Do u measure Earning vs Kilometer travelled? Do u measure effort vs income earned? Are u driving more to earn wad I earn at a lesser time?</p>
              <p>Last question, DO U EVEN BOTHER? Or u are just a taxi driver who dun care and keep driving to earn what u think is good money (I believe the old birds can do that cause they are experience enough to subconsciously calculate but new drivers better think all these before u settle down in to the "old bird routine". Remember u are not them. They drive so long and can relax liao, we new bird must work hard while we r still young).</p>
              <p>If u guys think all the above questions is too bothersome, seriously, no wonder u said u cannot hit $300 even with 14hrs driving.</p>
