              TS
              
              Unless your day job is a very relax.. stress free type , highly discourage you from driving cab at night , anyway once you try driving you will know taxi driving is not easy , you have to use alot of brain power thinking how to drive to certain locaiton and find pax ... also physically taxing of sitting inside a car for 5 hours, it  will take a toll of you ... I cant even walk straight after getting out of the seat .. go and try and you will know .. you have to skip toilet break , meal at times which is bad for health
              
              But I do have a good ex-colleague making $70 to $100 every night as he knock off at 3 pm and drive from 5 pm to 12 am , he lives in Jurong and hirer his neighbour ,there are alot of on call job at factory area , I have no  doubt he is indeed acheiving the earning

              <p>just go out and feel and learn. everyday is never the same.</p>
              <p>imaging the pax you took go to this location , CCK,
              Punggol, hougang? after dropping pax you sweep at the nearby area,
              you think what are the chances you will get one pax.</p>
              <p>take time to go thru this forum where old bird has share their
              experience especially those who are driving night shift, you will
              get to learn a lot.</p>
              <p>as for income, everyone is different cos individual need are
              different.</p>
              <p>4.5k? single shift or OMO or part time, i leave if for you
              to figure out when you start driving to learn on this trade. only
              thing i would say to get more income, there is opportunity cost
              which is your health and life.</p>
              <p>for a start you may not feel, but as you continue driving maybe
              you will start to understand.   remember recently a
              delivery driver who also is a relief die during his job, even it
              may not be driving taxi at that moment( big responsibility if ferry
              pax, their life at your stake).</p>
              <p>So as you start driving, rest if you must when your body tell
              you, it for long term if you wish to continue driving </p>

              <p>Unless your day job is a very relax.. stress free type , highly discourage you from driving cab at night , anyway once you try driving you will know taxi driving is not easy , you have to use alot of brain power thinking how to drive to certain locaiton and find pax … also physically taxing of sitting inside a car for 5 hours, it will take a toll of you … I cant even walk straight after getting out of the seat .. go and try and you will know .. you have to skip toilet break , meal at times which is bad for health</p>
              <p>But I do have a good ex-colleague making $70 to $100 every night as he knock off at 3 pm and drive from 5 pm to 12 am , he lives in Jurong and hirer his neighbour ,there are alot of on call job at factory area , I have no doubt he is indeed acheiving the earning</p>

              <p>As I said before, in this world, you see me good, i see you good, but actually we are all struggling to make a living out of each other, we need pax, pax also may need us to buy tab, iphone or whatever job pax is working in, he or she may be a hawker selling fish soup that need people like us to patronise, we are actually very much connected to each other, depend on you needs and your ability, I alway believe one should spend wisely and within one ability. Life is not long, if you keep chasing your needs to pay your credits or debts, then, you are nothing but a 24hr ATM for others to draw out your money. Savour the moment of time you have with family, resting, brisk walking in the park with nature, enjoy what you want as a hobby, be it fly kite or cooking or games, life will be more enjoyable than keep working. You are born to enjoy what this world can give you and vice versa, not born to just work and work.</p>
              <p>Learn to budget your spending, set achieveable objectives, and plan well to achieve it, if you think 40k loan to renovate your house is putting a burden on you that you need to drive Taxis, why not lower it to 20k, i guess your family will understand you, share the burden among them, or you can do the important renovation first, then later when times are good, renovate in a more refine term.</p>
              <p>No offences, but it happen to some of my buddies, spend so much on renovation, but everyday never go back to enjoy, just drive like a mad dog, he told me, cannot lose face to relatives and friends, house must be nice nice, but then when relative visited his house, wife said he go drive taxi, relatives also laugh at him.</p>
