              <p>I have been a long time lurker of this particular forum (sgforums NOT the taxi forum) cause i enjoy reading most of the sometimes entertaining, informative and humorous posts. I specially patronize the posts on the home page. Normally, as any lurker would do, I will mostly remain silent on topics and have a very little post count. However, I have to say that THIS particular sub-forum has COMPLETELY changed my view point of a certain group of ppl. I have always had a good impression of taxi drivers as cheerful, helpful and mostly kind group of ppl. But this forum has shown me the true vengeful, envious and petty side of this group.</p>
              <p>Its posts like <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/3426/topics/403224">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/3426/topics/403224</a> that has pushed me over the line. You guys think you guys are some kinda special group of people that are above the law? Hello my friend, NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW. Dont expect just because you guys are 'TDs' that you deserve any kind of special treatment just cause it deals with your livelihood. Everyone everyday is struggling to make a living not only you guys. And if everyone cried out that SOME laws should not be applicable to them, you know what would happen? CHAOS. Once again, no one is above the law and please dont play the sympathy card ok? You guys are in much better position then ALOT of ppl I have encountered in my life but in this forum you guys cry like the world owes you a living.</p>
              <p>Oh another note, I have read like 86712639 posts crying over 'cheapo pax' do this do that to avoid paying whatever extra surcharge there is and that these people should just 'stick to taking MRT and bus'. May I remind you people that at the end of the day, you guys are in the SERVICE line and if there is 1 thing you should know about the service industry is that CUSTOMER IS KING. Without us paying pax, you guys have no livelihood. Also, talk about hypocrisy, you guys complain so much when customers use 'tactic' to avoid paying extra yet you guys are SHAMELESS in discussing 'tactics' how to earn these extra surcharges. I have personally been a victim of these shameless tactics like a million times and I am sure every paying customer will be able to relate. 4:40pm in CBD international plaza, looong que (nearly 20 ppl infront of me) in the taxi stand. TWENTY mins go by no cab. At exactly 4:59pm (accoding to my clock) The first of EIGHT taxi joined the taxi que. I was in a cab by 5:08pm.</p>
              <p>Last issue, you guys CONSTANTLY complain about no shows of taxi callers."Wah this pax la call taxi then find another taxi then last min cancel la" or "never even bother to call in to cancel la" blah blah blah blah. Hello, if I call a taxi and while waiting for you if I am able to get another taxi, I shouldnt board it is it? You think money is the only issue is it? No need care about time ar? Ridiculous to think just cause we called a taxi that we should purposely give up a FASTER and CHEAPER alternative. Worse still all you guys always complaining about a no-show by customer. But you think all taxi drivers out there are angels themselves is it? Never the perpetrator but always the victim? Let me tell you, early in the morning, late for work. Bo pian call for taxi from comfort/city cab. Got confirmation and taxi number liao. Said 7-9 mins. Five mins later I go down wait for cab. However another 10 mins pass by cab never come. No choice call back the call center with taxi number. The call center put me on hold while he try to call the taxi. You know what the TD do? NO ANSWER. Don wan pick up the call center guy's call. Call center guy immediately gimme another taxi number and 5 mins later the new taxi came. So, this is not a one way thing ok? There are as many errant and screwed up TDs as there are customers. And you guys come here to a public forum to express your opinions. Which actually is fine if you think about it. A channel to vent frustration. However, its topic like the one mentioned above which makes my blood boil. HELLO WAKE UP, end of the day do something wrong, don't blame others for pointing it out. And to curse such things upon the poor guy truly shows your true character. May I never have the luck of riding in your taxi. Thanks for the time to read this for those of you who did. I plead to you guys wishing to comment to keep it mature and logical. Please dont resort to petty name calling and mud-slinging. If you TDs are all supposed to be over the age of 30, then act like it instead of 13.</p>

              <p>wah...u really full of shit in your big tummy le..why no place to let u shit so gotto do it here..???</p>
              <p>Ya la we may be service line SO...??? U think u got money can buy my pride..??</p>
              <p>SHAMELESS tactice - U seen like u know alot about the before 5pm CBD surcharge issues,  u know and u still waste your time waitting there then your brain grow only grass.. MRT station just a few step away from inter plaza nie right...???</p>
              <p>On Call - Still remember last week at ORQ this pax i can tell u he's the most steady pax i ever met. I took a call from ORQ but before i turn into the lobby mdt show call cancel so i turn 1 round and Q again. After Q'ing 10min i reach the 2nd spot of taxi Q in the lobby this pax board my cab and ask aiyo why u so long then come i waited for u for 15min liao...I was so surprise he's the one who call my cab and i donno why mdt show cancel message when he did not cancel the call. I can tell u i will never never get another pax like him for another 100 years. CHEAPO like u will call a cab when u are in Q behine 10 pax in taxi stand, if all pax are like him i can tell u u will never never get a no show on cab. I recommend 1 even cheaper way, even cheaper then Q'ing for taxi for 20-30min. Just walk 5 min to MRT station spend less then flag down rate for taxi less then $3 wait another 5min ding dong MRT here liao..</p>
              <p>End of the post u just show another ugly side of singaporean 'hoi, lin bei paying u so u better treat lin bei like a king, without lin bei money your family will starve to death' next time when u eat at Mcdonalds go ask them to clean your big ass after u shit in their toilet, y..?? U got money paying them mah...</p>

              <p>Talk about "keep comment mature and logical", go be a TD for a week then come back and tell us should we treat CERTAIN passenger as KING.</p>
              <p>Imagine this scenario, when a person standing next to you accidentally step onto you. He apologise and you accepted. Another moment he repeat that again and you also accepted. Then the 3rd, 4th .... n number of times repeated. Do you accept the apology?</p>
              <p>It is in the course of work of a TD that these unplesant incidents happened again and again that worn our patience.</p>
              <p>I would say most new cabby started the trade fresh from the taxi course wanted to serve with a heart. It's the ugly passenegers that spoilt the scene.</p>
              <p>In the end TD just treat the fare as a transaction. You pay $, TD drive you from point A to B. That's it, nothing more nothing less.</p>
              <p>You want SERVICE, go see your MP.</p>

              Hey TS, first point to your post, 1) what TCL did is highlighting to us TD, that a "sob" want to get us, TD, down because he was hit by summon.   question to him, do traffic summon public bus.
              
              2)  "cheapo pax"....agree with you customer is King but the customer has to be reasonable.
              you complained 4.40pm there are no taxis,changing shift?, what about 7.45pm-8pm?   long q of taxis at taxi stand.  we will see pax around 7.59pm.
              
              3) no-show.   last night at Harding rd (white Rabbit), had a call.  saw a angmo boarded a taxi infront of me.   immediately, a ping came. job had been cancelled. pls do not proceed.
              Later, had a call from arcadia rd for 3 taxis,  reach arcadia ,  same ping, job cancelled. reason. many taxis ferry pax home, that is why they cancelled taxis when they have it in sight.
              what is the explanation for this? it is a circle.   supply &amp; demand.
              
              for the same scenario, had a call from Mustafa, around 10pm.  this time round it is other way round. many pax not enough taxis.   alot of  pax  knock on my window to grab my attention, i ignored them not because I m stuckup but the paxs are on my way to board my cab.  pax was so happy when they got the cab that they book.   do they express this in forum?
              
              to each its own. .....your view are not wrong......neither is our view..

              <p>I have been a long time lurker of this particular forum
              (sgforums NOT the taxi forum) cause i enjoy reading most of the
              sometimes entertaining, informative and humorous posts. I specially
              patronize the posts on the home page. Normally, as any lurker would
              do, I will mostly remain silent on topics and have a very little
              post count. However, I have to say that THIS particular sub-forum
              has COMPLETELY changed my view point of a certain group of ppl. I
              have always had a good impression of taxi drivers as cheerful,
              helpful and mostly kind group of ppl. But this forum has shown me
              the true vengeful, envious and petty side of this group.</p>
              <p>Its posts like <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/3426/topics/403224">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/3426/topics/403224</a> that
              has pushed me over the line. You guys think you guys are some kinda
              special group of people that are above the law? Hello my friend, NO
              ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW. Dont expect just because you guys are 'TDs'
              that you deserve any kind of special treatment just cause it deals
              with your livelihood. Everyone everyday is struggling to make a
              living not only you guys. And if everyone cried out that SOME laws
              should not be applicable to them, you know what would happen?
              CHAOS. Once again, no one is above the law and please dont play the
              sympathy card ok? You guys are in much better position then ALOT of
              ppl I have encountered in my life but in this forum you guys cry
              like the world owes you a living.</p>
              <p>Oh another note, I have read like 86712639 posts crying over
              'cheapo pax' do this do that to avoid paying whatever extra
              surcharge there is and that these people should just 'stick to
              taking MRT and bus'. May I remind you people that at the end of the
              day, you guys are in the SERVICE line and if there is 1 thing you
              should know about the service industry is that CUSTOMER IS KING.
              Without us paying pax, you guys have no livelihood. Also, talk
              about hypocrisy, you guys complain so much when customers use
              'tactic' to avoid paying extra yet you guys are SHAMELESS in
              discussing 'tactics' how to earn these extra surcharges. I have
              personally been a victim of these shameless tactics like a million
              times and I am sure every paying customer will be able to relate.
              4:40pm in CBD international plaza, looong que (nearly 20 ppl
              infront of me) in the taxi stand. TWENTY mins go by no cab. At
              exactly 4:59pm (accoding to my clock) The first of EIGHT taxi
              joined the taxi que. I was in a cab by 5:08pm.</p>
              <p>Last issue, you guys CONSTANTLY complain about no shows of taxi
              callers."Wah this pax la call taxi then find another taxi then last
              min cancel la" or "never even bother to call in to cancel la" blah
              blah blah blah. Hello, if I call a taxi and while waiting for you
              if I am able to get another taxi, I shouldnt board it is it? You
              think money is the only issue is it? No need care about time ar?
              Ridiculous to think just cause we called a taxi that we should
              purposely give up a FASTER and CHEAPER alternative. Worse still all
              you guys always complaining about a no-show by customer. But you
              think all taxi drivers out there are angels themselves is it? Never
              the perpetrator but always the victim? Let me tell you, early in
              the morning, late for work. Bo pian call for taxi from comfort/city
              cab. Got confirmation and taxi number liao. Said 7-9 mins. Five
              mins later I go down wait for cab. However another 10 mins pass by
              cab never come. No choice call back the call center with taxi
              number. The call center put me on hold while he try to call the
              taxi. You know what the TD do? NO ANSWER. Don wan pick up the call
              center guy's call. Call center guy immediately gimme another taxi
              number and 5 mins later the new taxi came. So, this is not a one
              way thing ok? There are as many errant and screwed up TDs as there
              are customers. And you guys come here to a public forum to express
              your opinions. Which actually is fine if you think about it. A
              channel to vent frustration. However, its topic like the one
              mentioned above which makes my blood boil. HELLO WAKE UP, end of
              the day do something wrong, don't blame others for pointing it out.
              And to curse such things upon the poor guy truly shows your true
              character. May I never have the luck of riding in your taxi. Thanks
              for the time to read this for those of you who did. I plead to you
              guys wishing to comment to keep it mature and logical. Please dont
              resort to petty name calling and mud-slinging. If you TDs are all
              supposed to be over the age of 30, then act like it instead of
              13.</p>

              very very matured and relevant. Lol and dont worry I will never
              return here as a taxi driver. Fortunately for me I paid attention
              in class and worked hard to make sure that is never the case for
              me. Thanks for your concern though.</p>

              I know exactly what you are doing there taxi man. You berrate that
              guy 'wishing all the bad luck onto him' blah blah blah because he
              asked a legitimate question. Why is it that taxi drivers get a
              special pass. How is that fair in the name of the LAW. Does the law
              exclude you Taxi drivers from being fined if you break it? I
              believe it is your reading comprehension that is totally off. I
              think I am being as clear and concise as I possibly can.</p>
              <p>And like I said already I cannot believe this is a forum for
              matured adults. First page already and there are atleast two
              instances of my nickname being ridiculed. Lol that is seriously
              very very matured and relevant. Lol and dont worry I will never
              return here as a taxi driver. Fortunately for me I paid attention
              in class and worked hard to make sure that is never the case for
              me. Thanks for your concern though.</p>

              <p>P.S -  Most of you here are discussing my 2nd and 3rd
              point. Which was not even the main point. As i said, I have never
              mentioned those before even though i saw so many many posts
              ridiculing the passenger. This is a forum and there always be QQing
              and frustration venting. Which was what I was doing as well. So why
              can u guys share your views but not me? Maybe I should repost this
              somewhere else and see what the nuetral public has to say? It was
              the FIRST point, the post by this dear forummer Tio Call Liao that
              infuriated me. What is your defense for that taxi drivers? Is he
              right to wish evil upon someone's head where all he has done is
              point out a double standard set by the authorities?</p>
