              <p>ok last one for the road. I tried to edit my post to make it less insulting but unable to do it. lets keep it as that.</p>
              <p>The poster is using Taxi drivers as his case and the best part is he is openly challenging the authorities. Will the traffic police be happy that their email replies are being posted and discussed openly in a public forum?</p>
              <p>This is a government agency letter , supposedly meant only for the receipient's eyes. And if he wants to go this way of getting his case heard, there will be some quarters that will be unhappy just like you , deathpit , is unhappy with me.</p>
              <p>u wanna repost? sure.... either the whole nation will be enraged by a knn small fry TD or they will just laugh at u... chey taxi driver scold insults u first time hear ah??? chey! post lan la!</p>

              <p>A mistake to think this way. Until the day that you surrender your NIRIC back to the government and meet your maker, you can't definitely say you won't return her as a cabby,</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I have been a long time lurker of this particular forum (sgforums NOT the taxi forum) cause i enjoy reading most of the sometimes entertaining, informative and humorous posts. I specially patronize the posts on the home page. Normally, as any lurker would do, I will mostly remain silent on topics and have a very little post count. However, I have to say that THIS particular sub-forum has COMPLETELY changed my view point of a certain group of ppl. I have always had a good impression of taxi drivers as cheerful, helpful and mostly kind group of ppl. But this forum has shown me the true vengeful, envious and petty side of this group.</p>
              <p>Its posts like <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/3426/topics/403224">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/3426/topics/403224</a> that has pushed me over the line. You guys think you guys are some kinda special group of people that are above the law? Hello my friend, NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW. Dont expect just because you guys are 'TDs' that you deserve any kind of special treatment just cause it deals with your livelihood. Everyone everyday is struggling to make a living not only you guys. And if everyone cried out that SOME laws should not be applicable to them, you know what would happen? CHAOS. Once again, no one is above the law and please dont play the sympathy card ok? You guys are in much better position then ALOT of ppl I have encountered in my life but in this forum you guys cry like the world owes you a living.</p>
              <p>Oh another note, I have read like 86712639 posts crying over 'cheapo pax' do this do that to avoid paying whatever extra surcharge there is and that these people should just 'stick to taking MRT and bus'. May I remind you people that at the end of the day, you guys are in the SERVICE line and if there is 1 thing you should know about the service industry is that CUSTOMER IS KING. Without us paying pax, you guys have no livelihood. Also, talk about hypocrisy, you guys complain so much when customers use 'tactic' to avoid paying extra yet you guys are SHAMELESS in discussing 'tactics' how to earn these extra surcharges. I have personally been a victim of these shameless tactics like a million times and I am sure every paying customer will be able to relate. 4:40pm in CBD international plaza, looong que (nearly 20 ppl infront of me) in the taxi stand. TWENTY mins go by no cab. At exactly 4:59pm (accoding to my clock) The first of EIGHT taxi joined the taxi que. I was in a cab by 5:08pm.</p>
              <p>Last issue, you guys CONSTANTLY complain about no shows of taxi callers."Wah this pax la call taxi then find another taxi then last min cancel la" or "never even bother to call in to cancel la" blah blah blah blah. Hello, if I call a taxi and while waiting for you if I am able to get another taxi, I shouldnt board it is it? You think money is the only issue is it? No need care about time ar? Ridiculous to think just cause we called a taxi that we should purposely give up a FASTER and CHEAPER alternative. Worse still all you guys always complaining about a no-show by customer. But you think all taxi drivers out there are angels themselves is it? Never the perpetrator but always the victim? Let me tell you, early in the morning, late for work. Bo pian call for taxi from comfort/city cab. Got confirmation and taxi number liao. Said 7-9 mins. Five mins later I go down wait for cab. However another 10 mins pass by cab never come. No choice call back the call center with taxi number. The call center put me on hold while he try to call the taxi. You know what the TD do? NO ANSWER. Don wan pick up the call center guy's call. Call center guy immediately gimme another taxi number and 5 mins later the new taxi came. So, this is not a one way thing ok? There are as many errant and screwed up TDs as there are customers. And you guys come here to a public forum to express your opinions. Which actually is fine if you think about it. A channel to vent frustration. However, its topic like the one mentioned above which makes my blood boil. HELLO WAKE UP, end of the day do something wrong, don't blame others for pointing it out. And to curse such things upon the poor guy truly shows your true character. May I never have the luck of riding in your taxi. Thanks for the time to read this for those of you who did. I plead to you guys wishing to comment to keep it mature and logical. Please dont resort to petty name calling and mud-slinging. If you TDs are all supposed to be over the age of 30, then act like it instead of 13.</p>

              <p>Hi, Please kindly get your ass out of here. Dun talk much, come and be a taxi driver for a month than you tell us your view again. Yah, you are right, we are in service line. But not Charity line.We pay Taxi rental rain or shine and of course we are TD will need to learn the FASTER and MORE EFFECTIVE way to cover our cost and buy rice home. This is business.Just like you, FASTER and CHEAPER way to get a cab is to bloody play taxi driver out. For all you know, when you book a cab, TD will be risking summon and life speeding down to fetch people like you. And these assholes only know cheaper and faster way.The faster way is go and buy a car yourself and dun let us earn your money.then you pay for the bloody installment and maintanence.For all you know, all TD here are paying 3k-3.5k rental per month exclude fuel which is needed to fetch your ass to your destination.As well as traffic offence to speed  down for call and get play out by asshole.Also summon when asshole want to alight at red bus lane and traffic light.PLS F*** off from here.</p>

              <p>I am not a TD, I am just a commuter and I am deeply disgusted at what a so call 'educated man ' like this stupid asshole 'death pit ' posted here. this is the kind of 'human beings' who think that they are the biggest asshole just because they pay and expect all kinds of service duly granted. I suppose these are also the kind of people who will leave their age parent to fend for themselves because its usually these 'highly educated ' people who see only money and nothing else in their shit -filled eyes. Yes, taxis are public transport like you say, so since buses have bus lane so why didn't you question how come taxi got no taxi lane?And what about GST ? They are offering their services to you ,so should you be paying GST alos?  It is always the passengers who request TD to drive faster and may I enquire  who is going to pay the fine if they are caught? The passenger? who merely pay their fare and wipe backside after that. This is a taxi forum for TD to let out their stress, ask for advise etc What in the fxxxxking shit-filled brain are you carrying in your useless big fat highblood pressure body to say so many blue bird talk.  You should be the ONE TO WAKE UP  cos you are a self-center and selfish asshole. If we want to be immature, illogical, petty name calling, mud- sling and like to act or  talk like 13 12/11/10 years old- SO WHAT!!  You are not in any position to critize us. Pull out the log in your shitfilled eyes before you comment on the thorn in other's eyes.</p>
              <p>(still had alot to comment but my hubby stop me) Death pit is where is you should stay and remain-----forever.</p>

              <p>Hi Death</p>
              <p>I really hope you are above 40s' or close to retirement.</p>
              <p>Taxi driving is an honest way of making a living. They drive for many rounds and hours, no MC or CPF, no leave or bonuses, unlike many of us. Work stop is equivalent to no income.</p>
              <p>True, there are some taxi uncles who hide, but as a passenger, don't we hide as well, trying to avoid the rush hour surcharges? It's still business. Supply and demand. Don't tell me your bosses or yourself had never exploited any weakness in the flow of business? If you are in their shoes, what do you think you will do? Never be a pot, calling the kettle black, as it will come back at you.</p>
              <p>Last, perhaps you can try to be a TD for a week and you might understand how they feel. We board the cab and face the driver only for 1 trip, but they need many passengers for their living. Imagine the number of ugly Singaporeans. Don't tell me they don't exist in our "gracious" and campaign savvy society, where courtesy needs to be campaigned. </p>
              <p>And to the TDs here, I wish you all well. Drive safe and don't fall sick.</p>
