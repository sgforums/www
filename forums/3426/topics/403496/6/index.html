              <p>people has no right to claim that pax is king... fair enough... but what gives you the right to "phui" call him scum and hurl expletives when he say something which from your TD's perspective is irrelevant or non-factual?</p>
              <p>rather than disproving him politely or giving a firm rebuttal... you guys chose to mudsling, call names curse his death... all very personal comments against someone with no personal intentions.... now who is worse...</p>
              <p>With all these responses, it further strenthen the points made by death pits without him even having to reply as pointed out by the bear.... this is really a classic case of ä¸�æ”»è‡ªç ´...</p>
              <p>And to riskman's reply to the bear... dun you think that your reply is akin to shooting yourself?</p>
              <p>your first paragraph accuses the bear of not knowing the full story and being presumptious... and then the last line you ask the bear not to tell you that customer is king.. arent you being presumptious yourself? which part of the bear's reply did he say that he thinks that customer is king...</p>
              <p>after seeing this and this forum, my impression of taxi drivers has gone south... but then again.. i wouldnt be too quick to judge like some TDs here or as the chinese say 1 bamboo knock whole boat of people.... I still believe that there are good TDs around...</p>

              <p>n0x, my mate... I think your "england" too powerful until you misunderstood what i wrote.</p>
              <p>This is what i wrote "Have you ever be a cabby before? Do you know the full story on this argument? If not, why don't you sit one corner, pick up your books and go study."<br>What does the sentence means? I'm asking our dear "the Bear" questions. Which part of the sentence or word makes you think i'm presumptious? Btw, got this word "presumptious" meh? Delicious i know. Hahaha... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> I check dictionary hor, only got these 2 words leh. presumptuous or presumptions. Maybe my dictionary too old liao, must throw away. hahaha.. Your "England" so powderful until i need to check dictionary.</p>
              <p>Second part i wrote...Oh ya, Please don't come telling me customer is king. Like that also call "presumptious". Ok mate, let you win ok? This Monday morning, i ask ALN's spain pass you the world cup trophy ok? Happy bo?</p>
              <p>My mate n0x, let me tell you this, we are talking/discussion/argument etc.. about this topic. If you want to attack people for word for word, sentence to sentence. Why don't you drop me an email and argue all you want instead of you posting here wasting the bandwidth or even worse still, embarrass yourselves.</p>
              <p>n0x, singaporean like to use this sentence, smart can already, don't be too smart. The way you wrote is like Jalan Kayu selling Roti prata. One moment said my impression of taxi drivers has gone south, another moment i wouldnt be too quick to judge like some TDs here or as the chinese say 1 bamboo knock whole boat of people. What nonsense you talking about? One moment want to attack people, another moment want to put people to heaven.</p>
              <p>Lastly, i would like to add, this is my personal feeling, not representing all the TDs bro here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"> </p>
              <p>After seeing this and this forum, my impression of scholars mindset has gone south... but then again.. i wouldnt be too quick to judge like some smart alec here or as the chinese say 1 bamboo knock whole boat of people.... I still believe that there are good scholars around to lead Singapore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>To be fair, in every industry, there are good and bad peoples, not only TDs, TDs are like traders plying our trade, we depend on customers and customers also depend on us, it takes two hands to clap. I would not argue that customers are king, but rather they are just customer within the same eye level as we, the TDs. We are the service provider, like any other industries service provider, example,  M1, singtel, starhub or Macdonald, kopitiam etc etc, each have it own unique way of treating it customer in it own missions and objectives. Every taxi cos have their own missions and objectives toward satisfying customer and generating profits, but I have never come across a policy statement that said, Customers are Kings.</p></div>

              <p>This is what i wrote "Have you ever be a cabby before? Do you know the full story on this argument? If not, why don't you sit one corner, pick up your books and go study."<br>What does the sentence means? I'm asking our dear "the Bear" questions. Which part of the sentence or word makes you think i'm presumptious? Btw, got this word "presumptious" meh? Delicious i know. Hahaha... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> I check dictionary hor, only got these 2 words leh. presumptuous or presumptions. Maybe my dictionary too old liao, must throw away. hahaha.. Your "England" so powderful until i need to check dictionary.</p>
              <p>Second part i wrote...Oh ya, Please don't come telling me customer is king. Like that also call "presumptious". Ok mate, let you win ok? This Monday morning, i ask ALN's spain pass you the world cup trophy ok? Happy bo?</p>
              <p>My mate n0x, let me tell you this, we are talking/discussion/argument etc.. about this topic. If you want to attack people for word for word, sentence to sentence. Why don't you drop me an email and argue all you want instead of you posting here wasting the bandwidth or even worse still, embarrass yourselves.</p>
              <p>n0x, singaporean like to use this sentence, smart can already, don't be too smart. The way you wrote is like Jalan Kayu selling Roti prata. One moment said my impression of taxi drivers has gone south, another moment i wouldnt be too quick to judge like some TDs here or as the chinese say 1 bamboo knock whole boat of people. What nonsense you talking about? One moment want to attack people, another moment want to put people to heaven.</p>
              <p>Lastly, i would like to add, this is my personal feeling, not representing all the TDs bro here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"> </p>
              <p>After seeing this and this forum, my impression of scholars mindset has gone south... but then again.. i wouldnt be too quick to judge like some smart alec here or as the chinese say 1 bamboo knock whole boat of people.... I still believe that there are good scholars around to lead Singapore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

              <p>may i ask what are u suggesting with this line? that nobody can come in and disagree with you TDs? Because this is taxi driver's forum?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">This is what i wrote "Have you ever be a cabby before? Do you know the full story on this argument?

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">What makes it presumptious is that when u asked the question... you only merely consider 1 side of the story and then based ur arguments on that 1 side of the story... what if the bear has been a cabby before and what if he knows the full story..then arent you shooting yourself? \</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">again, you attacked my single typo error and then u come and accuse me of attacking you sentence for sentence word for word... and how am i embarassing myself? can you please elaborate?</span></p>

              <p>please refer to above posting</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Full of crap !!!</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Care to explain why my posting is full of crap? After going 1 big round.. instead of addressing my concerns.. you again started mud slinging and name callings and using strong phrases like the above.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">And yet you accused me of making personal attacks... i dunno what your defination of personal attack is but i consider this the first salvo....</span></p>
              <p>so let me ask you again.... extracted from my previous posting... my main concern...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">"people has no right to claim that pax is king... fair enough... but what gives you the right to "phui" call him scum and hurl expletives when he say something which from your TD's perspective is irrelevant or non-factual?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">rather than disproving him politely or giving a firm rebuttal... you guys chose to mudsling, call names curse his death... all very personal comments against someone with no personal intentions.... now who is worse..." </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">why are TDs in this forum so full of angst? even when i politely give my view points i can elicit such strong remarks from someone like you? </span></p>
              <p>death pit is a boy and his words are not chosen with tact.. yet the way TDs in this forum responded as if he owed each and everyone of you some money? Someone who has no personal intentions and yet the TDs banded together and under the cover of each other started hurling abuses at him.. and some of you are almost twice his age. Twice as old yet so immature and irrational</p>

              <p>Continuing from my previous post to Insg.... I shall post the questions that after 6 pages in this forum, there is still no answers from the TDs yet.</p>
              <p>For some particular reason, you chose to swtich back to english. Hence, being the easy-going guy that i am, i shall follow suit.</p>
              <p>What you mentioned in the above post, is to pin-point deathpit's lack of tact. Yes, i wouldnt disagree that deathpit is wrong in saying all these.</p>
              <p>But like what i would say and as explained in my chinese post above, there cannot be smoke without fire or the chinese saying "there cannot be waves without wind" There has to be some reason which triggered deathpit's response in this post.</p>
              <p>Your argument is extremely biased and considered only 1 side of the story. In doing this, you draw the conclusion that what you TDs did in this forum is justified and proceed to conclude that everything is closed.</p>
              <p>No sir. This thing aint close, not by a long shot. I believe deathpit did post a question and i did post my own question. NOBODY in this forum can answer these question. Unless there is are satisfactory answers to these, i guess you guys are just as guilty as deathpit.</p>
              <p>The first question by deathpit is:</p>
              <p>"Its posts like <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/3426/topics/403224">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/3426/topics/403224</a> that has pushed me over the line. You guys think you guys are some kinda special group of people that are above the law?"</p>
              <p>The second question by me and i have posted it to riskman</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">"people has no right to claim that pax is king... fair enough... but what gives you the right to "phui" call him scum and hurl expletives when he say something which from your TD's perspective is irrelevant or non-factual?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">rather than disproving him politely or giving a firm rebuttal... you guys chose to mudsling, call names curse his death... all very personal comments against someone with no personal intentions.... now who is worse..." </span></p>
              <p>So yeah, try to disprove me and I will give it to you guys. Or can i expect another round of mud slinging and names calling from you as well?</p>

              <p><br>you guys had fun cursing deathpit's early death, calling him scum of society and after countless "phui" you want to let it go so easily?</p>
              <p>When you all said it, you all had much fun aint it. Like a gang fighting a guy. One person punch him and then someone else next and then someone held him down while the rest rained blows on him.</p>
              <p>And then after which some people came to help, and you all dismissed these people as the bad guys and you guys are the angels and wanna just "end it all" conveniently.</p>
              <p>I mean if you all cant provide decent answers and wanna 'escape' is perfectly alright. Thing is people has already lost a decent amount of respect for you guys. With the way you all answered and behave in this forum.</p>

I think that U r the best one to give comments on tis "customer is king" thread, bcoz ur service line is more tough than TD service, but quite similar. most importantly U r not TD. of cause U r very professional, if not U will get Sue. I like TD job, finished work go back home snore loudly. bcoz I very contented person. heheee...............................</p>

              <p>Since you want an answer, i will give you one. Even with some reply here, you get offensive though. Let alone TD who got play out by pax like deathpit.Normally people call for cab during peak hour where there is a lot of traffic and pedestrians. And when we bid for job, we have 5-10min to reach the destination which is within 5km radius. Its radius, not kilometre. Hence can you imagine how we need to drive to reach destination on time to peak up pax in order to exercise punctuality in customer service which commuters like you are expecting from us?And what are the risk we are expose to?Then people like deathpit cause us to take risk for nothing because we see no pax when we reach pick up point.Don't we have the right to become more offensive than you when you only sit in front of the computer and reply message while we are risking life and death to reach pick up point for no show pax like deathpit?No point to debate so much in forum,you may want to get a TD licence and try driving for one month and you understand all the agony and hatre for pax like deathpit.</p>
