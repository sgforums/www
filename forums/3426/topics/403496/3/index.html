              <p>as for the b4 &amp; after peak hr issue where cabbies &amp; pax play hide &amp; seek,</p>
              <p>we can only blame the system being structured in this way</p>

              <p>Play the "Mr Nice Cabby"?</p>
              <p>i think most cabbies here driving more than 3mths will agree with me that it is not worth the efforts.</p>
              <p>most locals will not appreciate at all</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When was the last time u said "Thank you" to a cabby for risking getting summons and driving fast just bcos you are late?</p>
              <p>When was the last time u said "Thank you" because the cabby help you carry your heavy load?</p>

              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>No issues at all from me. I had my fair share of nice TDs, those who step on it n chiong when I am in a hurry, and also some nasty ones who makes my blood boil.</p>
              <p>I just feel that live and let live. Remember the good ones at heart and forget those who made life shitty or nasty. Who knows, maybe I will be the next degree holding (akan datang) taxi driver in the near future after that PHD guy?</p>

              <p>Lol clearly no one understands English here. With the amount of vulgarities being thrown around it's no wonder people who DO understand english is scarce around here. All you people are reading is the 2nd and 3rd point which I brought up BECAUSE similiar points were made about paxes. You guys shared your stories about ugly paxxes and I shared my stories about ugly TDs. All my point about the SECOND and THIRD point was that there are equally ugly TDs out there too.</p>
              <p>NO ONE dares to respond as to why TIO CALL LIAO has the right to curse 10 generations of the family of someone who merely pointed out double standards set against him. Please do bother to read the full thread before jumping in blindly having no clue what is being discussed at hand. Obviously I am refering to you Devil Angel 036. Perhaps you wanna try cutting out all the vulgarities and maybe you will be able to grasp what is being discussed here and not make a fool out of yourself. I have no clue as to what you are blabbering about GST, blue bird nonsense, completely irrelevant stuff. I would love to stoop down to your level and equally blast the stuffing out of you through the annonymity of the internet. However, you are just not worth my time and energy to do so.</p>
              <p>Anyway 3 pages full of name calling, shit-slinging nonsense yet no one can tell me why TIO CALL LIAO thinks TDs are ABOVE THE LAW and you people agree with him. Bashing him for pointing out something which was clearly not fair to him AND other road users.</p>

              <p>Please , open ur eyes. U accuse our seniors that they don't understand English. Then , may i ask u , how come , they still can reply u? Please , everyone have brains. Dun sit on it , instead , use it.</p>
              <p>And , did u know that being a taxi driver is stressful enough? From car rental fees to oil cost. From rude passengers to road fines. Whats wrong with using vulgarities anyway? And , if u dun like it , just Get The Fuck Off. Simple as that. Why come trolling here? Do u think we like u here? Please , just mind ur own business. I dun care if ur educated or w/e.</p>
              <p>Sometimes , I wonder. Do u respect LAW that much? Do u have the cheek to tell me that u did not commit an offense before? Human is never perfect. And , why can't Taxi Drivers accuse? Coz they are not so educated?</p>

Congratulations on finding the capslock button and welcome to the thing we call the internet. How are you finding your new keyboard? I believe you are an old bird. Right pops? Now you see its not so fun when you bring personal attacks into a thread now isnt it? You should know what i mean. Also, this forum is also open to PUBLIC. I too have the right to post here my opinions about TDs just as much as you do about your days. =] So carry on getting to know more about the internet and this magical device called the computer instead of wasting more of your precious time you have left. After all I am a 'young man' and I certainly have more time left to squander away right? =]</p>
