              <p><br>Yes, if workers or student are late for work and school,  missed their transport, but only got a few dollars to spare, I do not mind doing something good for them, it makes me happy the whole day. But like some of our bros here said, go casinos, pubs, niteclubs drink etc etc and then said no money, that is too much. </p>

              <p>That time I was out and only had $15 with no atm nearby, but my stupid house has no nightrider. So no choice, had to flag a cab and ask if $15 was enough reach my house. Uncle said should be ok but in the end the fare had reached 15+ in the vincinity of my house.</p>
              <p>I told the uncle to drop me at ATM to take money. I would leave my IC behind and he could keep meter running. But the uncle keep saying nevermind while I keep saying drive to nearby atm (I show him where). In the end the kind uncle just drove me home and took the $15. The fare was 17+ I think.</p>

              <p>I was one of those that had asked taxi driver if $15 enough to go back my house before. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"></p>
              <p>That time I was out and only had $15 with no atm nearby, but my stupid house has no nightrider. So no choice, had to flag a cab and ask if $15 was enough reach my house. Uncle said should be ok but in the end the fare had reached 15+ in the vincinity of my house.</p>
              <p>I told the uncle to drop me at ATM to take money. I would leave my IC behind and he could keep meter running. But the uncle keep saying nevermind while I keep saying drive to nearby atm (I show him where). In the end the kind uncle just drove me home and took the $15. The fare was 17+ I think.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">No need to feel shy. Just glad you are appreciative of the good taxiuncle. I have done that before taking a pax from Clarke Quay to Choa Chu Kang home accepting less.  Sometimes difficult to tell genuine from the cheapo but a number of taxiuncles are compassionate people too.  Hope more people have the same good impression about taxiuncles.</span></p>
