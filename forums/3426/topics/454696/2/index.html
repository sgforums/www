              <p>Eh minus all the tekan, actually you have got your answers here. The correct thing is when realise, stop the meter. Charge lesser nevermind. Consider pay learning fees. You go wrong cannot expect pax to be responsible. I am not good with route also but I try to handle the pax in a way no win no lose and no problem. But sometimes for $5 dunno drive for what... but that's a seperate matter.</p>

              <p>I proceeded then while driving towards aljunied, her hp rang and she was talking on her hp to some guy, those mushy talk, I start to panic as I reach aljunied and duno which way she want to take. I asked her and even gestured to her but she was so busy talking that she ignored me. So Bo pian, I look at road signs to help me. Think I used upper serangoon till I hit yck road. Then turn right as finally I see hougang ave 8 on the road sign . Finally she then put down her phone and she commented that this is the first time she used such a route home. I said, there we are, next turn would be ave 8. </p>
              <p>Upon reaching her flat, total fare is $16.06</p>
              <p>I told her fare is $16. Then she told me, she can only pay me $15. I asked why? She said this is the most expensive ride she ever taken and usually max is $12-13+ only. As I was about to ask her if it's midnight or not, she left the money on the armrest then slam the door...</p>

              <p>I kanna once just a few nights ago.</p>
              <p>One PRC woman in her thirties flagged me near lor 20 geylang
              after midnight. Say wanna go hougang ave 8. I initially wanted to
              go straight take PIE then CTE exit AMK ave 3 but she insist I turn
              into lorong 17 and go by aljunied road. She say she everyday take
              this route but I explain to her that I'm a newbie so if take her
              route, she needs she guide me and she say ok.</p>
              <p>I proceeded then while driving towards aljunied, her hp rang and
              she was talking on her hp to some guy, those mushy talk, I start to
              panic as I reach aljunied and duno which way she want to take. I
              asked her and even gestured to her but she was so busy talking that
              she ignored me. So Bo pian, I look at road signs to help me. Think
              I used upper serangoon till I hit yck road. Then turn right as
              finally I see hougang ave 8 on the road sign . Finally she then put
              down her phone and she commented that this is the first time she
              used such a route home. I said, there we are, next turn would be
              ave 8. </p>
              <p>Upon reaching her flat, total fare is $16.06</p>
              <p>I told her fare is $16. Then she told me, she can only pay me
              $15. I asked why? She said this is the most expensive ride she ever
              taken and usually max is $12-13+ only. As I was about to ask her if
              it's midnight or not, she left the money on the armrest then slam
              the door...</p>
              <p>Tmd...</p>
              <p>So tell me. Am I being short charged or I really had taken a
              longer route?</p>

              <p>Ya I know it's a longer route but it's she who wants me to turn into aljunied road from sims ave in the first place then talk on the phone while ignoring me when I asked her where to turn.</p>
              <p>So I had to take my own initiative on an unfamiliar route.</p>

              <p>Exactly. Who is responsible for your mistakes?</p>
              <p>No one expects you to know every route but you are charging 300%.</p>
              <p>People overcharge your wife 50% and you not happy.</p>
