              A more fairer way is to forgo the cash penalty &amp; hand over the cab to him base on his lateness on that morning.
              
              i.e: He late for 1 hr, i'll hand over later by 1 hr.
              
              Seriously im considering this method.

                  In return juz a pathetic compensation?

              <p><br>Agreed, however, $4 is base on good relationship, and as I said,  it should be geniunely late with a good reason to be late, I believe we all had late before in our life due to this and that..so, let give the benefit of doubt.</p>
              <p>In fact, for some of my good hirer who give me late once a while, I don't even bother to say anything, they will automatically apologise and offer compensation which I never want to accept, if those often late one, sorry lor, like bro Joe said, no need to talk so much one lah, nobody owe nobody a living, just put the key at the key hole, write a piece of note or SMS him goodbye, dun even need to argue or fark him up, all past 30s yo already, should know what is a gentleman and what is a cheater.</p>
