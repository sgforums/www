              <p>I know increasing the number of taxi on the road is not favourable for taxi drivers.</p>
              <p>However, is increasing the population of Singapore good for our country ?</p>
              <p>Our population has increased in fast pace over the last 2 years, not by birth, but by the large influx of foreigners taking up citizenships. Many do not even need to do military national service.They just hop in and here to share our wealth which we had created and accumulated over the last few decades.</p>
              <p>Why is there a need to increase our population ?</p>

              <p>u made a very good point bro. My guess is that the oppo parties do not wan to play along racial lines and end up getting in hot soup.</p>
              <p>I went to WP , SPP and NSP rallies , all the candidates raised the issue of FOREIGNERS full stop .</p>
              <p>No ah tiong , ah neh , pinoy , ang mo was mentioned.</p>
              <p>But if u think again , unless that Singaporean is BLIND and has not stepped out of his house for years , he or she would have noticed everything has changed. It no longer feels like home anymore. Surely you dont need an oppo candidate to remind us?</p>
              <p>There are still a lot of sporeans who have not awaken yet, oblivious to the fact their country is being overruned by this people. Until more and more come , taking their jobs , personal space , TAXIS then they realise knn! i have awoken!</p>

              <p>The last election the PAP only garnered 66.6% of the votes and our dear friend at AMK GRC also got the same percentage points. A PM and yet only 66.6%? alamak go international arena very malu leh.</p>
              <p>So how to ensure PAP's survival when their electorate is slowly going to vote them out in the future?</p>
              <p>Simple la , bring more people in , give them PINk ICs like toilet paper , these people will be forever indebted to em.</p>
              <p>And also Business owners will earn like siao coz they can pay low wages . Ever went to transcab kiosk and see? All the cashiers and attendents are ah nehs.</p>
              <p>Every nite transcab boss laughing to the bank , on one hand save cost , on the other hand screw the taxi drivers hard. Jasmine also drive BMW liao, everyone happy happy.</p>
              <p>why not?</p>

              <p>Both Poolman and BCL are correct on their views. The ruling party 
              keep putting smoke screen FTs are good, create more jobs for 
              Singaporean.</p>
              <p>I really want to ask them what is the meaning for FT? Foreign Talents, Foreign Workers or Foreign Trash?</p>
              <p>Seems
               like only a very small percentage of Foreign Talents are here to help 
              create jobs. The rest leh? Well, you know i know lah... Hahaha...</p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Now
               PM even apologised and admitted they have made mistakes. This shows 
              that opposition or alternative parties are good for Singapore. Keep the 
              MIW on their toes and slap the driver when the driver fall asleep. <br> </span></span></p>
              <p>I think this election is important for us. I want to see whether Singaporeans has finally grown up and mature on their thinking or are they still living in fear or dreams what the ruling party has painted for them.</p>

But land &amp; resources are scarce not only in Singapore, but other part of the whole as well. When people of other countries chose to be citizen of Singapore, their country reduces some population, that also affects their economy. So, they would encourage more production or their local may feel that it is their interest to produce more people to benefit their manufacturing sectors. In this manner, the earth's limited resources may be cripple by mass reproduction for mankind consumption.

              <p>These peoples from the world (lower class asia peoples) are in fact, so lucky that Singaporeans are tame and non conflict peoples, if you ask them to behave like this in US of A, guess the Afro american negro will be at their asses</p>
