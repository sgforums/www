              <p>Actually my prime period of riding a bike was with my Honda Steed......</p>
              <p>Stay with me for 6 years, most of my kakis "upgrade" from small cc bike together.......</p>
              <p>because of its look alike Harley style, some bikers call it "Chiong Harley".......hahaha</p>
              <p>This steed gone through my youth........<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Last time if anyone see a group of steed riders at Marina South or Raffles City Taxi Stand round about, I'm 1 of them.........</p>
              <p>And my current Goldwing kakis, most of them also from this group until now, but due to our age and family commitment, very rare la, will ride out......</p>
              <p>And to be frank, because of some unhappiness in HOG group, that's why we change..........knn, how can a Sg HOG run by foreigners?.....that's why, FT problem, not only in company, even to the extend of this sort of things.......hahaha</p>

              <p>Got my class 2B when i was 16, few months later buy Suzuki DR200. The bike i accident most.. LoL </p>
              <p>Accident with Taxi twice, fly over a car once (car illegal U turn never signal never on headlight),  crash into the side 10 foot lorry when it turn left.. Broke my collar bone off road at Sungei Gedong, jump nearly 2 storey but landed face first LoL.</p>
              <p>Slowly ride to NUH, doc ask what happen, say fall riding bicycle.. He also know i bluffing..  Cannot say bike accident, must make police report, cant say ride off road, because already tresspassing military training ground $3000 fine. So ride bicycle behind friend house at rifle range road become the excuse.</p>
              <p>Before NS, decided to sell and downgrade to $600 Vespa, end up spend nearly $4k to mod. Race engine, race carb, race exhaust, 2K paintwork, body mod. My friend always say my vespa like 400cc bike. Give RXZ 2-3 lampost also can eat. Accident with taxi once, taxi hit my backside at filter lane, bike and me fly across 2 lane lucky car just pass by.</p>
              <p>After NS, let my friend ride my Vespa, cos my job give me van. Drove van for few years. Change job also drive van. Vespa still under my name, and also sometimes ride Yamaha WR200 and Suzuki RMX 250..</p>
              <p>End up change office job, buy Super 4. No mod all stock..</p>
              <p>Think somewhere in 08 or 09 i thought of getting class 2, go parct 1 2 lesson give up, very sian i alone there taking class 2, rest all 2B. and also disgusting now my wear elbow and knee pad, all wet wet one previously used.</p>
              <p>Can find many of my sticky post on SBF nick cyben76.</p>

              <p>Yes, if affordable, biking is a farking expensive hobby.........</p>
              <p>Of course if you are using it for daily usage, than need not buy a high end bike........</p>
              <p>And if you are a speedster, which I never was, although my Goldwing can hit 200km/hr anytime, than a performance bike is what a lot of youngsters are looking at nowadays........</p>
              <p>Many many years ago ZX11 is king of the road, now I really don't know liao.........</p>
