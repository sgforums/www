              Im not scared to be paiseh, I decide to take up as taxi driver is bcos after my job in overseas ended, i cant find a job in Singapore (tried abt 6months) and is very expensive to stay here. Plus some other personal problems =( So i need to earn as much as possible.... 
              
              Wat do u mean by "Like parents or relatives need to go hospital all the time. . . Need transpot and yet cannot afford. . Like tat."?? honestly im worried about those hdb estate with st and ave.!!! Im really not familiar, moreover theres alot changes... jialat....

              <p>Be relief First.</p>
              <p>As a relief, Off course CDG is the BEST, Let those TaiKo call to train you to know the road, at the same time you MUST learn how to sweep the road.</p>
              <p>6 Mths ~ One Year later, If you still survived as TD, and consider want to OMO, Maybe you can consider TransCab  Red Engine.</p>
              <p>Bit off course proivder by them TransCab still survived. </p>

              <p> I think what he meant was, it's better for one to start off their TD career as a relief instead of a hirer.</p>
              <p>Its not easy to start off as a hirer when you are still unfamiliar with the trade, you'll have to work a lot harder just to cover all the costs before you see take home any profit. Things like daily rental, season parking, etc.,</p>

              <p>Since u really want to fully utilise your time to earn as much as u can, go for transcab 1.8 wish or CDG toyota crown. I dun think u can handle sonata or epica rental. In taxi driving, u must have the courage to take any passenger n go anywhere they want. nobody can really teach u how to make a living. U must never give up when u encounter any difficulties.Otherwise,u will give up driving very soon.</p>

              being green and not knowing the routes well (tats y i hope u guys
              can give some tips) I did call Comfort once, n they are damm yaya…

              call but <span>DOES THAT MAKE ALOT DIFFERENCE</span>??
              then i called prime, trans and smart… Trans staff seems nice and
              their rates are reasonable… tat brings me to another Q. Does

              Ericgo &amp; Weehu, tyvm for your suggestions really really appreciate it, kumsia! If can take the easier way out, who doesnt want?? To me...(pls dont luff) i feel tat being a hirer is much better, dont hv time constraint, wash car, pump back to the level etc etc... causes alot hassle. 
              
              CNG has good rebates but tank small and is costly..... any comments on premier kia auto diesel??
              
              I cant expect any balance lifestyle as of now, too many bullet holes to cover... so die die also got to earn as much as possible, plus for my retirement lol.... 
              
              If any of u "nice and helful" guys dont mind, can we chat further in yahoo messenger, just feel damm lost?

              <p>I think Poolman mentioned this once, you're new best Co to join is CDG, either Citycab or Comfort.</p>
              <p>Not because they are the best ( Icertainly don't think so) but because they are the biggest. They have the most pumps, their repairs/sewrvicing are generally done faster and if you suay suay kena accident theirs is still the lowest excess (not sure, others may clarify).</p>
              <p>No need to enjoy their perks by becoming hirer, it may add up to $2000 a year, but this amount you can easily recoup if you take 1 extra pax a day.</p>
              <p>Be relief best. learn the ropes, and CDG got many hirer for you to choose, dont like 1, throw, find another.</p>
              <p>If really want to be hirer, join them but do not take their perks. Just a normal hirer, I think they have Crown which offers $800 after 6 months as hirer, this you can take, plus if you got friend recommend, the friend gets $500 if you stay for 6 months.</p>
              <p>Sonata now got 3 month waiting period. But you got time what to learn the ropes as a relief first.</p>
              <p>Or as I suggest sometimes, check with your course mates, maybe 2 of you can take 1 cab and 1 of course is the hirer (he takes the perks on paper, but you 2 split it between yourselves). Both are new, both can learn and support each other.</p>
              <p>Transcab (must be very careful here) better ask regulars about them. They are super if everything goes smoothly, better than CDG, but if there's slip on your part, it's money talks, first. Plus about their methods also find out more.</p>
              <p>SMRT, I also urge caution, heard a number of horror stories but my info is old, so they could be much better now.</p>
              <p>I think Silver is alright as a company but repairs/servicing cannot fight. </p>
              <p>So join the 'Mustafa' first - CDG, everything have but not the best, can find better elsewhere. Gain experience and then you can switch to another company. Remember you got 1 year to enjoy the perks on offer or is it 6 months. Drive for 6 months then make a better judgement - your own.</p>

              <p>the reason being advise not to become hirer especially being omo is very shiong, shiong and is very taxing on your health</p>
              <p>no one here is against you being a hirer, what they want you is to have a taste of being a taxi driver and learn about before you become better and more confident on the road in future.</p>
              <p>omo also must wash taxi and clean inside, if not pax may start to skip your taxi.</p>
              <p>my view is take it like a new job, don't stress yourself, can make it continue driving, if not best to have other plan in mind too</p>
