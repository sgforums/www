              <p>Of course under this project , Scheme A no taker , goes to Scheme B , Scheme B no taker , Scheme C like that ....</p>
              <p>I guess you happen to be on Scheme B , which is quite a distance away , usually is .</p>
              <p>Then the system despatch this job to the next nearest taxi from other company .</p>

              I think the TS has a point. Booking system is based on trust and honor, like a trading system, you buyer i seller... but some people will play punk, either side can be TD or the pax, but in such cases usually pax but sometimes TD do it too, never turn up because they got another more lucrative deal.
              
              So you guys are saying TS is at fault because he took the call? It's the same as you buying an electronic at the shop and then when you bring back use after 1 week it brokes down and when you go to the shop it says warranty don't cover this, will you seriously look at yourself and say it's your fault for not checking the item properly? I doubt many of you will, in fact, i think you guys will throw a fuss at that shop which conned your money.
