              <p>To all fellow taxi colleagues</p>
              <p>Finally the day arrive for me to throw key... I hereby wish to thank all LV members both in this forum as well as those outside for the kind advice given to me during my 3 month as a newbie cab driver.</p>
              <p>Especially to uncle poolman for sharing his tons of experience, ct for his jokes, khoon for jioing me supper or breaskfast whenever we met as well as ck for talking cock with me under the coconut tree.</p>
              <p>For those not inside this forum, I would like to thank 06,22,126,277,756,388 and others who i have forgotten to mention for giving me job lobangs, tips, advices, as well as sharing  jokes to keep me awake in the middle of the night.</p>
              <p>Yes!! I will definitely miss "try-call, open call, 5 min &amp; 1 turn"</p>
              <p>LV87 hereby officially resign from cab driving. I hope that you all still welcome me for your buffet gathering in future even though i am not a cab driver anymore. </p>
              <p>My walkie (i205) is available for sale, any members which need a spare set can pm me or contact me at 8125 9258. Last but not least...  i just wish that all of you drive safe.</p>

              <p>many td took up driving for many reason, likewise, leaving this trade does not mean td can not make it.</p>
              <p>in this world, many people job hopping, they will tried a different job to see if it is better than their previous job after comparing.</p>
              <p>the tried duration can be long or short subject to individual</p>
              <p>What is your fear, how many td in this forum actually say they are leaving for good cos cannot make it, so far i see very very few</p>
              <p>So don't get so worry if someone want to say goodbye, all the best to them is what I have</p>

              What you have been thru, I also go thru it in my 3yrs driving. 
              Accidents? Just drive carefully. 
              Passenger abuse? I dun think its wrong to F them back if they foul mouth first. 
              Horn and disturb? If i not at fault, I usually horn them more when they do it at me. 
              Traffic light violation? Just practice slow down and stop if nessesary at amble turned red light. 
              Security guard? F care them if you are told to pick up or wait by the pax, do the guards pay your fare? 
              Ignored by pax? Usually I let it be because there will be other pax taking my red taxi. To me now Sonatas are more dangerous as it seems.

              I am just earning a honest living like other drivers, so not really anybody can affect my emotions unless I make myself loose control. You must know this, what goes around, comes around, god is watching us everytime.
