              Yes we rest just before peak hours. Slatiga ur a biz owner. U have a limited capacity, u hage 2 jobs but u can only chose one job. Would u choose the better profit one or the lower profit ones. Sure maybe at times u will choose the lower profit because it's a long term customer. Taxi biz what long term customer if u pick on the streets. U think they appreciate yr help by picking them up 5 mins before peak hrs and give u a tip or always call u to give u biz. Simple equation. Next, as u said see a lot of cabby take kopi before peak hrs. Do u see us take dinner at 6pm ? Geez we have to take a break la. We choose to take early dinner before peak hrs to help those that need a cab after hard work but willing to pay and be pamper, of course we help ourselves too. Why don't u say why all workers go eat dinner at 5pm etc. 
              
              As for earning a lot? Nope we don't, but we are able to survive if we work hard and we do work hard. Driving in Aircon listen radio yep that's true, but asked any taxi driver how their neck and back feel? Aches daily. 
              
              Well increasing fares might put ridership down and well then even lesser cans because no td. 
              
              Maybe saltiga can help by changing yr workers timing from say start at 3am then ends at  12noon. Then no surcharge lor and easy get cans lor, we tds also get a better spread of the jobs and maybe even can scrap the surcharge Liao. The issue is demand and supply. 90% of population go to work fr 7 to 9, go home 5 to 10 and 70% of those ate fr town. Of course the cheapos will go off after 8pm la.

              <p>I dunno abt the rest but i have my meal breaks at 11 pm which is the time for me to recharge to do my midnight runs. If one day u see me at a kopi tiam TCSS , you really cannott fault me for tat as i think 11 pm is the worse hour to do my rounds &amp; my body needs a rest.</p>

              <p>So what business are you in???</p>
              <p>Need Workers???? Can I join???</p>
              <p>Been in welding works. Carpentry.  Vehicle mechanic. Can cook ( zhe car ), used to have my own seafood restaurant.</p>
              <p>40 years old but no cert. $2000 is enough</p>
              <p>Interested???</p>
              <p>You think we are having easy life. If got chance to change, a lot of TD will rather gave up their taxi.</p>
              <p>Talking about fault accident. My rear left door was bang by a van, but i still have to repair myself. Not my fault I was going straight but the stupid fella just signal and turn out without looking. My company say no witness better not claim, 50/50 chance only. If want to claim, can but if the claim doesn't go through then i will have to pay company $2000. We are out there on our own, company doesn't protect us.</p>
              <p>Been slap by a passerby who want to take taxi. ask me to wind down my window and slap me then tell me it's wrong to pick up pax by the road. then cha bo taking another taxi. Call police, police ask me to call my company to track down the taxi so that they could block it.  I call but my company say the police need to fax the details to them before they release the whereabout of the taxi. Think about it by the time the police fax the details, the guy will be at home sleeping. We are out there on our own.</p>
              <p>Thinking and talking is easy. Try it out first. Try driving 10 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
              <p>Typical singaporean, always think you are right. If we don't eat before or after peak hours. You expect us to eat during peak hours. Siao bo.</p>
              <p>I am really wondering whether you really own a business. Or just a nobody, but like to talk big. I think it's the later.</p>

But that is part of our life we choose to live on, we blame nobody and certainly expect nobody to blame us. And frankly, it is not that I have not work before, for working is rules and disciplines, you can siam here and there, and there is alway a room to negiotate over it, but for taxi driving, if you dun not have a self discipline, plan your own rules and regulations, you are doom.</p>

              <p>A reduction in taxi fare may not necessarily result in a corresponding increase in a td's income. There are only so many hours in a day a td can work. (say 10hrs for one shift and 14 hours for omo). The upside is limited by the number of hours and the fact that taxi driving is limited to serving 1 paying customer at any instance. Be it 4 adults or 1 or any other combination, the fare is still the same. This is unlike shop owners\biz owners who can serve several customers simultaneously. It is guaranteed that a td will earn less per trip if the fare is reduced, and this has to be made up for by an increase in the number of trips in order to maintain the same level of earnings. This is not a given, though I concede given a fare reduction, an increase in the number of trips is a likely outcome. But it comes back to the number of available hours. The general perception that a td is his own boss is wrong. He has no say in the price of the service he is providing. A business can increase the prices of it's products or services to meet it's own increasing costs and maintain a reasonable profit margin if necessary. A TD is just self-employed. His only say is the number of hours he works in order to achieve his desired income utilising the available working hours.</p>
              <p>When people ask me why the taxi fare is so expensive, my usual response is to ask if they expect their annual salary increments to at least match the inflation rate. Only 1 answer obviously - yes. The advantage of being an employee is that one can generally expect bonuses and salary increments. For a td, the only increment is if taxi fares were raised AND the number trips remain consistent. This is an unlikely outcome as people will voice their unhappiness by not taking taxis. (at least for the first few months). Since the last fare increment in December 2007, my income has not varied significantly MOM or YOY.</p>
              <p>Inflation rate : 2007 = 2.1% , 2008 = 6.6% , 2009 = 0.6% , 2010 = 3.3% (Sep).</p>
              <p>My income has not increased despite me working the same number of hours and at the same work rate. Obviously, inflation and the rising cost of living do not apply to tds. Who is helping me cope? The three of us have to work hard, me, myself and I.</p>
