              <p>Taxi drivers are already earning more and their average income is already more than those who are employed by companies.</p>
              <p>Taxi drivers are actually considered self-employed and they get to earn as much time as they put in to work.</p>
              <p>Taxi drivers pays only little to zero income tax.</p>

              <p>The money is there, but if you asked another taxi driver, they will tell you the money isn't there because they discourage you to increase their competition.</p>

              <p>The earnings of a TD is really nothing to shout about. Considering how much the country has moved forward , the earnings are still lagging. If ever one day , SG cabbies can hit the earnings of UK cabbies , then we can safely say we will be a happier bunch.</p>

              <p>I for one am not earning more , it is abt the same. And i still recommend that CDG imposes chrysler fares $5 + $0.30 jump to ease the demand for cabs. Day drivers will earn more with this adjustment too.</p>
              <p>This structure will weed out those marginal users , save having them to complain abt us day in and day out.</p>

              <p><br>Alot of self-employed people also get no sick pay and taxi driver is no different too.</p>
              <p>Although the taxi belonged to the taxi company, the driver don't get paid by the taxi company and can easily lose the taxi over a mere complaint from customer.</p>
              <p>Taxi companies should protect their own drivers against such abusive customers.</p>
              <p>But they are not doing it, so taxi drivers must learn how to protect their own business lor.</p>

              <p><br>Then hawkers leh? You can find relief driver if you really sick for one or two days, but most taxi drivers prefer not to do so.</p>
              <p>One day $96, you split 1/2 with your night/day driver, so it's not much to lose in a day. Can easily earn it back then go home and rest for the day.</p>
              <p>Hawkers have no relief hawkers and they still pay for the stall rental even though they are sick.</p>
              <p>If you want to imagine taxi driving as the perfect job, then it's no wonder you're driving a taxi.</p>

              <p>Are you a taxi driver ? come on admit it, if you are not no shame on admiting you are not a taxi driver. it seems likely you are not because of the way your way of saying here. why you said "many people quit their real jobs and took up
                                      taxi driving instead?"  people have no choice as they are jobless for a long time thanks to gov policy FT. if you think singapore is recovering you better think again. And also you can try to drive 12 hour a day then you tell me it good to be taxi driver of cos you can said you sub let to relief driver but you must try first before you have the right to said anything here. </p>
