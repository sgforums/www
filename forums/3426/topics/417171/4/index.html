              <p>Give ptnc70a  break will ya? Sure nobody force us to be taxi drivers , dont have to say until aunty , uncle , granddad , grandma but some circumstances drive us to be one.</p>
              <p>You are a very arrogant businessman i must say. 10 workers? well u better make sure your business flourish and huat till the day u die and pass on to the next generation.</p>
              <p>3 businessman cases i have come across who had to drive taxis.</p>
              <p>ex boss of a ferry operator ( big timer )  - much more than 10 workers.</p>
              <p>ex boss of a credit co</p>
              <p>ex boss of a contracting firm</p>
              <p>you are obviously very offended when Ptnc70 challenged u, seriously wad have u got to prove? offer people a job and then docked 2 mths pay for challenging u? wtf?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What u can do instead is to tell us wad is your company , so all of us can boycott picking your staff &amp; i will be the first.</p>

              <p>Bro, don't bother to talk so much to this fella. Words can't kill, only actions get the job done. 10 years in business and only 10 workers. Can't go far. Not to criticize but that's the fact.</p>
              <p>Well think about, have you heard of any Big businessman who got so much free time to tc in the forum.</p>

              <p>So what business are you in???</p>
              <p>Need Workers???? Can I join???</p>
              <p>Been in welding works. Carpentry.  Vehicle mechanic. Can
              cook ( zhe car ), used to have my own seafood restaurant.</p>
              <p>40 years old but no cert. $2000 is enough</p>
              <p>Interested???</p>
              <p>You think we are having easy life. If got chance to change, a
              lot of TD will rather gave up their taxi.</p>
              <p>Talking about fault accident. My rear left door was bang by a
              van, but i still have to repair myself. Not my fault I was going
              straight but the stupid fella just signal and turn out without
              looking. My company say no witness better not claim,
              50/50 chance only. If want to claim, can but if the claim doesn't
              go through then i will have to pay company $2000. We are out there
              on our own, company doesn't protect us.</p>
              <p>Been slap by a passerby who want to take taxi. ask me to wind
              down my window and slap me then tell me it's wrong to pick up pax
              by the road. then cha bo taking another taxi. Call police, police
              ask me to call my company to track down the taxi so that they could
              block it.  I call but my company say the police need to fax
              the details to them before they release the whereabout of the taxi.
              Think about it by the time the police fax the details, the guy will
              be at home sleeping. We are out there on our own.</p>
              <p>Thinking and talking is easy. Try it out first. Try driving 10
              hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
              <p>Typical singaporean, always think you are right. If we don't eat
              before or after peak hours. You expect us to eat during peak hours.
              Siao bo.</p>
              <p>I am really wondering whether you really own a business. Or just
              a nobody, but like to talk big. I think it's the later.</p>

              <p>i think you're probably the only driver who doesn't know that being hit at the side is a 50/50 kinda thingy, but thanks god you hit someone who might not know much about insurance, if its me, i'll make sure you don't even lose your 2k, i'll report and make your you might have your driving points deducted even....</p>
              <p>and as for you being slap, well put it this way, there must be more to it then what you claimed, no one of sound mind would come slapping your face if nothing happened before that,</p>
              <p>job wise, no problem if you're interested and hopefully you're capable enough, call me at 85541533... but make sure your call me with your mobile no appearing, but thats if you're man enough. </p>
              <p>and as for whether i'm a business owner, well, call me and you'll find out if i really am, and if you realized that i'm not  then you can start being your screen warrior and claim this and that about others..</p>

              <p>Bro, don't bother to talk so much to this fella. Words can't
              kill, only actions get the job done. 10 years in business and only
              10 workers. Can't go far. Not to criticize but that's the fact.</p>
              <p>Well think about, have you heard of any Big businessman who got
              so much free time to tc in the forum.</p>
