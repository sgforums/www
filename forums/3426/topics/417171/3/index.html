              <p>A reduction in taxi fare may not necessarily result in a
              corresponding increase in a td's income. There are only so many
              hours in a day a td can work. (say 10hrs for one shift and 14 hours
              for omo). The upside is limited by the number of hours and the fact
              that taxi driving is limited to serving 1 paying customer at any
              instance. Be it 4 adults or 1 or any other combination, the fare is
              still the same. This is unlike shop owners\biz owners who can serve
              several customers simultaneously. It is guaranteed that a td will
              earn less per trip if the fare is reduced, and this has
              to be made up for by an increase in the number of trips in
              order to maintain the same level of earnings. This is not a given,
              though I concede given a fare reduction, an increase in the number
              of trips is a likely outcome. But it comes back to the number of
              available hours. The general perception that a td is his own boss
              is wrong. He has no say in the price of the service he is
              providing. A business can increase the prices of it's products or
              services to meet it's own increasing costs and maintain a
              reasonable profit margin if necessary. A TD is just self-employed.
              His only say is the number of hours he works in order to achieve
              his desired income utilising the available working hours.</p>
              <p>When people ask me why the taxi fare is so expensive, my usual
              response is to ask if they expect their annual salary increments to
              at least match the inflation rate. Only 1 answer obviously - yes.
              The advantage of being an employee is that one can generally expect
              bonuses and salary increments. For a td, the only increment is if
              taxi fares were raised AND the number trips remain consistent. This
              is an unlikely outcome as people will voice their unhappiness by
              not taking taxis. (at least for the first few months). Since the
              last fare increment in December 2007, my income has not varied
              significantly MOM or YOY.</p>
              <p>Inflation rate : 2007 = 2.1% , 2008 = 6.6% ,
              2009 = 0.6% , 2010 = 3.3% (Sep).</p>
              <p>My income has not increased despite me working the same number
              of hours and at the same work rate. Obviously, inflation and the
              rising cost of living do not apply to tds. Who is helping me cope?
              The three of us have to work hard, me, myself and I.</p>

              <p>Terima Kasih chief. Just voicing out loud what most TD bros already know.</p>
              <p>likeyou, concerning reduction of rental, beside the loyalty reduction for the first few years (I think for CDG it's $1.5 + GST per year) a true reduction in rental is never going to happen. Not with COE prices at such levels, not with CDG giving their staff 3+ month bonus (my guess only, but I know what they got for last year), not with inflation running at 3+%. I am thankful they never increase in the first place. Sure many tds throw key. Reducing hop in fares, again unlikely to happen. TDs unhappy, throw key. Consumers switch to taxis, billions invested in MRT Lines down the drain. Biggest losers SMRT, SBS Transit and the garmen.</p>

              <p>bro just to rewind a little back to 1995 , prior to this , taxi rental was only $38 a day. When COE hit $110k . they hiked the rental by more than double to $80 or so citing COE prices as the reason ( I am not sure wad is the exact hike but should be therabouts)</p>
              <p>But right after that 110k COE , prices started to spiral downwards , over the years we seen $40k , $30k , $10k and even $3k COE but rentals still stayed high &amp; never came down. So just imagine how much $ they made from TDs. The amount is mind boggling considering some of the sonatas they bought were only $60k with COE.</p>
              <p>Just a year of solid prompt payment  from a hirer yields $37800 for CDG. In a matter of another few months , the cost of the taxi is fully paid for ( and im very sure they do not take bank loans to buy their fleet).</p>
              <p>You think they will lower rentals bro? They never increase our rentals consider very heng liao.</p>
              <p>We are just like u commuters , hapless &amp; cant do much.</p>
              <p>So we take all the shit from the taxi cos and just pass the baton on to end users.</p>
              <p>If people were to understand this simple theory , then they will not slam the TDs tat much but sadly tats not the case.</p>

              <p>Been in welding works. Carpentry.  Vehicle mechanic. Can cook ( zhe car ), used to have my own seafood restaurant.</p>
              <p>40 years old but no cert. $2000 is enough</p>
              <p>Interested???</p>
              <p>You think we are having easy life. If got chance to change, a lot of TD will rather gave up their taxi.</p>
              <p>Talking about fault accident. My rear left door was bang by a van, but i still have to repair myself. Not my fault I was going straight but the stupid fella just signal and turn out without looking. My company say no witness better not claim, 50/50 chance only. If want to claim, can but if the claim doesn't go through then i will have to pay company $2000. We are out there on our own, company doesn't protect us.</p>
              <p>Been slap by a passerby who want to take taxi. ask me to wind down my window and slap me then tell me it's wrong to pick up pax by the road. then cha bo taking another taxi. Call police, police ask me to call my company to track down the taxi so that they could block it.  I call but my company say the police need to fax the details to them before they release the whereabout of the taxi. Think about it by the time the police fax the details, the guy will be at home sleeping. We are out there on our own.</p>
              <p>Thinking and talking is easy. Try it out first. Try driving 10 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
              <p>Typical singaporean, always think you are right. If we don't eat before or after peak hours. You expect us to eat during peak hours. Siao bo.</p>
              <p>I am really wondering whether you really own a business. Or just a nobody, but like to talk big. I think it's the later.</p>

              <p>Supposing govt said lower rental, reducing hop in fares, who
              will be happy? Td and customers right? Isnt it simple and logic?
              Win win for all.</p>

              <p>You can forget about this idea lah.</p>
              <p>Firstly rental will never be lower, coz it is tied to the fixed capital the coy paid (ie, the vehicle cost, taxes, and so on so forth).</p>
              <p>Secondly, I don't think it is gahmen intention to lower the fare.  Lower fare -&gt; more commuter take taxi -&gt; more taxi needed on the road -&gt; more congestion, polution, etc.</p>

              <p><br>I dont think it will make the road more congested.</p>
              <p>With the present number of taxi on the road, it will be sufficient enough to cater for the increase of commuters.</p>
