              <p>North East CDC launches scheme to provide more job opportunities</p>
              <p> SINGAPORE - To help more residents find a job, the North East Community 
                  Development Council (CDC) has launched an AID Package to provide more 
                  opportunities for job-seekers through closer cooperation with companies.<br><br> The CDC announced yesterday that it will pay S$2,500 of a 
                  job-seeker's salary for the first month and S$1,250 from the second to 
                  the sixth month when he is placed with an employer by the CDC.<br><br> Mayor of North East CDC Teo Ser Luck said at the CDC's council 
                  appointment ceremony yesterday: "We realise that the PMETs and the 
                  elderly have some problems of being placed in a job, so ... we decided 
                  that maybe we should encourage employers to employ them when they are 
                  job ready."<br><br> Around 2,200 job-seekers are currently registered with the CDC.<br><br> Mr Teo said while the CDC has "some budget numbers" for the 
                  programme, he does not have an overall budget. "I think in helping 
                  people, it's more important to see ... whether there's demand out there,
                   whether this scheme can effectively work on the ground. Then we look at
                   the budget," said Mr Teo.<br><br> So far, three companies - 
                  Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort, Maxillofacial Solutions and Service, 
                  and Pawer Skills Learning Centre - have joined the programme.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, the guest-of-honour at the 
                  event, said the CDC is taking a "more proactive role" to adopt a "no 
                  wrong door" policy by ensuring there is a smooth transition between 
                  different aid agencies when residents seek help in different areas.</p>
              <p><br> For example, a needy job-seeker can apply for social assistance, 
                  along with job assistance from the CDC's career centres, DPM Teo said.<br><br> North East CDC yesterday appointed 64 councillors, who Mr Teo Ser 
                  Luck described as "social catalyst(s) to help identify the needs of the 
                  community".<br><br> Ms Judy Anne Wee, vice-president of the 
                  Disabled People's Association and the first councillor with special 
                  needs to be appointed, said: "It's a new sector as, all this while, I 
                  have been working with voluntary welfare organisations ... It is a good 
                  time to look at the national level and see how I can contribute to 
                  society ... to help a group of people with special needs who probably 
                  need someone to speak out on their behalf."</p>
