            <div class='col-md body'><p>Wise words, Poolie. As it is now, we're made to slog for a pittance. Pity the ang mo tourists flagging taxis along Jln besar at 10 pm nightly. They don't understand why empty taxis aren't stopping. Our fares are cheap compared to where they come from. They don't mind paying more. The people setting fares can't manage supply and demand. Little India, Vivo city, Golden mile complex must incoporate the $3 city charge. The authorities choose to mati mati demarcate the city charge by the ERP gantries. Hence the bewilderment of tourists when no taxis stopped in these fringe areas. Yes, correct pricing is the best way to manage supply and demand. When demand exceeds supply, prices must go up.

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>2 common reasons why some disagree on taxi fare hike.</p>
              <p>1. Passengers stay away -- This is only temporary. When they need a cab they will be back at the taxi stand. Even without increase, they will not board your cab if they don't need one. Its's the demand and supply situation rather than taxi fare. A small increase isn't going to scare away the good passengers.</p>
              <p>2. Taxi fare increase, then surely rental also increase -- Taxi rental isn't going to go down or remain the same for long. Unless there is a serious economic crisis here in this region. Taxi meter fares need  to increase periodically to match consumers demand. Similarly rental will go up as well. You fear taxi fare increase, you die standing. Taxi drivers here will be downgraded to cheap labourers.</p>
              <p>To keep your heads above the water level, we need to increase the taxi fare soon.</p>

              <p>Donsan, aka navigator 81, thanks for raising a great topic. Really, we see many</p>
              <p>complaints against cabbies in the papers. We have our gripes too. But we're</p>
              <p>powerless. Where's LTA, Seng Han Thong, Raymond Lim when we need them most?</p>
              <p>When will there be some respite in the taxi industry?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, your Palringo baby is getting stronger by the day huh? Congrats.</p>

              <p>Some coffee shop uncles , when i sat with them , no one said taxi future is good ...... soon it will be tougher they said , cos Downtown line start liao .....</p>
              <p>Wasn't this the same group that told me about NorthEast Line ?</p>
              <p>Circle line ?</p>
              <p>The most funny thing is .... whenever Punggol customers called our Lake View hotline , need a cab to Punggol .....  from Shenton Way area , Lake View members don't take one .</p>
              <p>Why isn't this group of Punggol Sengkang paxes take the Circle Line or NEL home ?</p>
              <p>Cos taxi fare is dirt cheap , taxi is personal , taxi can sit , MRT must stand , taxi will not squeeze into like sardines ... but who's fault ?</p>
              <p>But dun want to pay more ...</p>

              <p>Tamp mall no cab after 8 pm is because cabbies go dinner mah. No 35% extra liao mah.</p>
              <p>Problem exacerbated by pax all coming out at that time to avoid surcharge. Come</p>
              <p>9pm, supply and demand will more or less even out. At 10.30 pm at Tamp, if u hv 35%</p>
              <p>extra as standard charge, TD surely jialat. On the other hand, at 10.30 pm Serangoon</p>
              <p>Plaza, ppl wud b willing to pay 35% extra. So its a complex issue. No one size fits all.</p>
              <p>Back to basics of economics. Higher demand, higher price. Lower demand, lower</p>
              <p>price. At 10.30pm, I'd be glad to hv a pax at CCK without surcharges. Something is</p>
              <p>better than nothing.</p>
