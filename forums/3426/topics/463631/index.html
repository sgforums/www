              <p>As newbie i willing try every situation, part and parcel of the learning experience.</p>
              <p>Just want some advise if encounter again.</p>
              <p>Saturday around 10+pm picked up two pax along Bukit Batok East Ave 3:</p>
              <p><strong>Pax: Uncle, several location, ok?</strong></p>
              <p><em><strong>Me: Ok lah, where u want to go?</strong></em></p>
              <p><strong>Pax: Go Boon Lay market first.</strong></p>
              <p>So drive to Boon Lay, go in market carpark. Pax ask me wait awhile, pax girlfriend stayed in car. Meter still running. I ask the girl can wait outside, i need to go pee. She ok. She go out buy some stuff, i go pee. </p>
              <p>Come back sit in car, then guy come back, girl also come back in.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Me: Where to next?</strong></em></p>
              <p><strong>Pax: Yishun Ring Road.</strong></p>
              <p>Driving towards Corporation Rd, suddenly pax said no need go Yishun, go back to Bukit Batok where i picked them up. So go up PIE, pax ask to exit by Bukit Batok Rd.</p>
              <p>Reach Bukit Batok East Ave 3.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Me: You want drop at the bus stop io pick u up ah?</strong></em></p>
              <p><strong>Pax: No go into the carpark.</strong></p>
              <p>So drive into the carpark, pax tell me left right left right. Then suddenly say different block. So went to that block. Pax alight ask me wait again with gf inside. Wait with meter running.</p>
              <p>Pax return after 5min.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Me: Going where now?</strong></em></p>
              <p><strong>Pax: Ang Mo Kio Ave 4 MacDonalds.</strong></p>
              <p>So go PIE Lornie, reach Mac Ave 4 pax alight, this time girl say she also want alight for smoke, i say ok i also want to smoke. So all 3 of us smoking outside, meter still running, the guy don't know wait for what. Finish my stick i sit back inside, then guy went across the road, then come back.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Me: Now where?</strong></em></p>
              <p><strong>Pax: Geylang Lor 16.</strong></p>
              <p>So drive there, i thought last destination, as usual guy went out for 5-10min, then come back.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Me: Next?</strong></em></p>
              <p><strong>Pax: Last place, Lavender Food Court.</strong></p>
              <p>Pax alight 1150pm, so nearly 2hrs total fare nearly 60 points. </p>
              <p>I know can make more within CBD in that 2 hrs, but my question is, can i reject the pax halfway, let's say at AMK i say i can't go any further, etc.. and still collect fare?</p>

              if you agree to pax request then is very to reject half way.
              
              you should have ask the number of stop and waiting time
              
              share with you yesterday when i pick up a family at traders hotel
              
              thy wanted to go ford ave to drop the wife and than follow by back to orchard so i agree.
              
              half way to ford ave, they added one more stop jurong country club 
              
              then again they add one more to bukit timah plaza.
              
              looking at the place they go i knew it is going to be more than an hour with est $30 point
              
              so i told them that such service would require disposal service min 2 hr, $35 an hr and 
              
              they agree though the wife mentioned other taxi driver just add current booking charge
              
              i show them my company paper and the rate  and will stop where we are to drop them off
              
              since service require was not as say when they board
              
              they agree and accept without choice( cause i will drop them off at place where there will be no taxi)

              to drop pax half way make sure you find a good reason and not get yourself
              
              drinking coffee at LTA,  try to have a nice talk like since you are still new
              
              throwing a pax out require skill
              
              yesterday at little india(heavy rain) 2 indian lady wanted to go tg rhu( i was changing shift to punggol with the LED sign indicated)
              
              i did not want to take them but they ask tolong so i took them, bastard just board and
              
              move off they want me to stop kallang to pick their daughter and i so tulan and say no
              
              they say just nearby but i just refuse, prepare to throw them out but they want me to drop 
              
              them at musafa taxi stand so i tell them i will still charge them (already stop at one side)
              
              they lan lan accept
              
              so drop off collect money and move on to pick other
              
              many case you will come across but need to apply the right tactic

              <p>Suspected that also, but don't want to jump to conclusion, maybe selling Hello Kitty toys, LoL..</p>
              <p>When just pick them up both were calculating how much they would make after Taxi fare.</p>
              <p>Towards final destination they were counting money, sounded like a lot. Min $500+ in hand cos i overheard, deposit $500, rest dunno do what.</p>
              <p>Must be some high end "Hello Kitty"</p>
              <p>Anyways TDVL course only teach us what to do if encounter "terrorist", never teach us what to do if encounter drug runners, etc...</p>

              <p>First of all, i'm not here to complain about this trip, i'm ok
              with it actually. Although i know most old birds don't like this
              tye of trip cos can earn more hourly on Sat night.</p>
              <p>As newbie i willing try every situation, part and parcel of the
              learning experience.</p>
              <p>Just want some advise if encounter again.</p>
              <p>Saturday around 10+pm picked up two pax along Bukit Batok East
              Ave 3:</p>
              <p><strong>Pax: Uncle, several location, ok?</strong></p>
              <p><em><strong>Me: Ok lah, where u want to go?</strong></em></p>
              <p><strong>Pax: Go Boon Lay market first.</strong></p>
              <p>So drive to Boon Lay, go in market carpark. Pax ask me wait
              awhile, pax girlfriend stayed in car. Meter still running. I ask
              the girl can wait outside, i need to go pee. She ok. She go out buy
              some stuff, i go pee. </p>
              <p>Come back sit in car, then guy come back, girl also come back
              in.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Me: Where to next?</strong></em></p>
              <p><strong>Pax: Yishun Ring Road.</strong></p>
              <p>Driving towards Corporation Rd, suddenly pax said no need go
              Yishun, go back to Bukit Batok where i picked them up. So go up
              PIE, pax ask to exit by Bukit Batok Rd.</p>
              <p>Reach Bukit Batok East Ave 3.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Me: You want drop at the bus stop io pick u up
              ah?</strong></em></p>
              <p><strong>Pax: No go into the carpark.</strong></p>
              <p>So drive into the carpark, pax tell me left right left right.
              Then suddenly say different block. So went to that block. Pax
              alight ask me wait again with gf inside. Wait with meter
              running.</p>
              <p>Pax return after 5min.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Me: Going where now?</strong></em></p>
              <p><strong>Pax: Ang Mo Kio Ave 4 MacDonalds.</strong></p>
              <p>So go PIE Lornie, reach Mac Ave 4 pax alight, this time girl say
              she also want alight for smoke, i say ok i also want to smoke. So
              all 3 of us smoking outside, meter still running, the guy don't
              know wait for what. Finish my stick i sit back inside, then guy
              went across the road, then come back.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Me: Now where?</strong></em></p>
              <p><strong>Pax: Geylang Lor 16.</strong></p>
              <p>So drive there, i thought last destination, as usual guy went
              out for 5-10min, then come back.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Me: Next?</strong></em></p>
              <p><strong>Pax: Last place, Lavender Food Court.</strong></p>
              <p>Pax alight 1150pm, so nearly 2hrs total fare nearly 60
              points. </p>
              <p>I know can make more within CBD in that 2 hrs, but my question
              is, can i reject the pax halfway, let's say at AMK i say i can't go
              any further, etc.. and still collect fare?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Why cannot do....no pressure, got smoking break in between.</p>
              <p>60 bucks for 2 hours in the last few days on Dec, why cannot. Knn 3 days ago on Thurs nite 1 epica in front of me, stopped, yes stooped, not slow down in the 2nd lane, wait for a bus to go, then go left most lane just to pick up 1 pax hailing a cab. So desperate for pax. Here you got confirm trip to cover rental why cannot.</p>
              <p>Ask for illegal activities, pls lah some of you your imagination run wild. Pax do legal or iilegal business as long you never involved why worry. You think this Singapore or North Korea....Police or CNB anyhow catch.</p>
              <p>If say really they do drugs and stopped, the first thing is screen you, no drug record, 2nd, no contact number or exchange of calls between you and the couriers. 3rd just 1 phone call to your company can clarify your previous trips and show you were genuinely picking up a fare.</p>
              <p>Say really sway, as happened 1 time before CNB tail a major trafficker, who happened to use a cab to do his delivery. So cab stopped brought to nearby carpark, driver questioned and released after 15 to 20 mins, not 24 hours. Plus if I the driver sure ask the CNB to collect my fare [meter running] for the wait.</p>
              <p>Why scared. Never do wrong scared for what. Trouble, this one not trouble lah, we TD trouble is violent pax, drunkard fare evaders. This 1 is paid job.</p>

              <p>Why cannot do....no pressure, got smoking break in between.</p>
              <p>60 bucks for 2 hours in the last few days on Dec, why cannot.
              Knn 3 days ago on Thurs nite 1 epica in front of me, stopped, yes
              stooped, not slow down in the 2nd lane, wait for a bus to go, then
              go left most lane just to pick up 1 pax hailing a cab. So desperate
              for pax. Here you got confirm trip to cover rental why cannot.</p>
              <p>Ask for illegal activities, pls lah some of you your imagination
              run wild. Pax do legal or iilegal business as long you never
              involved why worry. You think this Singapore or North
              Korea....Police or CNB anyhow catch.</p>
              <p>If say really they do drugs and stopped, the first thing is
              screen you, no drug record, 2nd, no contact number or exchange of
              calls between you and the couriers. 3rd just 1 phone call to your
              company can clarify your previous trips and show you were genuinely
              picking up a fare.</p>

              trafficker, who happened to use a cab to do his delivery. So cab

              Same thought for me. Why think so much, go CBD confirm can get pax meh?  Got ppl pay for your meter to run, why not? And 10+, already got peak hour, already a bonus. 
              
              Agree, never do anything wrong, why worry?
