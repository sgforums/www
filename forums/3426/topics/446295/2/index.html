              <p>whenever i see cheapo searching for cheaper Taxi, i always pray

              not to take them.</p>
              <p>because<br> 1) i believe that when people got problem with the fares, they will
              have problem for me.<br> 2) these people usually give me short trip, longer trip they can’t

              i remember when I was doing super relief for a short while.
              
              There was this cheapo auntie as well and the first question she asked was how much is the starting fare to which I reply $3 and she board the cab with her son and mother.
              
              Along the way from West Coast to Sembawang, she share that she seldom take taxi and is going for her first holiday and start complaining things is getting very expensive in Singapore. She keep glancing at the meter and by the time we reach, it was about $18.40 or $18.60 which I cannot remember la.
              
              I just told her that $18 will do la and it make her so happy that keep saying thank you to me. It kinda make my day as well. Strange but true.
              
              P.S I won't say that she is cheapo but from what I see that they seem to come from low-income family and to go holiday to Malaysia is like a luxuary to them already.
