              <p>I had 3 encounters with Aux police personnel taking my cab.</p>
              <p>One gentleman was in plain clothes with some sort of security pass hanging at his neck. With his blue slack, I quickly identify him as an off-duty police personnel. True enough, he stopped at Certis Cisco near corperation rd and paid by company cab charge card.</p>
              <p>During the journey, he seems very restless and aggitated with some matters. He also looked hagged and as though he has tonnes of probs.</p>
              <p>When I asked him does he has his gun in his procession, he said yes.</p>
              <p>What if he misfire his gun in my taxi? what are the protection we TD can get from such risk? with the recent misfire case in toilet, it serve as a reminder to me that I should not take off-duty aux police or any body with weapon.</p>

              <p>my 2nd case was this gentleman kept his pistol in his bag. wondering whether was it lock and holstered properly. What if something entangle in his bag resutled the pistol goes off?</p>
              <p>wonder if SG police care to comment the 'what if?'.</p>
              <p>Such lapse cannot be happened at all especially to an innocent cabby who trying to make some decent income!</p>

              <p>The revolvers are usually the double action type. Squeeze trigger first time, the weapon is cocked, squeeze trigger second time, it fires. Unless he act like cowboy, and cock the revolver with his palm first, then squeeze trigger and fire.</p>
              <p>Difficult for the aux officer to accidentally fire.  He must be playing with his gun, or he really want to shoot.</p>

              <p>Incorrect. A double-action revolver accomplishes both actions with a single continuous pull of the trigger, i.e., from a hammer-forward position, pulling the trigger will draw the hammer rearward then release it to fire the gun.</p>
              <p>If the hammer is manually cocked beforehand, pulling the trigger then just releases the hammer and fires the gun in <em>single action</em> mode.</p>
              <p>Almost all accidental discharges are caused by negligent handling of the firearm by the operator, regardless of what the operator claims.</p>

              <p>Yup. Today you can pick these ppl up from shopping centres, gold smith shops, offices, etc when they are changing shift. they are to take the cab to their respective HQ to send arm. This is the one journey I am not comfortable with.</p>
              <p>What if one who got himself in deep trouble (eg: otang bank money, etc) wanted to kill himself in the cab. Then how? you will not become a suspect, but a PRIME suspect!.</p>

              <p>here we talking about off-duty personnel. There must be a reason why they are allow to take taxi instead of MRT &amp; buses. Probably due to the weapon. It shld be least expose to public. It shld be back to HQ asap after any shift duty.</p>
              <p>I wonder how will be the reactions if one aux police officer 'accidentally' fire off his gun in a taxi and 'accidentally' killed the taxi driver....</p>
              <p>Many of you will thk: never happen one la.</p>
              <p>Maybe I kiasi... always expect the unexpected thing to happen. Thay's why I live longer. heee.</p>

              <p>Yup! you can see it when it is pointed at  you. But when you're the one holding the revolver and squeezing the trigger, you can feel the hammer being pulled back, and lock in the cocked position, ready for release. The mid point can be felt. This it self is a safety feature, because the shooter has that much micro second to change his mind about shooting. This has been smoothen to the long pull.</p>
              <p>You have to have fired the older revolvers and the present ones to know the difference.</p>
              <p>The older revolvers would have the hammer rest on an empty chamber, the present ones have a groove betwen chambers. But still don't throw a loaded gun on to the floor like they do in the movies.</p>
              <p>As for the aux officer sitting behind the taxi driver, if he just sits still, its safe, if he fidgets and touches the revolver and pushes the revolver to deeper into his trousers, he is taking that 0.0001percent chance of the revolver going off into the back of the taxi driver.</p>
