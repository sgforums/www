This is first Class public transport. The transport is FREE, any contribution will go into the driver family fund and charity. In here you are talking about increasing Transport prices??

              <p>Hahaha, but bros, in most of europe especially the western side, every job is consider a professional, even a cleaner have dignity and respect, same as doctors and lawyers, their taxi drivers take pride and dignity in their job, in Swiss, there is a tiny basket at the back and in front for you to give tip as you wish, if you take their cab, which is mostly mercs, you can see the money on the basket, you can even take it, but it is for tipping, and the peoples are very gracious to take it as part of life, if that basket is in singapore cab, long gone liao</p>

              <p>We should not be misled by a few nice stories and think westerners are more generous and asians are more stingy. Asians may be generous but remain anonymous and westerners may be generous with a more public-relations (PR) driven twist, so people can get misled. These issues become crystal clear when you start driving private limousines or hotel limousines or even a chrysler. Asians slaughter animals using method A, whereas westerners slaughter animals using method B. In the end, the same animal gets slaughtered differently in different hands. People who tip as a habit simply have a better upbringing, its not because of their colour. To them if their little money can give immense joy to someone, it makes the effort worthwhile. If $10 can bring a smile to someone, these people think they got it at a discount. Why? Because you cannot simply slip a $10 note into anybody's hand and bring a genuine smile to their face. Happiness cannot be purchased, but if this little tip makes you happy, then they have bought something potentially costing more. You made somebody happy, congrats! Now think about how easy it is to offend someone. You think that small tip can so easily put a smile on an angry face?</p>
              <p>You may be misled to think taxi driving seems like a more respectable profession elsewhere, but hey take a moment and imagine an ang mo father proudly introducing his taxi driver son to a potential hot date. What transpires after this? Am I supposed to believe that a Miss America will want to hook up with my taxi driver son? I hope you get the basic idea. :) Some ideals in life dont change whether you live in Switzerland or Singapore. Its all about presentation. Here it is "tui lei lo mo" (using your mouth and your mind), but there it is "have a great day" (using their mouth but "tui lei lo mo" inside their mind).</p>

              <p>There are more lawyers, doctors, teachers, bankers and all other top professionals creating more crimes than TD,  crimes from sexual harrassement, rape, bribery, cheat, cons, misleading others, etc etc. Many TDs childrens are U graduate, some even with phd or master, if a so called hot gal love my son but because of me as a TD, she do not want it, is this call Love??

              <p>1) for personal matters such as meals/toilets, TDs choose an option that put the fare meter in "suspend" mood, meaning the display on top of taxi is off/blacked out.

              <p>2) when TDs get confirmed orders, the display on top will automatically go to "On Call". Once the fare meter is off, the display will revert. TDs can't change this option.</p>
              <p>3) Once fare meter is running, the display on top is changed to "busy". TDs can't change this option.</p>
              <p>4) For leaves/breakdowns, TDs have to input time/date into monitor to relay to HQ to put the fare meter into "sleeping" mode. And display on top will be "off".</p>
