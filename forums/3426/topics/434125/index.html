              <p>Ang moh wrote a post in today chinese newspaper complaining bad taxi services: At first say taxis are cheap in SIN and used to have good impression. But nowsdays cannot get taxi, call also dun have, go longer route and get stuck in jams (But the driver refunded him when he took him again the next day after he called to complain), send to wrong destinations, drivers not picking after interviewing etc.</p>

              <p>Actually it is true that when you want a cab desperately, high chance they are nowhere to be found. Even if a cab is found, there is always a risk that the cabby goes by a less preferred route. This is my personal experience even as a cabby. That is why I make it a point to treat fellow cabbies well, and tip them when I use their services. And I tell them nicely to go by a certain route that I like to use. It always works.</p>
              <p>I really cannot imagine people who would complain and even cheat cabbies. These people need to lose their jobs and be forced to drive a cab to understand that our money was earned through daily struggles.</p>

              From iTODAY:Cabbies still selective of passengers, despite warnings
              
              Letter from Peter Tay 04:45 AM Jul 09, 2011
              
              THURSDAY night was my third attempt to flag down a cab along Ganges Avenue. I waited for one from 10.15pm to 10.45pm and no fewer than 30 of them passed by. Many had their rooftop sign set to "busy" even though there were no passengers. Some actually switched from "available" to "busy" the moment they spotted me.
              
              One cab dropped off a passenger near me and waved me off even before I could approach him.Â 
              
              I went up to him anyway and he curtly said he needed to pick his brother up from the hospital. It did not sound as truthful as it was patronising.Â 
              
              It was only when I walked into a smaller lane that I managed to stop a cab, probably only because it did not have enough space to manoeuvre past me.Â 
              
              I queried the driver about the situation and he admitted that cab drivers get an additional S$3 by picking up passengers from town and, hence, avoid picking up anyone just beyond it.Â 
              
              When I had previously encountered the same situation, I called ComfortDelGro. The customer officer took the matter seriously, got back to me within a couple of days and said the relevant cab drivers had been warned and discouraged from being selective of passengers.Â 
              
              The cab driver who picked me up also said it was common for cab drivers to avoid picking up passengers just before midnight so they could benefit from the surcharge - a practice which is common knowledge among commuters.
              
              Such issues raise a huge question mark about the integrity of taxi drivers. If this is a matter of incorrigibility and no amount of persuasion or warning works, then it is obvious the relevant authorities should consider a different strategy.Â 
              
              For example, midnight charges could be staggered by 10-per-cent increments every 20 minutes so drivers would not be tempted to wait past midnight to earn that full 50-per-cent profit.

              I refer to the letter from Mr Peter Tay, "Cabbies still selective of passengers, despite warnings" (July 9). My family and I faced the same problem on Saturday, along Serangoon Avenue 3 at about 10.30pm.
              
              As with Mr Tay's experience, more than 20 empty taxis went past us with the sign "busy" turned on. It was anyone's guess that these cabbies were just waiting to profit from the midnight surcharge or for people to dial a cab.
              
              If this is happening in an area outside of town, I am sure it has become commonplace practice. It is ironic that the taxi service which is meant to transport passengers in the late hours could be manipulated by these errant drivers for their own selfish means.
              
              This would not reflect well on the standards of taxi services in Singapore. I urge the relevant authorities to look into the problem urgently and find a solution to put a stop to this before these errant cabbies give the country a bad reputation.

              From iTODAY:Vicious cycle of taxi surcharges, 'false' demand
              
              Letter from Lyn Tai | Jul 13, 2011 6:00 AM
              
              I REFER to the letters from Mr Peter Tay, "Cabbies still selective of passengers, despite warnings" (July 9) and Ms Chan Lai Ying, "Errant cabbies will give Singapore a bad reputation" (July 12).
              
              I fully agree with the writers and I strongly urge the relevant authority to consider scrapping the midnight and town-area surcharges, at the same time capping the phone booking surcharge to a maximum of S$1 irrespective of the time of booking.
              
              These surcharges have been the perennial problem as clearly some cabbies have exploited them to create a "false" demand which in turn leads to the justification of the endless extra charges by the taxi companies, with the passengers bearing all of the cost.
              
              If the surcharges are eliminated, those errant drivers who are perpetually "busy" cruising and waiting for phone booking and midnight charges will no longer have any incentive to do so.
              
              They will simply have to return to the basic and fair method of earning the fares, that is to pick up any passengers who flag them down.
