              i see this phenomenon differently.
              
              i read this as: First class city, third class taxi service...&gt;&gt;&gt; that is desperately in need of some tweaking to match First class city taxi needs!
              
              i remember one time i was at hawker centre. this about 10 years old boy complain to his mother he want to eat more after finishing one plate. but the mother slap him and tell him to keep quiet, one plate is enough. but i thought the 10 years old boy could be early maturing so he feels more hungry, its natural, but the mother choose to ignore him, sweeping his hunger his calls under the silent carpet. 
              
              now we face the same problem here. supply is not meeting demand the way demand expected it, so again of course its natural that things that can go haywire will go haywire.
              
              but i think i know why this industry is haywire. because taxi drivers can never rise up to become the management that can change the policy. and the management that has the power to change the policy will never find themselves driving taxi. so its like chicken leading the ducks. the blind leading the deaf.

              but there are 2 problems. 
              
              singapore customers are notorious and anxious for giving 'over enthusiastic feedback'. and singapore authorities are equally notorious and anxious for following up on those 'over enthusiastic feedback', whether they make sense or not. one Filipino who work in customer services here once told me he dont understand why customer service is so efficient until every rubbish also have to take in consideration. then that will create a situation for the customer service to become a rubbish truck, every minor issue that is not a problem will also become a problem. then the customer will think he will try his luck next time. so there will never be real progress because everyone spending so much time and energy focusing on the never ending rubbish.
              
              the 2nd problem is, not everyone who take taxi will understand the context of global economy. many frogs are only looking out of the well they are sitting in, so the sky they see above them is just one small patch of circle. some customers never own cars, they cant afford so they dont bother to find out the actual costs of car ownership and compare that with taxi pricing. some never been overseas, so they think local taxi VERY expensive. so those no car, no travel overseas taxi riders only know to compare cheaper bus and mrt services with taxi so of course they only see MORE, not less. they dont understand they should not compare apples with oranges. these are completely DIFFERENT forms of transport services, even though everything seems to conveniently fall under the main heading of Public Transport.

Is one of them, if u can afford it, than there will not be such a problem, take a bus? That might work for u, if a taxi stop for u, also complain, no taxi want to stop for u also complain, complain still comes in as wrong routes being used stuff like that. So don't complain, cannot get a cab, call for 1, cannot get from 1 company call another, taxi driver work everyday, mileage is equivalent to going KL everyday but with tons of traffic, no fixed route like bus, u think easy? Or u want to try? Taxi driver all robot? Some passenger also chose taxi, do u know?

              <p>In singapore, the so call first class "notion" is nothing but a motivation factor, it is so often use by govt and Lky both in his speech and even his books, it is a motivation factor to force you to move to a higher platform resulting having you paying higher cost of living. Fcuk the first class nation, in every first class nation, lower income pple suffered, only the top 30% enjoyed. I am not an advocate of not having a first class nation, the so called Swiss standard, but are we??? with the influx of no manner foreign workers/FTs who phui here and there and the way locals behaves at times, I often laugh over this so call first world notion with a Gst in it.</p>
              <p>Yes, it makes you feel great to live in a first class city, but are you getting first class treatment like the swiss? no, you are not, in fact, you have to pay and live in high inflation, meaning you are living on debt, TD are alway living on debts, debts of rental, debts of power supply, phone bills, etc etc. You can't guarantee if that $100 in your right pocket will be there tonite, welcome to the first world fcuking nation, it just a lame phrase. Nobody in this world said that we are first class, only our govt and ourselves, some pax even think we are part of china or malaysia? What first class are you talking about when you do not have first class pax??? so, we end up working damn hard to earn 3k++ per month pathetic first class paid?? you cannot call yourself handsome unless someone said so, got a Danish couple paxs even said, "Sorry, but I feel your peoples still need lots of graciousness and social etiquette to improve, not just having more ferraris or porsches on the road"</p>
