              <p>I drive in 2 eras, 90s and present, still make so many mistake. Can go wrong route to places I've been 100s of times.</p>
              <p>Can go wrong places to find pax, knowing full well these places are 'olland. Can kena cheat (this happened recently)</p>
              <p>So many other things, kena accident also, i actually knocked somebody down twice! Happened once in 1997 and again in 2010. (1997 not my fault, pax, Thai guy drunkard) who stopped when he saw my taxi and as i was passing him, he ran across. Lucky I was very slow. Those days go no hp, so i left to call ambulance, return to scene, the guy disappeared, I think illegal immigrant). In 2010, it was my fault, knocked someone down at traffic light, but again very slow speed,. Prepared to return my license, but in the end TP gave me a stern warning instead.</p>
              <p>Many drivers here have so much experience, some are way better than me in collection, some better in psychoing pax, even when they salah make the pax forgive them and like them. Some know which is best place at what time. Some know which company is good for what (Angwk is exceptional is methods of companies, as just 1 exmple). Some know other things like Poolman got alot, if he write here cannot finish.</p>
              <p>I know somethings better, maybe the Law but other things, this forum can give you a lot of insight, if you know when and where to look. Even newer drivers like Khoon and others sometimes come up with gems for us to learn.</p>
              <p>People give advise here not to show off, but to share. Nobody ask everyone to follow 100%, mix and match what suits you, but when they talk about certain things that you're clueless, the best advice I can give is to give what they say a try.</p>
              <p>If they recommend relief, got a lot of reason, why not try first. of course out of 100, maybe 5 or even 10 can succeed without the advise given, but most can't. So you know yourself better, can you make it? If can't, you don't need to see it as a challenge, go with the flow.</p>
              <p>Ok rant over, good luck.</p>
