              <p>STOMPer Lean feared for his wife and himself as the cab driver of his cab sped at 150km/h on the KPE, making the 19km route from Marina Bay Sands to Pasir Ris in only 13 minutes.<br><br>Google Maps states the distance from Marina Bay Sands to Pasir Ris via the Kallang Paya Lebar Expressway as 21km, which should take an average of 21 minutes. <br><br>According to the receipt provided by STOMPer Lean, he was picked up by the cab at 12.06am, and reached his destination at 12.19am, after travelling 18.5km. <br><br>The STOMPer recounts:<br><br>"My wife and I took a cab from MBS and arrived at Pasir Ris in a whooping 13 minutes! <br><br>"You can check my receipt for verification. <br><br>"Well, we had a ride of our lifetime.<br><br>"The cabby drove at almost 150kph inside the KPE tunnel, only slowing down twice to 80kph as we approached the speed camera.<br><br>"Why is this kind of dangerous driving allowed?"<br></p>

              <p>Sad to see such case.</p>
              <p>If I was the pax that night, Firstly, I will ask him to slow down to limited rd speed, and explain the consequences of speeding. 2ndly, I will also tell him politely that I will not allow anyone to put me and my family members' life at risk. 3rdly, if he ignore my advise, I will take down his details with my video and lodge a complain to LTA and his company.</p>

              <p><br>No , Sunday and Public holiday only , from 6am til 2359 , not even 24 hours .</p>
              <p>The rest follow CBD timing .</p>
              <p>I believe the trip also possible starting from RWS .</p>
              <p>So let TransCab and LTA investigate , no point posting on Stomp and voice their unhappiness .</p>
              <p>Let the satellite system's data base prove this driver is guilty .</p>
              <p>Because the satellite system will captured the pick up point and drop off point base on taxi number , time &amp; date on board and time &amp; date stamped for drop off .</p>

              You all don't know this driver was paid by the Formula1 committe to test whether they should include KPE as the F1 track? ;-p

              Although as fellow TD I don't want to break his rice bowl, but I do think that the streets in Singapore will be better of without drivers like him.
              
              Why you all are more interesting in the overcharging portion? Agreed with Pool that LTA is looking into overcharging more strictly than speeding, but this is where it is wrong. LTA should change their mindset and put safety at their priority. Haiz!
