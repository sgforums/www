              <p>First, all vehicles in singapore need an insurance inorder to be on the road, any accidents of whoever is right or wrong will be covered on the car, even if the whole car got missing.

              <p>A taxi got into an accident is an accident, neglience or pure accidental is not the issue, the excess of $2140 is covered, and that why you need a deposit of 2k+ by most companies.</p>

              <p>2nd, the insurance would had paid up thru the car repair workshop, but the taxi company still want to maximise their cost  for the lost hours, depreciation and so on to their asset, and therefore hope that by pressuring you thru their unprofessional credit collector, they can get back some ROI.</p>

              <p>@TS, I'm so sorry if my wording cause you some distress.</p>
              <p>This thread will interest me due to the fact that a taxi company was chasing a poor TD for 10 over thousand of damages due to negligence? Which I never encounter and heard before.</p>
              <p>So far in our history, no taxi drivers been file bankruptcy by a taxi company, correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
              <p>So maybe bro Bowah can address your concern more clearly than I do.</p>
              <p>With minimum detail on your thread, is as good as making us guess, so if you can't accept things that we guess, so be it.</p>
              <p>Anyway, wish you good luck again, will still pursue your encounter closely and quite interested to know the outcome.</p>

              <p>Would suggest you call them and negiotate nicely a bit. What court case? End up if you lose, you have to LL pay legal costs and the expensive repair bills.</p>
              <p>Usually for engine overheat, the engine overheat warning light will be on and the engine must be stopped IMMEDIATELY! Then wait for engine to cool down, try to top up some water and then crawl back to workshop with eyes constantly on the lookout for the warning light en route.</p>
              <p>Further, the onus is on the user (driver) to prove that he had taken due care and not cause the overheat in the first place.</p>
              <p>My previous crown's engine also overheated without my knowledge (warning light did not come on) and had to be overhauled. Partly my fault not checking engine for coolant level and oil leak regularly and relying too much on the warning light.</p>
              <p>Luckily the overheat was caused by a blown cylinder head gasket. Engine totally without lubricating oil! CDG mech quickly helped me top up some water and I was not required to pay for the repair (easily thousands)!</p>

              <p>But base on the servicing records, it is not cabby negligence, for nothing, who want to keep going into servicing and waste time??? TS is trying to solve the problem, whereever there is a temp rising,  a mechanic will check all liquid levels and leakage, thermostat, the cooling channels (for choking) and the electrical box fuses the exhaust channel, the catalyst pipe and the engine sound, once sound is out of scope, most likely an internal crack had happen, this can be cause by previous accident or impact, and from prolong driving, it had reach it limitation and the crack open up leading to debris in combustion damaging the piston, spindles and liner.</p>
              <p>The liner is the one that determine you vehicle CC, from 1.8 to 2.0 cc.</p>
              <p>The heart of the engine is the crankshaft, once crack, good luck</p>

              <p>Taxi company should have been more fair and tried to discuss the issue with TS. Instead of pushing all the blame and driving up the cost of repair on him.</p>
              <p>Repair can cost over 10k ah? Got any outside assessor to look at it, or just their own workshop costs, which include brand new parts, worker charge etc?</p>
              <p>Got take into account wear and tear, whether previous repairs was done proeprly? Can suka suka charge brand new?</p>
              <p>The court doesn't work that way. The court if it ever goes there, will look at all this issue. Even if got contract, the court won't necessarily accept. An unfair contract will not be given much weight. Did the company take steps to educate it's driver, did it conduct proper training for its mechanics? Were repairs done were sufficient? Were repair costs kept to a minimum? Were additional unfair charges laid in? In non accidental damage, what is the liability of a driver? What percenatge of blame?</p>
              <p>Got a lot of factors one. This is not like you owe singtel for use of your phone and refuse to pay. There's a wear and tear issue and a liability issue. Cannot be driver is 100% liable. You rent a car and the car breaks down, will you pay the rental company all the repair charge? Which normal layman will agree?</p>
              <p>Worse case is that this case will go to abritration and the Tribunal will acccess liability and propose a % of liability. Even then both parties can choose contest it.</p>
              <p>That's why the company after so many years never straight away sue in court, they trying other means to 'hung' driver and recover costs. Anyway all companies have write off account. The cab wasn't written off and was subsequently re-rented out. Cost of repair would have been easily recouped.</p>

              <p>I need to say I'm really touched by all our fellow TDs that came into my thread and commented, but pls do not start to quarel and leave any bad feeling among each other. Afterall, everyone is trying to help me to the best of their knowledge/ experience.</p>
              <p>I posted for advice/ help here, becos I need to know about the procedures one need to do to sue someone, what they can or cannot do. What will happen if I file for bankruptcy, how long will it take to write off, and things I can't do as a bankrupt.</p>
              <p>I'm not here to discuss about whether I'm right or at fault for the negligence part on over-heating and did it directly 
              cause the engine to be damaged and is the cost of repair justifyable. 
              The only way is to let the court decide on the amount if me and the taxi
               co. does not come to a agreement.  Not me, not the taxi co. and definitely not anyone here..</p>
              <p>After all the private messages from some forumers, I finally got a better picture. because out of no where got stunt by that caller claiming to be the court and going to freeze my a/c and asset.</p>
              <p>Then lastly, if I cannot afford to pay up, bankruptcy will be one option.</p>

              <p>Nobody can be charge bankrupt without a proceeding that fully determine that you owe others a sustaintial credit (money) and that you admit that you are at fault and unable to service the credit at the moment.</p>
              <p>When I rent out my flat to a couple from malaysia, after a few days, they told me my front gate and 1 toilet tap were damaged, I went to have a look, knock knock and fix fix here and there, then off to drive my casket van. A few days later, this good couple told me one of the gate collapsed, now no gate, just the door. I went back at nite after driving to take a look, knn, the hinges really give way, poor workmanship.</p>
              <p>The next day, I go around looking for repairer and end up, having to fork out $350 for a simple cheap new gate including fitting at Sye alwi road, so I take it. Am I going to ask the tenant to pay for it???</p>

              <p>definitely playing chicken with you.</p>
              <p>contracted co will try squeeze $ from you. Whatever you give they happy cause they most likely eat 60-70% of the $ as payment. They don't receive any payment from co for taking this case.</p>
              <p>Our court no call you, its just bluffing.</p>
              <p>Unlikelyhood cheong to court. but if do, just point to their servicing which is always dragged out.</p>
              <p>renting from same rail co as you did. my sampan every month since day 1 get 1 clutch failure, must tow back guaranteed. can't give back cause 6 month contract.</p>
              <p>so wait for accident to happen if clutch fail at high speed. hold onto repair sheets to protect onself. its good if you still hold on the sheets, if not don't matter much.</p>
              <p>like somebody else say, judge see contract will see its biased and whatever doubts you raise will be seen favourably, if it ever goes tat way.</p>
              <p>but seriously, until now never see taxi co sue td. think what that will do to their reputation?</p>
              <p>look at smart and prime. fucked up until now because of what they did, no good td wants to go to them. </p>
