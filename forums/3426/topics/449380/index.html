              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>About
               2 years ago, me and one taxi company has a disputatable amount that has
               yet to settle. More than $10k for repair cost on the engine chasis and 
              they insisted it's my negligence.</p>
              <p>Today, I received a private 
              no. caller stating from baliff dept of sub-court and will be exercising a
               summon to freeze my bank a/c and my house items.</p>
              <p>When I tried to 
              find out more from the caller refuse to disclose more only giving me a 
              phone no. to call to find out more if I wish to.</p>
              <p>It turn out to be a company representing this Taxi co.</p>
              <p>It was a very brief and rush conversation as the party seems unwillingly to disclose much info.</p>
              <p>As
               I mentioned earlier, due to the huge amt involved and I do not agree on
               the word "Negligence" I'm prepare to go to court if they wish to and 
              let the Judge decides.</p>
              <p>The thing is, Does anyone here knows 
              can the taxi company request for a court order to freeze my assets 
              before hearing, if they are taking me to court to recover their 
              "so-call" outstanding amount owed to them?</p>
              <p>Or does it sounds more like a "Chicken" game made by their own collection dept or some collection agencies?</p>
              <p>Would really appreciate if anyone have any knowledge on simillar situation to advice me.</p>

              <p>As Ang said need more details. But from you write, it appears that bankruptcy proceedings have been taken against you. Bankruptcy is for amounts above 10k only.</p>
              <p>They will only freeze your account, actually cancel it, in civil cases, if you are declared a bankrupt by a court not a baillif or any other parties.</p>
              <p>Bankruptcy order not so cincai one, gotta publish in the papers, serve you a writ, and ask you attend court (if you don't go judgment can be passed in your absence). In short ample warning will be given. Plus you will need to declare everything you have in list by the OA, ( I know after judgment definitely have, forget about before whether got, I think have). If you fail to declare you will then commit an offence, a fine or jail depending on the level of ignorance or disregard of the order.</p>
              <p>And when there is order to seize property, this will be done by a bailiff, I think the other party or his rep can attend. But the bailiff will only for a start place a seal on your items, you cannot dispose of them after the seal is affixed. After returning to court with a list of assets of yours then only will it be seized or sold at an aution. Sometimes, the bailiff will bring would be buyers along and they will buy direct at your house. The money collected will go to the court to be paid to your creditors.</p>
              <p>However, the bailiff cannot seal anything that isn't yours. So if you family members can justify or have receipts that certain things are theirs, the court won't seize them. If really got such an order, you can check with either the High Court or Sub Court registry to verify this, I suggest you put all expensive things in your house in 1 room and say this belongs to your tenant, of course you may need to find a 'tenant', use your imagination.</p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>But I think the caller is definitely from the other party, the bailiff would never call a bankrupt or debtor to alert them when he's coming.</p>
              <p>But that's a long way to go. There has to be a lawsuit or claim against you in court in the first place. Even that starts only with a letter of demand from the insurance or other party's lawyer, which you can ignore. Only when it goes to court, then you must go and challenge the suit and argue your case.</p>
              <p>But the court also prefers mediation and will ask both parties to try and settle. In the mean time, you should go find out about their claim. What was the result of the TP investigation? What about your excess and liability? Maybe you should get a lawyer to examine all this and advise, if it goes to court or already has. Or if really you think you cannot fight and win, then you should try to bring the amount down below 10k, to avoid a bankruptcy proceeding.</p>
              <p>Maybe pay some first to bring it down, but don't sign anything agreeing to an amount above 10 k that you will pay. Eg: Amt is 11k, you pay $1,500 first, they take, but you admit to owing 11k and agree to pay this amt. Like that means you still owed 11k to begin with and they can start bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
              <p>This are just some things, but hard to advise with so little facts.</p>

              <p>Really thankyou for Angwk7118, JoeRaj &amp; Poolman for your reply...</p>
              <p>Poolman knows the story, he was with me when I started as a TD, can count as
                  half my mentor...</p>
              <p>They went thru credit collector internally and outsource, for almost one
                  year no news liao, thought they finally dig out their heart and close the case,
                  now comes again...</p>
              <p>The claim was for my negligence for overheating and damaged the engine
                  chasis.</p>
              <p>The thing is, it wasn't a new taxi, the taxi I took over is already a 3 yr
                  old taxi and had quite a few problems just after my first month servicing, and
                  the incident happened just after two days when I collected it from the workshop
                  for some other issues.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it's a long story...</p>
              <p>So for now got no choice but mentally prepare to fight it out in court, but
                  need to know what's my rights and the legal procedure so as not to let them
                  "hunk" me...</p>
              <p>And also when the time is right, I'll make sure people will know abt this...</p>

              <p>if you go attend court, just as joeraj has say, don't sign anything.</p>
              <p>try make some payment,</p>
              <p>one case i have  is  big company , not a taxi company . is F&amp;N coca-cola , agreement to pay installment, after 1st installment, no further payment from me laio. year 2005 case,  SP services,  owe few $k , make partial payment, than i no news for payment again - 2007 case,   ERA - 2009  about 11k,  only pay them 1kplus, after that i also no payment further until now,  income insurance 2010 till now, still trying to ask me for payment for the accident excess, they have change few debt collection company so far, none can do anything about it. big company does not mean they can eat you, singtel since year 2000 till now, M1 since 2011 till now</p>
              <p>i cannot say you ignore like me, everyone case is different, i dare cos i ever study business law in late 90s, the lecturer who is a lawyer taught lots of useful things like all this case, like how to have contract void even you sign etc.  so my behaviour is different.  even my existing premium, before i return to drive their taxi, i actually owe them rental when i left and never paid them a single for nearly 14months before i go back and still able to drive as hirer</p>
              <p>i will PM my number to you, can always call and discuss, without a better picture to advise is very dangerous, wish can be of a help to you but not (HAI) you</p>
              <p>take care good luck</p>

              <p>This are credit busters' companies, they go after those still having a case and hopefully can get some credit back, they are legal business entity, whatever money they can get, the companies contracted them will give them certain percentage, other than that, they get nothing, fark care them.</p>
              <p>And there is no way people can freeze your stuff without going thru a proper hearing, you think what?? emperor laws? You can make a police report for harassement first.</p>
              <p>If it is as per what you said about taxi repair, what is there to pay, taxi is covered by insurance, what you might lost is your deposit, other than that, why need to pay 10k and all these nonsense.</p>
              <p>It is definitely a chicken game, while digging out old file, they spot on this case, and try if possible to take some money out of you.</p>

                  <p><br>not asking to play hide and seek, at least i never have to do that, just a little disturbing at time, what we need to do here is to see if the bill is justify or not, no doubt.</p>
                  <p>Some i know their style, cannot play play, they like to use lawyer which some ex td has kena, but doesn't mean they can just charge and bill everything to td like that .</p>
                  <p>Pay the amount which is deem fair, doesn't happen to you so you don't feel it. just hope we guys can give morale support. </p>

              Just 2 cents count.
              
              Owe money and refuse to pay, in layman term we call "chao kah".
              
              Money rightfully not owe, use all means to protect oneself.
              
              So question is? Is the money rightfully owe? Only TS himself will know.

              <p>Like Onewaytransfer mentioned, "Is the money rightfully owe??" That's why I rather go for a court hearing and let the judge decide.</p>
              <p>But meanwhile, I just need to know my rights if they're trying to play punk with me...</p>

              <p>But basically the rule here in Singapore is:</p>

              Sorry I could not provide you the genuine advice, if just depend on the little details provided by TS.
              
              Bro JoeRaj is right, civil matter is not a criminal matter.
              
              But looking at those bankruptcy file on ST everyday, not difficult to find out all kinds of proceeding from all kinds of industries.
              
              The law say anything above $10k, you are subjected for bankruptcy.
              
              So if genuinely you had owe this amount from a taxi company, without acknowledging it, or even endorse it, how the company will proceed with the filing???
              
              Debt collection might be the first step leading to civil suit. 
              
              Unless you required a answer to"escape"this mess, than sorry, I could not provide you any help.
              
              Those ideas provided by some forummers here is to play punk with authority by coming out some stunt which ultimately these companies might just write off as bad debts.
              
              But bear in mind, think of your children and your families, you don't want them to suffer in future due to your irresponsible act towards your own debt. (or maybe should put it as liability.)
              
              From your thread, is been 2 years since this matter been bring up, what have you done or just simply ignored it and waiting for miracle to happen which don't happen now.
              
              Good luck, Bro, wish everything going right for you in near future.
