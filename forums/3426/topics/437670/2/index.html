              <p><br> it seems like i am not alone when i saw this post since some time
              ago, even when i put busy or hand sign no thank you, i still have
              pax opening door and offering to pay special to certain places.
              sometime its the male partner of a couple, sometimes its a lady,
              but mostly foreigners, locals very few. some of the usual is like
              $20 to LPS or club st or amara, or CQ or mandarin or hilton. some
              of the highest i ever came across is like $40 to airport after peak
              hours. some others will ask for a price. i think this is quite
              common in other countries, maybe asia. at first i quite paiseh.
              dont know how to say. then after those other offers i start to have
              an idea where is how much value. until now quite a few times if the
              pax will accept, we will get there they will pay up no problem.
              some of them still smiling and happy like fark. i thinking this is
              just like normal business practice just simple market supply and
              demand, whats wrong if willing buyer willing seller what. secretly
              i still waiting the $50 durian drop, i wonder what will it be like

              <p><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Guess beside Japan, we here in singapore have the best taxi fare system, very transparent and yet well honored by all. You guys want to mess it up, by all means, then you will end up like those 3rd world cities, or even our nearest JB, before every boarding, you hv to negotiate and end up giving yrself a bad name.</p>
              <p>Let us not go into any kind of flat rate practices, it will only makes us a fool and cheapsake, dangling a $50 like a carrot and we become the rabbit hopping on it, then end up this ang mos or foreigners laughing at us in their drinking session. Someone would had taught him to wave that $50, cos they know beggars will come. Foreigners or FTs willingness to paid higher price is also because to them, our fare is cheapsake comparing with 1st world Taxis. And as the disparity of the rich and poor widened, you can see 2 types of paxs, one that is so careful with the road and fares, the other can even give you tips or negotiate a flat rate with you.</p>
              <p>We should take pride in our decent job, tips is acceptable, but not a flat rate fares. When we do thing, we need to take a bigger look before doing it, the so called marco view or eagle view, you get a better picture of what you are doing is right or wrong, if you just look at it individually at a micro view, then you are doing the whole taxi industrial less favourable.</p>

              <p>Guess we should take tips and flat rate as a different issue here, flat rates is consider a one time off offer by pax or TD, it is consider touting under the law. Tips is different, it is an offer for your service between you and the pax transaction issue.</p>
              <p>The issue is, if everyone is to take flat rates, then we are kiling our own industrial, and pax will be complaining here and there and some even may laugh at us because we can be easily bought over by a piece of blue bill. Of course for individual self thought, a $50 dangling is a good income, but learn to thinking the big picture, out of the box, once you are able to step out of the box, look at it from view outside your cab, you can see what you are doing can be harmful to the taxi industrial in a long run, of course, LTA or whatever Tp is not going to bother about you picking up a dangling $50 pax, it is you, your responsibility to uphold your profession. If that is the case, not long, you will see paxs dangling money on the road for taxis. The highest take it all.</p>
