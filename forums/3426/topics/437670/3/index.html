              <p>It's hard to resist a dangling $50 temptation for a $15 trip to airport. I confess I just did that about a week ago.10 pm friday night along Grange Road.</p>
              <p>He was willing and I willingly accept. I took his $50, started the meter. So long I have reason to support my action, it's fine with me.The remainingly is his willing tips.</p>
              <p>Cabbies on the road, just like any other professions, is trying to make as much money as possible from other people in an acceptable and reasonable manner.</p>
              <p>As long as we don't approach to suggest, its fine. It has little to do with damaging the image of the common taxi industry.</p>

              I know you are one heck of a damn good driver. Not many in lv can match you, 
              However, i feel you can still better utilise your limo status. Go ask your senior Mercabs lah

              I agree with you if someone offer you, you shouldn't refuse. However TD must remember this thing happens only once in a blue moon. We cannot expect this to happen all the time. Or worse, we get frustrated when it doesn't happen and start soliciting.</p>
