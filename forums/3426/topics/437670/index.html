                              <p>juz now when my pax alighted at Queen St Bus Station, a pax
              approached me, wanting to go Pasir Ris urgently. I told him sorry.
              I need to go into CBD to pick as there is a $6 diff (I told him
              honestly pointing to the traffic light just ahead of us!)</p>
              <p>To my surprise, he offered $6 in addition to meter. wtf? Dun
              wait liow.. took him to PR. That's why I came home early

              it seems like i am not alone when i saw this post
              
              since some time ago, even when i put busy or hand sign no thank you, i still have pax opening door and offering to pay special to certain places. sometime its the male partner of a couple, sometimes its a lady, but mostly foreigners, locals very few.
              
              some of the usual is like $20 to LPS or club st or amara, or CQ or  mandarin or hilton. some of the highest i ever came across is like $40 to airport after peak hours. some others will ask for a price. i think this is quite common in other countries, maybe asia.
              
              at first i quite paiseh. dont know how to say. then after those other offers i start to have an idea where is how much value. until now quite a few times if the pax will accept, we will get there they will pay up no problem. some of them still smiling and happy like fark.
              
              i thinking this is just like normal business practice  just simple market supply and demand, whats wrong if willing buyer willing seller what. secretly i still waiting the $50 durian drop, i wonder what will it be like :)

              <p>Very few normal cabbies will accept flat fare even if offered. It is my own experience.</p>
              <p>I came back from Malaysia holiday with my family. Total 6 pax plus luggage landed at Queen Street early in the morning and needed to go back. Blue yellow cab dont want my business. See us also scared. I fully understand. So I asked a red fire engine cabby to help me. I say wont sabo him and will pay 8 + meter. Heng ah the cabby smiled and let us in. Transcab wish cabbies are a special breed. This act of breaking LTA law in order to help the passenger is called super excellent service. Too bad I cannot write in and praise the cabby.</p>

              we TDs always at losing end if pax complain 4 nothing n for sometin when even we r not at fault !!! cos those ple at LTA or a "great" company call Comfort wil put everytin on record when pax complain against a TD......
              
              u mk a false police report, u can b charge............
              
              even when LTA n Comfort find out tat the complaint against u is false or u r nt at fault, wil they tk action against the pax? NO !!!
              
              alot of Sporeans anyhow complain against ple workin in service industry cos sometimes they really have nothing else better to do n/or they jus wan 2 get back at u 4 a samll tin tat mk them unhappy........
              
              like at a restaurant, small tin happen, they always "I wan 2 complain u, i wan 2 see yr manager !"
