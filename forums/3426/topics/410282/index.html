              <p>I pick up a Malay uncle pax besides commonwealth MRT going to Boon Lay MRT. So after he board my cab and say boon lay mrt, he busied himself on the phone with his wife.</p>
              <p>So think maybe I can go south bouna vista rd=&gt;AYE=&gt;Jln Boon Lay... When I reach AYE and he put his phone down, he said I should have gone straight (using commonwealth road) instead of turning to South Bouna vista Road!!! And began to dig out his TVDL to show me!.. threatening me saying he can complain me! Saying he is in a hurry and I took a longer route!! Told him sorry, new driver, and he just kept on shouting stupid blah blah blah...</p>
              <p>I ask him by wat time must he reach Boon Lay MRT. Pick up time was 4.57pm. He said nevermind wat time he have to reach. He is in a hurry! and kept rumbling about he being a TD and i should ask him which way to go n not just go my way.</p>
              <p>I apologised that i'm wrong without asking him. and he just kept on blah blah blah...</p>
              <p>OK! Fed up liao!</p>
              <p>I just ram the sonata at 140km/h all the way until i reach Boon Lay MRT at 5.02pm. 5mins! when reach he ask me how much. Meter shows $11.20, I ask him to pay just how much he usually pay. He say usually abt $7-$8. I took $7.</p>
              <p>So Is there such TD ard? Wat would you do... If next time i pick such pax again.. I'll sure stop by the expressway and drag him out of the cab.</p>

              <p>sandisct,</p>
              <p>Just a few pointers.</p>
              <p>No need to apologise for this because you did not go merry go round. When you apologise, pax will eat u up and squeeze discount from u.</p>
              <p>Next time remember to ask pax how they want to go to destination. If they say up to you, then go by fastest way, but pax can still find fault with you. So be prepared to argue with them. The only way to win is to win by debating skills. They want to talk cock, you win by talking bigger cock with them. At the end of the day, as long as u did not overcharge, and went by the fastest way, even if they complain, you will not be penalised.</p>
              <p>Dont ever speed at 140km/h unless you know what you are doing. No excuse if TP catches u.</p>

              <p>The other night took one eat Katang Malay lady from CQ to Woodlands at 11.45pm, took her own sweet time talking to her friend before boarding my cab then later told me pls hurry up rushing for time, throughout the whole journey keeps telling the same thing and I was already travelling at 100-110 km/hr along CTE and SLE. You think she really rushing for time meh? More like dun want to pay midnite charges lah... PUI!!!</p>

              <p>But pls think... the GPS only either can choose the shortest time or shortest distance. So how to judge if heavy traffic or accident along the route? Unless you subscribe to live traffic condition then I'll say you're 100% correct...</p>

              to show me!.. threatening me saying he can complain me! Saying he
              is in a hurry and I took a longer route!! Told him sorry, new
              driver, and he just kept on shouting stupid blah blah blah...</p>
              <p>I ask him by wat time must he reach Boon Lay MRT. Pick up time
              was 4.57pm. He said nevermind wat time he have to reach. He is in a
              hurry! and kept rumbling about he being a TD and i should ask him
              which way to go n not just go my way.</p>
              <p>I apologised that i'm wrong without asking him. and he just kept
              on blah blah blah...</p>
              <p>OK! Fed up liao!</p>
              <p>I just ram the sonata at 140km/h all the way until i reach Boon
              Lay MRT at 5.02pm. 5mins! when reach he ask me how much. Meter
              shows $11.20, I ask him to pay just how much he usually pay. He say
              usually abt $7-$8. I took $7.</p>
              <p>So Is there such TD ard? Wat would you do... If next time i pick
              such pax again.. I'll sure stop by the expressway and drag him out
              of the cab.</p>
              <p>FARKER!!!</p>

              <p>Bros here, pls don't get emotional &amp; vent your frustration while driving.</p>
              <p>Always think of your loved ones waiting at home.</p>
              <p>Going at 140/km will book yourself a session with the judge with at least a $1,000 fine if got caught.</p>
              <p>What happen if accident happen?? $$$ is gone!!</p>
              <p>I know it's difficult but frankly speaking I don't get annoy by paxs who says they are rushing &amp; I took the long route.</p>
              <p>At the end of the trip, I will still collect full fare &amp; if they need a receipt just print for them.</p>
              <p>Anyway, from Commonwealth MRT to Boon Lay MRT, the route you took or the route pax want is the same to me. One w/o traffic light &amp; one with many lights along Clementi.</p>
              <p>For me, if paxs did not indicate preferred route, it's my call.</p>
              <p>So next time take a deep breathe &amp; cool down. Cheers!</p>

              <p>There is another trick pax can pull to get discount. Usually taxi cheats have been taking taxis for a long time, and already know the exact route from point A to B. But when they board the taxi, they like to pretend like they do not know the best way to their destination. Then taxi uncle ask and they ask the uncle for his opinion. Bullshit ok. This is the kind of cheebye pax I am always watching out for. Already know the best route, but trying to trick me. They think they are some tester is it? At the end of the journey, they quiz you and ask why you never go by this way, much faster. And if you go by the faster way, they say why dont you go by that way, much shorter. I always try to suss out the pax, and if they belong to this category, I will not hesitate to give them the loudest fuck of their life. They will get the worse shit treatment from me. Cheebye tricks to find excuse to pay less. No mercy from me.</p>
