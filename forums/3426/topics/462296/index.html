              <p>If no claim then no need report cos sound like minor incident.</p>
              <p>See all the crown and cedric on road with little dents here and there? all waiting to hand back key and scrap vehicle so no need pay anything. Within 2 years no more crown or cedric in SIN.</p>
              <p>SMRT got good and bad just like any other taxi co.</p>

              about tds driving smrt vehicle and kena ask to pay is no news stories at this forum
              
              the point i see is that TS himself may not even admit it is his fault at the point of accident
              
              i have post comment and advise about incident for  accident and where tds must be able
              
              to access the accident before deciding to report it or not in this forum.
              
              aso this does not happen to smrt only but also other taxi company which has been
              
              mention. very hard to miss such thread here, only if anyone bother to read and believe
              
              not very case maybe true but it does really happen on this accident excess issue
              
              i myself driving taxi has involved in 3 accident and i choose to make outside settlement
              
              which was cheaper than paying excess
              
              when accident happen, cool down determine who fault, if cannot define on the spot can 
              
              exchange particluar and contact number to allow time to decide, unless very serious
              
              damage and repair cost deem too high or there is injuries to some party, then reporting
              
              and pay excess is the only choice

              <p>Indeed, this is the risk for driving old Taxi, esp those near scrap date.</p>
              <p>what i hear is $3500 for write off case, from a past victim.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You do not need to take their words, it's will never be fair on you. Go and consult a lawer, see what he can help you.</p>
              <p>Do not afraid of spending money on lawer, it may not be that costly as you think. And lawer owe you the responsibility of your best interest, that include your spending on him.</p>
