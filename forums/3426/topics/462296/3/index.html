            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>To foolsh, I have this advice:</p>
              <p>Be very careful about engaging a lawyer in order to take SMRT to court.</p>
              <p>Unless the lawyer someone you know well, I would consider any advice he gives varefully. They might say, ya,ya, you got good chance, let's proceed to court.</p>
              <p>This is Singapore not the US, you go to court, you have to pay legal fees upfront, no such thing as minus from the winnings. And if you lose, you will likely have to pay the the other parties legal fees and whatever damages.</p>
              <p>Don't forget a court case is very taxing, a lot of preparation is needed, so a lot of time is gonna be wasted. Are you really up for this? The long haul.</p>
              <p>Next also consider before writing to the press (that's if it gets published).</p>
              <p>Dont make this a big issue until you really have to. You force their hand into defending themselves by going this route, and they have or can afford to lose, can you?</p>
              <p>The best at this stage is negotiate, try to make some arrangements or compromise. Or as some put it, write the 1k deposit and take this as a lesson learnt.</p>
              <p>They can't force you to pay 2.5k, they can't bankrupt you for this, at the most just send lawyer letters of demand, which can be ignored.</p>
              <p>The lesson to learn here is always take time to consider the options after some trouble, like an accident. Don't rush to report, even if you are in the right. Reporting takes much time and can go both ways. Even if you think you're right, the other party might actually lie in their report, and TP will just either ignore the report or summon 1 or both drivers.</p>
              <p>There is no big issue or specific law that you must report an accident in 24hours, except in cases of injury. Even then it can also depend on whether compensation was given and taken. I hit a pedestrian, settled with him, later he make a report. TP write to me 3 months later and ask me to report (thru Comfort). I lodged a report, in the end also nothing happened. TP gave me a warning (because no injury and the pedestrian had taken compensation but of course later wanted more). I just paid the $1000 excess and am now waiting for to get it back (or part of it). But I'm not presurising them, letting things the normal course.</p>
              <p>Also somebody hit me, something like your case. We ding dong back and forth and finally he agreed to pay. Why? Because I knew I was right. When you're right, reporting 1 week later or 1 month later doesn't make a difference, as long as you have the facts and photos of damages. But why didn't I report? Because of the time involved. But if he did, then no choice I must, but his excess a lot, and I suspected he wouldn't, win or lose he has to pay tht and his yearly premium would go up.</p>
              <p>Take this as a lesson, after an accident, follow the correct steps, if injured party involved attend to them, call ambulance etc. If not exchange particulars, take pictures and then negotiate. Unless severe damage, no need to involve company.</p>

              <p>Of course can lah, they are not unlicensed or illegal money lenders or acting for them. They are chasing a 'legal debt' or a debt not illegal under the law. As long they don't breach the peace, or cause annoyance to the public at large, the Police will not deal with it.</p>
              <p>Eg; Once someone own my friend money, so he went to the debtor's house in the early morning and bang the door. The debtor call the police, my friend answer simple, 'Sir this block got so many house, why I only knock this door? Because only he owe me money. The Police also LL cannot do anything just advise to keep noise down or take civil action.</p>
              <p>Of course the debtor can also refuse to pay or open the door, my freind also lan lan.</p>
              <p>For TS and others, don't worry about about these 'legal debts', in Singapore as long you don't owe Ah Long, the other debts or so called debts, all can take a queue number.</p>
              <p>Even you owe Govt money (as long not a fine under any law), say income tax or whatever similar, even as a bankrupt. The govt is not going to hound you like Ah Long. Yes they may make things difficult for you, deny your application for license or whatever, or cut off some things like power (if you owe PUB). But you won't go to jail just because you don't have any money to pay (unless as i said, it's rule under law like conservancy charges, there is a law for that).</p>
              <p>Only Ah Long you have to worry because of the trouble they will cause you and your neighbours.</p>

Now they declare TL $2500 for own vehicle, diffrence$1.5K. All these don't need to pay so fast one, drag for years. Later U look back its sup sup water.

              <p>tats why before join any taxi co, do homework and read up about them in the forum.</p>
              <p>Take the road less travelled, it becomes easier after a while.</p>
              <p>I neither support nor condone SMRT though I'm their former hirer, now relief. Go in with your eyes wide open. No point crying after spill milk.</p>
