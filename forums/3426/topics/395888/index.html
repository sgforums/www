              <p>Hi Bros and Shifu,</p>
              <p>Don't know why but feeling very tired after driving for less then 2 months. Pathetic right?</p>
              <p>Sometime before starting my shift already feel like not driving. It's not that I can't bring home a decent income. Income is a lot more than what I expected. But seems that it can't motivate me.</p>
              <p>Am I not having enough rest???? Please advise.</p>
              <p>My daily timings:</p>
              <p>Reached home in JB at 7 a.m</p>
              <p>Bath and breakfast, sleep around 7.45 a.m.</p>
              <p>Wake up at around 2.15 pm. Had lunch then go to SG at 3 p.m.</p>
              <p>Collect taxi around 5 to 5.15 p.m. then drive non-stop till 4.15 a.m. ( Of course I do stop for a leak ) Wash car, pump petrol and handover.</p>
              <p>Presently rest on Wed and Sun. But Wed rest day only sleep after 12 noon till 5 p.m.(bo pian family commitment)</p>
              <p>This week I am trying out a new schedule. Resting on Wed and Thur. Maybe this way is better.</p>
              <p>I have notice that my mood affect my daily income. Like last Thur, eve of Good Friday drive till 10 p.m. just gave up and went home. I was so tired.</p>

              <p>bro are u forcing yourself too hard on earning money, like setting your daily target too high???</p>
              <p>For me i work 6 and half day. Tus-Sun i work full shift target 200-220 then i stop. ofcos friday and sat i set 300. Monday i half day.</p>
              <p>Maybe i not like u with family commitment, housing loan or any other things to pay. But bro don't pressures yourself too much. When time to relax take a break. There still tomorrow to earn.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also non stop but till 12 am, i will find some things to eat call pool,kom,83 or thomas to tcss and relax relax. U also can find a place to Q for pax and relax at the same time.</p>

              <p>Bro FT,</p>
              <p>I understand your meaning but, I don't have the luxury like you can stop and go home sleep.</p>
              <p>The earliest bus from sg to jb is 5.40 a.m.</p>
              <p>Since rental is paid then might as well drive till 4 a.m. then stop. That's is also one reason why I rest 2 days in a week.</p>
              <p>I think the problem is I spilt of my rest day. Rest like no rest at all. So, now I am testing resting 2 day together.</p>
              <p>Nice to hear from you. Been missing you guys after the last gathering.</p>

              <p>respect you bro, what you are doing is not easy! your schedule is very tiring. why don't you try rest sunday and monday, use the rest of the days to maximize your profits. you sleep after 7 and wake up at 2pm sure tired man. it may affect your consistency.</p>
              <p>i normally reach my target by 12am or latest by 1am, reach home by 1:30am still can do a bit of work. for fri and eve, will drive a bit later depending on mood. next morning wake up by 11am so shiok. haha.</p>

              <p>Arrange to rest on these 2 days. You may want to try sleeping in a totally dark room without a single ray of light. Use dark coloured cloth to cover over your windows and use a sleeping mask too. This will improve the quality of sleep, according to experts.</p>
              <p>If you don't reject chinese medicine, may try ginseng capsule.</p>

              <p>I think the biggest problem is my commitment to my family, which is my wife.</p>
              <p>I should have gone straight to sleep on my rest day instead of bringing her out for breakfast. cos in such way I totally stress out myself. Come to think about it, from the time I wake up at 2 p.m. the day before till I sleep after going out with my wife is a total of 22 hours. I think machine also cannot take it.</p>
              <p>It is great to have all you bros and shifu to talk to. Now I know what is wrong with me. Everyday so tired, my mind can't think well. I kept thinking I already rest 2 days every week but why still not enough. Ha Ha. Now I know.</p>
              <p>Thanks guys. Owe you one.</p>

              <p>if u r tired, its dangerous driving, endangering yourself, your passengers and other road users.</p>
              <p>if you are tired, why dun park in a car park and rest for 30 mins to 1 hour. sleep longer like 30 more mins or another 1 more hour. I think some rests is better than no rests at all.</p>

              <p>Pntc70, hope u rest well. Looking at your schedule and having to rush home to JB after driving a taxi, I believe you are completely drained of energy at the end of the day. I walk 15 mins everyday to my taxi, and another 15 mins home after driving. It is very exhausting for me already.</p>
              <p>If at any point u cannot tahan during driving, I recommend u find a shady place to nap away and wait for Comfort calls or Lakeview calls. Sometimes it is better to idle and wait for calls instead of nonstop road sweeping. It may save your life u know? I have seen quite a few cars and taxis who mystery crashed into a tree or kerbside. I think the driver dozed off for a few seconds on a straight road and crashed around a corner. It is really no point trying to force yourself to earn more, yet risk losing even more.</p>
