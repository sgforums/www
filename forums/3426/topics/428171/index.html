              <p>Hi, </p>
              <p>I am actually not very happy with the reply given by Comfort as can be seen from the e-mail below i copied over. </p>
              <p>It is one thing to take a longer route and that is actually quite minor but to be pissed off when my wife told the driver that he is taking a longer route, then to deliberately drive till almost hitting a centre road divided before jammng the brake causing the car to spin sideways...that can risk my wife's life. When that happened, my wife was so scared that she ran out of the cab, down the street to the main road to the safety of a a crowd.</p>
              <p> I just want to find out a few things from you guys:</p>
              <p></p><ol>
              <li>I wish to check whether any of you have ever encountered any issues while taking Comfort Cab 2770.</li>
              <li>Would you all be happy with the actions by Comfort on the driver as listed below, bearing in mind this is not a minor issue but one which could lead to an accident and worst, death of a loved one?</li>
              </ol>
              <div>Fact is, till now, she is still traumatised by the whole incident even though i managed to convinved her that not all drivers are the same but she will never take a cab driven by an Indian man (no racism intended) and the cab no. 2770 has been formly logged into our notebook so that we know to reject it when we see it.</div>

              <p><br>We cannot do anything , perhaps u can proceed to see your fellow MP ( before election ) to nail this dangerous species on the road ?</p>
              <p>From where to where u thought is a longer route ? Perhaps we can justify if your wife is right or driver is wrongly accused ?</p>
              <p>What i know there could be some over-exaggeration here , Comfort drivers never dare to do it , unless u are talking about other company .</p>
              <p>Unless there is evidence to prove it .</p>
              <p>Or it's just another story .</p>
              <p>If Comfort are to give you that sort of answers , if the drivers still okay , keeping with his job , then ur side those stories must have some "discrepencies" .</p>
              <p>Under normal curcumstances , Comfort will sacked this driver .</p>

              There are 101 ways to a certain destination.
              Did the driver confirm with you the route that he will take prior to the journey?

              Did you propose alternative if you disagree.

              <p>Let me clarify, i am ok if the driver is of the opinion that the route he is taking is a better route since different people has different opinions of routings. But if we just ask if he is taking a longer route since knowing by previous taxi trips, they took another route and also the time taken is way beyond the norm, then the passsenger has the right to ask.</p>
              <p>But my issue is not the routing as this is minor but for whatever reasons ither than to avoid hitting a living being, no drivers should endanger the lives of the passengers in their cab, There is absolutely no excuse for this.</p>
              <p>To clarify also, we live in Bt Btk and normally to Raffles Pl., they cab will take via, PIE, exit AYE all the way till Keppel Rd but this driver took PIE and eventually end up in Cavenier Rd. The time taken is much longer than usually taken via AYE thus my wife querying him. But again, all passengers have ever queried drivers on routing before but does this justify the driver acting recklessly?</p>
              <p>I am here not to seek compensation from Comfort or fault them but to check whether any others experience similar dangerous drivings especially from 2770. </p>

              Seriously td is in the service line.
              Therefore cannot be rude even though passenger is at fault.
              If follow the correct protocol, like asking for route confirmation, be courteous...etc 
              Authorities cannot do anything to us.
              Anyway, the most we spent is 30 minutes with e passenger.
              After they left and walked off, then u knn$%*&amp;%% to vent off ur anger.

              there are 27 thousand taxis on the road everyday.
              There are few hundred thousand trips a day.
              It does not serve any purpose to come to this forum and ask for people to contribute their bad experiences with this 2770 driver.
              People who have bad experiences with this driver may not even accessing this forum.

              <p>Even if we did not tell the driver upfront but to later ask him whether the route he is taking is the shorter route is not wrong. Like i said, my wife is merely asking. She did not shout or scold him. In fact, he did not even respond to her or answer her.\</p>
              <p>Again. i clarify that the issue is not exactly the route but the reckless endangerment of a passenger's live....why is it that some of you keep harping about the route issue but ignore the safety part. If the issue is about routing, we would not even bother to lodge a compaint to Comfort as this issue is minor and as i mentioned, we acknowledge that different people prefer different routes. It is not wrong to ask right?</p>
              <p>How would you react in the situation where the driver tried to drive into a centre divider, jamming his brake at the last moment causing the car to spin? You all would react the same way we did.</p>
              <p>Anyway, i cant be bothered answering who is right or wrong since we (my wife and i) are the ones experiencing this and this may seem like some ludicrous story. I dont expect you to believe anyway.</p>
              <p>As mentioned many times, i just want whoever has encountered similar incidents with 2770 or other cabs to share their incident with me. Perhaps we can take this offline since this thread has become like a courthouse. E-mail me at hamidi_chemicrete@yahoo.com.sg (only those who genuinely wish to share please)</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>First, reckless driving is absolutely wrong. Secondly, i like to say that TD are humans, many do hv problems from family to drinking to loan to debt to girls etc etc, but that I understand is each and individual personal problem, however, these problems sometimes, like most human, can cause a state of brain stagnation, in layman term, daydreaming.</p>
              <p>You hv to agree with me, the most important point in this issue, is that the TD managed to evade a serious accident, from his dreaming state, he suddenly realized he was going to hit the divider, it could be a blessing from your wife questioning him that woke him up, so he swerved and the Taxis went into a spin. My guess is that he has no intention to get angry or hurt or trying to hurt anyone.</p>
              <p>In our daily driving, we see private cars knock into curbs, trees, lampost and some into walls and rivers, we see buses hit into interchange, bus stop, cranes, etc etc, all are reckless, but that is a part of driving hazard, and we, the TDs are prone to this kind of hazard, but as said, there is no accuses for reckless driving, a TD must discipline himself to drive safely, no drinking, sleep enough, try not to bring personal problem into the steering wheels. However, given a known location, just like said Airport, I will go there with no problem, along the way, my brain may wonder off abit, cos it is a easy location.</p>
              <p>The view is that the TD had been called up by his company, lectured and warned, his replies could be, I was never rude to the passenger, it just that my mind was off, and suddenly the passenger asked me a question, which woke me up and then I saw the road divider. And with that, he apologised and ask for leniency and be given a chance to ply the road to earn a decent living. So, if you look it at this angle, that the TD had no intention to get angry or harm your wife, but merely his daydreaming mistake, hope you can be more calm and I wish your wife well.</p>

              <p><br>Yup he may be daydreaming or facing some personal issues but that does not justify reckless driving. Tell that to relatives of those who are victims of reckless driving.</p>
              <p>I would agree if he is daydreaming and tries to avoid collision at the last moment if he turns around immediately after that and apologise and check if my wife's ok. But he jsut sat there looking at the rear view mirrow at my wife expressionless.</p>
              <p>Even when she ran out of the taxi, he did not get out after her and apologise. These are not acts of people who did in unintentionally. He did it delibrately. Furthermore, he speed up before heading towards the divider.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am a practical person so the questions you asked, i asked my wife before i told her to lodge a complaint to Comfort.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, i am not here for a debate so i rather not answer any more since it is not my objective here to make believers out of you all. I know what happesn, my wife knows what happen and the driver knows what happen so let's leave it at that. </p>

              <p>No. I am seriously thinking of doing so. Even my wife's company is thinking of lodging a complaint since not only the incident cause my wife to be a late but to be shaken even while at work. I am thinking of waiting to see what her company decided first.</p>

              <p>That is why i asked whether any others have faced issue with 2770 before. As i mentioned, i am not the type to compain but if this driver is a repeat offender noting that some people who have unpleasant incidents with him may not have reported to Comfort, then i may take this as a push for me to take it up to LTA.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We did ask Comfort whether he has other cases before but of course, they will not disclose that to us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But again, probably you are right also in that i should not wait and just feedback to LTA without deliberating whether he is a repeat offender or not.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, Hope Bro Hamidi is cool enough to forgive other, I alway have that empathy on mistake, it could be this TD first mistake and as Singaporeans, we are definitely gracious enough to think of his childrens and his family food on the table. Of course Bro can go all the way even to civil suit in court to get this TD out of here and go into deep shit, but Bro have to weight the balance, is it necessary. Perhap bros and his wife can now gain more experiences dealing with Taxis, ask for the road or give the direction you wish before moving off.</p>

              <p>I can certainly forgive and forget...that is why i want to know whether he have other cases before. If it is his 1st time, then maybe i can just forgive him.</p>
              <p>But i am suprised many here still think the issue is the routing. The issue is not. Many od us have taken taxis and asked the driver mid-way in the journey whether the route he is taking is the correct one but many drivers just politely answers. In this case, it is different, he does not answer and choose to vent his anger. </p>
