              <p>Also, if you all refer back to my 1st post...i never mentioned my objective of opening this thread is to lodge a further complaint to Comfort or LTA.</p>
              <p>Just want some comments from you guys, as mentioned in my 1st post, </p>

              <li style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Would you all be happy with the actions by Comfort on the driver as listed below, bearing in mind this is not a minor issue but one which could lead to an accident and worst, death of a loved one?</li>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Allow me to answer yr 2 Qs,</p>
              <p>1. As this is more of a taxi forum, you are asking for passengers to answer it, but most of us are TDs. However, we do take Taxis, and hardly come across such driver as you mentioned, the situation here is btw a pax and a driver servicing the pax, the relations should not be much different from a customer and a seller, Both have to work toward a amicable friendly rapport. which will ultimately end up in a win win situation, i.e both the pax and the driver are satisfied. The condition for bad relation alway start at the begining, once pax and driver do not see eyes to eyes in whatever matter that is involved, be it lack of courtesy, characters, demanding, or even race can be a teething problem at the begining, once that fail, the whole journey can be a time bomb waiting to explode. I believe there is a posssible friction btw yr wife and the TD, on the other hand, the TD could had a bad day or some personnal problem himself, but as i said that is no excuses for it to driver recklessly.</p>
              <p>2. The Action taken by Comfort is within the company level, not within your judiciary, unless you want to take it up to the Court. For example, if you work in Sony, and you somehow angered a client, he cannot do anything to you, but he can launch a complaint to Sony Singapore, Sony will call you into the office, investigate it, punished you by either giving warning, or termination or other disciplinary action as Sony Code of Conduct or handbook stand. However, Sony will not tell the client what they had done to you, they just simply apologise to the client and state that the case had been arrested and thank the client for his feedbacks. That is how corporate works, if Comfort is to tell you how they punished the driver, the driver can sue comfort for disclosure of privacy, he reports and trust Comfort, not to you.</p>
              <p>Lastly, by stating the nos plate here, his relief driver or someone who took over as hirer of this cab may end up having no passenger. Therefore, you should be conscious of what you are doing.</p>
