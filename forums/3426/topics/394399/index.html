              <p>When situations happen, these "Drivers" can either be alert, then anticipate, slow down, be patient, let the other driver(s) finish doing whatever they intend to do, ie turning, parking, overtaking etc, because no one really wants to linger on the road, everyone just needs it to get away to somewhere else</p>
              <p>or they can horn, flash, shout, shake fist, show colour because they decided Why should I be patient??</p>
