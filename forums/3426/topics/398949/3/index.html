              <p>Drum beat.........................</p>
              <p>To all future and upcoming and choose to be upcoming OMO bros here. Let me share my story abit.</p>
              <p>I was like most new TD few years ago when I started out as a OMO. Struggling between OMO and relief. Relief wasn't a easy option cos you will hear people saying problems about having a relief, finding a relief is sure a problem itself. It's true till today that a good relief is never easy to come. So naturally OMO became an "easy" option" for newbie. You may dreaming of good income driving 14-16 hours a day, no relief problems. These are easy excuses for being an OMO. But what newbie will never understand is that driving 14-16 hours on the road is not a joke. I personally got into 2 accidents within my first 1 years due to lack of sleep. I was lucky enough to stay alive today. Being an OMO is a balancing act between making enough money and having enough sleep. Mental stress itself will kill your motivation to move forward, over the long run.</p>
              <p>Of course there are TD who are very successful in being an OMO, and being OMO sure got its advantage, like having the freedom usage of taxi, etc. But how long do you think one can take such mental and health stress? Do you really think the money you make as an OMO you get to live for it (touchwood, but very true)? Do you think your family feel good to see you drive so hard and at the same time neglect them?</p>
              <p>Here is a good story by FT on "Can I Borrow $25"</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/3426/topics/397378?page=4">http://cabby.sgforums.com/forums/3426/topics/397378?page=4</a></p>
              <p>I once heard some conversation among a new driver, bragging that how he make $xxx within a day. The old driver just answer a smile and say " What you earn now, you will need to pay back when you old, or if you manage to see yourself old"</p>
              <p>So my advice to all upcoming OMO, make a wise choice today. TD like ceo pool and our principal TCL and many more out there are people with 10 years experiences in this industry. Do you think what they says doesn't carry some weight in their statement?</p>
              <p>If you think the group in this forum are selfish people, unwilling to share the truth, just twisting some facts just to make you change your decision. Let me tell you the truth. I have never seen people like that throughout my life, sharing so willingly their experience, their lobangs, everything. They are best among the best I have seen, especially the lakeview group in this forum. I have heighten my income cos of ceo pool's help and many people who share info with me. These people makes me feel see a different side of this industry. These people makes me feel prideful of being a taxi driver. Therefore I tell myself I will in return help as much as I could to those who need my help.</p>
              <p>Hope you newbies make a wise decision.</p>

              Fat Golden Cow..............</p>
              <p>Those who want OMO Limo taxi just be prepared. You must able to
              "tahan" (withstand pressure) for 3 months or so. If not u, my
              advice is go OMO with comfort OR be a reflief.</p>
              <p>Taxi company will not tell u(well at least the taxi company
              which I am renting my taxi from) IN DETAIL wad will be the issues
              faced by drivers who rented certain type of cab. They just keep
              quiet and let u choose like a good service front door
              salesman.</p>
              <p>And when u take it up, u are stuck for at least 6 months. By
              then, Taxi company no need to worry cause even u return car, u need
              to change vehicle or pay up the penalty.</p>
              <p>I spoke to MPV a lot. These few days I think I was a bit harsh
              to him. Feeling a bit bad that he is still struggling. I am still
              trying to encourage him. One of the problem with new drivers
              especially desperate new drivers who needed money to keep family
              going is they presurrized themselves too hard till their income
              drop - and they dun understand why...</p>
              <p>I think from tonight onward, I will write a series of newbie
              guide for new drivers. At least it will help u to ask some
              questions before u decide to rent any taxi.</p>
              <p>With a sincere heart, all those new drivers who visit the forum,
              approach Poolman and join Lakeview. You may struggle even if u are
              with Lakeview, but at the very least, you struggle knowing help is
              behind. I am new here in this forum, but I can see poolman and gang
              is one of the best self help group here.</p>
              <p>If you are from the rat race coporate world, then u will
              definitely appreciate the frankness displayed among this LV forum
              members here. We are not the smartest in Singapore, but we
              definitely not the blind and stupid as some pple think we are.</p>
