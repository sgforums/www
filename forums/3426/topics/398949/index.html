              <p>Hi all bros, I know this is ridiculous for some! I was offered a Trans Merc Cab as relief driver for day driving (6am-6pm, day+night on Sats). I have no experience at all..</p>
              <p>I hope i can get some valuable advice from all the senior bros here....I'm in a dilemma of whether to take or not.</p>
              <p>1. Is it ok to start my taxi career with this cab? it depend mostly on bookings and 'special' arrangements via network. The hirer also offer his talkie network forme to join in.</p>
              <p>2. Understand Comfort need at least 6 mths driving experience before one can switch over to limo cabs. How about Trans? Sorry I've yet to check with them...</p>
              <p>3. What are the pros &amp; cons for taking Trans cab? eg: lesser diesel kiosk? payment later than Comfort's transaction, etc..</p>
              <p>4. Heard that trans now also equipped with cashless mode of transaction, eg: visa &amp; nets.</p>
              <p>I am really lost at this moment as all my 'research' had done on only one taxi company... comfort. really no ideas on Transcab terms &amp; condition.</p>
              <p>Pls advise. Thank you. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Most of the cabs companies have a "Payment system and/or GPRS" in their cabs.. Hence, the drivers need to be trained to use the equipments (for cashless payment) w/o any difficulties.. Go check with your hirer or company if there is a IN HOUSE COURSE for you to attend, in order to understand and operate the payment system w/o fail.   From my understanding, changing shifts for most taxi drivers are at 5pm to 5am.  Starting later at 6pm means 1hr of evening peak hour is lost.  And nowadays after midnite, you got to be super lucky to get a Pax, which means, you got only 6 hours from 6pm to breakeven your rental, diesel (or CNG for some Union Cab), cab wash $$.  UNFORTUNATELY, there are TOOOOO MANY TAXIs already... every where you cruise (in town) is FULL of TAXis waiting for PAX after Midnight !!! Good Luck to you.....</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Well, this "changing shift arrangement" should be iron out before you start driving for the said partner.   Night Shift drivers like you should have given the priority of timing (unless you can't get one near your house).  I understand from my friend that driving a normal cab (even the auto-gear Sonatas oftered by Comfort Delgro) earns more because of lower rental vs Mercedes cab rental (saved $15 per half shift per day, 1 month $450 richer).  With already heavily populated taxis industry (estimated 24,000 taxis), competition is very stiff.  Almost everywhere (Hotels, Casinos) provides Private Limo services, hence, getting into taxi industry now is a BIG challenge for some... Keep your operating cost low is the MOST IDEAL situation for a NEWBIE... Driving comfortably may be in your top priority.. but when you clocked below a reasonable take-home payroll, isn't it worth ? Furthermore, are you ROAD-wise ?  do you know all hotels and place of interest well ?  Mercedes Limos Cabby are supposed to be the Premier Group of drivers whom roam the island on their fingertips....</p></div>

              <p>I see. I am driving day, not night... for a start. Instead of 6-6, I am working with him for 6.30 to 4.30pm so that both of us can start 1/2 hr before peak hr.</p>
              <p>As for the rental, yes, it was one of my considerations too. You got a point here. I am taking the higher rate for limo cabs and booking surcharge vis-a-vis to the normal cab's charges too. of cse, other factors too.</p>
              <p>My top priority here is finding one in Pasir Ris.</p>
              <p>I am quite confident &amp; familiar with all major roads &amp; hotels here.</p>

              <p>Hi Bro Sgm40 vps......my scenario is slightly different from you, but just for sharing purpose.</p>
              <p>I used to drive a Mercs cab as well.  As I'm a super relief, I only drive on Sundays (my preference).  Driving hours is 4.30am-4.30pm.  However, there are times when the relief handover the car late (eg 5am).  My rental was $67 for half shift.</p>
              <p>My strategy is to pick &amp; go or take calls.  I can make about on average about $150, it can go up to $180 if that particular day is good.  Take note that the amount earned is after deducting rental, car wash and diesel.</p>
              <p>For meals (breakfast &amp; lunch combined), I take about 20 mins and off I go.  Hope this helps.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I am quite optimistic at this hour and would like to give a try. Maybe I shall try for just a month and see whether I am ok or not.</p>

              <p>Since you are driving a Dynasty Mercedes Cab.. it is adviceable to join some taxi grouping (namely Limo2000, K-Limo etc) as there are limited GPRs calls for Union Cabs.  The pros of the group is the members within provides road conditions, airport "pick &amp; go" (if you are near east, you can turbo to airport) or even Limo Q at airport.. sometimes, members do tells you important info likes TP speed traps locations... (drive whole day = pay to TP.. nuts)... the only operational cost is that you have to pay GRID walky a monthly subscription fee of min $28 to $48 with a Limit cap at $88 (w/o GST).. Furthermore Limo Groups do have premier jobs like Hotel Departures (normally at nett $33 per trip) .. Hourly Disposal booking, $35 x min 2 hours... When Formula One Night Race comes to town again, you will likely to have hourly booking ranging from 4hrs to 8hrs.... This jobs diff from the normal cabs..  If you just want to wait for Pax at Taxi Qs, then, you don't need to drive a Mercedes Cab with higher Operational Cost, ie, rental.</p>

              <p>Bro, r u driving one now? I am really not sure on those jobs like hotel departures, hourly disposal and how they operate the walkie group and how it works.</p>
              <p>Questions:</p>
              <p>1. I subscripe GRID, given a call-sign and frequency for that gp, and I will take bookings from whoever announce? Understand it is broadcast by individual, not group head or call centre. is it correct? what if other cabby chiong to grab customer even though I cfm my booking? will this happen?</p>
              <p>2. Who assign those hotel or special assignment? is it a standard rate charged?</p>
              <p>3.How is this Limo Q at airport works? simple as the normal cab Q?</p>
              <p>Any further advise? Appreciate with Tks.</p>
