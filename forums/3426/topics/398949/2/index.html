              <p>My take is give it a try to see if u can take it as a Taxi Driver. You never know if your butt can "tahan" for 10-12hrs daily. Also take this relief job to learn (shortest routes, place of interest, hotels and building) and adjust to taxi enviroment.</p>
              <p>At first u will earn maybe very little but maybe if lucky then it ok.</p>
              <p>Driving Merc cab=higher overheads, maybe more demanding with limo job(corporate Jobs) higher expectation from pax etc...</p>
              <p>Of course, it more comfortable to drive, quiet interior and nice sound system.</p>
              <p>But if later think otherwise, switch to normal cab its your choice not the hirer.</p>

              <p>I so big size and u forgot me Pool................I new bird OMO Fat Golden Cow..............</p>
              <p>Those who want OMO Limo taxi just be prepared. You must able to "tahan" (withstand pressure) for 3 months or so. If not u, my advice is go OMO with comfort OR be a reflief.</p>
              <p>Taxi company will not tell u(well at least the taxi company which I am renting my taxi from) IN DETAIL wad will be the issues faced by drivers who rented certain type of cab. They just keep quiet and let u choose like a good service front door salesman.</p>
              <p>And when u take it up, u are stuck for at least 6 months. By then, Taxi company no need to worry cause even u return car, u need to change vehicle or pay up the penalty.</p>
              <p>I spoke to MPV a lot. These few days I think I was a bit harsh to him. Feeling a bit bad that he is still struggling. I am still trying to encourage him. One of the problem with new drivers especially desperate new drivers who needed money to keep family going is they presurrized themselves too hard till their income drop - and they dun understand why...</p>
              <p>I think from tonight onward, I will write a series of newbie guide for new drivers. At least it will help u to ask some questions before u decide to rent any taxi.</p>
              <p>With a sincere heart, all those new drivers who visit the forum, approach Poolman and join Lakeview. You may struggle even if u are with Lakeview, but at the very least, you struggle knowing help is behind. I am new here in this forum, but I can see poolman and gang is one of the best self help group here.</p>
              <p>If you are from the rat race coporate world, then u will definitely appreciate the frankness displayed among this LV forum members here. We are not the smartest in Singapore, but we definitely not the blind and stupid as some pple think we are.</p>

              <p>After learning about LIMO services, if you ask me why Merc Cab? I would say the reason is the BRANDING!</p>

Although its rental is just merely a different of $10 or more, it has more choices to be chauffeured as a LIMO cab as compared to a normal taxi. The luxury &amp; prestige power also attract some group of customers where it will command a higher returns upon services like airport transfer, arrival &amp; departure transfer, hourly disposal &amp; special events. <span> </span>It is all about providing a premium experience to our customers. Better income for me as well!</span></p>

Its like "</span><span style='line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;'>after you drive an auto-trans car, you will never wanted to drive a manual one again" likewise to driving a Merc Cab.</span></p>

              <p>Drum beat.........................</p>
              <p>To all future and upcoming and choose to be upcoming OMO bros here. Let me share my story abit.</p>
              <p>I was like most new TD few years ago when I started out as a OMO. Struggling between OMO and relief. Relief wasn't a easy option cos you will hear people saying problems about having a relief, finding a relief is sure a problem itself. It's true till today that a good relief is never easy to come. So naturally OMO became an "easy" option" for newbie. You may dreaming of good income driving 14-16 hours a day, no relief problems. These are easy excuses for being an OMO. But what newbie will never understand is that driving 14-16 hours on the road is not a joke. I personally got into 2 accidents within my first 1 years due to lack of sleep. I was lucky enough to stay alive today. Being an OMO is a balancing act between making enough money and having enough sleep. Mental stress itself will kill your motivation to move forward, over the long run.</p>
              <p>Of course there are TD who are very successful in being an OMO, and being OMO sure got its advantage, like having the freedom usage of taxi, etc. But how long do you think one can take such mental and health stress? Do you really think the money you make as an OMO you get to live for it (touchwood, but very true)? Do you think your family feel good to see you drive so hard and at the same time neglect them?</p>
              <p>Here is a good story by FT on "Can I Borrow $25"</p>
              <p><a href="/forums/3426/topics/397378?page=4">http://cabby.sgforums.com/forums/3426/topics/397378?page=4</a></p>
              <p>I once heard some conversation among a new driver, bragging that how he make $xxx within a day. The old driver just answer a smile and say " What you earn now, you will need to pay back when you old, or if you manage to see yourself old"</p>
              <p>So my advice to all upcoming OMO, make a wise choice today. TD like ceo pool and our principal TCL and many more out there are people with 10 years experiences in this industry. Do you think what they says doesn't carry some weight in their statement?</p>
              <p>If you think the group in this forum are selfish people, unwilling to share the truth, just twisting some facts just to make you change your decision. Let me tell you the truth. I have never seen people like that throughout my life, sharing so willingly their experience, their lobangs, everything. They are best among the best I have seen, especially the lakeview group in this forum. I have heighten my income cos of ceo pool's help and many people who share info with me. These people makes me feel see a different side of this industry. These people makes me feel prideful of being a taxi driver. Therefore I tell myself I will in return help as much as I could to those who need my help.</p>
              <p>Hope you newbies make a wise decision.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Its all true. OMO is very xiong. Everyday maciam like wake up in BMT. Out of bed from short rest and its time to do your 5BX, marching, running and SOC. See steering wheel also scared. End of day, if cannot tahan the 14-16 hrs, dont be surprised only made 10, 20 or 30 dollars profit. The cab rental is for 24 hrs. The company charged based on constant usage. So dont even try OMO unless you just want to testing. For OMO testing, can try Comfort. Only need 7 working days advance notice to return taxi. No penalty involved.</p></div>
