              <p>La2534, thank you for yr pioneer &amp; sincere reply. Sorry for the slow response because I am still unfamiliar with the technical aspects of the forum. One thing is, appeal is not a long term solution for me. They can still summon me again, unless I give up queuing. I tried that but my income dipped and fuel consumption soared. I think the key prerequisite to mitigate this problem is for the relevant authority to expand the size of taxi stands near shopping centres and other places of importance. In comparison with the size of taxi stands in other densely populated cities of the world, the majority of our taxi stands are indeed impractically small. Perharps, expanding the avg size of TS from 2-3 lots to 6-8 lots will be feasibly desirable. I am only a taxi driver. I hope that anybody who is of a noble birth or in a position of relevant authority who happens to come across this forum page will care to lift a finger to bring about this change. Not just for the happiness of taxi drivers but also for the comfort of commuters and the decency of our country's landscape.</p>
