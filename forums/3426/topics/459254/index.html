              <p>Initially thought the pax were in the wrong, then read the whole story, my thinking is... if you use aggressive tactics to pursue the matter, even if you are in the right, you will make the situation worst. human instinct is fight or flee in such situations, in this case, the girls flee, what if it was a bunch of losers who fight back and took the opportunity to rob the driver?</p>
              <p>for a small amount of money, and given the age range of the girls, i think $20 or less is not worth all these troubles. if managed properly, the situation would have resolved itself nicely, and saves the girls problems, and saves the TD time... his time is money.</p>
              <p>all the time he spent to stomp, go to police station, etc... i think his time would have earned him at least $100. moreover this is a case of suayness, where the machine broke down... it's not like the girls wanted to run, but given their age, they are probably scared to death...</p>

              <p>They will be thinking, well, can so easily get away, let try again next time, and the next time could be you or me.</p>
              <p>Just like chicken rice and after eating, do not want to pay, the seller may think, ok lah, only $4, forget it, dun make a mess out of it, then other saw it, also do not want to pay, how??</p>

              <p>But it's the principle, why allow people to cheat?</p>
              <p>You think it's the first time they are cheating, maybe it's the first time they were caught but not the first time.</p>
              <p>It's not a question of money, I have given free rides too, huge discounts etc, but to deserving people. Once an old lady asked me to send her near Geylang Lor 22 to Circuit Road, she was in her 70s, missed her last bus, but she asked beforehand and never forced, said if cannot never mind. This kind, we can consider and forego. She is an old lady, shouldnt be forced to walk or wait until 6am. Could give her the benefit of doubt.</p>
              <p>Similarly I have given kids a ride home after missing the last bus with whatever cash they had on them even if doesnt meet the full fare, we think of them as our own children, who we dont want to be wandering the streets late at night.</p>
              <p>But these girls did it at 8 or 9pm, when all the resources for going back were there. They were plain selfish and thought they could get away with it. They must be taught a lesson and also to warn others who have similar ideas.</p>
              <p>Anyway lose an hour or 2 to teach them also no problem, how often do we encounter this kind of cases? Money can be earned back but the lesson must be taught.</p>

              <p>But it's the principle, why allow people to cheat?</p>
              <p>You think it's the first time they are cheating, maybe it's the
              first time they were caught but not the first time.</p>
              <p>It's not a question of money, I have given free rides too, huge
              discounts etc, but to deserving people. Once an old lady asked me
              to send her near Geylang Lor 22 to Circuit Road, she was in her
              70s, missed her last bus, but she asked beforehand and never
              forced, said if cannot never mind. This kind, we can consider and
              forego. She is an old lady, shouldnt be forced to walk or wait
              until 6am. Could give her the benefit of doubt.</p>
