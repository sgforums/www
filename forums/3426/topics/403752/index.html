              I'll definitely identify myself when he does that. Of course I must see what's his attitude towards a fellow TD. 
              
              End of trip, of course pay the fare accordingly.

              ok the statement of facts goes like this ...
                                                  
              On a saturday abt 5.08pm i boarded a silvercab toyota crown at marina bay sands taxi stand
                                                  
              when i boarded the taxi the surcharge is already $4.00
              pls note silver cab got 3 columns (1 to show fare, 1 to show peak hr extra, 1 to show surcharges)
                                                  
              as there were road block along the way, we go by
              bayfront ave-temasek ave-temasek boulevard-rochor road-
              north bridge road-middle road-prinsep street
                                                  
              thereby passing 2 erp gantries(1 at bayfront ave the other at north bridge road)
                                                  
              i remember the first gantry at bayfront should be $1.00 but the 2nd one i cannot remember, should be $1.00 too
                                                  
              when i reach destination at prinsep street abt 5.18pm
              the surcharge is $7.00
              the peak hours is $2.05
                                                  
              total fare is 14plus all in
                                
              I give him $15.00
                                                  
              the TD still ask for $3.00 more, saying got surcharge
              but i told him he have press already if not the surcharge column cannot be $7.00 (and further more i suspect this $7.00
              is already overcharge, i think he got fast fingers to press more) 
                                                  
              in the end he said nevermind abt the $3.00 and drove off

              <p>I ever heard from TD from a long Q at AP, say his friend ever met a driver use a longer route to reach his intend destination and even tell him that's the only route. Without saying anything he let his wife and children alight, after he throw $100 on the desk top ask the driver to just keep on driving till meter read $100. knn the driver himself also scare scare ask him pls don't play.</p>
              <p>Alot of black sheep TD around, as pax we also must show no mercy...just quietly pay take receipt that's it.</p>

              <p>1. Will give him the benefit of the doubt (maybe he honestly made a mistake) and ask him for explanation why there is surcharge.</p>
              <p>2. At the end of the trip will ask for receipt and tell him that you know there is no surcharge and he was attempting to be dishonest and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tell him</span> that I will lodge a complaint to LTA.    This to teach him that he cannot try to rob people this way. I may not actually complain , depending on his attitude and explanation.</p>
              <p>3. Sorry, colleague or not, I don't like dishonest TD. Come on can we get rich just by charging a few bucks more? Even if he did it a thousand times, it's "only" a few thousand dollars, right?     Too bad, he pick up the worng guy, got caught, and he has to face the music. Go lim kopi at LTA.</p>

              based on the information given to me during the MDT course at Comfort, it said,
              if you reject the job offer by turning on within 1 minutes, this is not considered a 
              job rejection.
              And it said the meter on/off should be more than 3 mins to be considered as a genuine street pickup.
