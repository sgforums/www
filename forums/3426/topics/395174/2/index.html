              <p>i dun know abt being kicked by a ball. havent encountered such things yet. like i say , comfort calls are hopeless now. its like playing roulette. lucky u get 35 times payout , unlucky u kena ZERO die cock standing BUT they can save your day too.. on a quiet nite while everyone is empty , there is hope that the MDT will sound off. at the outskirts of anywhere in singapore , the MDT might save your day too.</p>

              <p>yes i quite agree,  in fact i also did come in to offer tips to some newbies in here. but the thing is u are creating a kind of dependence. what people dunno they just come to the forum and ask instead of doing some homework themselves.</p>
              <p>those who are not clear can always call the taxi cos and check isnt it? is it very difficult?</p>
              <p>There is no perfect co to join . here u win some , there u lose some. so why really bother to pin point to the detail?</p>
              <p>if everything u pin point , i can tell u being a TD really has no meaning. calculate here calculate there , for fark?</p>
