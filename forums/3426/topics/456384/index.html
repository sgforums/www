              <p>Bro,</p>
              <p>Those taxi roof top " change shift china town"</p>
              <p>After 3-4hr still change shift china town,</p>
              <p>U think they can track bo?</p>

              <p>The MDT, the meter, the nets and credit transaction equipment are all in the rental package, nevertheless it is still the company properties. To attract drivers, some company use it to the full advantages like many calls and fast transaction, good meter and screen, map etc etc. This give the added advantage to the company in attracting drivers, and also give customer a good impression.</p>
              <p>But if a driver is to use to his advantage like changing shift china town for hours, it is his perogatives, meaning his own business, like a chicken seller, given the electricity, the light the stall, the water point, the rest is up to him to decide where he want to cook, hand his chicken or simply where to put his utensils.</p>
              <p>Taxis company can decide on fares, fuel and rental prices, at the present moment, they are hand off on how you earn your living, for that matter, you drive for leisure or 2 hrs per day, they also dun give a damn.</p>
              <p>Problems arises only when paxs are involved, good taxis company's management will know that  they are the most important ingredient in the Taxi industrial food chain. No doubt Taxi company only take rental from hirer, but if that particular company careless about pax, no sooner, their TD will suffer, most will become not discipline and do funny stunt here and there on pax, in a long run, pax avoid those taxis, and hirer start to throw keys, and that break the food chain for that particular company.</p>
              <p>So if you ask me if one can put on change shift for hours, its ok, but once every cabby start to pull this stunt, which is not difficult to figure it out given most TD got good IQ, then what happen, all cabs at CBD with changing shift china town, so once pax complained, remember once pax get involved, enforcer will come in. Therefore do what you like, keep it to yourself and life will be better, for that matter, you can also put busy until you see baggages.</p>
              <p>Human in nature, like to excel in what they are doing, meaning a person want to do and earn more for what they are doing, as for TD, after a few years driving, whatever stunt you saw or pulled, can only help you maybe just to have more time resting, but for income, same same but different</p>
