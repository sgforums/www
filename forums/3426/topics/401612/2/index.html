              <p>Yeah, got destination is good, but it is only good if you GOT the pax on board your cab. Newbies like me will only end up seeing lao guis smoke when reach the pick up locations :(</p>
              <p>At least tright now I can quickly press the meter first, and if it is confirmed, the pax will be there for us.The only problem is some seasoned TD, like Al "Fast Finger" ALN usually got all the bookings before we even press the MDT. Phui!</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Auto booking.</span>  Many of the staff call from their office just before they come down. Once recorded, the next call will be listed as auto booking (without name). You need to invest some time to familiriase with the "pick up" loactions. Ie, which building has what big foreign companies (foreign banks, finance firms, law firms, etc) and if you got calls from these buildings, most of the time it is "safe".      </p>
              <p>Sometimes you can even tell what type of pax and their type of residence from the number the call are made from. For example, if call from 6890xxxx, you can tell the age of pax, their rank in the company, method of payment (all will pay by eVoucher), etc, Believe me, your experience will tell.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SMS booking.</span> Again, need to see which buildings they are calling from and most of the time it is a lone pax. They just use sms for the convenience.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">iPhone booking.</span>        This is the type I don't like and will reject.  These people using iPhone booking are usually the "smart aleck" who will "no-show" as they will grab any empty cab, even though they have made the booking. Worse is that they don't bother to cancel.</p>
              <p>If they don't "no show" (that is, they cannot get empty cab before we reach the pick up location), usually they are the Desmond Lim or Raymond Tan type, which will bring you to Komade's favourite places (Sengkang and Punggol).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, I hope Professor Poolman would come back from the Carribean soon and teach us more on taxi driving. Seriously I learnt a lot from him.</p>

              <p>That night I drove from one end of AMK5 (at the junction of YCK
              Rd and Buangkok Green) to the other end of AMK5 (a T-junction with
              YCK Rd again, ironically) and got ALL the green lights.</p>
              <p>I went to check again, there are TWELVE traffic lights along
              this 4.9km stretch <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png">. Even the ICC staff sitting in my cab was amazed. This
              12 consecutive green lights is a record for me. :)</p>

              <p>The other day my hirer uncle called me telling me that he just lost his wallet at the Taka taxi stand when he was helping the pax with their barang barang into the boot. He panicked because he got all his cards (NRIC, Driver's lic, TDVL, diesel card, ATM) on top of the cash.</p>
              <p>He told me that he drove back and searched around but couldn't find it. I asked him whether he check with Taka, and he said he checked with the security warden but also no luck.</p>
              <p>I tried to call the Taka info counter and managed to find the wallet. Someone found it and brought it to the info counter!!. Quickly called the hirer uncle to go and collect the wallet back,</p>
              <p>He was happy to see his wallet with all intact, including the cash.  I am also happy, not only that he found his wallet, but more importantly that there are still many honest good people around. :)</p>

              <p>Yeah, but this is not really about timing it right, it is just the lights are green just before you reached the intersections. That's why I was amazed by it :)</p>
