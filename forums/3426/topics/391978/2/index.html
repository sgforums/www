              <p>1)How to know whether its a CBD area?When enter ERP its
                      consider CBD area.Am i right to say that.</p>
              <p>As
              the name CBD indicates Central Business District, it's in town area.
              Places like Shenton Way, Robinson Road, Cecil Street, Suntec area,
              Chinatown, Bugis area, Orchard area etc. Look out for ERP gantry with a
              RED 'R' insdie RED triangle. It indicates RESTRICTED Area.</p>
              <p>2)So when pick up inside CBD charge 3 dollars.Am i right?(press
                      button)</p>
              <p>Yes on Mon~Sat 5pm~Midnight ONLY</p>
              <p>3)When drive in ERP with pax they paid,no pax we paid.Am i
                      right?(auto)</p>
              <p>When ERP gantry in operation and you passed it with pax, they pay. No pax, you pay. Yes, auto.</p>
              <p>4)On call going CBD they paid.Am i right?</p>
              <p>(Scenario: When pax in CBD, you outside CBD and you accept the call)</p>
              <p>No, you pay. Cos no pax when going in.</p>
              <p>5)Morning peak hrs surcharger what time to what time?Not
                      sure</p>
              <p>Mon~Fri 7am~9.30am</p>
              <p>6)Night peak hrs surcharger what time to what time?Not sure</p>
              <p>Mon~Sat 5pm~8pm</p>
              <p>Not sure can see http://www.cdgtaxi.com.sg/commuters_services_rates.mvn?cid=910</p>
              <p>As bro poolman say surcharger is pro rated so it should be
                      automatic charge by meter.Thks bro poolman,komade and FT(foreigner
                      talent)haha.</p>
              <p>Peak hour surcharge are auto. Pro rated means only meter fare covered in the peak hour period will be given the 35%.</p>
              <p>Say
              if you start meter at 4.55pm, only normal fare (eg. $3.00), no 35%. If
              the journey continues and when the clock turns 5pm, the 35% kicks in.</p>

              <p>I think it's a temporary mismatch of supply and demand situation.  CQ pax is struggling for more taxis but elsewhere you can see taxi queing at MRT in clementi, in JP, plaza singapura.  Last night i was shuttling a lot of trips in CQ but yet i saw empty taxis queing elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Moreover the upsurge of too many people wanting cabs at the same time due to some private events, end of month spending spree, pay day syndrome......</p>
              <p>Adding to the woes are i believe RWS had attracted more taxis queing there. I send pax into Sentosa resort yesterday midnight, and for the first time i saw no cab queing in the usual St James...and many paxes wanting cab.....I don't need to Q in RWS, don't need to turn back to St James, immediately i saw many paxes right in Siloso and fetch them to JW Gekpoh, then connect to Old Lim Chu Kang, and immediately connect another to Tuas South.  Knn whole night stuck in outskirt and didn't see the warfare in Downtown.</p>
              <p>Tuas South connect one to Boon Lay again....i say no more and enough....Quickly zoom into AYE and save and help the taxi trade to get paxes out of CQ......</p>
              <p>However i think Night Shift can be a real challenge.....Not everyday is a Fri or Sat.....</p>
              <p>Hopefully those pathetic situation is gone when you see infront of you and behind your back, all the Cabs with green light and blue light LED......charging everywhere and in every directions.....</p>

              <p>To register as a relief, $1000 deposit is a must.</p>
              <p>I heard that there are some private party renting out taxi that do not need $1000 deposit but need to buy 3rd party insurance. Maybe Pool can advise on this.</p>
              <p>Learn the trade as a relief b'cos your cost is lower and then decide later. To me, taxi driving is a job that can earn a living but without prospect. A driver is still a driver after 5 years. You still need to depend on the demand to earn your dough. That's why drivers are mostly elder people though more younger (30+) people joining. But I think this trend is b'cos jobs are fewer these days and not b'cos they like being a cab driver.</p>
              <p>Yes, I'm relief. I supposed the aim of this forum is to help new comers ease into the trade.</p>
