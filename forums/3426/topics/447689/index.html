              Hey Bro....
              
              I'm not those that can talk cock with anyone and usually keep quiet when driving passengers. Anyway not a big issue la.... just wanna know how you guys feel....
              
              So I find it very strange and funny when the passenger start talking about himself, his family and the whole world. They can even continue one way direction without you replying... 
              
              Women in their twenties or thirties still ok la...
              
              Guys??? I don't give a damn lo....
              
              You guys encounter this type of strange people? How do you react?

              <p>Last night send a pax to airport.</p>
              <p>He told me that his company is in oil business.</p>
              <p>I ask him if it's true that Singapore make the best oil rig in the world.</p>
              <p>He told me that in term of quality, the Koreans are better but the price is higher. Singapore are able to come out with lower cost for quality as good.</p>
              <p>Thoughout the trip, we talk on cheap labour exploitation, material quality, QC standards and alot more.</p>
              <p>When getting close to the airport, he was telling his wife who happens to call that he is having a very interesting conversation with this taxi driver. Not bad right?</p>
              <p>For the record, I seldom talk to pax unless they initiate the chat.</p>

              <p>She told me she just love Singapore. The people, the safety, the food and all that.</p>

              <p>I think it is good to chat when the topic is good, no harm done, as taxi Driver, we also cannot put ourselve inside a cocoon, need to ask and talk to people of different trade, exchange view and keep ourselve abreast of what is happening.</p>
              <p>But of course, you must know where you stand, not to overly indulge into debate that determine who win or lose kind of silly stuff, just be moderate, humerous and humble. Just ah ah, ok ok,,...can also give people an impression of proud TD, but that is also fine, people will just go along.</p>
              <p>For me, when the topic frequency is right with the paxs, I can also make them very happy, in return, I feel less stress and tire, as good conversation alway helps to keep me awake and somehow, long journey become short when we are in conversation.</p>
              <p>A good humerous conversation will alway leave a long trail of smile our face, I think all of you would had experienced it, you get a good guy talking happily with you, even after both had parted, you just smile along driving, and accordingly to mind happiness, the longer that smile hang on in your face, the more jovious and happy is the encounter.</p>

              <p>I think it is good to chat when the topic is good, no harm done,
              as taxi Driver, we also cannot put ourselve inside a cocoon, need
              to ask and talk to people of different trade, exchange view and
              keep ourselve abreast of what is happening.</p>
              <p>But of course, you must know where you stand, not to overly
              indulge into debate that determine who win or lose kind of silly
              stuff, just be moderate, humerous and humble. Just ah ah, ok
              ok,,...can also give people an impression of proud TD, but that is
              also fine, people will just go along.</p>
              <p>For me, when the topic frequency is right with the paxs, I can
              also make them very happy, in return, I feel less stress and tire,
              as good conversation alway helps to keep me awake and somehow, long
              journey become short when we are in conversation.</p>
              <p>A good humerous conversation will alway leave a long trail of
              smile our face, I think all of you would had experienced it, you
              get a good guy talking happily with you, even after both had
              parted, you just smile along driving, and accordingly to mind
              happiness, the longer that smile hang on in your face, the more
              jovious and happy is the encounter.</p>
