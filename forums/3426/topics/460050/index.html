              <p><a href="http://www.tremeritus.com/2012/10/13/new-gps-tracking-to-replace-current-erp/"><strong>A new GPS system of charging self-drive commuters adds 
              pressure to switch to public transport. Motorists to be hit in the 
              pocket again.</strong></a></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.tremeritus.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ERP.jpg?9804ec"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-55350" title="ERP" src="http://www.tremeritus.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ERP.jpg?9804ec" alt="" width="259" height="195"></a>As
               one of the world’s most expensive countries for car-owners, Singapore 
              has started to test a new satellite-tracking technology to tax vehicles 
              on congested roads.</p>
              <p>The government plans to use the Global Positioning System (GPS) to 
              track cars on congested roads and highways and charge them levies. If 
              necessary, this may replace the current annual road tax.</p>
              <p>Satellite tracking will replace the current Electronic Road Pricing 
              (ERP) system that uses some 80 electronic gantries located at various 
              busy expressways and in the city centre.</p>
              <p>The GPS trial began in May on a stretch of Woodlands Avenue 12 not far from the Causeway, said the <em>Today</em> newspaper, quoting the Land Transport Authority (LTA).</p>
              <p>The replacement of road gantries would happen in the space of 18 months, it added.</p>
              <p>When operational, the new technology can change the travel habits of 
              nearly a million motorists in the republic as well as visiting Malaysian
               drivers.</p>
              <p>This new form of charging motorists may make it even more expensive 
              to use a car in Singapore. For the state Treasury, it will be a more 
              effective source of revenue.</p>
              <p>It will be a step closer to the day when operating a car in space-challenged Singapore will be out of reach of the middle class.</p>
              <p>The new system’s other capabilities include better traffic control 
              like catching speeding vehicles and those which beat red lights, 
              spotting illegal parking or tracking hit-and-run drivers.</p>
              <p>It can help find stolen cars, assist police in solving certain types of crimes, and aid in tracking offenders.</p>
              <p><em>The Straits Times</em>, however, warned: “Singaporeans will have 
              to watch not only their back, but high in the sky whenever they think of
               committing a traffic offence.”</p>
              <p>The authorities can also – if they want to – use it to keep track of the movements of political foes.</p>
              <p>“Big Brother will be watching you!” exclaimed one blogger.</p>
              <p>A web surfer said it would really bring things to a whole new level: 
              “In future your car would be watched every hour of the day, seven days a
               week. And that’s just plain creepy.”</p>
              <p>A transport official mentioned no launch date, but said these are 
              still early days. It could be a few years before all problems are ironed
               out and the system becomes fully operational.</p>
              <p>He said: “(The trial area) Woodlands Avenue 12 is a suitable site as 
              it is a relatively straight road with high traffic volumes, and a good 
              mix of different vehicle types.”</p>
              <p>The way our population is expanding, there is little prospect of the 
              motorist avoiding the move away from the car to public transport, 
              however crowded it may be.</p>
              <p>It does not augur well for the aged, the sick and the handicapped. 
              Official projections see the population reaching 6.5 million, but land 
              space will remain the same.</p>
              <p>A plethora of taxes, some uniquely designed in Singapore to reduce 
              the car population and private car usage, has succeeded well in two 
              areas – cutting traffic jams and lightening the burden on Singaporean 
              pockets.</p>
              <p>There are few countries where buying and operating a car is more 
              expensive than in Singapore. Any elected government that tries the same 
              measures will be out the door in the next election.</p>
              <p>As a result, Singapore has only 12 cars per 100 people, half of Hong Kong’s 24.</p>
              <p>The taxes imposed on private cars in Singapore are so devilishly 
              complex that it would take a whole chapter to list them and explain how 
              they work.</p>
              <p>The purchasing costs include these mind-boggling factors: 
              registration fee, cost price, road tax, COE (certificate of 
              entitlement), additional registration fee and Customs duty.</p>
              <p>Understandably, many Singaporean buyers do not fully understand them; they simply pay – and grumble.</p>
              <p>Increasingly, young professionals are emigrating to countries where cars are a lot cheaper.</p>
              <p>Here, a medium-sized 1,600cc Japanese car costs around S$120,000 
              (RM300,031), enough to buy a bungalow in many Asian countries. This is 
              twice the price 18 months ago following a surge in COE prices.</p>
              <p>How the government intends to operate the GPS system is anyone’s 
              guess. But it will have more options than the current gantry technology.</p>
              <p>For example, it may impose a road levy charging the motorist 
              according to mileage covered, the time of usage or the location – or any
               combination of the three.</p>
              <p>If it replaces the flat annual road tax, it could mean that the 
              charge meter could start running the moment the owner drives his car out
               of his house.</p>
              <p>“Under satellite tracking every time he drives to the corner coffee 
              shop for a toast-and-egg breakfast, he pays for using the road,” a 
              veteran taxi driver explained.</p>
              <p>An advantage is that he may no longer pay an annual road tax, which could benefit infrequent motorists.</p>
              <p>In time, the GPS method of charging may become even more unpopular than the current electronic gantry system.</p>
              <p>Some people believe it would be implemented either long before or after 2016, the next general election.</p>
              <p>The whole thing is part of the government’s strategy to get Singaporeans out of their cars and into public transport.</p>
              <p>City planners want 70% of peak-hour trips by Singaporeans to be on trains and buses eventually.</p>
              <p>The way to do it is to hit commuters in the pocket.</p>
              <p>Years ago, an enthusiast who ran a special car blog estimated that a 
              Singaporean must earn S$7,650 (RM19,125) a month to be able to buy and 
              operate a car without financial stress.</p>
              <p>At that time, the average family income was S$7,000 (RM17,500) a month.</p>
              <p>That led to his conclusion that “a car has become a luxury item in Singapore”.</p>
              <p>.</p>

              <p><em>Chiang Nee has been a journalist for 40 years. He is a 
              true-blooded Singaporean, born, bred and says that he hopes to die in 
              Singapore. He worked as a Reuters corespondent between 1960-70, based in
               Singapore but with various assignments in Southeast Asia, including a 
              total of about 40 months in (then South) Vietnam between 1966-1970. In 
              1970, he left to work for Singapore Herald, first as Malaysia Bureau 
              Chief and later as News Editor before it was forced to close after a 
              run-in with the Singapore Government. He then left Singapore to work for
               The Asian, the world’s first regional weekly newspaper, based in 
              Bangkok to cover Thailand and Indochina for two years between 1972-73.

              <p>Taxis cannot be in the bus lane la. Which country allows that? Imagine 26,000 taxis using the bus lane, bus use what lane.</p>
              <p>Taxis will start stop to pick drop pax, bus lane will be worse than other lanes.</p>
              <p>Taxis are not public vehicles, public service vehicles maybe.</p>

              <p>Agree. As usual, they will solve it by increasing call charge, increasing peak period charge, etc... End result, less people taking taxis and more taxis driving around empty. Win-win situation for them.</p>

              <p>This started with ERP. ERP was supposed to reduce road conjestion in the first place. Since it is not effective, go for GPS tracking. Tax the heaviest road user. Heaviest road users are off course Taxis drivers lah.</p>
              <p>It is like saying, taxi drivers got nothing else better to do but drive around all over Singapore roads all day to sightsee. Taxis are the major cause for road conjestion. Taxis are private vehicles.</p>
              <p>Taxi drivers are private car owners, with lots of time on their hand, to drive all around Singapore, causing road conjestion all over the island, for other private car owners who don't drive taxis.</p>

              <p>Well, you can't base just on one month. It's all yearly basis. Like car salesman, sometime one month sell one car; some month 0; some month sell 3 - 4 cars. Like today middle of the month and raining, no mood to drive. Throw rental bring wife and son go jalan jalan.</p>
              <p>Last year, total 70 days never drive. End of year consolidation $3x,xxxx.</p>
              <p>I am not like u all, think too much. Use to stay in JB 16 years. Like a slow and easy life. Unlike u guys, I got something to fall back on. Just sold my old place in JB. Going to buy a new one nearer to LegoLand Malaysia.</p>

              <p>Nope. U think about it. If to "cruise looking for
              passengers will be hit the hardest." Then people going to complain "No Taxis" again. By then I will just join LV and wait at hot spot. Everyone will do the same cos u cruise u pay. Then might as well sit and wait.</p>

              <p>I think it can be both good and bad for TD,</p>
              <p>For the bad, it means more surcharges, and who is going to bear for it, and like most of you guys here saying, drive taxis better than buying cars, can use taxis as own to do some personal stuff, given the higher cost of operating pte cars, more taxis drivers will be on the road.</p>
              <p>For the good, it might not really affect us, as consumers, the pax will bear the cost of such implemention, on the other hands, many will give up driving and take public transport including cabs, this will help to elevate the excessive cabs on the road.</p>
              <p>What I forseen in the next 5 years, COE is never going to go down, it is something govt are able to get as people are still buying, but less, but less doesn't imply less income for govt in term of such high COE, it is like one person now buying a car is equal to 3 persons paying the COE few years ago.</p>
              <p>Next is that for TD, my guess is our trips will get lesser in term of distance, because as public transport become more availiable for peoples, peoples will tends to take a mixture of bus Mrt and Taxis, most will end up at MRT stations waiting to take a cab or taking a cab to MRT station, which is expanding substaintially</p>

              <p>We pay daily rental of $100. Works out to $3000 per month. Everything covered except accident. In an accident, taxi driver is guilty unless proven innocent. Maintenance cost questionable. If car breakdown and your radiator low water, you have to pay for replacement of whole engine. Many more examples I believe bros here can contribute.</p>
              <p>Owning a car costs around $1800 per month. There is a good breakdown of the costs involved here. <a href="http://www.moneysmart.sg/frugal-living/ride-or-drive-the-cost-of-car-ownership-vs-public-transport-in-singapore/">http://www.moneysmart.sg/frugal-living/ride-or-drive-the-cost-of-car-ownership-vs-public-transport-in-singapore/ </a>You sell the car, you get back something.</p>
