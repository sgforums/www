              <p>Many of the pioneer TransCab drivers I know still there,
              Especially those white with single digit number and crown started
              with 75xx. They might change vehicles, but their headcount still
              within the capacity of Trans. So what make you so upset, me
              interested to know also.</p>

              <p><br>Cdg can now be relief, OMO long waiting list, I believe you still stand a chance to join back, can appeal to your MP or someone on top to help you, today govt are more helpful, and cdg is not so unreasonable to terminate a person for life, it is all up to you.</p>
              <p>Lower yr ego and pride abit and you can be driving for them, afterall, due to full OMO, there is a high need for relief cdg cabbies.</p>

CDG don't own by me or any TU, there's no such things call lose face also. No money lagi lose face. Joining back CDG?

              Chief, after 54yo, if you still want to drive further , can contact
              me, now mostly cremate one, easier to drive.</p>
              <p>Lan sai lah, taxi driving only, here cannot drive, go there
              drive lor, worst come worst, like me,  go take one on daily
              basis at those daily rental kiosk.</p>
              <p>Take it easy with taxi, alway remember why you want and become a
              TD, to be free from those corporate politics where the higher
              salaried get higher and so on, to be free from strict time
              management, to be free from some stupid superior who know nothing
              more than you and yet can F you like a dog or worst, back stab you
              until you also dunno what is happening. All in all, the main
              objective is to get a more free life other than those in debt.</p>
              <p>You do not owe the taxis companies, nor do they owe you
              anything, never set close relationship with taxis companies, they
              are just a body that rent you the taxis, nothing more, nothing
              less, can drive, drive on, cannot, fark off. There are many thing
              to work on in this world, not just taxis driving, the key is you
              want to do it or not.</p>

              </p><p>Trust me, CDG had become much better in term of administrative parts, except operation wise still need to buck up. Overall, coming back to CDG don do anybody harm. If your main concern is on their call system which I analyze from your post, just ignored it, anyway you have LV, don even need to bother the MDT like many of my friends do.</p><p>

              <p>Knn, many peoples still fail to see the ugly side of business, business is a transaction, a body by itself without any feeling, turns of events can happen anytime, that is the risk of it, you can go on and blame the adminstrators, the controllers, the CEOs, the bosses, or whoever that control it, but the problem is business, once business turns good, everyone no give problem, once business turn for the worst or expect to become worst, all kinds of pattern will surface.</p>
              <p>Everybody wants to gain, who want to loose, but someone must loose, and it is alway the lower peoples that loose out, not only taxi companies are speechless in their approach, all companies or any profitable organisations, so to speak, are the same, good time, all ok, bad time, knnccb, start to cheat you. And that why I alway said, we are the pawns of Taxi companies, they can easily exploit us, their decision change our life, our family and childrens way of living, our livinghood. But who care about all this, cos nobody owe you a living.</p>
              <p>Life goes by in stages, there will be twists and turns, take it as a challenge, new style, new condition, new begining, too long with the same company, same style, same routing can only end up with complacency, that makes one reluctant to changes, but like it or not, the world is changing, and change is part of our life stages.</p>
              <p>Go for it, chief, change and come tell us how good is Silver</p>
