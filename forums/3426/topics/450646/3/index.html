              <p>I want to add ....</p>
              <p>TransCab were considered good before fare adjustment .</p>
              <p>Their blunders that begin to cause their downfall , it's their delaying tactic to follow suit with the rest , or the market leader. They took almost 3 weeks to follow or fit into the new pricing .  After a substancial amount of returned taxis . Blunder no 1 .</p>
              <p>And when they finally follow suit , they took off the Sunday's whole day MBS surcharge of $3 . Blunder no 2</p>
              <p>Why they chose to take it out ?</p>
              <p>Their reason ? MBS dun allowed transcab to apply the surcharge .</p>
              <p>In Singapore , taxi fare is liberalised , as in taxi company has the rights to set their own fare and value added services , they expect us to believe that xcuse ? Their ultimate objective is to force us to take calls , which they had implemented a $0.40 and $0.30 levy respectively . If we kept going to MBS to take that fare , who's there to take their calls and calls means revenue for them ? Call levy another blunder , Blunders no 3 .</p>
              <p>They also famous for copying cat Comfort , right ?</p>
              <p>If wanna copycat CDG , they must also copy cat their accident access policy !</p>
              <p>Comfort 50-50 means 50-50 , black and white written nicely , u finish paying means the end . U quit also need to fulfill that written amount .</p>
              <p>Comfort in this case , never roti prata such issues .</p>
              <p>Comfort if everything goes well , your security deposit is secured . In less than one month , u'll get it back . Blunders No 4 .</p>
              <p>Is this good enough presentation to show to you , it's a "were" for them ?</p>

              <p>Once you kept us in suspense, you will expect many negative comments, is nothing wrong to be simple and righteous. Isn't what you been doing for Penjuru case? Your last moment in CDG, and you describe that as heroin act. So I'm expecting something more serious this time with TransCab. For your righteous act during CDG time, nothing seem to change until today.</p><p></p>

              <p>Many of the pioneer TransCab drivers I know still there, Especially those white with single digit number and crown started with 75xx. They might change vehicles, but their headcount still within the capacity of Trans. So what make you so upset, me interested to know also.</p><p></p>

              <p>TransCab were considered good before fare adjustment .</p>
              <p>Their blunders that begin to cause their downfall , it's their
              delaying tactic to follow suit with the rest , or the market
              leader. They took almost 3 weeks to follow or fit into the new
              pricing .  After a substancial amount of returned taxis .
              Blunder no 1 .</p>
              <p>And when they finally follow suit , they took off the Sunday's
              whole day MBS surcharge of $3 . Blunder no 2</p>
              <p>Why they chose to take it out ?</p>
              <p>Their reason ? MBS dun allowed transcab to apply the surcharge
              .</p>
              <p>In Singapore , taxi fare is liberalised , as in taxi company has
              the rights to set their own fare and value added services , they
              expect us to believe that xcuse ? Their ultimate objective is to
              force us to take calls , which they had implemented a $0.40 and
              $0.30 levy respectively . If we kept going to MBS to take that fare
              , who's there to take their calls and calls means revenue for them
              ? Call levy another blunder , Blunders no 3 .</p>
              <p>They also famous for copying cat Comfort , right ?</p>
              <p>If wanna copycat CDG , they must also copy cat their accident
              access policy !</p>
              <p>Comfort 50-50 means 50-50 , black and white written nicely , u
              finish paying means the end . U quit also need to fulfill that
              written amount .</p>
              <p>Comfort in this case , never roti prata such issues .</p>
              <p>Comfort if everything goes well , your security deposit is
              secured . In less than one month , u'll get it back . Blunders No 4
              .</p>
              <p>Is this good enough presentation to show to you , it's a "were"
              for them ?</p>

              <p>For this, I kept my reservation viewing on this. Only thing I wish to bring up is, before the fare hike 3 years ago...CDG nearly sink, that 'genius' who suggest on 35% fare hike, save CDG asshole until today. How did that can be happening? At the end TU suffers. But that's political issue, if we go on, will never ending. If you think your claim on that is righteous, so be it. Anyway Silver Star is a Mercedes right? </p><p>

              <p>Lan sai lah, taxi driving only, here cannot drive, go there drive lor, worst come worst, like me,  go take one on daily basis at those daily rental kiosk.</p>
              <p>Take it easy with taxi, alway remember why you want and become a TD, to be free from those corporate politics where the higher salaried get higher and so on, to be free from strict time management, to be free from some stupid superior who know nothing more than you and yet can F you like a dog or worst, back stab you until you also dunno what is happening. All in all, the main objective is to get a more free life other than those in debt.</p>
              <p>You do not owe the taxis companies, nor do they owe you anything, never set close relationship with taxis companies, they are just a body that rent you the taxis, nothing more, nothing less, can drive, drive on, cannot, fark off. There are many thing to work on in this world, not just taxis driving, the key is you want to do it or not.</p>
