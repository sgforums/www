              <p>again encountered quite a few times liao, the passengers, even ang mors, they are VERY suspicious the moment they board the cab. ask this ask that in a rude aggressive tone, even before telling the destination</p>
              <p>along the way they kept poking making accusations machiam every turn every traffic light like the driver out to con them</p>
              <p>if go the correct route, even take shortcuts, when reach liao, they insist must be half price or a fix price minus the spare dollars and cents, like instead of paying meter 12 or 15, pay a straight 10 or nothing.</p>
              <p>is it because really TDs had been too much? some nicer ang mors told me they were surprised local TDs behave the way they do when they first got here, pick and choose, chut patterns, attitude problem, but over time they realise thats the culture (bad habits) here and they learn to watch out and counter</p>

              <p>ya lor I also seldom encounter. On the contrary, if I fetch angmo, I try to have nice chat with them. Almost guaranteed a healthy tip. Nice chat with laughs, confirm plus chop sure get a tip exceeding $1. Yes even if my fucking sampan crown / cedric is dirty and noisy.</p>
              <p>But hor, locals hor. Fuck it lor. No point talking cock with them. Laugh too much, wait the fucking ccb local pax ask for discount or worse open door and run because they think u very good to makan. Locals must treat them fiercely and no mercy. </p>

              <p>The reason why some passenger feels TD is out to cheat them is mainly some TD in the past did cheat them by using the longer way. Even up to today, I still took some longer route because either I dunno the way well enough/not confident enough/making wrong turns.</p>
              <p>All the long routes are unintentional. Usually I admit to the customer when it happen and deduct the fare accordingly.</p>
              <p>I am not saying what you said is untrue, but the way you have put it is as if ALL customers are like that. I disagree and that is why I say u maybe too sensitive. I met quite a few customers who feel I am out to cheat them. I either ignore them or told them off.</p>
              <p>Eg, today I had a good example to share.</p>
              <p>I pick a pax from Woodlands area who told me to go AMK Ave 5 to a building which I have no idea of. Upon reaching AMK ave 5, I asked him every single time I come to a junction on where to turn. He gave me the instructions and only to found out later he has led me to a merry go round.</p>
              <p>After that, he had the cheek to blame me and said I should know the way. I gave him a piece of my mind in the most civil way I know and printed him a receipt so he can go and provide a feedback. As long as he pay, I dun care and let him go. Why do I need to fume over such pple? After dwelling on the incident for a while, I simply let go and drive on.</p>
              <p>Today is not a good day, but I have no problem with other pax.</p>
              <p>So SgCabby, dun get me wrong by thinking that I dun believe u. Just that I think we TD dun need to go to the extend of thinking negatively. It affect your ability to drive and in the end ur earnings.</p>
