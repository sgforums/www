              <p>In a road rage, an angry driver reversed his car into a stationary 
                  taxi. He then claimed that the taxi hit him, and tried to cheat the 
                  insurance company. <br><br> 31-year old sales manager Melvyn Chua Tong 
                  Ling was sentenced to four months jail. His lie was unveiled as the 
                  whole incident was recorded by the in-car camera in the taxi.<br><br> The road rage row took place at 6:30pm on 10th January last year. While 
                  Chua stopped to pick up his son on Ang Mo Kio Street 44, taxi driver Ng 
                  Chor Foo overtook him on the narrow lane by going onto the lane meant 
                  for oncoming traffic. Chua had tried to move off when the taxi cut in 
                  front of him, sparking an argument.<br><br> Cabby Ng tried to avoid the 
                  rage row by driving away, but Chua chased and overtook him, and slammed 
                  on his brakes to force the cab to stop. He then back up and crashed into
                   the taxi. When the Police arrived, Chua claimed that the taxi crashed 
                  into him, while cabbie Ng reported otherwise. They both went on to claim
                   from their insurance.<br><br> Chua pleaded guilty to charges of 
                  reckless driving, endangering the safety of both his son and the taxi 
                  driver and fraud claims made on his insurer. <br><br> For driving 
                  rashly, the maximum penalty is a jail term of up to six months, up to 
                  $2,000 fine, or both. Attempting to cheat carries a jail term of up to 
                  five years and a fine of $5,000.</p>

              <p>A sales 
                  manager, who was fetching his six-year-old son home, deliberately 
                  reversed his car into a stationary taxi. The next day, Melvyn Chua Tong 
                  Ling, 31, lied in an insurance claim that the cab had rear-ended him in 
                  January last year.</p>
              <p>He was jailed for four months on Wednesday. He had pleaded guilty on 
                  March 19 to driving rashly and endangering the safety of his son and 
                  cabby Ng Chor Foo, and to attempting to cheat First Capital Insurance of
                   $11,463 with the false insurance claim. District Judge Eddy Tham said 
                  that it was very fortunate that Mr Ng, 55, had captured the incident on 
                  the camera in his taxi. The footage was screened in court at last 
                  month's hearing.</p>
              <p>It showed that at 6.30pm on Jan 10 last year, Chua stopped his car 
                  along Ang Mo Kio Street 44 to pick up his son. As it was a narrow road, 
                  Mr Ng overtook the Chua's car by going into the right lane for oncoming 
                  traffic. Just then, Chua tried to move off but had to brake suddenly 
                  when he saw the taxi moving left in front of him. It then stopped some 
                  distance ahead to let a passenger disembark. Chua sped forward and swore
                   at Mr Ng for cutting into his lane.</p>
              <p>Wishing to avoid a confrontation, the cabby drove off. Chua pursued 
                  him and after overtaking the taxi, he jammed his brakes, forcing the cab
                   to stop. Chua then reversed his vehicle into the front of the taxi. The
                   next day, Chua put in his fraudulent claim at Ah Lim Motor Company in 
                  Ang Mo Kio.</p>
