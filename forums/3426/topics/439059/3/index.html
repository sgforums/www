              <p>yah bro i do agree with mercabs that walkie is actually a fast n efficient</p>
              <p>way to dispatch jobs unlike mdt sometimes cock up then need to call</p>
              <p>operator. Cause any prob we juz ask the control over the air theres a</p>

              <p>Technology change is okay but actually the real "call" market is very small. I would not want any lousy booking.</p>
              <p>Walkie-Talkie on air is currently the only solution for faster response in between members and controller. Current technology in whatever Apps still doesn't work. They are not in real time.</p>
              <p>Just like email - fax - down to telex and telephony and backward to Morse code.</p>
              <p>Old telephony still work just like your home telephone copper line. Power failure still okay.  If you subscribe to new coaxial cable digital phone line or the new fiber optic phone line. What happen if your AC power line trip and your Modem or Residential Gateway no power, so no phone ring. </p>
              <p>With the current Radio Wave talkie is okay with limited number of members and limited quantity of Good Passengers.</p>
              <p>It doesn't pose any threat to CumFuck ,Transcab or whatever companies.</p>

              <p>Here is my view on the MDT vs walkie issue:</p>
              <p>It is true that the walkie is very efficient and fast. It allows real time communication between caller and driver. Because it is based on public broadcasting, all taxi drivers who are on the same channel can hear it. This is where you got the biggest disadvantage. There are many taxi drivers who because they are unable to press the PTT button in time, they lost the job to another colleague. So out of frustration, they will mark the successful bidder and complain to the walkie group IC if the successful bidder is late even 1 minute for his job. So you bid 5 minutes and OTS only 6 minutes later. This loser TD will complain and try his best to get you suspended. These people who complain would rather invest their time and energy into 'policing' members who flout the rules than to bid for another job. Some even go so far as to go to the pickup point and see if the successful bidder made it in time.</p>
              <p>MDT is nowhere as efficient as the walkie. It is also not real time. But it has got the big advantage in that only you and the operator knows who got the successful bid. So you dont have to worry about TD politics. In TD trade, there are plenty of politics, especially in walkie groups. If most members like you, it is because you belong to some committee, or you got plenty of durians to share. In the MDT job bidding, if you cannot reach the destination in time, you can always call the pax and inform them. Yes some pax will not be happy. But remember you only got to contend with the pax and the operator. For the walkie bidding, you must contend with fellow TD as well, in addition to the pax and caller. For MDT jobs, as long as you dont 'no show', the operator is quite alright. By the way, I only bid for $45 and $50 durians on the MDT. The MDT strategy is the best when you got these time of durians. No doubt the levy costs $9.63 including GST, but in the end, you are able to grab more durians per day compared to the walkie. For the walkie, to be able to grab even 2 durians everyday requires considerable skill. And because you are that good, there will be plenty of 'sharks' on air observing you and will make a complain for the slightest mistake made to get you suspended.</p>
              <p>For normal cabs, I would say the walkie works rather well. LV is a good choice. Definitely better than the comfort MDT. But for limo groups, it may or may not be the best option. It all depends on your personal chemistry within the group, and also on the type of limousine you are driving.</p>
              <p>Good luck and happy hunting!</p>

              they are still the best when it comes to call. Willing to invest ,

              <p>cos they have economies of scale &amp; deep pocket. they get ST electronics which is a GLC to do the stuffs for them, per unit cost definitely lower than company like transcab or premier.</p>
              <p>IIRC, the last time CDG's booking system using GPS system costs about $23mil. Other than CDG, who can spend this kind of money?</p>

For me, personally speaking, smart phone bring alots of convienences and business, both in my contractual and partime TD works.  And frankly, i do use the MDT one, never even on it if there is one, nor do I use any walkie, off it when issued by those taxi kiosk. But my apps do help me to get lots of younger paxs, from executives in CBD to places where youngster mingle. I believe i created my own market here afterall, we are all businessmen, aren't we.</p></div>
