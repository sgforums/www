This will bring about a new begining and new motivation for members and staffs in LV. And as LV keep pace with the usage of technology, cumfuck call business will be worrying.</p>
              <p>From what i read here is peoples (members) wanted change, and change is inevitable, if not they will leave for the better, unless u want to become a frog porridge, organisation that can changes faster to adapt is sure to gain a better share of the market. But having said that, it is not easy, lots of hardwork and initial failure can happen, because, naturally, we do not like changes, we like to remain what we are, it will take a lots of consideration and determination to make a change. But like it or not, you must change.</p>

              change is inevitable, if not they will leave for the better, unless
              u want to become a frog porridge, organisation that can changes
              faster to adapt is sure to gain a better share of the market. But
              having said that, it is not easy, lots of hardwork and initial
              failure can happen, because, naturally, we do not like changes, we
              like to remain what we are, it will take a lots of consideration
              and determination to make a change. But like it or not, you must
              change.</p>

              <p>In term of technology, these radio station may be outdated but broadcasting the jobs over the talkie is the most effective way to dispatch the jobs fast &amp; efficiently.</p>

              <p><br>I did not dismiss it as ineffective, out of date maybe, people should learn to take new challenge, well, if you and LV want to stick to their way of running business, by all mean, it does not take a dime off me, my perspectives is on the posts here whereby people leaving for better pasture, lesser calls and so forth. It could be or could not be because of LV or other station.</p>
              <p>The difficulties of change arise of what is practiced and works now, you look at Nokia and samsung/apple, you look at border and amazon, you look at local breadshop and breadtalk, laptop and pads, today, HP is going to sell off, Nokia employed former microsoft boss to save them, local breadshop closing one by one. You changed to limo because you pre emptived a profit there, good for you, you are pro active enuf, the market today call for convienences, you cannot stop technology from invading any business, so it is best to take pre emptive measure to change for the better, LV will come up best of the best, books are selling lesser than ebook today, that is why popular's MD son resigned because his father refuse to change into ebook style of business, amazon come out to sell pad instead of books, so now you buy book thru net and download into their pad. Cumfuck is upfront and is going into touchless transaction that accept nearly all cards, the latest I heard is everyone is going to be given a pad like a MDT, where even the cabby go toilet or tea break also can know the calls and location. SIA business class is using ipad and so will the economy class, you go in, you are issued with a pad, can click on the back of a chair and start play games or watch movies of choices.</p>
