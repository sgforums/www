              <p>At 12mn .... CTE , always so clear , four lanes .</p>
              <p>The question is : Is there a need to cut in 4 lanes just to go to Lane 1 ?</p>
              <p>I was saying all along ...... this is never safe ! </p>
              <p>The safer way is lane by lane ..... swiftly .</p>
              <p>My driving instructor taught me it is safest if u see from the right mirror , the whole car behind ( including the view of the head light behind ) , then it is safest to overtake or filter in .</p>
              <p>I believe at my position , against his , he will not see my whole car .</p>
              <p>I did not say he committed an offense , it's the moron way of driving .</p>
              <p>U guys drive like that ? And enjoy to be with them on the road ?</p>
