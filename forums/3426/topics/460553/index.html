              <p>1st, bros i need ur opinion and what will u do, pls input.</p>
              <p>My friend went for an advance booking at PanPac Suite Somerset at 8am. Pax was late and came down at 8.10am. Told my friend he going 20 upp circular road. Upon reaching, my friend missed the 1st turn to upp circular rd, so he turned at carpenter st. He panic and called me saying dunno how to go. So i told him to cut thru the open carpark. But he missed again n turn to hongkong st. Eventually, he make a turn back n reached 20 upp circular road. Now the turning point is, pax (Indian) dun want to pay the fare of $18. He said he is late due to my friend not knowing the destination and wanna complaint. His appt time is 8.15am.</p>
              <p>My question is, can he just walk away n not pay?</p>

              <p>knn, why so many indians stories leh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First and foremost, when destination is reached, there is no such thing as not paying, unless destination is not reach, then maybe do not need to pay because the service rendered did not materialise,</p>
              <p>Meaning you did not provide the service, just like going to a restuarant and eat, you can complain wrong food, food ordered come so late, this and that, but once you eat the food, you hv to pay, you can waive all the other charges, but the food taken must pay, but if you walk out of the resturant without eating or even the first taste only tell you off, you do not need to pay, because the service is not complete.</p>
              <p>Do not get conned by Indians, especially those flawlan or fallen talents, they take the hard, never the soft, once you are soft, that is it, they are very good in taking down with people who they think got lower IQ. And they are also very good in exposing your mistake and take full advantages of it.</p>
              <p>What ever happen, just be cool, tell him to pay or both can go police station, if he wants to complain go ahead, be tough on your stand, you can give discount, but never the no paying and free trips. Once he paid and drop off, call your company, any Dro or in-charge, tell them about this problem so that when they receive a call from that farker, at least they know the picture better. If you do no make a call, then abit jiak lat liao.</p>

              <p>can discount but cannot don't pay. bring them to police station they still have to pay for the fare to police station.</p>

              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Now you know why I avoid them?</p>
              <p>I dunno why so many TDs especially CDG (I am one myself) find their calls so steam one?</p>
              <p>I really can't understand. I dunno why some drivers will wait for more than 5 mins except very early morning departure (advance before 6am).</p>
              <p>I will unlikely face your problem because I make it a point not to accept calls without name. No auto booking for me. I must know pax name and from it I will decide if I want to pick this pax up.</p>
              <p>Indian - forget it, 95% will be FT, and local Indians seldom want to pay booking fees. So only FT usually because it's on company tab, if not they would take a bus. Yes they damn cheapskate one.</p>
              <p>In the rare instances I do take auto booking, I will never wait more than 5 mins, maybe only after midnight where there is no possibility of getting another pax nearby - ulu locations. Never main road with a lot of cruising taxis. Never take advance from HDB block, you're likely to kena play out.</p>
              <p>Nowadays market is tight, pax are fewer, taking calls can be very tricky. Sure you get that $3 or so extra, but what happened if you kena go Sengkang, Woodlands or CCk, especially night shift drivers?</p>
              <p>Can you really expect to get a pax from there to bring you to areas with more pax waiting for cabs?</p>
              <p>Max you can get is around $25, but the time to travel there and back is it worth it? It may take you more than an hour to get back to the zone again. Is $25 fair for more than 75 mins until the next fare?</p>
              <p>So pls treat calls very carefully.  Morning shift maybe can cari makan in most places but night cannot.</p>
              <p>Turning to your incident and Tcsaa's pls listen to Bowah and Pntc's advice. Never give a free fare, always call your company first to alert them and make sure you give a discount for any error of yours. As for pax late to board, you can't take that as an excuse, you had the option of pressing No Show which you didn't take, that makes the pax as even as far as blame is concern, his mistake has been wiped out because you waited.</p>
              <p>And pls don't go calling pax on Hp unless midnight and ulu place where it's better for you anyway to take the call, Once you call the pax, you commit yourself to waiting extra for him. Of course more than 20 mins, you have a right to leave, but if he comes ard 10 mins later, the company will side with him, because you gave a promise and agreed to his demand to wait a bit because you called him.</p>
              <p>Hp is yours not company's, why waste your own money? You have no obligation to call him, why do so? For me, I will just say, never pay bill, only can receive incoming, no outgoing, how to call?</p>
              <p>For thread starter, since this was a call, the pax can be traced, pls inform the DRO, give your side of the story and most probably they will refund your fare. They will of course apologise to the pax - pax seldom wrong in their eyes. But they comppany most prob will refund your from their own account, if you explain nicely to DRO and ask for help.</p>
              <p>For Tcsaa, I'm afraid your case quite difficult to refund because the locations are very near. 313 to Killiney should never be more than $15 even with CBD surcharge and call. If no call, that means it should not exceed $10. Here it's $25 and the amt of time spent looking for it. The blame has to go to you mainly, company unlikely to side with you.</p>
              <p>Just take it as a lesson and experience.</p>

              the way i see
              go gather your group of friend(tds)
              learn the road, do revision daily. take out some trip and see any alternate road available
              learn how to communicate with pax when given a destination which td is not familar or which best route to take
              learn how to handle non paying pax, ( best is also have clear instruction from individual taxi company whom td hire the taxi)
              learn how to get help instantly if both td and pax does not know the way or location
              only with all this knowledge then one can possiblel avoid all this nonsense 
              it serve no point starting a thread here as it is almost a repeat from many others thread which has already given many form of answer,
              why not ask your friend to register and come here to post, if they are not interested to find their answer, why should it be you?
              
              remember driving taxi cannot be alone, you need friends (tds) also for all kinds of reasons to be on the road
              
              when ever it is close to a makan gathering , i always like to say this
              
              come and meet the old birds and you will get to hear many tds driving experience for many different cases
              especially some news bird who just started, they come and ask lots of questions and most in fact all are given very good solutions.
              
              wantaxi, you stay ang mo kio, can't you just invest a little time and money(buffet price)
              to get yours answer?
              
              Think about it.  don't be so shy

              <p>I started this thread so as to ask bros question using 1 thread
              rather than creating multi thread. </p>
              <p>1st, bros i need ur opinion and what will u do, pls input.</p>
              <p>My friend went for an advance booking at PanPac Suite Somerset
              at 8am. Pax was late and came down at 8.10am. Told my friend he
              going 20 upp circular road. Upon reaching, my friend missed the 1st
              turn to upp circular rd, so he turned at carpenter st. He panic and
              called me saying dunno how to go. So i told him to cut thru the
              open carpark. But he missed again n turn to hongkong st.
              Eventually, he make a turn back n reached 20 upp circular road. Now
              the turning point is, pax <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">(Indian) </span></strong></span>dun want to pay the fare of $18.
              He said he is late due to my friend not knowing the destination and
              wanna complaint. His appt time is 8.15am.</p>
              <p>My question is, can he just walk away n not pay?</p>

              <p>If it is me, I don't see race. Don't understand why you mentioned it so elusively.</p>
              <p>I am an Indian Taxi Driver by the way. I won't be a pussy like your friend.</p>
              <p>If it is me and I have been in these situations. I will get out of my taxi and get violent.</p>
              <p>I know Police! is behind! but I must know where the Taxi Cab Fare Cheater! is staying! before calling Police.</p>
              <p>My question is, what is your friend's race and what did he do?</p>

              <p>Tks for all bros for the inputs. I really appreciate it. Be it positive or negative. Each n everyone is entitled to his or her view. And I wish to clarify that I'm not pin-pointing to any race or person. If I do make u feel so, then I apologise here. Sorry Bro PS2U.</p>
              <p>But every race got their fare share of lousy pax. Be it chinese, malay, indian angmo, there bound to be some nasty.ones. I accept every comment with open mind n heart. I believe more in inner self. If u think positive, then positive. If negative then it will be. And I saw CDG mentioned here, but my initial thread there isn't CDG mentioned. </p>
              <p>To conclude, we human interpret things differently. Just like Bro poolman started a thread on which taxi stand u hate most. Some say this, some say that. So is still individual. </p>
              <p>My statement might not be accepted by all, as one person cannot satisfy all. </p>
              <p>Thanks once again.</p>
