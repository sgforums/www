              <p>I started this thread so as to ask bros question using 1 thread
              rather than creating multi thread. </p>
              <p>1st, bros i need ur opinion and what will u do, pls input.</p>
              <p>My friend went for an advance booking at PanPac Suite Somerset
              at 8am. Pax was late and came down at 8.10am. Told my friend he
              going 20 upp circular road. Upon reaching, my friend missed the 1st
              turn to upp circular rd, so he turned at carpenter st.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> He panic and
              called me </strong></span>saying dunno how to go. So i told him to cut thru the
              open carpark. But he missed again n turn to hongkong st.
              Eventually, he make a turn back n reached 20 upp circular road. Now
              the turning point is, pax (Indian) dun want to pay the fare of $18.
              He said he is late due to my friend not knowing the destination and
              wanna complaint. His appt time is 8.15am.</p>
              <p>My question is, can he just walk away n not pay?</p>
              </div>

              <p>Get a Garmin GPS.</p>
              <p>If pax never pay anything, your friend should complain to the company which gave him the booking.</p>
              <p>Why your friend so stupid that he cannot post this himself?</p>

              <p>Tks for all bros for the inputs. I really appreciate it. Be it
              positive or negative. Each n everyone is entitled to his or her
              view. And I wish to clarify that I'm not pin-pointing to any race
              or person. If I do make u feel so, then I apologise here. Sorry Bro
              PS2U.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">But every race got their fare share of lousy pax.</span></strong> Be it chinese,
              malay, indian angmo, there bound to be some nasty.ones. I accept
              every comment with open mind n heart. I believe more in inner self.
              If u think positive, then positive. If negative then it will be.
              And I saw CDG mentioned here, but my initial thread there isn't CDG
              mentioned. </p>
              <p>To conclude, we human interpret things differently. Just like
              Bro poolman started a thread on which taxi stand u hate most. Some
              say this, some say that. So is still individual. </p>
              <p>My statement might not be accepted by all, as one person cannot

              <p>Agree with you bro. Don't stereotype a particular race, because of "ONE" Incident.</p>

              <p>Tks RBS for the reply. That's isn't any last minute changes. Just that, everything was on time and the pax reason is, change cab number then no advance charge. We also work according to the MDT prompt. We won't anyhow argue also. To me, arguement goes no where. Might as well think of a better things to do. </p>
              <p>I'm a newbie abt 8mths on the road. I like 1 type of food. "PIE". I always eat that. It bring me a long way. I'm in the forum to rant. I accepted and understand most bros posting with a open heart and mind.</p>
              <p>Bro Techno, coy spoke to him n he LL also got to pay. It is the mentality of a person. It is how we perceived things. It is always 2 sided. </p>

              <p>What no reason pax will be angry, once i took over a replacement with more than half an hour mdt call from cdg, I called cdg operator, she said replacement can charge $8.</p>
              <p>But when pax saw my crown and plate nos different, tho he knew but he straight away said no advance booking, then called cdg on why send a crown and a clown driver. I lan lan, slowly slowly drive him to AP with a smiling face, then he gets quite annoyed and asked what so funny? So I told him, a clown alway smile.</p>
