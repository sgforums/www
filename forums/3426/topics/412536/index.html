              <p>1) On 5 October 2010 @ about 820pm, i left my office at PLAB and wnet outside to wait for a cab. To my surprise all cab was on call with ppl inside. This confort cab 4503 came in &amp; was shown on call. He make a uturn @ RASF Roundabout @ airport road when to Car Park 1 than make the uturn again. For 20mins, the driver was like making his rounds waiting for the caller. Is his cab really on call? I flag him down and he went to the bus-stop and than rest @ the bus-stop @ Airforce School. I then approce him and ask if i can take his cab, to my surprise, he told me to wait for other cab. The bus came about 850pm and to my sirprise, the taxi driver wnet to his cab to switch his on call to green light and than drive off. WAT TYPE OF TAXI DRIVER IS THIS???</p>
              <p>2) Y r there no taxi stand @ PLAB Roundabout? Alot of ppl trying to take cab from there between 5pm to 9pm daily but no cab available. Always nid to go main road. Good money all dunwan to come.</p>

              Let me make a guess...
              
              1. At 8.20pm, he got a call at PLAB from outside PLAB so he take the trouble to drive all the way in hoping to earn more.
              
              2. But upon reaching PLAB, the pax cannot be contacted or HP signal no good, so he went deep into the round about driving in circles, hoping to contact his pax
              
              3. When you flag him, he couldn't take you cos already on-call so went to bus stop to rest or wait
              
              4. Lastly, call was cancelled, frustrated he went off, cos many cheapo pax like to play tricks like calling cabs to come to remote places and cancel the call and flag on the street hoping to save on the on-call charges

              <p>What we know is that he is a very frustrated taxi driver. Pax play him up, make him waiting, and could not be bothered to call to cancell booking.</p>
              <p>Imagine how much potential income he lost because of this single incident? Not counting he got to bear the unreasonable complaint from your type of pax.</p>

              Regarding this slowing down and moving off stance you see some taxi drivers doing is all the work of ComfortDelgro Mobile Data Terminal
              
              The MDT always assign jobs to taxi drivers when
              1. They are about to move off from a stationery position
              2. They are about to stop from a moving position
              
              I don't know why, maybe some lao jiao / CDG can explain 
              
              so you kenna one is from 2. 
              imagine you kenna from 1. , some driver may call you to alight after you just sit downsaying got call come in

              <p>I can only speak for CDG ( Comfort &amp; Citycab). When CDG cabs flash " On Call" sign, it must be genuine. It is activated by on board computer and there's no way the driver can input it manually. When waiting time for pax expired, the driver did a "no show" which reverts the roof-top sign to "TAXI".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Scenario painted by "Relief driver" is highly probable. He'd have thought you're the cheapo pax who called.</p>

              <p>Yes, scenario painted by ReliefDriver is probably what happened.  <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">ON CALL</span></strong> is triggered by the system, no way we drivers can manipulate it.  Only thing we can control is the <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">BUSY</span> </strong>and <strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">TAXI</span> </strong>and <strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">CHANGE SHIFT</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>Hence, after spending time circling around looking for his pax and waiting, of course he's going to tell you to wait for another taxi since the "call booking" is still active on his terminal.  Since he is making his round for about 20 minutes, more like than not he is played by his passenger since the max we can press on the terminal is 10 minutes.  When you see the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>ON CALL</strong></span> changed back to <strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">TAXI</span></strong> is most likely he pressed the <strong>NO SHOW</strong> and it's approved. This is also changed by the system, outside of our control.</p>

              <p><br>Thread starter complaint about Comfort taxis ...... is it wrong to say because the TS die die those army boyz call for a comfort , that cause CDG drivers to be picky ? Because Paya Lebar is their stronghold ?</p>
              <p>If like TransCab , nobody call us , but once got call at Paya Lebar to Jurong West , u think we dun take , nothing to pick about , just take , no complaints , or can call SMRT .</p>
              <p>I cannot  jeopardised any CDG's rice bowl , impossible , cos if Paya Lebar no calls , Tai Seng will have , if Tai Seng dun have , Macpherson will have , if Macpherson dun have , Kallang Pudding will have . If Kallang Pudding dun have , Stadium will have , if stadium dun have , Suntec will have etc ........</p>
              <p>I dun think i am wrong to enlighten those who loves to complain about CDG , start switching to other companies , but try not to call for a TransCab , we dun need this type of paxes .</p>
              <p>Try SilverCab , Smart , Prime , SMRT or even yellow tops .</p>
