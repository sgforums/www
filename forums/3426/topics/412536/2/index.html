              <p>I just take the paxes as they come along.  Maybe this is not working too smart lor.  Local, foreigners, aliens etc. As long as my meter runs, I will just take.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, don't know why... Started at 5:20pm and started plying the street.  For some reason, the only taxi stands I go to are those in Raffles Place area (have a personal favourite one).  But, when I start, I start plying the street in my area and yesterday, very gan dao.  For 1 solid hour, boh pax.  Was thinking, cannot be so sway mah... Then, when I made the decision to go into town, just as I pass the North Bridge Road gantry ($3, heart pain), plong... Call comes in at ..... Parkview Square.  Knn... Never mind lah, since haven't open business, just take lor.  Not bad, end up is a $20 ride and only to Stevens Road too.  So, my first pax yesterday is at about 6:30pm.</p>
              <p>Yet, despite the late first business, I still clock my targeted amount yesteday.  Hence, I start to believe that how much you earn per day is pre-determined one.  Maybe if I work smarter, I can keep car at 1am.  But, no offence to bros here, I myself don't like those cabby who either ignore street pax for calls or do interviews.  As I used to stay in Sembawang, I used to be on the wrong receiving end.  So, calls or street pax, I will still take.  Sometime, even when I am just stopping for street pax when the call comes in, I will just ignore the call and take the street pax.  As I have kenna no show or potong jalan cases before, my thinking is that here is a pax ready for me, why go for a call and risk losing the call pax as well? Maybe not very smart, but I take the current street pax, I can finish the job earlier and start looking for the next pax.  Go for the call and risk wasting time looking for the pick up location. Sometimes, Comfort's call is like playing hide and seek with you.  You pass the pick up location then you get the call.  End up, you need to go one big round to get to the place.  In the process, there are too many variables to content with.  Taffic jam lah, pax board another cab lah.  Jobs cancelled lah.. Having encounter 2 cancellations in a row, I began to appreciate the street pax that is coming into my cab vs the $3.50 call fee that I'm going to collect.</p>
              <p>There are drivers who solely operate around CDG calls.  That's their preference, their strategy.  For me, CDG calls is only good for me if I happen to land in a ulu place and need to get out.  (Even then, also not guaranteed got calls one.)  Street pax for me anytime. </p>
              <p>As a newbie, as long as I get to clock my targeted amount everyday, I don't care whether I do it by 12am, or 4am.  I "sgned" up for 12 hours shift.  If I do it by 12am, it simply means I'm going to earn a bonus for the night from the period 12am - 4am.  And if I do it by 4am, no grudge.  It's just an honest pay for an honest day's work. :)</p>

              <p>I just take the paxes as they come along.  Maybe this is not working too smart lor.  Local, foreigners, aliens etc. As long as my meter runs, I will just take.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, don't know why... Started at 5:20pm and started plying the street.  For some reason, the only taxi stands I go to are those in Raffles Place area (have a personal favourite one).  But, when I start, I start plying the street in my area and yesterday, very gan dao.  For 1 solid hour, boh pax.  Was thinking, cannot be so sway mah... Then, when I made the decision to go into town, just as I pass the North Bridge Road gantry ($3, heart pain), plong... Call comes in at ..... Parkview Square.  Knn... Never mind lah, since haven't open business, just take lor.  Not bad, end up is a $20 ride and only to Stevens Road too.  So, my first pax yesterday is at about 6:30pm.</p>
              <p>Yet, despite the late first business, I still clock my targeted amount yesteday.  Hence, I start to believe that how much you earn per day is pre-determined one.  Maybe if I work smarter, I can keep car at 1am.  But, no offence to bros here, I myself don't like those cabby who either ignore street pax for calls or do interviews.  As I used to stay in Sembawang, I used to be on the wrong receiving end.  So, calls or street pax, I will still take.  Sometime, even when I am just stopping for street pax when the call comes in, I will just ignore the call and take the street pax.  As I have kenna no show or potong jalan cases before, my thinking is that here is a pax ready for me, why go for a call and risk losing the call pax as well? Maybe not very smart, but I take the current street pax, I can finish the job earlier and start looking for the next pax.  Go for the call and risk wasting time looking for the pick up location. Sometimes, Comfort's call is like playing hide and seek with you.  You pass the pick up location then you get the call.  End up, you need to go one big round to get to the place.  In the process, there are too many variables to content with.  Taffic jam lah, pax board another cab lah.  Jobs cancelled lah.. Having encounter 2 cancellations in a row, I began to appreciate the street pax that is coming into my cab vs the $3.50 call fee that I'm going to collect.</p>
              <p>There are drivers who solely operate around CDG calls.  That's their preference, their strategy.  For me, CDG calls is only good for me if I happen to land in a ulu place and need to get out.  (Even then, also not guaranteed got calls one.)  Street pax for me anytime. </p>
              <p>As a newbie, as long as I get to clock my targeted amount everyday, I don't care whether I do it by 12am, or 4am.  I "sgned" up for 12 hours shift.  If I do it by 12am, it simply means I'm going to earn a bonus for the night from the period 12am - 4am.  And if I do it by 4am, no grudge.  It's just an honest pay for an honest day's work. :)</p>

              <p>But too bad that was the only 1 time i picked him.</p>
              <p>I can count the number of PLAB pax i have taken. PLAB times are erratic , not fixed unlike ST aerospace where the timing are always about there.</p>

              <p><br>I drive SMRT taxi, if I accepted a booking and fail to find the passenger, I will definitely call the passenger.  The worst kind of bookings is when the passenger register office number and when you call, it goes to automatic answering system.. Not saying you are using office number to book, but am just quoting an example of failed taxi bookings.  How many times we reach the destination, the pax goes away with other cab?   Customers can complain to LTA, but who should TD complain to?  We just LL and move off. </p>
              <p><br>I suggest you try drive taxi for a month, you will most likely delete your above complains.  I am sure all Taxi drivers take taxis before but not all passengers drive taxis before. </p>

              <p>WizQ were asking : " Just go down CBD from PLAB , just for that $3 , worth meh ?"</p>
              <p>2 scenarios .... 9pm</p>
              <p>U make a quick one at PLAB , to Woodlands .  </p>
              <p>Reached Woodlands say 9.35pm . $20 ?</p>
              <p>9.15pm from PLAB i reached CBD , grapped 2 CBD calls , say near near one , per trip $10 , 2 trips ....... all near near one .</p>
              <p>Yeah both $20 , u at Woodlands , me inside cbd ...still .</p>
              <p>I am ready for the next CBD call , WizQ are dashing down .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the conclusion ...... one might to faster to connect , but due to "undisclosed destinations" , makes the next connection unpredictable .</p>
              <p>That is why "many" cabbies now , adpoted " U go where ? " " Changing shift " technics , rather than grap a quick booking and see how .</p>
