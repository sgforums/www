              Taxi Drivers are not GST Registered. But they are working with GST Registered firms who collect GST. So Taxi Drivers have to collect GST for driving service. 
              
              Where does GST go and how it is used is anyone's guess.
              
              Who pays this? Consumer lah!

              <p>Any business that have an annual of 1 million profit before income tax turnover is eligible to apply for Gst so that whatever they bought in and sold out can be charged with Gst.</p>
              <p>Gst is a govt taxation, no one, not even company gain from it. In both way, you pay your supplier Gst (govt take), your customer who bought your goods also need to pay Gst, (again Govt take). So, you can see govt take from both sides.</p>
              <p>So, unless you are a one million dollars profit per year taxi driver, than you can charge your pax Gst. But up to now, I can't see any TD can make a million per year out of Taxis driving, or maybe our chief...</p>

              <p>I think hirers having cashless really helps in their rental payment but for relief - this does not benefit us - unless the TD is reasonably ok, don't need to roll money daily.</p>

              <p>Like I said once, some people (public) say we Tds are as low as prostitutes or treat us as such. Anyway like them we also in, out, in, out, as far as passengers go. Like them whoever also we must take (with some exceptions like them).</p>
              <p>So when the world's oldest trade accepts card payments fully, then I say ok, we also must accept. But now 2012, still they prefer cash, and so should we!</p>

              <p>They managed to do it on buses using EZ-Link. But taxis is a different ball game, so might be complicated.</p>
              <p>When you board a bus, the full fare is deducted first. When you alight, you tap your card on the reader to get the balance refunded from the full fare. Complicated right! but we or they did it.</p>
              <p>I know there is a song which is usually played on National Day titled We or They Did it. Not sure of the exact title.</p>
