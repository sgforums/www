              <p>If bus can do it, why can't taxi?</p>
              <p>We can use the same EZ card and the pax just need to scan the moment they board the taxi, like in the bus.</p>
              <p>Upon reaching the destination, another scan is done.</p>
              <p>If second scan is not done, a full fare of maybe $40 is deducted from the card like the full trip of a bus ride.</p>
              <p>For this reason, maybe the deposit need to increase to $40 or more to cater to this.</p>
              <p>
              </p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">This way can 100% solve fare cheaters. Safer for the TD too.(robbery)</p>

              i foresee 2 problems
              
              think ezlink has to have minimum $3 before can 1st tap.
              but what if taxi ride is $6? then 1st tap in is ok, but 2nd tap out is reject, then passenger say since is cashless, so no cash..then how? how do you ensure which passenger has $40 deposit or those that has less, or change law everyone must top up to at least $40? then those no money to top to $40 no need take public transport ride bicycle..from tuas to changi? and what if passenger ride more than $40? so check for $100 value? then if the whole queue or whole day, no passenger has $100 store value, means no take business liao?
              
              if let say, ideal scenario, customer has $100 value and ride is $10. the passenger is fine, the ride is fine, the payment goes thru fine also. then when driver check 3 working days later, the money never come in. then check with company, they say no such transaction..then how? cry father cry mother? write ding dong letters to authorities to check card owner details? will they even do it? what if passenger is not card owner? what if the card owner deny to pay already paid? sleepless nights just for $10?
              
              the difference between bus drivers (captains) and taxi drivers is, one is paid employee, the other is own pasar. paid employee is not responsible and liable for losses that passengers don pay, they can only report for management to take action, or at most they have a right to deny service to protect company interest. its the company's who need to ensure every passenger pay properly, so of cos they gan chiong, becos they care. taxi driver? the company is only to ensure that one single driver pay rent and any penalties. everything else is driver's own problem, UNLESS it affect company reputation or audit, like the famous Blues/Yellows

              <p> </p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">This minimum of $3 is for bus ride. if Taxi should come into the picture, a whole new scheme should apply. Same situation as in bus ride, if card value goes below minimum amount, pax can choose to top up or pay cash which amount can be total different. For 73cts using card, paying on cash might be $1. Just an example, I might be wrong cos I dun take bus. In addittion, pax should be ask to make a prepayment, equavalent to the amount of the trip. I find such things all all technical problems which can be iron out easily.</span></em></p>
              <p>if let say, ideal scenario, customer has $100 value and ride is
                  $10. the passenger is fine, the ride is fine, the payment goes thru
                  fine also. then when driver check 3 working days later, the money
                  never come in. then check with company, they say no such
                  transaction..then how? cry father cry mother? write ding dong
                  letters to authorities to check card owner details? will they even
                  do it? what if passenger is not card owner? what if the card owner
                  deny to pay already paid? sleepless nights just for $10?</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Err! which taxi company u working for arr? I dun see such problem in mine. Reimbursement for us is next working day, not 3 days. Payment once cleared on TD side, means clear, no dispute. no cry father cry mother. I think the issue lies in the company u chose to work with. Do u check every cashless transaction if they come in or not? I never need to. </span></em></p>

              first you yourself put the title taxi goes cashless. then now you suggest pay part cashless, part cash. you still didnt tackle the question what if cashless not enough pay but passenger no cash then how?  and you might see ikan bilis, but whos going to foot the bill and resources for 'ironing out all the technical problems' finally? whats their benefits? or are they going to charge another administrative or operational surcharge somemore? you kana run by passenger before or recently?
              
              about the cashless reimbursement. 3 working days is just a general figure of speech la, can be same day same time, up to individual operations not die die fix rule la! you sound like a couple my new drivers friends when they first start out. wha rumbling about how good how popular the system, they can take more passengers bah bah.. then one day 1 fellow the accounts cock up or what or system overhaul, i dont know, payment delay over 2 weekm, chase until those usual friendly faces all turn black. the other fellow, transactions not recorded haha, passenger refuse to cooperate for investigations. then now they both quiet liao. remember friend, when you dont have bird sht on your head, doesnt mean theres no bird, it means that bird thats going to bomb you havent fly over your head YET. dont need to say which company that which company this, all the same when sht happens. maybe later on, when free, you should check your cashless transactions, you might get 'surprise', thats how that 1 friend found out his $30+ transaction mia so long. sometimes something ignorant is better for health haha

              Cash is still king for some retailers, not only taxi drivers.

              <p>If bus can do it, why can't taxi?</p>
              <p>We can use the same EZ card and the pax just need to scan the moment they board the taxi, like in the bus.</p>
              <p>Upon reaching the destination, another scan is done.</p>
              <p>If second scan is not done, a full fare of maybe $40 is deducted from the card like the full trip of a bus ride.</p>
              <p>For this reason, maybe the deposit need to increase to $40 or more to cater to this.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">This way can 100% solve fare cheaters. Safer for the TD too.(robbery)</p>

              <p>Bus also can pay by cash mah, if got no EZlink.</p>
              <p>Just like when you shop, you can still paid by cash or credit or net is all up to you, the promotion of going cashless by some company is because of the profit from the service fees charged which go to the credit or net companies, j</p>
              <p>Jst imagine, every cashless earn these banks get some money out of your work and pax income.</p>
              <p>So, even if the bank is not operating, money still pours in, better than the On call centre, because you do not need to set up anything or employ operators to run for you.</p>
              <p>And to many, Cash is still king. Cashless only give paxs more options and cabby less adminstration on changes, but the ultimate gainer is still the Issueing banks</p>

              <p>Maybe I am wrong to say 100% cashless.</p>
              <p>What I mean if we can work quite similar as the current bus/mrt module but maybe on a bigger scale.</p>
              <p>Cashless is prefer but pax can also opt to pay cash but as in taking bus, the cost is priced high enough to discourage people from doing so, at least in the long run.</p>
              <p>Remember the speak Mandarin campaign? When it was first launched, remember all the protest and objections coming from everywhere? Now 20 over years down the road, these 50s, 60s auntie/uncle are taking to Mandarin like fish in water.</p>
              <p>Back to this topic, does all these auntie/uncle or for that matter, ah kong/ah ma got any issues with using a EZlink card? Not a very high percentage right?</p>
              <p>Many tourist also know how to get a "one day card" to travel around in  trains and buses.</p>
              <p>There will sure to be initial objections and rejection when new things are introduced, especialy by skeptic, but many a times, many of my pax compliment us on our cashless and fully intergrated seamless transport network. And if one of them happens to be from VISA, selling this network system to governmental bodies like LTA, it certainly speaks a lot of volume right?</p>
              <p>Who says paying cashless cannot have tips? After I go through my cashless deal today at airport, my pax handed my 2 purple notes for my tips.</p>
              <p>U guys never encounter cashless payment of example $13.50 and pax ask u to round out to $15.00 for cashless payment?</p>
