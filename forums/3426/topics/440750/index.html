              <p>less congestion lah, at least got improvement over no erp.</p>
              <p>in a democracy, one man one vote but everyone also got roles n responsibilities.i for one am embarrassed that i hv always criticised but couldn't contribute anything useful. imho, maybe more productive to focus our energy to find solutions and feedback.</p>
              <p>Yes, i've lived thru the 60s and compared to now, it was like a neighborhood near hell!</p>

              <p>So, what are you trying to imply here? PAP make us better or we ourselves make us better? Have you ever wonder if there is no PAP, and another Party or group took over, wouldn't it be the same or even better? Of course we could be worst, you have 7 siblings, I have 11 siblings, a football team, father coach, mother assistant coach. We tends to see thing in a very direct perspective, most failed to think out of the box, just live as what it is at face value. Of course PAP is good, because in the mid 60s, they had already destroyed all other parties, not one survived, because if any party survived, it will be a pain in the ass for the PAP. And so, the conclusion for people like you, breed by PAP, educated by PAP, trained by PAP and even lectured by PAP, will tends to say whatever they do is the best, and that is stigmatisation at it very best.</p>
              <p><br>What if in the 60s, there are 3 parties sharing the pie of bringing up singapore, wouldn't we be living in a much better condition, maybe less foreigners or less cost of living and less taxation. Competition enhance productivity and challenge to promote better future, that is why cab companies go into privatisation, and that is also why they got 7 companies here. I am not saying is no good, but if we got more parties of not more than 3 or 4, that maybe more perfect, maybe ERP will be more well defined.</p>
              <p>If you look at today political situation, just 6 with GRC inside only, the govt start to do better thing for singapore, bringing out the theme of Singaporean first, start to talk carefully and listen to the ground, start to reduce army services period, start to ask employer to employ singaporean and do not discrimination Singaporean, imagine, you are a Singaporean worker getting discriminated by Foreigner in you own country!, things start to move abit, but what is PAP had won 80 per cent votes and all seat taken back, you think they are going to do all these above???

                  value. Of course PAP is good, because in the mid 60s, they had
                  already destroyed all other parties, not one survived, because if
                  any party survived, it will be a pain in the ass for the PAP. And
                  so, the conclusion for people like you, breed by PAP, educated by
                  PAP, trained by PAP and even lectured by PAP, will tends to say
                  whatever they do is the best, and that is stigmatisation at it very
                  best.</p>
              <p><br> What if in the 60s, there are 3 parties sharing the pie of bringing
                  up singapore, wouldn't we be living in a much better condition,
                  maybe less foreigners or less cost of living and less taxation.
                  Competition enhance productivity and challenge to promote better
                  future, that is why cab companies go into privatisation, and that
                  is also why they got 7 companies here. I am not saying is no good,
                  but if we got more parties of not more than 3 or 4, that maybe more
                  perfect, maybe ERP will be more well defined.</p>
              <p>If you look at today political situation, just 6 with GRC inside
                  only, the govt start to do better thing for singapore, bringing out
                  the theme of Singaporean first, start to talk carefully and listen
                  to the ground, start to reduce army services period, start to ask
                  employer to employ singaporean and do not discrimination
                  Singaporean, imagine, you are a Singaporean worker getting
                  discriminated by Foreigner in you own country!, things start to
                  move abit, but what is PAP had won 80 per cent votes and all seat
                  taken back, you think they are going to do all these above??? Think
                  wise.</p>
