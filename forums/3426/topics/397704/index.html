              (the money-come action)<br> i asked how much again.... he said in a bery low dreamy voice....
              "i no on meter........"<br> i oso neber check the meter bcos it was blocked by the front seat
              and i was busy è¡¥å¦†-ing throughout the journey<br> sensing something not bery right, i quickly stuffed 2 x 2-dollar
              notes into his hands and faster got off the cab....and taken note
              of the carplate as he reversed and made 3-point turn to get out of
