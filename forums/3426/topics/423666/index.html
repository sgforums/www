              <p><strong>Beware And Take Note Of This Taxi Cheat That I Encountered One Month Ago</strong><br><br>On
               21/01/2011 at about 2003 hrs, I picked up an indian passenger along 
              chulia street. When he boarded my taxi, he told me to send him to boon 
              lay drive. During the journey, he started to struck up a conversation 
              with me. He said that he had been waiting for taxi for the past half an 
              hour and could not get one ( in mind I think he is waiting for peak hour
               to end then hail a taxi ). He then told me that he is working in a pub 
              inside boat quay and now very tired wanted to go home to and rest ( in 
              my mind i think he is talking nonsence because if you are working in a 
              pub you should be starting working now and not going home at this hour 
              ). When we are along AYE towards jurong he fell asleep.<br><br>But when I
               exit cooperation road, he woke up and starts to search for his mobile 
              phone. After that, he told me that he might have left his mobile phone 
              and wallet at his working place, instead of asking me to send him back 
              to retrieve his wallet and mobile phone. He told me to charge him a taxi
               fare of $50 and he will pay me the next day.<br><br>When we arrived at 
              blk 176 boon lay drive, he produce his NRIC and I took down his 
              particulars and his mobile phone number. He also took down my mobile 
              phone number. After that, he left.<br><br>The next day, he called my 
              mobile phone using a private phone number, he told me that his wallet 
              and mobile phone were lost and he had no money to pay me now and he 
              suggest to me to pay on monday which is 2 days later. After hearing 
              this, I know the fellow is an experience cheat, I told him that by 
              monday I don't hear from him I will report to the police. After knowing 
              that I will call the police, his tone change.<br><br>As I expected when I called his mobile phone, the number was never on.  So I make a police report.<br><br>Beware and take note of the below mentioned person.<br><br><strong>Name : Kartigesu , male : 35 yrs old<br>NRIC : S7642399G<br>Address : Blk 202, serangoon central #03-58<br>Mobile phone : 83157544<br><br></strong>Thanks to fellow TD from TU.com</p>
