              <p>Usually if I run out of small notes like $10s I will use $5s and $2s to make up the numbers. At the same time apologise to the pax that I run out of $10s so hope he/she dun mind smaller notes. Usually they paiseh paiseh says ok. Some of them have alot of coins so they ask me ok to take coins I more then happy to accept. Then I just have to make to trip to the petrol kiosk to buy a pack of ciggy to break down my big notes. If suay suay small notes also running low I will tell pax before hand I dun have change for $50 and ask them go cashless or wait for them to change on the way at kiosk.</p>
              <p>For me I think is driver should acommodate pax cos we are inm the service line. But if the pax is rude to begin with then he/she will kanna from me also loh....</p>
              <p>For example got once I tell the pax I run out of small notes liao he says in a rude voice "Wah lau eh, you drive what taxi. Now not early morning leh. Afternoon liao u tell me u no small change?" Then I take out my wallet and flash 6 X $50s and 1 X $100 and tell him off. "I change out more then $400 worth of small change so what u expect? KNN u sit from here(Geylang Lor 8) to Kallang MRT meter hardly jump u use $50 to pay. LIM PEH BUAY KE YAN ZAI LIAO...KA LIM PEH LO CHIA!!!"</p>

              <p>Small change always an issue .</p>
              <p>No point shouting at all .</p>
              <p>I have got $500 of $10 with me anytime , which i can accumulate more everyday .</p>
              <p>Just my luck i don't receive any $50 at all today .</p>
              <p>But once i banked in all the $10s into the bank , and left with say $60 of them , the next day , the $50 kept coming in , i dunno why like that ? Always the case .</p>
              <p>So how ? This is the time NETS and Credit card payment come in handy .</p>

              <p>It is true that some taxi drivers really though that they are the king of the road as if everybody driving must pray them (joss stick and offer oranges and apples) to them.</p>

              <p>As a TD, have to agree that some TDs got no manner, but there are also paxs who are very rude to us. For you case, even I do not have change, I will reply you nicely and both can find a solution as to how to settle the fare amicably.</p>
              <p>As the govt use to say, those no skill and do not want to upgrade, go taxi driving, so what you expect from TD, most do not how to express themselves and also do not comprehend what is good customer service. There are ah lau, ah seng, ah beng, ah bowah and many other driving taxis, we got very less education, yet this taxi companies never teach us customer service, only know how to collect rental fees or call us to lim kopi. Most of us have high temperment, and some of us do not know how to control it, therefore, end up talking like scolding people.</p>
              <p>If Paxs can understand us, we do not mean to be impolite, if we are good, we no driving taxis already. Unlike educated one, who can plan and priortise their life and work schedule, most TD work whatever come along.  So, end up some got debt problem, wife and mistress problem, money problems, driving stress problem, aging problem, summon problem, etc etc, I am not saying Paxs got no problem, they too have problem, but they know how to control and way to settle their problem, TD tends to have lots of thinking and suddenly, someone give him a $50 which he is not prepare to change, he burst out angrily with all the problems into the pax. Hope pax understand them.</p>

              <p>I think TD should get ready some 10 dollars even TD just start off shift. And also pax should understand that TD is not money changers that can everytime change big notes to small notes. Also pax should plan the route and get ready the amount that close to the trip before taking the taxis. if a pax take taxis eveyday to the same place he or she should know how much to pay the TD plus and mins 2 to 5 dollar different. And the most important thing for a nice pax is to tell the TD that only has 50 dollars before continue the trip.</p>
              <p>There no need to get angry for both side. come to the worse just drive to nearby ATM to get the money.</p>

              <p>Clear cut .</p>
              <p>Sometimes , talked to commuters also must have SKILLS .</p>
              <p>Not sweet talk , talk firmly , talk with senses , talk less offensively , commuters are generally okay .</p>
              <p>By talking , it's not always the end of the road , talking open up more options .</p>
              <p>Keeping your big mouth shut , for both party , means no good for everyone .</p>
