              <p> The surcharge menace</p>
              <p>WHILE more passengers may be choosing to book a taxi instead of flagging one down, I think it is presumptuous to attribute it to a stronger economy ("More book taxis in stronger economy"; Jan 18).</p>
              <div class="stleft">
              <div class="ststory_large">
              <p>I was back in Singapore recently for a short visit and without a shadow of doubt, it has become extremely difficult to flag down a taxi in the streets.</p>
              <p>Every time, I had to wait for at least 20 minutes to 30 minutes before I could get one. Many empty taxis zoomed past with the "on call" sign on, but none stopped at the taxi stand. Even those that were dropping passengers at taxi stands did not pick up new fare.</p>
              <p>On several occasions, I have seen rows of taxis waiting with engines idling at side roads with their "on call" signs on. One of those places is Queen Street.</p>
              <p>The taxi drivers are very smart. They know that if they ply the streets hoping to pick up passengers, it would be a game of chance. However, if they just parked at a street corner and waited for a booking, their chances would be far better.</p>
              <p>When the bookings come in, they can select a preferred one - for example, those going to the casinos or airport - and ignore those that they don't want - for example, those going to Tuas.</p>
              <p>And by waiting at corners like Queen Street, they know their chances of getting a fare go up exponentially. Orchard Road and Bras Basah are busy areas and cabbies are confident they will receive a booking within a couple of minutes.</p>
              <p>The reason cabbies prefer bookings over casual street fares is the multitude of surcharges they earn from taking booked calls. After having been away for two years, I was shocked to note, on my return home, how costly a taxi ride had become.</p>
              <p>For instance, one taxi ride cost $4.60, but the surcharges bulked up the total fare to $11.40. Isn't it bizarre that the surcharges add up to more than the actual ride cost? If a Singaporean like me is confused and annoyed, imagine what a tourist would be thinking? Most likely, that he has been ripped off. I can't recall any other place with such a convoluted taxi fare system.</p>
              <p>If we cannot live with a free-market system, let's switch to a full booking system like in New Zealand. The Land Transport Authority should be under no illusion that all is well and there is no need to fix the problem.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Long wait to book a cab</h1>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">ON JAN 31, I was at the VivoCity taxi stand trying to make a booking on the phone around 10.15pm and was appalled when repeated calls to all the taxi operators gave me either a busy tone or an automated message informing me that there were no cabs in the area.</h1>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">There are eight taxi companies in Singapore and an estimated 24,000 taxis plying the roads. The numbers may seem small compared to our current population, but it is still ridiculous to expect commuters to wait up to an hour before successfully booking a cab.</h1>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">During my wait at the taxi stand, I noticed many taxis driving in towards Sentosa on the other side of the road, and available taxis zooming by VivoCity. I believe that ever since Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) opened, commuters at HarbourFront Centre and VivoCity have had no luck with flagging down taxis as most cabbies would choose to pick up passengers from RWS because of the surcharge imposed.</h1>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">Can the relevant authorities please take appropriate measures to rectify this problem?</h1>

Everything now is ex, cost is high, so in order for cab to survive fare is consider low, ask him go japan take a cab see how much he pay than come n shout about the price he pay in singpaore, n note not every cab is doing booking.........</div>

              <p><br>That's the problem brother, with so many different type of surcharge and add on, sure TD will drive to greener pasture leaving those on the normal street, sea and ferryharbour port  empty unless connected. This is not TD fault, it is the peoples who make and implement the surcharge policies fault, TD like me also human, and human will go for bigger pie, even if you working, the other company pay more high and offer you, you also will jump ship, it is human nature.</p>
