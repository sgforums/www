                      Initially during the previous election was looking quite highly on this guy until the things he said and realise that the things he says no depth. Most of the things he mention was all attacking the problems but with no solutions. At a point even he had some solutions but was damn either unrealistic or contradicting. I think we need someone who can solve problems rather than finding fault or complain and complain....which delay important decision. For policy, I still believe that it should be done in the parliment which is alrdy there. Can you imagine when the law is passed down after parliment's debate...suddenly president don't mind his own business and go disturb disturb...I can imagine how messy it would be and a joke to our neighbouring countries.....The part I gave up on him was when he mention that he was a personal assistance to Mr Goh and say bad things abt him. Initially I was like quite interested in the topic but after that I think deeper, he as a PA should have some professionalism mah...but by doing this he macham act like some childish double-crosser or back stabber. This I cannot accept...can you? Furthermore I believe that Singapore is going through some economic tough times ahead due to the US debt default...the last thing I need is a troublemaker turning our stable political scene like Taiwan or similar...alot of country visit/invest in spore due to our political stablilty...like the last election, it shows the world although the election was very much contested but was still done peacefully without riot or casualty of the same sort like eg malaysia, thailand.. So when ppl come visit or invest in spore, we as taxi driver can earn more....Lastly I am not siding anyone but I only want the best for our small country as we do not have natural resources like our neighbours...any polical unstablity our country will be crush, then who suffer or who to blame???...still ourselves...Singaporeans........these are just some of my thought and I don't expect all to agree so don't flame me...hehe

              thats where you are off the mark..the prataman did do his assigned job for 12yrs and he did it to perfection, he truly deserved the pay they hand him for the job they wanted him to perform.
              
              his job is not doing anything significant for 12yrs. too bad he cant continued for another 12.
              but if any tom dick and harry could have screwed up on the very 1st day by asking irritating questions.
