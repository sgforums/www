              <p>If the manager or the general manager is a foreigner, his or her office staffs will slowly change to their country origin people, if indian, the office will be full of indians, if philippines, lots of pinoys and so on.</p>
              <p>Anyway retrenchment can be a blessing in disguise, it is time for management to trim and cut those redundant staffs including poor performers. Having getting some payment and get out of the company, you may land yourself in a better job or business. There is alway a way out for living people, just a matter of how you go look at or for it. Take it as a past that hardened your strength to be better, stronger and smarter. Of course there are people who get retrenched, went into depression or unable to get a perfect job, end up poorer and weaker, in a sad state, take up illegal vices or drinking or gambling habits that only add more sorrows. But there are people who put up their strenght of never said die attitude, since no way to go, do the hard one, go into business, set up stall, sell foods or whatever, change life and become successful, got a fish noodle stall boss near my house now hv 8 stalls islandwide, formerly retrenched by National panasonic, fed up, promise himself never to return to worker life, set up his stall, now very rich loh</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I do not what job you  preferred, but I recommend you to go e2i at redhill, same as Taxi academy, they got lots of jobs pasted on the board, choose the one you like, go into the office and talk with the officer, if you got no skill, they will train you up to match the job. For singaporeans above 40yo, there is also a so call surrogate employer, meaning e2i will act as your employer until you find a job, but you hv to attend e2i courses provided to you, you will be paid $6 per hour for attending the course, max 2 months</p></div>

              <p>Well bro... most of the thing u mentioned are quite true. Look at the brighter side.</p>
              <p>But
               getting retrenched because me falls into poor performers catergory is 
              abit hard to swallow. Myself in this job (project) for 7 years, my other
               local colleague is 3 years. We are not the bottom performers. But we 
              lost out to a local colleague who just in this job for 3 months. We lost
               out to FTs which the company employ 13 pinoys at one go last year Dec.</p>
              <p>All i can say, Singapore open arm policy for FTs is wrong. Sad to say, I have just tasted it.</p>

              <p>Dun worry lah brother, you are under contractual obligation, like it or not, every 2 years, they can alway not renew your contract. Same as bangala permit holder.</p>
              <p>Anyway, not everyone suit working life, your are right, now a day, even Singaporean bosses side foreign staffs, become like singaporean killing singaporean. If bosses employ pinoys to take over singaporeans who are capable of doing the job, I think this is a total discrimination of Singaporeans case which you can report to MOM at Havelock road, give them some case to work on, who knows, your former employer may call you up to drink coffee and talks over the terms again, that time, you will be in the driver seat.</p>
              <p>Perhap this issue can enlight you further in life, that is, nothing last forever. I hope it will give you strength and energy to work harder, smarter and become richer. Here are some cases taken up by MOM,</p>
              <li><strong>Case study 1: Foreigners hire fellow countrymen</strong> - A Singaporean complains that a foreign manager in her IT firm prefers his own countrymen to qualified Singaporeans. Management tells Tafep that it had trouble finding suitable local candidates, but later admits some departments have seen an increased representation from a particular country in recent years. Company then agrees to hire and develop Singaporeans as its workforce core. </li>
              <li><strong>Case study 2: Discriminatory practices by an employment agency</strong> - An employment agency specialising in foreign recruitment raves about why foreign workers are better than Singaporeans in an e-mail to clients. The agency corrects its e-mail and pledges not to do so again after Tafep steps in. Manager involved is counselled and makes a public apology while staff are sent for relevant training. Manpower Ministry issues a written warning to the agency after conducting its own investigations.</li>
              <li> </li>
              <li><strong>Case study 3: Over-reliance on foreigners</strong> - A chief executive was swamped by complaints from his local staff about the company hiring too many foreigners from a certain country. CEO was surprised of this practice as he was not aware of it. Many employees left for another company which hired less foreigners.</li>

              <p>Dun worry lah brother, you are under contractual obligation,
              like it or not, every 2 years, they can alway not renew your
              contract. Same as bangala permit holder.</p>
              <p>Anyway, not everyone suit working life, your are right, now
              a day, even Singaporean bosses side foreign staffs, become
              like singaporean killing singaporean. If bosses employ pinoys to
              take over singaporeans who are capable of doing the job, I think
              this is a total discrimination of Singaporeans case which you
              can report to MOM at Havelock road, give them some case to work on,
              who knows, your former employer may call you up to drink coffee and
              talks over the terms again, that time, you will be in the driver
              seat.</p>
              <p>Perhap this issue can enlight you further in life, that is,
              nothing last forever. I hope it will give you strength and
              energy to work harder, smarter and become
              richer. Here are some cases taken up by MOM,</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Case study 1: Foreigners hire fellow
              countrymen</strong> - A Singaporean complains that a foreign
              manager in her IT firm prefers his own countrymen to qualified
              Singaporeans. Management tells Tafep that it had trouble finding
              suitable local candidates, but later admits some departments have
              seen an increased representation from a particular country in
              recent years. Company then agrees to hire and develop Singaporeans
              as its workforce core.</li>
              <li><strong>Case study 2: Discriminatory practices by an employment
              agency</strong> - An employment agency specialising in foreign
              recruitment raves about why foreign workers are better than
              Singaporeans in an e-mail to clients. The agency corrects its
              e-mail and pledges not to do so again after Tafep steps in. Manager
              involved is counselled and makes a public apology while staff are
              sent for relevant training. Manpower Ministry issues a written
              warning to the agency after conducting its own investigations.</li>
              <li> </li>
              <li><strong>Case study 3: Over-reliance on foreigners</strong> - A
              chief executive was swamped by complaints from his local staff
              about the company hiring too many foreigners from a certain
              country. CEO was surprised of this practice as he was not aware of
              it. Many employees left for another company which hired less
              foreigners.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Things will look up, bro. When you hit bottom, the only way is UP. Many of us here were "retrenchees", I got the handshake in 2007. Don't place yourself in the poor performer category, you need to keep your self-esteem, otherwise the road will be very long. In my company's case, more than 50 Managers and Engineers, most with degrees and some with Masters, star performers also not spared. Economics, is all. Prolly your new 3-months colleague is younger and cheaper lah. FTs, enuf said.</p>
