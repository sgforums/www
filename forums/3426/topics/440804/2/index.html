              <p>When i resigned my last FT job at 1999 , i can hardly get a job .</p>
              <p>Their reason for not employing was i too high pay . wtf $1300 high ?</p>
              <p>Then they started to scream their jobs nobody want to work .</p>
              <p>That time , foreigners were not even allowed , allowed but not many , never a nuisance to us , unless you are PR .</p>
              <p>And PR are mostly Malaysians , i would say 90% of them .</p>
              <p>Not many permit holders competing jobs with Singaporeans .</p>

              <p>But getting retrenched because me falls into poor performers
              catergory is abit hard to swallow. Myself in this job (project) for
              7 years, my other local colleague is 3 years. We are not the bottom
              performers. But we lost out to a local colleague who just in this
              job for 3 months. We lost out to FTs which the company employ 13
              pinoys at one go last year Dec.</p>
              <p>All i can say, Singapore open arm policy for FTs is wrong. Sad
              to say, I have just tasted it.</p>

              <p>Ya, exactly. There are so many of such phantom workers around. Take a look at some of the labour-intensive industries, like construction, manufacturing, agriculture, fishery.</p>
              <p>I cannot believe that they are able to fulfill their quota by legal means. E.g. Was watching a TV program on fish farms. This fish farm owner have 2 burmese working for him on his kelong. No local worker except himself. I thought there is a ratio of 4:1 for hiring foreigners?</p>
