              <p><br>Standing on your rights or lefts is good, but the way and action to stand on your rights and lefts, need to be careful, alway learn to seek the middle way in attending to issue without personal emotion, or less personal emotion, as such, you will have a clearer mind to look into the issue with a open mind.</p>
              <p>Because of one issue, as chief, you neglect the rest who supported you here, did you think of that when you said bye bye? this is an emotion and extreme action, you therefore, seek consultation and thru proper negotiation to settle the issue, be neutral and open, given time and proper explanation, even if you end up with no solution and decided to say bye bye, we would be more understanding and might had go with you and appreciated your effort.</p>
              <p>So now, you learned, if anything happens again, you should know better on what to do, as I have alway said, look at thing in a bigger picture, from your rights to your people, the issue at hand and the solution to it.</p>
              <p>Hope that you dun go spam the forum again and leave us alone...home alone.</p>

              <p>A leader rule by his charismatic personality. Guide and lead his people without any authority.</p>
              <p>Govt and manager rule by authority, without it, they are nothing, a leader is different, he leaves forever in his people heart, and even without authority, people will do as he command. That is the true leader.</p>
              <p>For govt and manager, if thing get caught up, they will push or leave immediately and nothing is of their concern.  A leader stay by his peoples thru thick and thin of the problems.</p>
              <p>To be a manager, is much easier, to be a leader, it need to mould for years, and history alway remember a leader, never a manager.</p>
              <p>Most of us are leader of a family, and base on that, our family will listen and remember us .</p>

              </p><p>Like what I had say before, you integrated forum and real life beautifully, but, down here still got many many many don't buy this 'ideas', especially forumers from other sub-forum, you can't just think on your side, you had to think the whole picture, even me was a life example for you to visualize, we never met before right?......and it won't happen also......So can I post what I want?.....you can't fark me in real life mah.........think towards that, than you will understand Queen feeling..........</p><p>
              
              </p><p>A lot of forumers just wanted a place to vent their anger and stress...........when I come in and on top read "unmoderated".......ho seh liao, whack ah........</p><p>
              
              </p><p>In real life, you think all taxi uncles and level same same, that's your problem, in forum, you don't show authority, how forumers will know?........if sgf was a very fast moving site like EDMW, cabby forum will be attacked by unknown source non stop.........</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Btw, I'm not siding anyone.......I'm just stated the rational behind all this issues..............Communication? You don't need it in CyberWorld..........</p><p></p>
