              <p>Bro Peter,</p>
              <p>Thank you for the new year wishes.  Glad to hear you already started the year in right direction by winning in Genting. Huat ah!!</p>
              <p>I doubt Comfort will sign you as a relief, unless you have found a hirer. However, even that you have not signed with them, they will be willing to give you a list of hirers looking for relief partner (in Woodland area for your case). I found a hirer this way, and going to register tomorrow. Will start driving once I attended the MDT course. (yeah I know, we missed the peak period last couple of weeks :) )</p>
              <p>Kopi is always on. we'll be driving same hours anyway. Not to mention I owe many many cups of kopi to seniors here who have helped me up to today. Sifu Pools and all seniors, one round of kopi will be on me next time you guys have the Kopi Tehtarik Makan session!</p>

              <p>Chief,</p>
              <p>No, did not start last night, but I will be driving night shift starting from tonight. (Yeah I know, Thursday is like the worst night of the week).</p>
              <p>Learnt how to use the GPS yest, not as bad as what I thought although a bit slow, but at least I got more assurance on top of the Mighty Minds guide :)  But BEST still is if we could get help from the walking-talking-eating street directory, Mr KC Lee himself. Tio bo? :)</p>
              <p>You should be OK nowadays ah?, got LakeView jobs. :) All the best to you in this Tiger year too Chief!</p>

              <p>Anytime Shifu,</p>
              <p>I already PM you my number. Call me when you are thirsty.</p>
              <p>I was lucky, the former relief when MIA for 2 weeks. I almost gave up on Comfort, call almost everyone on the list. Was on my way down to transcab when I found my hirer.</p>
              <p>Wow Komade,</p>
              <p>You F1 driver. My hirer told me go easy on  the pedal. Easy to get ticket. A lot of his friends have already paid tribute to TP.</p>
              <p>A big thanks to every one here.</p>
