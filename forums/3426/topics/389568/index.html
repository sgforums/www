              <p>Hi Bros,</p>
              <p>Just passed my TVL. Now waiting for LTA letter to collect my Driving License.There's so many Taxi companies in sg. I really need some advice here.</p>
              <p>I am going OMO, and will be looking for relief on Sunday and maybe alternate Thursday.</p>
              <p>Which company should I join??? Hoping to bring back S$100 net per day, is it possible? Being out of job for one and a half year. Financial is really tight. Need all the help I can get from all you "Tai Guo" here at the forum. I have read through almost all your post and I know everything is possible but, the main issue is which company is more suitable for me. One more thing, I have some problem coming out the S$1000 security deposit. Is there any company that can pay in instalment?????</p>

              <p>Talking about Transcab, I think I saw one of your post that you got your fire engine. Do they still give S$1000 to hirer for the used wish? And also the monthly S$716?</p>

              <p>Can let me share with u Pntc70</p>
              <p>No need to think so much as to which company to join, think too much will cause headache <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png?1212956094" alt="Confused">    hehehe. <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/tongue.png?1212956094" alt="Tongue"></p>
              <p>Jus take a Comfort crown for a start, the Biggest bro in the taxi industry. Since u need $$$, u have to work doubly hard. I would suggest u drive at least 14 hours a day maybe from 3 pm - til next morning 5.30 am, i believe for a start u may make at least $120/ per day. Driving in the evenings and mid nights got surcharges mah.</p>
              <p>$120 * 26  = $3120 per month = 7400RM. as for sun u can slowly look for relief, if cant find for time being, then u have to at least drive to cover ur rental so as no need to lugi.</p>
              <p>after few months down the road, when u r mature enough u will then know ur strong and weak points, whether u need booking calls or not (since comfort is strong on calls and nets services), or u can also make it without calls. by then u can seriously consider which company to go to. Good luck ! <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/smile.png?1212956094" alt="Smile"></p>

              <p>Thanks Freemanisa.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>I have considered to join Comfort at first but, I am having second thoughts. Don't ask me why? It just gut feeling. Maybe I should just go down to all the Taxi companies and find out more.</p>
              <p>Like what you said, I do intent to drive long hours but my timing is 7 a.m to 9 p.m. for Monday to Thursday. Friday and Saturday will start at 3 p.m to 5 a.m. Sunday ???? Can't plan yet. Maybe start at 3 p.m and ends at 9 p.m. just to cover a bit of my rental.</p>
              <p>But if Friday and Saturday turns out good then Sunday is rest day. Need to spend some time to do a bit of exercies to keep fit.</p>

              <p><br>Wow bro , so far , ur case is the most serious sia knn .</p>
              <p>Why this knn forum got so many problematic personality ?</p>
              <p>KNN driving damn shiong liao , and f*ck u still need to commute between 2 countries , after a damn hectic driving , and jam somemore ?</p>
              <p>Lan eh .. i also dunno sia .</p>
              <p>That recommendation or referal $1000 no more la bro .</p>
              <p>But that $716 ok la , still have .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U decide la ...but u try not to think about Sonata , to drive a Sonata , like with your current situation , u will punctured very fast . Or in taxi line , we called it die young sia bro .</p>
              <p>KNN u wo nya bo , stay JB , walao eh ?</p>
              <p>Mai chu spot leh , like that also can ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But knn u need lots of money ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If need money big time , OMO will be damn fucking shiong for u , u must be ready for the triple hardship .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If need money , not so desperate type , fuck la try as relief 1st a .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then slowly , see u can cope or not , like need to travel between 2 countries .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If can cope , still normal for you , 3 months later , then  u " upgrade " , still got time .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because bro , once u commit yourself to 6 months or 1 years contract , u cannot withdraw one . Once back-out of the contract , meaning say good bye to $500 .</p>
              <p>Relief no contract la .</p>

              <p>That's Rm 3600. Unless they allow me to pay by instalment. S$500 first deposit then the rest by instalment.</p>
              <p>Bo pian, though stay in JB but travelling time is about 1 hour to reach Woodlands.</p>
              <p>Actual fact I am hoping to bring home about S$2000 to S$2500 per month. That's is my target but if cannot S$1500 to S$1800 also not bad. Change to ringgit is already Rm3600.</p>

              <p>You are right about it. <strong>Like you</strong></p>
              <p>My wife salary is approx 2K ringgit per mth and we could still survived with a 1000cc car. If with my earnings, we could afford to buy terrace house. A place to come home to.</p>
              <p>I used to earn alot when I was in sg but, never save any money. All spend.</p>
              <p>I was those "happy go lucky type" never think about tomorrow.</p>
              <p>After got married 2 years ago then started to think. ha ha  "Think only"</p>
              <p>Only when my son came out then I realised what is wrong with me, though late but still not too late. Went for a lot of interviews but they always say we will call you. I think age is the problem. After considering for a few months, I decided that Taxi is just right for me. Don't need to contribute CPF.</p>
              <p>Don't worry I won't nga nga chiong. I am going OMO not just because of money. It's more on fexibility. But who don't want to earn more. Right? I don't expect much for the first 6 mths. There is always a learning stage.</p>

              <p>Normally a omo will cover abt 300-400km/day. That's abt $28-$50 max.Taxi co.sell diesel to their drivers between $0.88 - $0.93/L</p>

              <p>Thanks Bros, <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/smile.png?1212956094" alt="Smile"></p>
              <p>You all really put a smile on my face.</p>
              <p>Poolman, nope I stay in Tun Aminah. It takes about 30 minutes to reach JB custom, provided no jam. But here early morning traffic OK. 30 minutes to cross to woodlands.</p>
              <p>Relief driver. I am really afraid. It's like going into business partnership. These always turns out bad for me. I used to be in business, "seafood restaurant";" vegetables wholesale". But it all turns out, I am always on the losing side. You may think I am a foreigner here. Over in sg also same thing happen to me. Maybe this is my luck. That's why I choose OMO. I don't mind driving 2 hours more to cover the second shift rental. Who knows maybe after 6 mths I might end up to be a relief. Now, I must learn as much as I can.</p>
              <p> My is winston, Rm 7.80. <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/tongue.png?1212956094" alt="Tongue"> ha ha even cheaper.</p>
