              <p>Poolman Shifu,</p>
              <p>I am starting to reconsider my strategy. I am thinking of starting as relief if the waiting list for the Wish is long. No point wasting time waiting at home. Everyone here has help me grow and after much considerations. You are all right about being a relief, as a OMO I will have to drive extra an extra 2 to 3 hours to cover the rental. LPPL.  </p>
              <p>Night shift is the only choice for me but no time for family. Day shift needs to wake up veeeery early but no bus to custom. That's why I wanted OMO, not because I need more money. But that extra 2 to 3 hours is going to burn me down.</p>
              <p>Could you tell me more about the shift timings?</p>
              <p>I believed that shift timings varies with different owners. Roughly what time the night shift starts and ends.</p>
              <p>For u I know, 4.30pm, right?</p>
              <p> </p>

              wa i dun know abt the traffic condition and distance to your place in JB.... but sounds like extra effort needed... 
              
              but if your target is S$2K, still quite easy... if target 3K, still can but tough... 
              
              u take bus or got own transport? makes a lot of difference

              <p>Poolman thanks bro,</p>
              <p>You are super. Luckily I stumble onto this forum by accident.</p>
              <p>Without you and everyone here, I will be banging my head against the wall. </p>
              <p>I can't off on Sunday. Wife off on weekdays Wed and Thur every week. I have talk to my wife and we agreed on alternate Wed or Thur. That is one mth 2 days off.</p>
              <p>Wed and Thur, which is better? I think Wed night is better cos ladies night. Right???</p>
              <p>I will need your advice on how to attack the night shift.</p>
              <p>Thanks again</p>

              <p>Poolman Shifu,</p>
              <p>I am starting to reconsider my strategy. I am thinking of
              starting as relief if the waiting list for the Wish is long. No
              point wasting time waiting at home. Everyone here has help me grow
              and after much considerations. You are all right about being a
              relief, as a OMO I will have to drive extra an extra 2 to 3 hours
              to cover the rental. LPPL.  </p>
              <p>Night shift is the only choice for me but no time for family.
              Day shift needs to wake up veeeery early but no bus to custom.
              That's why I wanted OMO, not because I need more money. But that
              extra 2 to 3 hours is going to burn me down.</p>
              <p>Could you tell me more about the shift timings?</p>
              <p>I believed that shift timings varies with different owners.
              Roughly what time the night shift starts and ends.</p>
              <p>For u I know, 4.30pm, right?</p>

              <p>pntc70 - lucky you change your mind to be a relief.  Otherwise if you are OMO you will start to worry about car servicing, checkup, inpection.</p>
              <p>Another nightmare you will have is your CAR Park in a car park where no one watch out for you when u are back in JB.</p>
              <p>Your travelling back and fro to JB is really time wasted and tiring.</p>

              <p>Yep ALN,</p>
              <p>It's like Hougang to Woodlands but without the traffic lights. Ha Ha<a href="http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001_ZSman000"><img src="http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/36/36_1_13.gif" border="0" alt="Bounce"></a></p>
              <p>Actually the travelling time is not so stress. Half an hour from my place to custom, it just that JB and SG custom have to walk a bit. A little bit of exercise is good for me. Driving and taking public transport is roughly the same time.</p>

              wed and thurs nite to me not much different...
              
              best is Fri nite then Sat, next tier is Wed, Thurs, then last tier is Sun, Tue, Mon.... haha
              
              so i think your schedule is like this
              
              3.30pm: leave JB hse
              4.30pm: reach taxi
              4.30pm to 4am: drive taxi
              5am: return taxi
              6am: reach JB
              
              6am to 7am: rest and breakfast
              7am to 2pm: koon
              2pm to 3pm: Lunch
              
              3.30pm: another day!
              
              wa... sounds like no life leh... better find 1 taxi very near checkpt... so that you can choose to end early and walk to customs instead of waiting for hirer to drive u to customs...  so drive 4.30pm to 2am keep liao... save 2 hrs... haha

              <p>Must check with my father-in-law. Every morning he drives workers to ST AMK.</p>
              <p>So, I just ceased work at 4am then walk over to Woodlands Checkpoint. Reach JB at 4.30am. Should reach home by latest 5.10am.</p>
              <p>Think too much also useless. Just let it be. agar agar can already. Right? Bros.</p>
              <p>Start already then adapt lah.</p>
              <p>When I was back for reservist last year. Every morning 5am I am at Woodlands hawker centre lim kopi, I did saw a few comfort taxis park at woodlands carpark. (near Sheng Siong) Didn't notice got sonota or not. I think after CNY then follow father-in-law go woodlands look see, look see.</p>
              <p>If really cannot find nearby custom then just go to the taxi and wait for the owners to show up.
