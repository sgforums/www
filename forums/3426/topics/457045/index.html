              </p><p>Singapore has the world’s worst taxi drivers</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That’s a statement not a question for a reason. It’s true. Singaporean taxi drivers are the world’s worst. I love living in Singapore but the one thing that winds me up no end is taxi drivers lack of ability to do their basic job, take me from point a to point b.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First question they always ask when you get in a cab, which way do you want to go. Now they don’t ask this as they do in other countries where they may be asking for the choice of directions that the customer wants to go.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No, in Singapore they ask because they have no idea how to get to the destination. If I hear one more time, “I’m new, I don’t know the way” when getting in a cab I will scream. My response is twofold 1) you’re not new to Singapore you have lived here all your life and 2) it’s your bloody job to know the way!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If someone came to me in my marketing job and said I would like some marketing advice please and I then turned around and said well what do you think because I haven’t got a clue, what would happen? The client would walk out and not pay me. In a Singapore taxi this happens 75% of every one of my journeys.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no excuse. Newness to the roll is pathetic. They are not new to Singapore, they must know the way. If they do not why are they taking up a job as a taxi driver?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whose fault is this incompetence?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The driver, the cab company or the Government? All three in my view.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The driver really has no excuse. All taxi drivers in Singaporean have to be Singaporean. They tend to be in their 40’s and 50’s. Therefore they have lived here all their lives and presumably know the city inside out. It’s not that big! I have lived here three years and know most routes! So why don’t they?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does this come back to always being told what to do by the Government? They want to be told the way even though it’s their job and they are, let’s not forget, being paid for this service! Why don’t they take responsibility and know the routes? Why do they have to be spoon fed when their livelihood rests on it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have the government conditioned them so much that they do not want to take a risk and go the way that they must know or do they simply genuinely not know in which case why are they so ignorant and going around with their eyes closed? It’s their job to know the way!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No training means greater ignorance. Cab companies clearly do not train their taxi drives. If they did they would know the way to anywhere in Singapore or be able to find the way without asking a passenger. Why don’t they train them? If they do then they seriously need to look at their program because it does not work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What first impressions does this give a tourist arriving at Changi Airport? That someone completely new to the country could be asked which direction to go and do you know where it is, the two most common things a Singaporean taxi driver says!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don’t believe me? Take the last couple of week’s mishaps as some recent examples:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Asked to go to Singpost at Paya Lebar the taxi driver took a detour to Marina Bay... west not east! She then had to ring up someone to ask the way to Paya Lebar as we sped towards Vivo City...</p>
              <p>Going to Rochester Mall I had to get three taxis before someone knew the way</p>
              <p>I was taken to Suntec when I had said Novena Square</p>
              <p>Asked to go to Nicoll Highway from Bugis Junction was told that he didn’t know where Nicoll Highway was...(it’s next door)</p>
              <p>I was taken to Little India when I asked to be taken to Marina Square (he thought Marina meant inland... Despite Marina Bay, Marina Square, Marina Bay Sands being the other way...).</p>
              <p>Asked to take Stadium Road I was told by my driver that it is fully closed when it is not and if it was I wouldn’t directing him that way...</p>
              <p>Asked to go to Changi Airport the driver, who was on the ECP (the correct way) turned off to go the scenic route...</p>
              <p>Asked to go to Sentosa Cove went to Sentosa beach (right not left)</p>
              <p>Asked to go to One Shenton, Shenton Way asked for directions and only knew were to go when I said next to Asia Square! Bizarre because Shenton Way is old and Asia Square is new!</p>
              <p>Asked to go to Great Eastern Centre (great enormous building with Great Eastern on the top) on Pickering Street (CBD) the driver didn’t know whether either of them were</p>
              <p>Having asked a taxi driver to go to Kallang Leisure Park he attempted to go the wrong way down Nicoll Highway on the basis that he could cut across the Stadium only to be surprised that it had been knocked down and the Sports Hub was being built and it had closed off all the roads!!! Work started 2 years ago...</p>
              <p>I could go on and on and on and on...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What happens at 4pm? Why does “change shift” give taxi drivers the right to not pick people up? Why do they drop by taxi ranks and say that they are going to their home and that if anyone else happens to live next door to them they will take them but if not they won’t! By the time they have driven around for hours looking for this perfect passenger who lives next door they could have taken several people home and earnt some money!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was given a great example of how some stands get focused on my taxi drivers. If you are standing waiting for a taxi at Ion, you have a long wait because it’s not in the CBD. If you move a few steps to Wisma Atria you will get picked up because it is in the CBD and that extra couple of dollars makes all the difference to a taxi driver which brings me on to rain…</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When is the one time you can never get a taxi in Singapore despite their being 26,000 of them, more than any other country per capita? When it rains.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They disappear. You cannot for anything get a taxi when it rains. Where do they all go? You can’t even text them or app them and they usually love that as they get an extra couple of dollars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why do the big posh black SMRT limos that Singaporeans won’t get into (because it costs a couple of dollars more, they would rather wait in the queue, even though it is the same cost as texting for one…) not take card? Why do the red and black/yellow ones do the same? Which modern country these days only takes cash when all the marketing from people like Nets, MasterCard, Visa, EZ link is cashless? Why do some cabs have displayed that they will take card/they are cashless only to turn around and say only cash? This usually happens only on a Thursday or Friday…when they don’t get their money to after the weekend unless it’s a cash payment…</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why are there 25,000 of the 26,000 Singaporean taxis always at Changi Airport? This is why you can never get a cab when you really want one. They are all waiting at Changi for that amazing fair, even though the queue takes hours to go down and they could earn much more on shorter journeys in the city….</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So all of this makes them really bad, but the world’s worst? Well in London you can’t become a black cab driver unless you know the “knowledge” which is the A-Z of London streets. You must know every street, every hotel, every landmark before you get a license. They should do that in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Australia and New York they allow non Australians and non Americans to take the roles and the service and knowledge of the city is better than Singaporeans of Singapore. In fact I would wager that if you took an Indian who had just got off a plane and never been to Singapore and gave him a cab he would do a better job than a Singaporean taxi driver in driving you to your destination…</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why don’t the Government allow non-Singaporean Asian’s to take taxi drivers jobs? That would make current drivers them more competitive and less ignorance and complacent. No more not taking jobs, no more not knowing the way if they felt like they could be booted out and replaced by a willing Indian cab driver who had put the work in and knew the streets inside out and worked all hours to generate money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Getting cab drivers to take personal responsibility to know their own city streets, being properly trained by companies and creating a competitive market place with non-Singaporean rivals for their jobs is the only way forward for Singaporean cab drivers. If nothing changes they will continue to be the world’s worst taxi drivers and continue to be the black mark on the tourism and business marketing of our otherwise amazingly run city state.  </p>

              <p>I dunno why I am answering this but....</p>
              <p>Why some people do not understand the <strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rain Phenomenum</span></span></em></strong>. I have spoken to quite a few commuters and they understand it.</p>
              <p>When it rains, those who are half-hearted about taking cab will do so. With the sudden surge of passengers, of course the  available cabs suddenly dissappear from the road.</p>
              <p>Now this question I am puzzled.</p>
              <p><strong>"WHY WOULD CABS NOT TAKE ANY PASSENGER AND WAIT FOR THE LIKES OF CHRIK REED TO PICK HIM UP?"</strong></p>
              <p>And because everyone knows that the cab have dried up on the road, due to the rain, they will naturally book a cab.</p>
              <p>Which makes booking a cab a painful process when it rains during peak hour.</p>
              <p>The system is so efficient that by the time you think it is better to book a cab, you are probably too late.</p>

              <p><br>If I explain and clarify your concerns, it would be a long story. Anyway you would not have understaood, and you may be bored half way.</p>
              <p>Competition, we welcome. But there are concerns, mostly not related to Taxi Driving itself, that do not allow Foreigners to drive Taxi.</p>
              <p>Maybe one day when our Government decides to open the gate (for Taxi Driving) to Foreigners, then the reason will become clear.</p>
              <p>Just look at Ah Tiongs driving Buses. They go routes that a Singaporean bus driver will never go.</p>
              <p>Just look at the Anehs drive trucks. They can destroy over-head bridges and tear a bus into half. Never happened before.</p>
              <p>You are probably a Foreigner because a Singaporean commuter will most likely not want Foreigners to be Taxi Drivers.</p>
              <p>Not all Fopreigners are bad. But to reduce the blame effect when something goes wrong, better not to have foreigners to drive Taxi.</p>
              <p>It seems that you also do not know the history of, "What is your preferred route?"</p>

Taxi drivers will always choose the fastest route by default cos we do not want to be stuck in traffic if possible. i.e. Pax usually takes a certain route that they are accustom to but that may not be the most efficient route. Thus, by asking for pax's preferred route, we eliminate any unpleasantries at the end of the trip.</p>
              <p>You ask for govt to allow non-citizens to be cabbies. IMHO the govt would had done that donkey yrs ago if it's feasible. I wouldn't want to comment too much abt this issue but just look at those non-citizens driving commercial vehs with no regards to other road users. Would you dare to sit in their cabs? I wouldn't .</p>
              <p>Im really puzzled by why the public (the minority) who love to pick on cabbies? We don't make a hell lot out of every trip but the service levels expected is more like master n servant. Come on..... For a mere few bucks u want me to kow tow? I would say live n let live. Most cabbies are pleasant except for a few black sheeps. Which industry doesn't have black sheeps? Why are cabbies being stereo type to be mean, bad ass crooks that love to rip u off? why don't they pick on somebody who rip them off thousands? I'll respect those who dare stand up to unfair practices by big corporates/agencies but to those keyboard warriors who just comment without truly understanding the root of the problem, pls STFU If u have nothing constructive to comment<span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);  ">.</span></p>
              <p>Coming back to the chow ANG Moh in razor tv, why did he keep quiet abt govt n cab companies during the interview? Bo LUM PAR to comment, end up just massacre the cabbies only. Cabbies are a flexible lot that constantly adjust to new policies, the problems <span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);  ">we face today is the result of policies period! wanna show yr dissatisfaction, you know which door to knock. It's definitely not mine. </span></p>

              <p>This guy is an attention seeking whore. Hi is in marketing so he knows how to attract attention. Want to fark him, do it here and not in his blog cause that will only increase his pageviews which is exactly what he wants.</p>
              <p>Let me start the ball rolling.</p>
              <p>Hello Crisp Reed,</p>
              <p>You want London taxi service in Singapore! Are you prepared to pay London taxi charges for such services which can cost around $70 for a 10km trip?</p>
              <p>Here is my suggestion (<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>must be approved by LTA first</strong></span>).</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Next time you board a taxi and the driver asks which route you want to take, just tell him you want London Taxi service standard.</span></p>
              <p>You and taxi driver negotiate the fare based on distance @ $70 per 10 km. No need to use meter. Fixed distance, fixed fare, both parties agreed, taxi drives on.</p>
              <p>Taxi driver can take any route he wants as long as he sends you to your destination.</p>
              <p>Fare is already fixed and paid in advance. You just wear your sunglasses and relax in the taxi.</p>
              <p>You need extra service on the way like coffee, no problem. Taxi driver will drive to nearest starbucks and get you your cup of coffee. You feel cold, driver can provide blanket and pillows for you. Is this service good enough for you?</p>
