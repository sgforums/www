I told him it happens long before i started driving taxi becos we need to change shift and i'm glad the evening peak starts at 6pm. He ask why?Told him before the fare adjustment evening peak starts at 5pm and everybody is  excusing TD hiding, waiting for peak hrs. And now evening peak starts at 6pm whats the outcome?

              5pm and everybody is  excusing TD hiding, waiting for

                              <p>Singapore has the worldâ€™s worst taxi drivers</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thatâ€™s a statement not a question for a reason. Itâ€™s true.
              Singaporean taxi drivers are the worldâ€™s worst. I love living in
              Singapore but the one thing that winds me up no end is taxi drivers
              lack of ability to do their basic job, take me from point a to
              point b.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First question they always ask when you get in a cab, which way
              do you want to go. Now they donâ€™t ask this as they do in other
              countries where they may be asking for the choice of directions
              that the customer wants to go.</p>
              
              <p> </p>
              <p>No, in Singapore they ask because they have no idea how to get
              to the destination. If I hear one more time, â€œIâ€™m new, I donâ€™t know
              the wayâ€� when getting in a cab I will scream. My response is
              twofold 1) youâ€™re not new to Singapore you have lived here all your
              life and 2) itâ€™s your bloody job to know the way!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If someone came to me in my marketing job and said I would like
              some marketing advice please and I then turned around and said well
              what do you think because I havenâ€™t got a clue, what would happen?
              The client would walk out and not pay me. In a Singapore taxi this
              happens 75% of every one of my journeys.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no excuse. Newness to the roll is pathetic. They are
              not new to Singapore, they must know the way. If they do not why
              are they taking up a job as a taxi driver?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whose fault is this incompetence?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The driver, the cab company or the Government? All three in my
              view.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The driver really has no excuse. All taxi drivers in Singaporean
              have to be Singaporean. They tend to be in their 40â€™s and 50â€™s.
              Therefore they have lived here all their lives and presumably know
              the city inside out. Itâ€™s not that big! I have lived here three
              years and know most routes! So why donâ€™t they?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does this come back to always being told what to do by the
              Government? They want to be told the way even though itâ€™s their job
              and they are, letâ€™s not forget, being paid for this service! Why
              donâ€™t they take responsibility and know the routes? Why do they
              have to be spoon fed when their livelihood rests on it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have the government conditioned them so much that they do not
              want to take a risk and go the way that they must know or do they
              simply genuinely not know in which case why are they so ignorant
              and going around with their eyes closed? Itâ€™s their job to know the
              way!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No training means greater ignorance. Cab companies clearly do
              not train their taxi drives. If they did they would know the way to
              anywhere in Singapore or be able to find the way without asking a
              passenger. Why donâ€™t they train them? If they do then they
              seriously need to look at their program because it does not
              work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What first impressions does this give a tourist arriving at
              Changi Airport? That someone completely new to the country could be
              asked which direction to go and do you know where it is, the two
              most common things a Singaporean taxi driver says!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Donâ€™t believe me? Take the last couple of weekâ€™s mishaps as some
              recent examples:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Asked to go to Singpost at Paya Lebar the taxi driver took a
              detour to Marina Bay... west not east! She then had to ring up
              someone to ask the way to Paya Lebar as we sped towards Vivo
              City...</p>
              <p>Going to Rochester Mall I had to get three taxis before someone
              knew the way</p>
              <p>I was taken to Suntec when I had said Novena Square</p>
              <p>Asked to go to Nicoll Highway from Bugis Junction was told that
              he didnâ€™t know where Nicoll Highway was...(itâ€™s next door)</p>
              <p>I was taken to Little India when I asked to be taken to Marina
              Square (he thought Marina meant inland... Despite Marina Bay,
              Marina Square, Marina Bay Sands being the other way...).</p>
              <p>Asked to take Stadium Road I was told by my driver that it is
              fully closed when it is not and if it was I wouldnâ€™t directing him
              that way...</p>
              <p>Asked to go to Changi Airport the driver, who was on the ECP
              (the correct way) turned off to go the scenic route...</p>
              <p>Asked to go to Sentosa Cove went to Sentosa beach (right not
              left)</p>
              <p>Asked to go to One Shenton, Shenton Way asked for directions and
              only knew were to go when I said next to Asia Square! Bizarre
              because Shenton Way is old and Asia Square is new!</p>
              <p>Asked to go to Great Eastern Centre (great enormous building
              with Great Eastern on the top) on Pickering Street (CBD) the driver
              didnâ€™t know whether either of them were</p>
              <p>Having asked a taxi driver to go to Kallang Leisure Park he
              attempted to go the wrong way down Nicoll Highway on the basis that
              he could cut across the Stadium only to be surprised that it had
              been knocked down and the Sports Hub was being built and it had
              closed off all the roads!!! Work started 2 years ago...</p>
              <p>I could go on and on and on and on...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What happens at 4pm? Why does â€œchange shiftâ€� give taxi drivers
              the right to not pick people up? Why do they drop by taxi ranks and
              say that they are going to their home and that if anyone else
              happens to live next door to them they will take them but if not
              they wonâ€™t! By the time they have driven around for hours looking
              for this perfect passenger who lives next door they could have
              taken several people home and earnt some money!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was given a great example of how some stands get focused on my
              taxi drivers. If you are standing waiting for a taxi at Ion, you
              have a long wait because itâ€™s not in the CBD. If you move a few
              steps to Wisma Atria you will get picked up because it is in the
              CBD and that extra couple of dollars makes all the difference to a
              taxi driver which brings me on to rainâ€¦</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When is the one time you can never get a taxi in Singapore
              despite their being 26,000 of them, more than any other country per
              capita? When it rains.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They disappear. You cannot for anything get a taxi when it
              rains. Where do they all go? You canâ€™t even text them or app them
              and they usually love that as they get an extra couple of
              dollars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why do the big posh black SMRT limos that Singaporeans wonâ€™t get
              into (because it costs a couple of dollars more, they would rather
              wait in the queue, even though it is the same cost as texting for
              oneâ€¦) not take card? Why do the red and black/yellow ones do the
              same? Which modern country these days only takes cash when all the
              marketing from people like Nets, MasterCard, Visa, EZ link is
              cashless? Why do some cabs have displayed that they will take
              card/they are cashless only to turn around and say only cash? This
              usually happens only on a Thursday or Fridayâ€¦when they donâ€™t get
              their money to after the weekend unless itâ€™s a cash paymentâ€¦</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why are there 25,000 of the 26,000 Singaporean taxis always at
              Changi Airport? This is why you can never get a cab when you really
              want one. They are all waiting at Changi for that amazing fair,
              even though the queue takes hours to go down and they could earn
              much more on shorter journeys in the cityâ€¦.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So all of this makes them really bad, but the worldâ€™s worst?
              Well in London you canâ€™t become a black cab driver unless you know
              the â€œknowledgeâ€� which is the A-Z of London streets. You must know
              every street, every hotel, every landmark before you get a license.
              They should do that in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Australia and New York they allow non Australians and non
              Americans to take the roles and the service and knowledge of the
              city is better than Singaporeans of Singapore. In fact I would
              wager that if you took an Indian who had just got off a plane and
              never been to Singapore and gave him a cab he would do a better job
              than a Singaporean taxi driver in driving you to your
              destinationâ€¦</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why donâ€™t the Government allow non-Singaporean Asianâ€™s to take
              taxi drivers jobs? That would make current drivers them more
              competitive and less ignorance and complacent. No more not taking
              jobs, no more not knowing the way if they felt like they could be
              booted out and replaced by a willing Indian cab driver who had put
              the work in and knew the streets inside out and worked all hours to
              generate money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Getting cab drivers to take personal responsibility to know
              their own city streets, being properly trained by companies and
              creating a competitive market place with non-Singaporean rivals for
              their jobs is the only way forward for Singaporean cab drivers. If
              nothing changes they will continue to be the worldâ€™s worst taxi
              drivers and continue to be the black mark on the tourism and
              business marketing of our otherwise amazingly run city state.
