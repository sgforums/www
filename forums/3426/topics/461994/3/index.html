              <p><br>This is not excuses, this is responsibility, the ever increase in cost of living had make us more and more hungry to feed our family.</p>
              <p>The idealogy of LKY is that everyone must have a job, once you have a job, a responsibility, you got not time to think of other thing, and to further ensure you got no time to think of other things, they make cost of living harder for you, so you have to plough more harder, or you can call it more smarter or whatever it is, but still have to work for it.</p>
              <p>And that is also why EDB must ensure that investment must come in so as to create job, and so far, singapore unemployment is almost zero except for some, who got job but refuse to work, sit at kopitiam and wait for durian to drop.</p>
              <p>All LKY wanted is simple, you do your job, make your family, the govt will support the infrastructure such as school, jobs, roads, medicals and so on.</p>
              <p>And with it comes peace and harmony, which then create the best business environment, for that you can read our standing in the world ranking of best place to do business, we are in the top 5.</p>

              <p>For that, if we go back to the 1960 eras of strike and protest, all the years of building this nation can be gone in just a day, we are that fragile in a sense.</p>
              <p>The govt presently had been trying to engage us by creating dialogue in public and in social media, but engaging only create closeness, no action taken from our feedback will mean a total fruitless engagement but rather just for show. And that is what is exactly happening.</p>
              <p>LKY is famous for catch the nip in the bud, he do not go for those loud speaker or whistle blower, he go for the nip before the flower appear, just like catching the snake by the head.</p>

              <p><br>Then my 2 daughters and wife also earn more than me, how? and this is no excuses, cos end of the day, driving bring about food to your family, this is call responsibility, after that, once they are able to earn by themselves, the more the merrier, but we, as husband and father had already do our part, hold steering for many years to bring up a family, and a good wife is alway supportive of her husband occupation as long as it is a honest living.</p>
              <p>We are not suppose to be like some other who only knows how to fark but never know how to bring up a family, many taxis drivers hold dearly to their jobs, not everyone is like you or me or Rbs or JDI or even hammer, we are only the 0.001% of TD who can able to go jobless and still survive</p>
              <p>There are many out there still needs to put food on the table for their old parents and families, you can call them not smart enough or drive without strategy and all those shits, but at the end of the day, they hold responsibility for their family thru an honest living of driving taxis, not those who use other to work or cheat others into investment</p>

              <p>For me, we are all mature and not so young adult, and as such age, we all have our own experiences in life, and as we go along, we become better and better in handling issues and problem, be it for leisure or real issue, we are more firm and realistic in looking at thing in comparing to our younger days, and we also become more down to earth people.</p>

              <p><br>The framework of strike is a legal process, you need to apply for strike, or that if you have a union, like NTA, their excutive committees need to approve, once approved, it need to go up to their executive secretary, then their secetary general, then the MOM and then the court approval before strike can commence.</p>
              <p>In 1986, there is strike on a marine company whereby 6 unionists was removed by the american owned company,  this was the last strike before this smrt strike happen, that is to say, nearly 25years, there was no strike.

              <p>Only in Singapore you need to give fourteen days notice to your employer and it need to be approved than u can go strike.</p>
              <p>Which cock does that? No wonder there is no strike for the last 25 years until the loads of foreigners brought in by the pappy. In a case of biting the hand that feed you.</p>
              <p>I'm hoping more of such strikes happening esp when it comes to those foreigners working here....its abt time the govt and all those big mncs start to appreciate the local workers</p>

              <p><br>The provision, meaning the laws gives both pros and cons, there is no such thing as one laws fit all, sure there is to be some disatisfaction and retialation, comments and critics on every laws.</p>
              <p>But if the laws benefit the majority, it is good laws. Having said that, being 25 years of industrial peace and harmony had bought about peace for us to make a living, to work, to drive at nite, peace for our childrens to study safety, peace for our family to live, growth without any disturbances.</p>
              <p>And the hindsight is of course, the agony of having to stick to the laws, let takes a simple laws like smoking,</p>
              <p>To a smoker, it will be a farking laws, have to smoke at the right place, or find a place that can eat, drink and smoke, but to a non smoker, children and cleaners, it can be a good laws in term of cleanliness and health.</p>
              <p>Therefore, if you take a look at the liberty woman who is holding the balancing weight in laws, the weight is never balance, you will notice that as you pass by those courts and take a look, or even at our city hall, and why is it not balanced, because every lawyers who studied laws know that laws is never an equilibrium, it is never going to fit all, and therefore, never a fair one.</p>
