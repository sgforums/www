              <p>nope.. since the PIE is crowded, you can see the antics of both
              drivers for quite some time...</p>
              <p>anyway, which part of your genius came up with the
              conclusion?</p>
              <p>remember this: this was NOT an attack on taxi drivers.. most are
              safe drivers.. when i needed to take cabs for work, most were safe,
              there were a few maniacs, including one who drove his cab so fast
              on an empty AYE, i was in Clementi from Tuas within 10 minutes... i
              am not kidding</p>
              <p>this was an observation of reckless driving by a speeder in a
              merc who was blocked by a taxi driver...</p>
              <p>do not be so quick to jump to the defense of the indefensible
              because lives of not only the drivers, but the passengers in the
              taxi and also the innocent road users around the two idiots driving
              like retarded schoolyard bullies</p>
              <p>maybe it is the "skill" of these types of drivers that cause the
              contractors who maintain the barriers of the PIE to be rolling in
              money because they seem to be smashed all the time...</p>

              <p>Bear, I am replying to you as a car owner. I ever reach Thailand from Singapore in less than 6hr 30 mins. In eyes of untrained driver like you is "reckless". You must understand, it takes a skilled driver to handle a car at higher speed. You cannot dictate all fast drivers are reckless. No hazard was imposed on anyone in your story. All I read is one rushing merc driver and one attitude TD. On the otherhand, I dare say people who stick to speed limit their whole life are guaranteed sh;itty drivers. Just like a person stay in sanitzed room whole life. One simple strep pneumonia infection will kill him.  Perhaps you can understand what I am saying, the day you meet with a bad accident is also the day you are driving slowly. The very experienced drivers may know what I am talking about.</p>

              <p>Serpent33, I am replying to you as a car driver.</p>
              <p>Whatever you said are the famous last words of many car owners who have crashed their cars and injured or killed people with them, including themselves.</p>
              <p>Show other road users and the law a bit more respect, and we can all have safer roads. People with your kind of arrogance towards basic safety laws should be removed at all costs from our roads, because it is people like you who have nearly killed me when I have been following all basic safety rules.</p>
              <p>If you don't care about other people, then please care a bit more for yourself, because it is precisely this kind of attitude that can get you killed.</p>

              <p>But if all due respect, some executives on the road are real toad driver, knn, drive like sending off someone in a funneral, how can?? and all these road hogging can also cause accident, their sudden brakes and cutting lanes can be a killer to others.</p>
              <p>Like what was said, if all drivers are able to comprehend each other, give and take, no problem, bus driver, taxi driver, executive driver, hawker char kway teow driver etc etc, are of no issue here. The mercedes' driver drove recklessly, this agitated the taxi driver to drive recklessly due to manhood ego. Now, who is wrong?? The agitated or the instigator??</p>
              <p>In any accident with taxis, the first thing in public mind is, Knn taxi sallah, taxis wrong, nabei, taxis again, everytime taxis kenna accident, those farking drivers all no education and manner. First question to ask is, are we TD willing to go into an accident?? we ply the road 24hrs, 28,000 cabs plying the road as our livinghood, not going for a picnic or office or shopping or a show, plying the road to earn our bowl of rice, pay our rental and fuel, and like everyone else, pay our taxes and bills. The keys is we work on the road, and that why we are more aggressive in a sense.</p>

              If it's liveihood why there's people who still do it? It's abt taking ownership for yourself n others on the road.

              <p><br>Speed camera are also cause of many accident, some private drivers could be new or day dreaming, then suddenly just jam brake on seeing camera leading to chain accident. I should said fast in a way of needed to be fast, and slow in a way of having to slow down.</p>
              <p>Driving a good turbo car can end up driving at 80 on expressway, what a waste for the vehicle, and most of these luxury cars got much better pick up then taxis, but end up when traffic light turn green or green arrow, they slowly move off, some even wait, look see look see, or turn like a tortoise, then end up those vehicle at the back have to wait for another roung of red light traffic. Seibei goondo leh.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it takes both hand to clap in anything, we do respect some cheapo driver who saved and spent so much on their car, sure to be careful. But they need to respect Taxis and their role on the road too. By understanding and appreciating each other, thing would be fine.</p>
              <p>OTR, singaporean private cars are not so bad, they do give way to taxis plying their trade on the road, just that some of them behave like the road only belong to them, turning also never give signal, suka suka cut into other lane, then alway farking accident at expressway leading to long long jam for nothing.</p>
