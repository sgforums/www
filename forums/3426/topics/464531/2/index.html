              <p>My conscience is clear. What goes around comes around. If one day I chut SMLJ stunt and get caught by people then so be it. Fact is I commit an offense so I pay for it.</p>
              <p>Before I become TD as a private car owner like most of us hate TD. Then when I started driving part time as a TD then I start to know it is not an easy job. I become more tolerant to TD. But when I started driving fulltime I become more tulan TD. Why? Because most of them are KNNBCCB selfish. Dun give way, hi jack pax, block your way when they see you on call, and many many more. Why can't everyone be more tolerant to each other? Why must chut so many pattern? Do so many LJ taichi? Every pax is like the last pax on the road? Die die must hi jack.</p>
              <p>So cannot blame me for what I am today. I am neither a good man or bad man. Just that when people good to me I will reciprocate, but when people piss me off nia then I dun give chance.</p>
              <p>So what if the Chrysler is hard up that day? He got the right to do this? If normal cab you all think I care? If they dun pick those stupid pax from bus stop then they never can get a cab loh. But Chrysler most are KNNBCCB, sibeh yaya papaya, all like very eh sai dog eye see people low type. Since they so atas need to chut this kind of stunt meh? So you think I give chance to them? NEVER.....</p>

              <p>Hi fellas. Have been dropping in occasionally thru the years. Things haven't changed much. Many
               antics which I don't condone is the usual fodder for the day. Civility 
              and level headedness has gone to the dogs. Should'nt the betterment of 
              TD's prospect take centrestage? TD's grievences, welfare etc. taking 
              precedence over lambastment of fellow TD from CDG? Smacks like an avenue
               for some personal vendetta. Go easy on those venomous toxins.</p>
              <p>Have been reading BCL since he was known as TCL. Though hard hitting and fiery at times, he articulate his points well with tinges of realism. Joeraj is another example. His sharing of knowledge is a welcome respite.</p>

              <p>Werent u one of hammer's supporters in the past threads? egging
              him on to hantum your fellow CDG drivers? So now u had awakened to
              the fact that the 'saints' here can do everything wrong but its ok
              , others do must post , must tekan?</p>
              <p>When i slammed the 'holy trinity' , noone came out to support.
              For a while , i thought all are saints here.</p>
              <p>When i lambasted mr 22 cts for his 'On meter before boarding '
              thread , my subsequent post to him was unceremoniously removed ,
              Khoon's thread and his apology was also removed. This is the
              censorship of the saints here</p>
              <p>So no matter how solid your english construction it is not gonna
              drill anything into their heads.</p>
              <p>This forum is going downhill from what i see. Newbies have eyes
              to see , they can be fools for 1 day, 1 month or 1 year but not
              forever.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To

              <p>U and i arent exactly the best of friends but on the day my dad
              passed on , i was very touched when u whatsapp a message of
              condolence to me . So one thing i do not understand why cant u
              extend this gesture of yours to others?</p>
              <p>Is there a need to do all these?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To Cyben764</span></p>
              <p>I have every reason to believe that the clip u posted indirectly
              caused the 2 CDG cabbies to get sacked. how so? That clip was
              posted on the 8th dec and probably was not even discovered till
              your post. As most people would know , the uninnovative , non
              creative , bootlicking Shin min picks up news from here and it
              appeared in the media.</p>
              <p>My words to you are as a CDG veteran of 10 years , i can tell u
              we have our own markets , i can go one night of shift without even
              touching a taxi stand or a street pax.</p>
              <p>These guys who got terminated will 99.9 % be thrown into
              circulation in the form of transcab , smrt or whatever and what
              will these fellas do ? they will squeeze with you for pax , take up
              an extra space at the stands . same thing , still will be an
              abundance of taxis around. Nothing changes if your motive is to be
              like the saints here to tekan CDG drivers.</p>
              <p>And to the so called chief , what u have against CDG , no need
              to take it out on the drivers. Smart and capable take on the
              company. Most of us hate that fucking co , do u think we love CDG?
              lampar ok?</p>
              <p>If any of you saints are smart , tekan the foreigners la . The
              FTs if they do browse this forum will be laughing their asses off
              to see a bunch of taxi drivers , ALL singaporeans killing one
              another while they are busily taking away your jobs.</p>
              <p>Think about what i wrote , i have more or less had enough of
              this forum , the only good thing is i made some really good pals
              from here and i will treasure their friendship forever.</p>

              <p>You know yourself if u had egged him on.</p>
              <p>i come from an era where mostly every TD is cordial on the road, when i fail to signal and cut in , i will raise my hands and apologise to the other driver . Likewise , other TDs do the same to me. There is a lot of give and take but what do we have now? The internet generation of TDs coming in posting clips , accusing people of being yao , being cheapo . These are the kind of things i am very beh song with.</p>
              <p>If u had driven as long as me , u will know back in those days , every TD is friendly towards one another. At the kiosk , at the car wash , waiting for calls also can come out and talk.</p>
              <p>Getting personal ? i dunno about that coz i have never even met u , how to get personal huh?</p>
              <p>And if u wanna talk about personal , nothing beats a bunch of cabbies who got TERMINATED from XXX and then rage a vendetta against its drivers who are merely out to tan jiak.</p>

              <p>i dont consider myself to be ah gong coz i was asked by poolman to join this forum in the later parts of its formation , for sure i wasnt here in 2003 hehe.</p>
              <p>Happy tio ho means he can bring misery to others? Like that , everyone who has a gun can just go around killing people?</p>
              <p>Anyway , about LV members lookin out for another , thats only if u belong to their different sections of cliques hor. Other than that , everyone is basically just for himself.</p>
              <p>In fighting is so common in there , Fist fight actually took place too. so looking out maybe yes? maybe no?</p>

              <p>Hi fellas. Have been dropping in occasionally thru the years.
              Things haven't changed much. Many antics which I don't condone is
              the usual fodder for the day. Civility and level headedness has
              gone to the dogs. Should'nt the betterment of TD's prospect take
              centrestage? TD's grievences, welfare etc. taking precedence over
              lambastment of fellow TD from CDG? Smacks like an avenue for some
              personal vendetta. Go easy on those venomous toxins.</p>
              <p>Have been reading BCL since he was known as TCL. Though hard
              hitting and fiery at times, he articulate his points well with
              tinges of realism. Joeraj is another example. His sharing of
              knowledge is a welcome respite.</p>
