              <p>Happy tio ho means he can bring misery to others? Like that ,
              everyone who has a gun can just go around killing people?</p>
              <p>Anyway , about LV members lookin out for another , thats only if
              u belong to their different sections of cliques hor. Other than

              <p>In fighting is so common in there , Fist fight actually took

              <p>dear hammer, few $ may mean nothing to u, it mean something to
              that cabby.. dun care limo or sampan.. arbo, go n drink kopi, read
              papers better? as for that wish.. lta is good, but it policys is
              not fair, sucks, stupid, or purposely crafted to jam the road (
              collect more $ la)..  if the bus lane is not use by buses, it
              actually is a waste of resources.. this kind of waste has been
              going on for years..</p>
              <p>bcl, i saw yr reply, not sure y it vanish..</p>

              In that case, don see it being a prob.... n I also see generally non lv members views  accomodated... think we all know individual hv own reasons for not joining lv... Mine is very simple... cant handle too much distractions while driving, scared langar...lol ... the mdt is enough to play around with... so maybe we can focus on the real issues by themselves..

              <p>It dont sound shit stirring but serious the way he put it.</p>
              <p>And if you come and say bus lane/bus stop cannot pick passengers, because of law.</p>
              <p>Then I will say the Law also say, you cannot park or stop at coconut tree and block the taxi stand from other taxi or passengers.</p>
              <p>Maybe coconut tree taxi stand you say empty, but say got 1 driver he got some good spirit there, like coconut tree taxi stand, but  he cannot use because you and gang operate htere, which the law say cannot. Or got pax want to wait there, how?</p>
              <p>If wanna talk law, I am very happy also to point many laws that can and are broken by everyone here.</p>
              <p>So dont come and use words the law say this say that, but for some things the law dont apply to you.</p>
              <p>You wanna be 100% law abiding prim and proper, good on you, but choose which law you want people to abide by and then point out their errors, but for laws you break or don't follow, totally ignore like never exist.</p>

              <p>Aiyo brother, to be fair,</p>
              <p>We cannot be so bias on chief pool lah, of course he got his interest, that is his rights and ideally, bring about this forum. So naturally, thing will be more focus and toward LV, if it is beach road, then more will be toward beach road radio, that is human interest in it natural behavor.</p>
              <p>Gathering can of course garner more newer members in LV, but there is also room for relax, eat and TCSS, or learn a few thing, networking is never a going to be neutral in it sense, I went for their gathering and there are also many non LV members, Ex LV members and also casket driver like me.</p>
              <p>Luring is a harsh word to use here, I would say more of a sales, when we buy a car or join any clubs or association, we might be lured in, but we will take it as a sales, because at the end of the day, the decision is still yours to join or not to join, and then having said that, LV also can generate income for you if there is a need, especially if you are driving with a company without much call. Not that they lure you in and leave you to rot.</p>
              <p>Forum or cyberspace is souless</p>
