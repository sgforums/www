              <p>Aiyo brother, to be fair,</p>
              <p>We cannot be so bias on chief pool lah, of course he got his
              interest, that is his rights and ideally, bring about this forum.
              So naturally, thing will be more focus and toward LV, if it is
              beach road, then more will be toward beach road radio, that is
              human interest in it natural behavor.</p>
              <p>Gathering can of course garner more newer members in LV, but
              there is also room for relax, eat and TCSS, or learn a few thing,
              networking is never a going to be neutral in it sense, I went for
              their gathering and there are also many non LV members, Ex LV
              members and also casket driver like me.</p>
              <p>Luring is a harsh word to use here, I would say more of a sales,
              when we buy a car or join any clubs or association, we might be
              lured in, but we will take it as a sales, because at the end of the
              day, the decision is still yours to join or not to join, and then
              having said that, LV also can generate income for you if there is a
              need, especially if you are driving with a company without
              much call. Not that they lure you in and leave you to rot.</p>
              <p>Forum or cyberspace is souless</p>

              <p>We should therefore, place our emotions more on the real aspect of our life, forums is a place of you like it, you stay, you do not like it, can just buzz off without any string attached, so, why need to play emotion, just have a sense (feeling) of it will do.</p>
