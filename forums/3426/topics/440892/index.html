              <p>At 34yo, you are still a very needed in the economy, I believe there are jobs that can suit you better than being a TD, please look for other alternative before you really decide to embark on TD, taking a Taxi licence for raining days is good, to put it into a full time job. Think twice.</p>
              <p>Of course people tends to look at the own time, own target kind of lifestyle job, that is natural, being a TD is one of those kind of job. You manage yourself without having to report to anyone or face the same ugly boss and colleague faces everyday. In exchange, you forgo CPF contribution, Medical benefit, bonuses, promotion, increment, annual leaves and many other benefits and perks such as transport claim, dental, overtime, allowances and so on. You need to focus on all these before you truly decided to be a TD, this trade command self discipline, business and quality service mind, which from day to day, you also will face road, paxs, traffic, authority and other cabbies problem.</p>
              <p>For example let look at earning power, drive cab on mean average can take in 3k per month net, cold hard cash without CPF deduction. In working life, you get 20% CPF deduction meaning you are left with $2.4k, however company will have to contribute another 16% for you, which is about $460, total money go into CPF $1060 which is further distributed into SA and medisave. In total wage concern, company pay you $3460 base on the basic of 3k, and if you work overtime with allowances, you get more base on the above percentage.</p>
              <p>I am saying you cannot be come a TD, but by asking the rate of pay of TD, you are actually comparing with working life pay, and if that is the case, I can tell you that if you are earning $2,500 and above, please do serious consideration, if you are below $2000, TD can be an option, but if you are $3K and above, better stick to working life. That's my opinon. At your age, you economy value to the industrial is still very high and worthy, try to find a job, do some partime upgrading and by 40+yo, you could be a someone on top looking down. A man by 40+yo is at his peak of his career, by that time, whatever he is doing will be more or less permanent, like we, as TD, die die TD until the end, no return, who would want to employ a 40+yo singaporean now a day, and especially so a former cab driver, sure like to argue and do his own way. On the other hand, as a TD for so many years, you simply cannot be able to adapt to working life anymore, what 8am punch card or sign in, 6pm go back, rush mrt, buses...tomorrow must complete the job, office politics, work base on bosses mood and not yours...fcuk lah.</p>

              <p>The LTA is going to reduce private car on the road as much as 1.5% per year in the coming years till abt 2015, with about more than 1/2 a million private cars on the road, let give a figure of 600,000 base on below datas, a 1.5 % decrease per year  is 9,000 cars gone and in about 4 years, 36,000 cars will be off the road. So, Taxi driver should not worry about the increases in cab population, it is to compensate those who give up car driving, take cab instead, and with a family of 4, the potential pax on the road by 2015 could increase by 100,000 over. So, if by 2015, cab population goes up to 30,000, it is still able to make a living out of cab driving. 100,000 paxs verus a 4000 cab increase. You said ho say bo.</p>
              <p>And also remember, there will be more opening of shopping and casinos and many other entertaining places coming up, the aging population where people will take taxis more after working so hard all their life, you ask old people go squeeze MRT ar?</p>

              <p>Bro Bowah, what you had mentioned can be true... nothing but the truth... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">.</p>
              <p>If the taxis' fares remains constant... There are a high chance of passengers (used to be drivers) will be shifting into Taxis as an alternative...</p>
              <p>From my understanding... the taxi fares will be raising soon....(hopefully not much)....</p>
              <p>Hence there will  be a big shift to the Public Transports....</p>

              <p>Well, with a higher prevailing COE (to renew 10 yo vehicles),
              there are a very high chance that the older cars will be taken
              <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>off the road</strong></span>.
               Not being realistic paying high premiums on OLD CARs.</p>
              <p>Bro Bowah, what you had mentioned can be true... nothing but the
              truth... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">.</p>
              <p>If the taxis' fares remains constant... There are a high chance
              of passengers (used to be drivers) will be shifting into Taxis as
              an alternative...</p>
              <p>From my understanding... the taxi fares will be raising
              soon....(hopefully not much)....</p>
              <p>Hence there will  be a big shift to the Public
              Transports....</p>

              <p>If the Taxi fares remain constant... then Pax don't feel the pinch...</p>
              <p>If Taxi fares will to go up &amp; adapt to Chrysler's 30 cents meter jump, then it will definitely be a turn-off for the pax.</p>
              <p>There are discussions by the Taxi companies that there is a possibility that it may happen (new meter jumps).... only when will it happen... (the timing must be right so as the consumers can absorb the hike in fares).   </p>
