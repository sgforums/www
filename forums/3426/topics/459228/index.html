              <p>that right, shouldn’t let those big companies bully, taxi drivers should unite, cent for cent, dollar for dollar, if price of gas goes down, then they shouldn't act as if they are struggling to make profit, that is utterly disgusting. .</p>
              <p><br>union gas are taking advantages because they spend tooo much in setting up the CNG station, they want to recoup their investment fast, you see the picture? Even prime company are so disgusted by their behavior that they dismantled their CNG tanks.<br></p>

              <p>Patrick Vail writes: 
              The price of natural gas hit a 10-year low in April, sinking to $1.91 per MMBtu on April 19.</p>
              <p>Gas’ stockpile surplus is well  down from its high of 61 percent above 
              the five-year average, which was reached  at the end of March 2012.<br><br> But the conditions that have  <strong>relentlessly pushed down prices</strong> the past 
              five-plus years--mainly <strong>abundant  supplies </strong>of low-cost shale gas and no 
              way to export it from North America--are still very much with us.<br><br> Prices are likely to plunge  once again during the next stretch of mild weather.</p>
              <p>Overlooked is the fact that  conditions for accelerating natural gas 
              usage have never been more robust. The  key is the continued dash to gas
               by electric utilities and other power  producers, spurred by the fuel’s
               low price, wide availability and, to a lesser  extent, its 
              environmental advantages.<br><br> At $10 gas, almost any producer  is a winner. The numbers fall sharply 
              at $4 to $5 and are a very short list  under $2. Cheap gas, however, is a
               major boon for companies geared up to take  advantage of rising gas 
              usage in power generation.</p>
              <p>Even with scorching  temperatures this summer, natural gas prices only 
              managed to briefly crack $3  per million British thermal units. That 
              makes it highly unlikely we’ll see a  return to even last summer’s price
               range of $4 to $5.<br><br> Producers have been able to  make up the difference in recent years by <a href="http://www.investingdaily.com/15123/natural-gas-the-race-to-1">shifting focus to oil  and natural gas liquids (NGL)</a>.
               This  ability, however, has been thrown into doubt by the plunge in oil
               prices from  nearly $110 a barrel earlier this year to less than $80 
              for a time in late  June.<br><br> One low-risk  energy play in the current pricing environment is Energen 
              Corp (NYSE: EGN). Its Alabama gas  distribution utility represents only a
               small portion of overall earnings and  aggressive price hedging and 
              reliance on proven reserves have kept profits very  steady.</p>

              <p>It is the producer, not the buyer that wins the game or gain the profit, you see, these are all cartels at works, Singapore being a resourcefuless country still depend very much on the cartels to fix a price everyday, and as such, are at the expense of these cartels.</p>
              <p>Let said if one day, indo is not going to supply us gas, and that arab refuse to supply us fuel, what happen here, in a week time, we are history.</p>
              <p>That is why, our govt need to diversity it international relationship, especially with all these fuel producer countries, beside indonesia, country like mynamar is also full of natural gas, in which China, being their close allies, had gain from it.  And now you know why lots of mynamar are here.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, we are helpless with regards to oil or gas prices, it is all up to supply and demand, and most of these bastards will keep stock, keep and keep on the pretext of overly demand or less supply to increase the prices, and once price increase, they release their old stock so as to gain max profit.</p>

               also switched to using more cheap natural gas to generate power instead
               of coal. Others used it as a substitute for nuclear power that was 
              offline for maintenance, PFGBest analyst <span id="lw_1337287560_5" class="yshortcuts cs4-ndcor">Phil Flynn</span> said.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_22_1348713200026_340">Now,
               the mild winter has given way to a mild spring in many areas. That 
              means homes and businesses aren't powering up their air conditioning 
              systems just yet. And Flynn said many of the idle nuclear plants are 
              being returned to operation, which could reduce the utilities' need for 
              natural gas.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_22_1348713200026_342">Electricity 
              demand from January through May 12 fell about 3.3 percent from the same 
              period a year ago, according to Edison Electric Institute, the country's
               main electric utility trade group.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_22_1348713200026_344">In
               other trading, oil prices fell as worries persisted about the future of
               Greece in the European Union and the long-term impact the crisis could 
              have on the global economy. Some wonder if Greece will be forced to 
              leave the group of countries that use the euro as currency if Greek 
              politicians who oppose austerity measures win next month's elections.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_22_1348713200026_357">That
               uncertainty trumped positive U.S. economic news. The Labor Department 
              said that weekly applications for unemployment benefits were unchanged 
              last week at a seasonally adjusted 370,000. That indicated modest gains 
              in the job market.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_22_1348713200026_355">Benchmark 
              oil fell 25 cents to finish at $92.56 per barrel in New York. Brent 
              crude, which is used to price many international oil products, fell 
              $2.26 to $107.49 per barrel in London.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_22_1348713200026_353">Heating oil dropped 4.86 cents to end at $2.849 per gallon and gasoline futures declined 4.27 cents to $2.8782 per gallon.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_22_1348713200026_351">Meanwhile,
               the <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">national average for retail gasoline fell</span></strong> about a half cent 
              overnight to $3.722 per gallon, according to AAA, Wright Express and the
               Oil Price Information Service. That's about 18 cents less than a month 
              ago and 22 cents less than a year ago.</p>

              <p>That is why, our govt need to diversity it international

              <p>At the end of the day, we are helpless with regards to oil or
              gas prices, it is all up to supply and demand, and most of these
              bastards will keep stock, keep and keep on the pretext of overly
              demand or less supply to increase the prices, and once price

              <p>the news maybe in april and may, but the chart i posted are latest, furthermore, since april till today, did the price of natural gas flicker behind international movement?  No, Since 2007 till today the prices of gas had plummeted from $20 to $3, but why are the prices at Union gas and SMART keep going up?</p>
