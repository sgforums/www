              <p>Ok a bit of ranting.....Just now I am queuing at T1 there is this Silver sampan infront of me. When we go in to the holding area. He sees the right side queue shorter by about 3 car he go and queue at the right side. So as usual the front taxi take right I will just take the left queue. Then when come to merging usually is one left one right merge ya? So what happen is when merging he will be behind me because sometimes there are some TD chit chat or day dreaming or reading papers etc so my queue move faster then his. GUESS WHAT???? He bypass the left right left right merging rule and eats into my lane nearly causing a collision.</p>
              <p>What happen next, no need to guess you all also know lah. Lim peh hot liao, hiong hiong lai cut him off, come down ask him WTF is he doing. He still got the cheek tell me he is infront of me before splitting queue so he have to right to cut in front of me when merging. GOT LIKE THAT ONE MEH? Maybe some old bird here can tell me. But at that time I really hot liao. We argue until the cow come home. For 5 whole mins we jammed up the holding area. Sorry if I have cause inconveniences to the fellow TDs behind but it is not me who started the incident.</p>
              <p>That idiot still got the cheek to says 1 place in the queue only mah I so çœ‹ä¸�å¼€. KNN who is the one who çœ‹ä¸�å¼€ in the first place. I tell him I very çœ‹çš„å¼€. Even want to argue with me whole evening no need to earn money I also no problem.</p>

              <p>Bro, I see many of the threads that you started are usually
              about your unhappiness on fellow TDs.</p>
              <p>I can only say minor incidents will make you "hot".</p>
              <p>If I'm you I'll just let it be. He is happy and I don't lose
              anything.</p>
              <p>Be more forgiving on the road otherwise you will be making
              yourself miserable.</p>
              <p>Then you will be venting your frustration on other road
              users.</p>

              <p>Sure fight and quarrel one lah, everyone also want to eat mah, that is why shakespear said, "Be guided", he is referring to human, we may not like laws and orders, but without it, we become uncivilise, as long as someone given the authority to guide you, people will behave, you put one indian worker to wave the taxi on one by one in order, thing will be smooth. Then it is only a indian worker, not even the TP</p>
