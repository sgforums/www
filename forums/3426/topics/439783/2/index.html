              <p>If there was even a proven way to win consistently by gambling, the casino would have closed shop long ago.</p>
              <p>Telling us that u have found a way to win consistently in a casino is like telling us that you have found a way to eradicate crime.</p>
              <p>The only way to eliminate all crime is to eliminate all human beings, and the only way to win consistently in a casino is to operate a casino. If you are telling me you can win the casino most of the time, you are indirectly saying that Stanley Ho, Sheldon Adelson and Tan Sri Lim Goh Tong are idiots...</p>
              <p>Let me ask you a simple question. Who do you think is smarter? The soccer bookie or the soccer punter? Any idiot can place a bet, but an idiot bookie will die with his cock in marikita position.</p>

              <p>Gambling in the Casino is like fighting with the world boxing champion.He can take your 100 punches, you can't withstand his 1 punch. </p>

              <p>I think losing money in casino is a little overated. The casino advantage is hovering around 5% (depends on which game), so the chance punters have is 45%, its really not that drastic like stepping into the ring with world boxing champion lah...very humurous way of describing. haha!</p>
              <p>Singapore Pools is a much worse than casino. SP advantages are huge (see my other posts on gambling).</p>

              <p>There is nothing like 50-50 .</p>
              <p>Why ?</p>
              <p>Cos the cards "shuffle" machine is so good , it is made to make
              banker win .</p>
              <p>They have a system to how to keep the cards after each game ,
              with more than one deck of cards , the "card shuffling "machine
              will "wash" the card to the favour of the banker .</p>
              <p>Any card games .</p>
              <p>His job just distribute , but funny enuf , most games he won
              .</p>
              <p>He just did nothing .</p>
              <p>Not huat type of people .</p>
              <p>Everyday huat for him meh ?</p>
              <p>Yes as dealer , he huat everyday .</p>
              <p>Like Ban Lat ..... he can get a 6 &amp; 7 , draw a 8 .</p>
              <p>And most times , he always draw 19 points , 20 points from start
              .</p>
              <p>How to beat them .</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Because the odd was not 50-50 from the start, not sure but maybe 51-49 or 52-48 ??</p>
              <p>Then this is only mathematically. Gambler still need to fight physcologically. They have to control their greed and fear.</p>
              <p>Imagine one put $1 then he wins. Next he double up to $2 then win again. Next double to $4 win again. Next double to $8 then he lost.   Didn't he win three times (out of four)? Didn't he win  $7?  But how much he has in his pocket now?</p>
              <p>Zero. Kosong. Zilt. Nil. Nada.</p>
              <p>HOW COME?</p>
