              <p>Yesterday another handsome well dressed young man got a fucking
              session from me at the top of my voice. After going
              from neil road to orchard tower, he say not enough change, ask
              for nets payment. I say only ezlink and credit card. He
              say ezlink no enough money and no credit card.
              So ask him go ATM and get some money. He say cannot charge for
              waiting time because its NOT HIS FAULT that my taxi got NO
              NETS. So I shouted at the top of my voice in orchard tower taxi
              stand, kept screaming till he took out credit card and paid. So he
              lied about no credit card like I thought. If fucker dare
              to run, me uncle will chase, shove him down the footpath and call
              police. I am ruthless with assholes who got money to dress well,
              fuck around, talk like big fuck but ask for discounts for cab
              fare.</p>
              <p>Later saw a chrysler taxi and let off my steam with him. He told
              me he kenna this kind of cheebye pax everyday. Almost everyday got
              people saw taxi bill and dont want to pay. Almost everyday also
              must call police. Almost all troublemakers are Singaporeans. The
              bangladeshis and chinese foreign blue collar workers never
              give this chrysler uncle any trouble.</p>

              <p>Let me start by saying, this discussion has been eye opening. It's damned interesting. I'm an "Ang moh" who lives in Sembawang. I always tip extra, because I know taxi driving is a thankless job sometimes, and giving someone the change or an extra $2 on a short trip isn't going to break my bank.</p>
              <p>On that note, I think you should calm down a bit f1. I'm sure you have some asshole customers, but your attitude of "if I'm cheated I'll die to fight blah blah blah" is a little dramatic. To be honest, you come off like such an asshole, that I feel like every TD I meet is going to be you, and I wouldn't want to give him shit. Stop being such a hardass.</p>
              <p>Aside from that, I appreciate what you guys do. Without you guys, I'd be lost half of the time, or sitting at home bored out of my mind.</p>

              <p>For a start, almost all passengers are either neutral or nice. But once a month or twice a month if I am lucky, I get to fetch some cheats who are well heeled, well dressed and got a foreign education. Its one thing to have a destitute asking for a discount, and another thing to have passengers living in nice condos in good locations and still asking for a discount. I go completely insane when the passenger tells me he or she is richer than me and can certainly afford the taxi fare, but just too bad he or she did not bring enough money to pay the fare, and that they got no credit cards. They all got some drinks and maybe the alcohol impaired their judgement. I dont know. But it does not matter, if they can afford to party then they should be able to pay in full for a cab ride.</p>

              <p>Hi Argyle, your comments really motivated me. Yes, only occasionally, I got paxs who said good words like thanks for the smooth and safe drive...or simply thanks for taking us back. But most paxs take Taxi with a face like as tho TD owed them something, no thanks, no tips and certainly no smile. Talking about gracious, we are still far from it.</p>

              <p><br>Bloody hell, live condo also want to ask for discount, how can?? those living in 3 and 2 rooms more steady, paid full fare one..and also nice to talk with them. Sometime, I took paxs like mother with childrens living in HDB 2 or 3 rooms, and father working in factory or as lorry drivers, I give them discount, cos I see them like my family. It is only the poor understand the poor.</p>

              driving, i realised they are currently my top -PHUI list. Act
              classy, but damn bloody stingy. Keep thinking you are taking them a
              longer route.</p>
              <p>Sat night, kena 4 "white" ah nehs. Boat Quay to St George. I
              took CTE, exit Moulmein. That fellow sitting beside me ask me</p>
              <p>How come it takes so long? Usually the journey is very
              short.</p>
              <p>Me replied : Sir, is raining heavily now. U want fast, maybe you
              take rocket faster.</p>
