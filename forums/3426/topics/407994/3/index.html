              <p>Yesterday night must be my day. I love fetching trouble makers and giving them a good fucking session. Yes it will end up wasting my time, but hey time I have. They want to be entertained, then they got the right taxi uncle.</p>
              <p>Went to Clarke Quay after 2am, and a punjabi lady wearing short skirt and revealing bloush walked straight to my cab, jumping queue.</p>
              <p>Upon reaching destination, she asked to stop outside her condo instead of driving inside.</p>
              <p>Then gave me small notes and coins, and still 2 dollars short. Kept apologising and saying never expected money no enough. She claimed to be drunked, though it does not seem so. So I fucked and shouted at her. She went out of the cab and coolly walked to her apartment saying will call police. I asked her to call police lor. Police no use one mah. Just call, its ok. She think she is some minister's daughter ah?</p>
              <p>I rushed the empty cab into the condo and waited. Luckily she came down in 5 minutes and passed me the balance 2 dollars.</p>
              <p>Me not fussy about 2 dollars. Its the cheating attitude. I dont care if the lady is pretty sexy or just an aunty. Money is all I see. For 2 dollars, even if it was a muscular man with a gun, I will still fight. Lose life can, lose license also can, waste time also can. But losing to cheats, robbers and scammers is totally unacceptable.</p>
              <p>This kind of cheeby paxes are what I use for entertainment. They dont understand taxi driving can be so fucking boring, and there are some uncles waiting out there looking for an excuse to fuck them. If they start a fight with me. Ho say liao, giving me excuse to humtum them back in defense is even more exciting.</p>

              <p>Use your judgement. There are people out there who like to step on other people. There are also nice people. You cannot reason with trouble makers. They need to be barked at, shouted at, and slapped if necessary. You must fight with them, because if u behave like chicken, they will just swallow u up. When that happens, the poor taxi uncle will be very angry for the rest of his day. And the bad energy might just end up on another pax or a friend or a family member.</p>
              <p>So just whack the fucker who started the trouble. Let it all out. Go as far as he or she wants the trouble to go. Finish it off and continue driving. You will feel much better. Let the trouble and bad energy start and end with the same idiot who started it.</p>

              Once pax use this trick (not nice to mention race)
              Short of 40 cents. No small notes only $50 and $100.
              I said no problem I've small notes, $50 or $100 sir ?
              He replied 100 also can, I said yes.
              When he saw my stack of $2 notes. He was shock, he said $50.
              
              
              
              Knn less than $10 fare want to use big notes n refuse to use NETS (30 cents extra)
              Don't know coincidence or what , a few of my TD friends encounter this.
              So I have this stack of $2 notes on standby. (my children last CNY angbao money)
              
              
              
              When pax tell me when they board. Is not a problem.

He say cannot charge for waiting time because its NOT HIS FAULT that my taxi got NO NETS. So I shouted at the top of my voice in orchard tower taxi stand, kept screaming till he took out credit card and paid. So he lied about no credit card like I thought. If fucker dare to run, me uncle will chase, shove him down the footpath and call police. I am ruthless with assholes who got money to dress well, fuck around, talk like big fuck but ask for discounts for cab fare.</p>
              <p>Later saw a chrysler taxi and let off my steam with him. He told me he kenna this kind of cheebye pax everyday. Almost everyday got people saw taxi bill and dont want to pay.
