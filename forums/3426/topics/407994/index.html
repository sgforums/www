              <p>Those Ah Nehs huh....</p>
              <p>Last time, when I work at Terminal 2 as trolley retriever (this is more than 20  years ago), part of my job is to recover trollies at the taxi stand.  We will try to make extra tips by help passengers / taxi uncles to load the luggages into the boot.</p>
              <p>Ang Mo and Indonesians are the best when giving tips.</p>
              <p>But, when it comes to Ah Nehs huh, we will just stand around until the taxi drives off before we will proceed to keep the trolley.  No point helping them at all.  They will just assume that it's part of your job.  Worked there for about 4 months before going back to school and I NEVER receive any tips from an Ah Neh before.  Not even once...</p>

              For me,
              
              
              Call Cancel or Noshow.
              I will just drive off. I won't help to shorten the queue.
              The farker that call  could be among the taxi queue, hoping to get quick taxi w/o paying the call charges. 
              
              
              
              Once oncall, reached pickup point saw  .... couple (not nice to mention race), looking at my direction. My sixth sense tell me they are the pax. Waited till time up and noshow buttom appear. Was about to move off they run to me and say they book the cab.
              I tell them "sorry ! time is up, don't ever play this game with taxi driver again". I press noshow and move off.

              Pickup oncall pax. He was talking on his mobile.
              He took quite awhile to tell me his destination.
              When I was about to start meter... knn "call cancelled do not proceed" 
              message appear. 
              
              
              
              
              TD : How come, call cancel ?
              pax: I did not cancel.
              TD : Since the call is cancel I can't take you.
                       please join the queue.
              pax: I will pay the call charges.
              TD:  Sorry, call cancel I can't take the call charges, please get down!
              
              
              
              
              Perfect timing to get the call cancelled, want to try his luck.

              <p>Another thought is they probably know they are the most disliked lot so they think what the heck , might as well be nasty lor. hahaha</p>
              <p>in fact the nicest ah nehs are those bangla workers. although they dont tip , at least they dont give trouble.  sometimes when i take em , i will deduct the cents and round down or give a $1 off. you can see that they are very grateful &amp; will say thank u very much uncle.</p>
