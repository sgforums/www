              <p><br>By if you are using Cab as private vehicle to fetch childrens and wife to and fro from work and school, OMO is not bad, you need to - off the  the transportation cost your family would had spent if you did not take them. All in all, you still got time to spent with family in  your cab.</p>
              <p>On the other hands for OMO, the pro is that you do not hv to rush to return, wash and pump as you like, it is like own time, own target, firer, watch your front kind of stuff.</p>
              <p>There are pros and cons in both OMO and relief, see how you outweight it, by doing sum, it can be misleading due to the Y factor, some can make more, some who like to take too much kopi break or idle, can alway end up on the losing side as OMO</p>

              <p>i'm not married but i got few elders needed my assistance in fetching them going medical appt/ treatments. An uncle with stoke on wheelchair n most cab wont fetch, my God-ma with diabetes n weak pair of legs, going up bus hard for her to climb hard for her to get down, mum with anemia n depression, will blackout at times when walking too far or going up bus. To them taking taxi, they cant really afford esp they r not working.</p>
              <p>Important point, its time to repay them now. When they r healthy, they took care of me when i'm young. now that they r old n sick, its time i do my part esp my mum n god-ma. when god-ma is childless.</p>
              <p>We all staying different areas, bedok, cck n marsling. Everytime i see god-ma come visit me n my mum i felt so heart pain. old n weak and need to travel so long distance from marsling to bedok. Sg might not be big but the mental for her is tiring. Everytime mum go visit uncle or god-ma, come back sure tired out due to the travelling n times falls sick. i may not have enough $$$ to give them but i just wan to bring them together for dinner n family gathering as time for them also not going to be very long. at least let them get together.</p>
              <p>Been working shift all alone, by the time off work, they already zzz. i'm the elder son so i got to take this responsibility n i should.</p>
              <p>So this becomes part of my reason i tot of OMO n TD.</p>
              <p>Due to these, if i'm on relief n super relief, wash taxi, topup n return taxi would be either too rush or not able to earn. i know using taxi as personal transport for one main reason going to die or the takings gonna be shit but nothing compared to having time with them when they r still around. Most pple forgotten about we have grown up n they have also grown old. Appriciate those around n what u have, life is something strange that we wont know n in next moment, its gone. when its gone, no point crying or regreting.</p>
              <p>I know all big bros n sistas here worked hard n gained experiences therefore advising newbiw liked me to be OMO first n be relief to gain more experiences but i got to give it a try. i already really done something that i tell myself no turning back but to look forward.</p>
              <p>Sorry for the "loh soh-ness" :P</p>
              <p>too far away telling my house story hehehehe....sorry sorry.... every household got their own story, sorry to tell mine :P ps ps ....hehehehe.....</p>

              <p>Been working shift all alone, by the time off work, they already zzz. i'm the elder son so i got to take this responsibility n i should.</p>
              <p>So this becomes part of my reason i tot of OMO n TD.</p>
              <p>Due to these, if i'm on relief n super relief, wash taxi, topup n return taxi would be either too rush or not able to earn. i know using taxi as personal transport for one main reason going to die or the takings gonna be shit but nothing compared to having time with them when they r still around. Most pple forgotten about we have grown up n they have also grown old. Appriciate those around n what u have, life is something strange that we wont know n in next moment, its gone. when its gone, no point crying or regreting.</p>
              <p>I know all big bros n sistas here worked hard n gained experiences therefore advising newbiw liked me to be OMO first n be relief to gain more experiences but i got to give it a try. i already really done something that i tell myself no turning back but to look forward.</p>
              <p>Sorry for the "loh soh-ness" :P</p>
              <p>too far away telling my house story hehehehe....sorry sorry.... every household got their own story, sorry to tell mine :P ps ps ....hehehehe.....</p>
