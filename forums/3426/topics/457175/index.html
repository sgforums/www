              these are real feedback from passengers
              
              1st. there are more than 1 passnger who report that they flag cab inside cbd and ask the driver if they know to go to certain location. the driver say yes then they board. but less than 1 hundred meters. the driver will ask them again and when they repeat the location the driver say the passengers was not clear first time, actually he do not go there or know how to go there, and tell passenger if he still want the driver to go, the driver may be go wrong or longer way, then not driver problem. the passenger ownself say ok he get out and take another. but then when the passenger alight, the passenger is asked to pay the meter $3.20 + $0.80 + $3.00 = $7, sometime $7.20. when passenger ask for reason, the driver say it is passenger fault for misleading and it is passenger ownself say to get down, the driver never say anything, so passenger must pay. when passenger ask for receipt, the driver will say is only new temporary relief do not know how to issue receipt or have any receipt to issue. this happen more than once to different passengers on different times
              
              2nd is some TD charge $3 Airport Surcharge on PER LUGGAGE. meaning if 4 bags is extra $3x4 = +$12.
              
              3rd is Hotel Surcharge. i know people take cab from Copthorne King or Miramar or Riverfront are charged $3 Hotel Surcharge. the TD tell them is can claim back from the Hotel after but the Hotel refuse.

              <p>TS seems bend on whacking TDs, I find his so call feedbacks from passengers far fetched. Probably he gets great pleasures out of bullying frontline service pple in general. My take is he should go find someone bigger in size, where's the glory in whacking TDs?</p>

              <p>these are real feedback from passengers</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>1st. there are more than 1 passnger who report that they flag
              cab inside cbd and ask the driver if they know to go to certain
              location. the driver say yes then they board. but less than 1
              hundred meters. the driver will ask them again and when they repeat
              the location the driver say the passengers was not clear first
              time, actually he do not go there or know how to go there, and tell
              passenger if he still want the driver to go, the driver may be go
              wrong or longer way, then not driver problem. the passenger ownself
              say ok he get out and take another. but then when the passenger
              alight, the passenger is asked to pay the meter $3.20 + $0.80 +
              $3.00 = $7, sometime $7.20. when passenger ask for reason, the
              driver say it is passenger fault for misleading and it is passenger
              ownself say to get down, the driver never say anything, so
              passenger must pay. when passenger ask for receipt, the driver will
              say is only new temporary relief do not know how to issue receipt
              or have any receipt to issue. this happen more than once to
              different passengers on different times</strong></span></p>
              <p>2nd is some TD charge $3 Airport Surcharge on <span>PER
              LUGGAGE</span>. meaning if 4 bags is extra $3×4 = +$12.</p>
              <p>3rd is Hotel Surcharge. i know people take cab from Copthorne
              King or Miramar or Riverfront are charged $3 Hotel Surcharge. the
              TD tell them is can claim back from the Hotel after but the Hotel
              refuse.</p>
