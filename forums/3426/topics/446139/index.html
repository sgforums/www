              <p><a href="http://www.fengshuimall.com/dragon/zodiac-allies-secret-friend-dragon-mobile"></a>The lunar years of the Dragon are 1916, 1928, 1940, 1952, 1964, 1976, 1988, 2000 and 2012. Individuals born in these years will embody the traits of the powerful dragon, and will be very intelligent, popular, talented and proud. The Dragon is full of energy and leadership, and has the power to achieve great things. However, due to its mighty nature, individuals of the Dragon Zodiac can quickly become over-demanding, prone to worry, quick tempered and power hungry. The Dragon will always maintain a tough face, but the inner personality is often soft and gentle. The suggested professions for those born in the years of the Dragon are leader, artist, politician or priest.</p>
              <p>It's a mix of good and bad in your bag this year. Although 2012 is your year (Dragon), your luck is not very good and the year is going to be rough for you because your horoscope sign is in conflict with the Grand Duke Jupiter and the Five Yellow. The former brings obstacles, aggravations and hindrances in your life that will break your will and hope, while the latter brings all kinds of misfortune and losses. You need to persevere and work at being strong to cope with the strong dose of Feng Shui afflictions in 2012 in your chart, with much of it causing a setback in your monetary luck. The 48 year old Dragon seems to have higher resistant to this though. You must be mindful and make every effort to suppress the feng shui ills that threaten to squash even your best plan.</p>

Individuals born in these years are often very popular and admired among those around them, and display the tendencies to be agile, intelligent, friendly, perseverant, and well-liked. You are sexually appealing, charming and good talker. You are hardworking and loyal. However, there are many negative traits that come with the Horse Zodiac, some of these being selfishness, rudeness, negative cleverness, moody and a very high ego. Although the Horse is a well respected Zodiac sign, when these traits are displayed that effect is diminished. The suggested professions for those born in the years of the horse are scientist, explorer, politician or poet.</p>
              <p>The horse is in full direct conflict with the Three killings. The dreadful Three Killings or “San Sha” – a combination of three “Sha” namely the Year Sha, Robbery Sha and Disaster Sha. Impediments that set you back may be caused by the Year Sha; financial losses may be due to Robbery Sha and frequent accidents and mishaps could be because of the Disaster Sha.

Your networking will grow and your foundation will be strengthened further to attract abundance for the future. You will emerge thriumphant in most occassions. Having said that, this is not a good year to start anything with high risk especially financially. Better to keep doing work you are familiar with. Those who are young and just starting out in working life should curb impulsive decision. Do not get ahead of yourself or you might at the same time attract envious eyes. The <a href="http://www.fengshuimall.com/victory-banner-mystic-knot-evil-eye"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Victory Banner with Mystic Knot and Evil-Eye Keychain</span></span></a> or <a href="http://www.fengshuimall.com/evil-eye-ommani-padme-hum-keychain"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Evil Eye with Om Mani Padme Hum Keychain</span></span></a> is just perfect for you this year.

                                      presented with honesty, compassion, loyalty, generosity and
                                      dedication to things you love. A protector, you are always ready to
                                      help and can get every defensive sometimes where friends and family
                                      are concerned. You have a symphathetic ear. The disadvantages of
                                      the Dog Zodiac are that you tend to become very lazy and instigate
                                      arguments when you are frustrated. Also, you have the strong
                                      tendency to become depressed and pessimistic.</p>

              Pig
              
              The lunar years of the Pig are 1923, 1935, 1947, 1959, 1971, 1983, 1995, 2007 and 2019. The Pig is the last symbol in the Chinese Zodiac cycle, and those born in these years are loyal, reliable, loving, passionate, honest and tolerant. Some of the negativities that arise out of these traits are naivety and gullibility, as well as the tendency to get frustrated due to lack of knowledge. Despite this, the Pig is an extremely loyal sign, and will often sacrifice its own good for the sake of others.
