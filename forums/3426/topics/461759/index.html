              <p>"At about 9.37am on Nov 20, a Singaporean couple flagged for my father's taxi at the junction of Toa Payoh Lorong 8.</p>
              <p>"The guy told my dad that he wanted to go to three locations in total -- Jalan Besar, Rowell Road &amp; Beach Road.</p>
              <p>"Firstly, he asked my dad to head to Jalan Besar.</p>
              <p>"Upon reaching, the guy dropped his girlfriend/wife and told my dad to go to his second location, which was Rowell Road.</p>
              <p>"Upon reaching Rowell Road, he told my dad to wait for him for five minutes as he wanted to go upstairs to take money from his boss.</p>
              <p>"So, my dad was kind enough to wait for him.</p>
              <p>"The fare was at $8.60 at that point of time.</p>
              <p>"My dad waited for over 20 minutes at least; no one came down during this time.</p>
              <p>"My dad then called his company to inform them of this issue and told the taxi control room that he's leaving.</p>
              <p>"The fare was $16.80 by then.</p>
              <p>"Honestly, this isn't the first case and this has been a growing issue that taxi drivers are facing.</p>
              <p>"Although reports have been made and complaints and feedbacks given to the company, there is still no solution to this problem.</p>
              <p>"My dad is just trying to earn a living.</p>
              <p>"He can't drive for long hours as he is no longer young and because of old spinal injuries.</p>
              <p>"Thus, he only earns $20 to $50 a day, and don't forget that he has to pay for the taxi's rental and diesel every day.</p>
              <p>"If you don't have the money to pay for a cab, why don't you take a bus or MRT?</p>
              <p>"Why must people resort to running from their taxi fares?</p>
              <p>"I hope that someday, this guy will be caught and I do hope that this acts as an 'alert' to taxi drivers who happens to pick up this couple again."</p>
