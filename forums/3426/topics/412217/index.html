              <p>By Uncle Cabby's own admission, he speeds by at least 30 km/h in excess.</p>
              <p>He has admitted to going over by 50 to 60 km/h on occasion.</p>
              <p>You mean, that is not reckless driving? Well done.</p>
              <p>I only have one wish for people who go up to 60km/h above the speed limit - I wish for them to just die alone and not kill other people while they're at it.</p>

              <p>Fudgester, u don't just wish for pax to die as it's not a nice thing to do. Perhaps a better way of putting ur message across is to advise against excessive overspeeding or overspeeding for that matter, n if  accident does happen,  it's by one's own dismeanour n hope it didn't implicate  or involve others.</p>
              <p>So drivers out there, when u want to chiong for better life, don't endanger other's as well as yours too.</p>

              <p>going faster than the road/traffic conditions allows and going faster than the drivers' capabilties to handle the car. one of these makes it very dangerous and 2 together makes it extremely dangerous.</p>
              <p>go home to your love ones safely BUTdon't be the CAUSE of other road users' tragedies.</p>
              <p>use common sense, when you have to go above the speed limit to get out of potential hazardous situations, then speed off. eg bunching of vehicles..lane 4 vehicles going at 70km, lane 3, lorry going at 75km, lane 2 cars going at 80km, lane 1 going at 80km. all these vehicles bunching up almost side by side are dangerous situation.  lane 1 should power up and break the formation.</p>
              <p>the above scene is NOT during heavily congested roads where every one is moving at 30km.</p>
              <p>it's not about you are wrong and I am right. any way no one is always right, so use common sense and give way, there's no loss of face.</p>

              <p>Which is why I was being so damn harsh in my post.</p>
              <p>I have the right to safety on the roads, and so do my loved ones. I'll be damned before I let some daredevil taxi driver who speeds in excess of 60km/h above the legal speed limit inflict harm upon them.</p>
              <p>As the threadstarter himself has stated, he knows the consequences of speeding by so much: 12 demerit points. However, that seems to have no deterrent effect on him. So I'm just reminding him of the other potential consequence: death through a terrible crash.</p>
              <p>These daredevil drivers can learn the easy way, or they can learn the hard way. If they crash and die while choosing to learn things the hard way, well, I'm not shedding any tears for them.</p>
