              <p>I believe i am the only one here who always voice out against driving too young an age. i share my life experience now.</p>
              <p>I started off driving right at 30 yrs old. Before i hit the age required for a TDVL , my friend asked if i wish to work together in a shipping co for $1,300 per mth. </p>
              <p>I laughed at him and say knn so low , u siao bo? he said 'u dun wan its ok , i go work'. So i went to drive a cab and he went about working in this new co , 10 years on my friend is a manager in that co earning a very stable income and with juniors under his command.</p>
              <p>Frankly i have wasted away this 10 years , no doubt its free and easy but i started out too early . at 30 i could have done more challenging stuff but i chose to take the simple route. Now at 40 im fucked liao . work for ppl also die , drive also die , wanna do bizness also die coz no $ &amp; all i know is meter and add surcharge.</p>
              <p>Trust me , those in their early 30s , u will get burned out one day. So fuckin sick of the steering . So after u get burned out , what are u going to do?</p>
              <p>pls bear in mind that employers think very lowly if u put in ur resume that u were a TD in ur last job.</p>

              <p>Young birds out there, please take BCL advice. &lt; 30 yrs old, please just take a $1K plus job. You are young, no family to support, just yourself. Be humble and work your way up. 10 yrs later, if u r still humble and able, just like what BCL said, you would have a nice stable job.</p>
              <p>Driving cabs is for those who lost their jobs n got families to support. Even if u 30yrs old and only got PSLE and a driving license, if u r not married, pls tahan a low paying job, and wait for your promotion. It is what I myself would do, unless u have tried working your way up and find that your ego is too big, cannot tolerate boss ordering u around.</p>
              <p>So those who carried on as cabbies got at least 2 kind. Those who got big egos, and those who failed at their careers or business at an advanced age for various reasons.</p>
              <p>But looking at the bright side, there are cabbies who got very lucky.</p>

              <p>Young birds out there, please take BCL advice. &lt; 30 yrs old,
                  please just take a $1K plus job. You are young, no family to
                  support, just yourself. Be humble and work your way up. 10 yrs
                  later, if u r still humble and able, just like what BCL said, you
                  would have a nice stable job.</p>
              <p>Driving cabs is for those who lost their jobs n got families to
                  support. Even if u 30yrs old and only got PSLE and a driving
                  license, if u r not married, pls tahan a low paying job, and wait
                  for your promotion. It is what I myself would do, unless u have
                  tried working your way up and find that your ego is too big, cannot
                  tolerate boss ordering u around.</p>
              <p>So those who carried on as cabbies got at least 2 kind. Those
                  who got big egos, and those who failed at their careers or business
                  at an advanced age for various reasons.</p>
              <p>But looking at the bright side, there are cabbies who got very
                  lucky.</p>

              <p>Age await no one, to compare is to add on more pressure on yourself. One life is different from the other, just like roads, there are many roads in life to walk on, as long as you work hard, do an honest job, respect yourself and be proud of what you are doing, you are as good as what you are, a good father, a good husband and a good citizen.</p>
              <p>My cousin studying with me is now a Doctor, another friend who skipped school with me is now a NUS professor. So, how to compare?? Then I got some end up as causal workers, some as security guards, why not your compare with all these??</p>
              <p>Since I posted here, I already mention that in your early or mid 30s, if you are driving taxis, you still got choices in your life, by 40s, the choices will be less, and by 50s, better forget all, forget about comparing, about who become MD or who become bellboy. In 50s, it is more on how to treasure life to the best.</p>
              <p>However, having said that, earning 5k and 6k or even 10k is not as simple as you see, you need 10 years of consistency and on the ball, and you need to carry on with all kind of corporate pressure and stress. For you, you just go on and be a happy cabby with so many happy frens around.</p>

              <p> Hardwork is the key to all jobs, if you go calculate this and that, you calculator can never be bigger than those taxi companies, there is hardly any shortcut or cut and paste method, just drive and since already in this line, might as well enjoy it.</p>
