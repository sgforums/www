              <p>As long as its an honest living I don't see an issue, if talk about dumping ground every job can be a dumping ground, go IR for example when I was with MBS there's a lot of people who joined because they have no luck with other employments.

              <p><br>Ah Rich,</p>
              <p>In this world, there are 3 kind of job, one is a job that you can see a bright future, eg you can become a MD, a manager, a GM or a senior enginneer or chief engineer, another one is you can also see a future, but that future is the more or less the same as now, eg are Taxi drivers, guards, cleaners, sweeper, operators, etc, all these give you very limited opportunity to go up, and mostly likely in 20 years time, you will be still driving a taxis if you are a taxi driver, maybe just better taxis.</p>
              <p>The 3rd kind of job is to work on one that you want to do it, you enjoy it no matter whether it got a future or not, and if you pick TD, you can promote yourself to limo or maxi or end up doing private one, but still driving, still working. So, my advice is that you better relook into what you want, if you really pick up TD, make sure you enjoy it, enjoy what you are doing. And if you do that, it fine, like you said, a honest living. And if 10 years down the road, you tell me you still enjoy it, I give you a big ten. But frankly, i can tell you, 10 full time cabbies out of 10 driving for 10 years, not one, most will fark it. Those who still say it good and still enjoy it very much is nothing but only a self motivation to move on.</p>

              <p>To me, begin a Cabby is a transit period, this transit period might took a long long time, or even forever. I just need to keep my dream to keep me moving.</p>

              <p><br>For favoritism, you are right,</p>
              <p>for comparison, should also encourage not to compare with others of your time or age, otherwise, see others earn big as banker or managers, feel so lousy yourself,  how to drive on??</p>
              <p>As for emotion, meaning dun play emotion with pax or yourself when you are driving, be focus of who you are when you are driving, be professional in what you are doing, if I peng bak kua until now, I just peng bak kua, lots of gossips here and there during peng bak kua, just hear and nod, never get emotion about it, like wise, in driving, let go all other matters, just focus, do not get emo over pax face, characters or attitude, just do your part, if really get a lousy pax, just drop them off and tell them to take another cab, cabby that play with emo alway end up getting frustrated themselves for nothing.</p>
              <p>In any dispute, learn to think out of a box in situation of uneasiness, look from outside the cab and see the whole picture, you see only angry faces, temper going to blow anytime kind of face, worst are those lan si lan yong faces, not worthy of it, afterall, we are out there to earning abit of living. By having less emotional attachment, you get get less problem.</p>
