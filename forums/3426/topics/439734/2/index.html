              <p><br>sg govt is the biggest employer in singapore directly or indirectly. Its not abt "foreign talent" but the cost of labour. To ease the flow of cheap labour, work permit got to be laxed across all boards from public to private sector. Just that the pte sector gets to benefits from govt policy of increasing GDP by lowering the labour cost.</p>

              <p>do u guys know why the westerners demostrated whenever there is WTO/Gx meetings?</p>
              <p>it's all about jobs! those westerners protest against exporting jobs to overseas.</p>
              <p>the same happens right here in SG except that the govt is giving jobs to foreigners right at our own door step.</p>
              <p>even foreign govt (with FTA signed with SG) openly request for opening of our industries (doctors. lawyers) to their companies to setup shop here and send their own kind here for the jobs created instead of employing local citizens.</p>
              <p>as early as 1992, my friend working in a MNC producing hard disks told me that once a person from a certain country becomes supervisor, he will make things difficult for the SG worker to force him leave then bring his own kind into the company.</p>
