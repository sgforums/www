              <p>hey all, I'm new to this forum i've made my choice to become a cabby and had already submitted my application to LTA last week.</p>
              <p>Ok, now my main concern now is I've been put under WA(warrant of arrest) before(Recently) for failling to  attend court  to answer charges for the carpark summons against me. Since i've missed the Court hearing and i was put under WA. The Warrant enforcement unit then send me a reminder letter to urge me to report to them asap to avoid any physical arrest against me, and i've actually reported to them on the very next day once i've received it and the advise given to me by them was i need to settle this outstanding carpark summon before the next court hearing date which was scheduled on 5th MAY 10.</p>
              <p>Question is will this issue affect my appllications? Hope all old birds can enlighten me on this...million thks</p>

              <p><br>Bro La2534,</p>
              <p>I ever picked up pax who told me their pay as a SOC (special ops command) soldier is around $2K and for those working in CID is around $4K. I felt so sorry for these high class security forces. Risking their lives for a miserable sum of money, and very long working hours with odd shifts. Might as well work as a security guard cum chauffeur, or as a taxi driver. More relax and same income as before.</p>
