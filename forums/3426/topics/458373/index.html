              <p>The law requires that your car be insured at all times.</p>
              <p>Driving your car around without insurance is a serious offence in the eyes of the law.</p>
              <p>The penalty is a fine of up to $1,000 or imprisonment of up to 3 months, or both. Upon conviction, offenders will also be disqualified from holding a driving licence for at least 12 months.</p>
              <p>This is certainly painful, especially for those who depend on their licence for their livelihood (e.g. taxi drivers). So do make it a point to ensure that your vehicle is properly insured.</p>

By agreeing to ferry more than the allowed number of passengers u basically cut the need of 2 taxis to 1!!! So u are taking away another TD earnings. U are spoiling market for urself. Nowadays wt more and more TD having Car Cam, all one have to is send LTA a clip and u are out looking for alternate job. So help urself and help others, don't ferry more than what is allowed. </p></div>

              <p>Ah Jimmy Case, this problem will never happen to me. Indian FT is my absolute last choice in pax. Sometimes, even CBD calls, midnight calls also I won't take, what more street hire jobs?</p>
              <p>Indian FT with family including mother (or father) and kids? That one even worse, maybe the first sometimes I will take as a last chocie, this one, absolutely no chance.</p>
              <p>I generally avoid pax with kids, especially if I notice the kids jumping frantically when hailing the cab, they will behave like monkeys in the cab. I know I am generalising perhaps unfairly here, but I have had enough of kids behaving badly with the parents doing nothing to stop them.</p>
              <p>Indian FT kids are worst, the parents treat their kids like 'angels' or gold, will never stop them or scold them for doing wrong.</p>
              <p>Now why I avoid Indian FT?</p>
              <p>1) They will talk non stop especially women, or on the phone in their stupid dialects. You see this all the time, talking loudly in Hindi usually and don't fuck care about people around them, who must listen to their animated conversations.</p>
              <p>2) These FT bring their culture here, including the caste system, they think they are some higher class because of their caste or jobs. They will treat drivers like shit.</p>
              <p>3) And of course, they stay some stupid places like Sengkang, Jurong West or wherver you'll find a hard time finding another fare.</p>
              <p>4) They must pay by card or $50 even for $5 or $6 fares? Why to act high class, la.</p>

              <p>I didnt fully understand the problems here. But assuming the case was more people trying to squeeze into a cab to save money few points.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>May of you are lucky to be better than many other. But it didn't come from your greatness. had you been born in India as an Indian FT, I can bet you would be doing the same.</p>
              <p>Though there are many arrogant people,two things for sure, not all of them are Indians and not all Indians are arrogant. The chinese culture is designed to be subservient/worship the Boss so relatively many seems arrogant as it has been my observation. Of course there are some north indians who truly believe they are divine.</p>
              <p>A bit more of compassions/giving a hand to those idiots who think they are great can help you feel better about yourself(You are better than that idiot) and do something good.</p>
              <p>Peace!</p>

              <p>For me, explain nicely, no need to get angry, once you stop, meaning you have the intention to pick, so why get so upset? Unless pax insist must go, than for me, stop engine, get down and smoke.......don't need to argue........</p>

              <p>I have to agree that breaking the laws is no good especially in Singapore context, further to brothers comments on Indian FT cultures,</p>
              <p>I would like to add that people from these countries, the like of China and India or any other developing ones, are also cultured in a way that breaking of laws is common because you can bribe your way out.</p>
              <p>You will find yourself facing a different culture, cheapo in our eyes, yet proud and like to break laws here and there, looking down on others way of earning a living, yet never give a thot for others, these are all very common in those countries where disparity of the rich and poor are at the two extreme, and the poor are at the mercy of the rich.</p>
              <p>We TD are very much expose to these type of culture happening more than those offices job, because day in day out, we engage them in the real society of singapore, therefore, can really see how their behavior cross the line, and to some of us, it can be a culture shock.</p>
