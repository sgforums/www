              <p>Anytime soon, I am also gonna quit from my hirer. Normally I would just fuck care, but drive for him nearly 2 year.</p>
              <p>Maybe I give notice, or 24 hours, haven't decide, or maybe start play plum pudding, feel like driving drive, dont feel dont drive, force him to sack me. He hirer what, he responsible for the cab.</p>
              <p>Anyway must be a bit harsher on next hirer. My conditions are</p>
              <p>a) Must allow smoke in cab ( I just cannot not smoke and drive, since got license 20 years ago</p>
              <p>b) No such thing as unannounced off day 1/2 charge.</p>
              <p>c) No such thing as pay more for diesel, equal can, more than going rate cannot. eg diesel 1.13 no such thing as 1.15. Day shift consumption is always more than night.</p>
              <p>d) washing to be done equally. You dirty the cab, you clean, i dirty I clean.</p>

              <p>Hi principal, I am a super relief, so more or less work on week
              end from friday start till monday morning, sometime take over
              people who go on leave, be it sick or holidays.</p>
              <p>For sonata, some hirer offer me $75 from sat 6.00am to monday
              6.00am, but usually, sunday after midnite, I return.</p>
              <p>Some offer me $80, and I still take it, maybe a year or 2 old
              sonata, all these come with washing and a full tank upon return. To
              go $90 per shift of 24hrs, for a full weekend sat and sunday,
              48hrs shifts, I never take for a sonata class.</p>
              <p>If I take, it will spoil the relief market. We are not
              unjustifiable people, as long as rental goes up, yes, we are
              willing to help the hirer to share the burden. More so, if the
              hirer give no room for you to discuss and straight away tell you
              off as tho we are beggar, then sorry lah, if hirer fark type, even
              $60 also never take, can end up with lots of problem.</p>
              <p>Oh, provided u include sunday, then maybe we can
              discuss, meaning from sat to sunday</p>

              <p>If mine is for both Sat &amp; Sun (No fixed time only to return 2359 Sun) for 80/day for Wish 2.0, worth or not. Your 75 is for one or two days? My hirer very chin chye until I can't tarhan cos feedback him the petrol issue no response yet. Maybe this weekend when I drive hope he said something,</p>

              <p>Anyway, if there is really such practice, is it only for hirers

              the hirer too?</p>
              <p>If not, really make a relief job like so un-important man!
              Anytime the hirer need, the relief got to give way. What if the
              relief already got jobs all lined up already?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, I no need to throw key la. He already send me a sms
              "Today I Terminate you!"</p>
              <p>Anyway, it's just a matter of time we split, he knows it cos he
              every day see me take my LV sticker in and out and dun put it
              overnight. Was thinking since my Sonata is coming anytime, no need
              to bother to look for another one first, so if can endure, just
              live day by day first but I expect something to happen on the 15th,
              my next off day when I will refuse to cover for him. but actually,
              i want him to make the first move.</p>
              <p>He think he so "garang", take action first win.</p>
              <p>This the sms I replied to him.</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yea u right! Dun forget it's
              you who terminate me! You already so broke, need to borrow money
              from me. Even need to pocket the money I give you for car wash. Now
              Chinese New Year coming, need money for any bao, need money for
              everything, you go sweep the road alone la. I am not living off
              your charity u know? I am paying you full half of yr rental, no
              discount, no "otang".  I am helping you bear 50% of your
              burden everyday. Today, it's you who terminate this 50%, so enjoy
              bearing the full load for yourself ok! Super Taiko Hirer. You want
              to be hero, be prepare to pay the price for it.</span></em></p>

              <p>Hi principal, I am a super relief, so more or less work on week
              end from friday start till monday morning, sometime take over
              people who go on leave, be it sick or holidays.</p>
              <p>For sonata, some hirer offer me $75 from sat 6.00am to monday
              6.00am, but usually, sunday after midnite, I return.</p>
              <p>Some offer me $80, and I still take it, maybe a year or 2 old
              sonata, all these come with washing and a full tank upon return. To
              go $90 per shift of 24hrs, for a full weekend sat and sunday,
              48hrs shifts, I never take for a sonata class.</p>
              <p>If I take, it will spoil the relief market. We are not
              unjustifiable people, as long as rental goes up, yes, we are
              willing to help the hirer to share the burden. More so, if the
              hirer give no room for you to discuss and straight away tell you
              off as tho we are beggar, then sorry lah, if hirer fark type, even
              $60 also never take, can end up with lots of problem.</p>
              <p>Oh, provided u include sunday, then maybe we can
              discuss, meaning from sat to sunday</p>

              <p>When I just started driving for my last hirer, our agreement was like this:</p>
              <p>late upto 30mins - give and take</p>
              <p>late up to1.5hrs - half rental (need to pay only a quarter of daily rental)</p>
              <p>late up to 2.5hrs - free rental</p>
              <p>Of course this can go both ways lah, but at least this will keep us to be more disciplined on timing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But in the end this never happen, he always give me early, Taiko me always give just before the time is up :)</p>
              <p>Even when he do disposals he still try to squeeze time to change shift with me and I continue to do his hourly job.</p>

              only? What if the relief also got such booking, can he just pay off
              the hirer too?</p>
              <p>If not, really make a relief job like so un-important man!
              Anytime the hirer need, the relief got to give way. What if the
              relief already got jobs all lined up already?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, I no need to throw key la. He already send me a sms
              "Today I Terminate you!"</p>
              <p>Anyway, it's just a matter of time we split, he knows it cos he
              every day see me take my LV sticker in and out and dun put it
              overnight. Was thinking since my Sonata is coming anytime, no need
              to bother to look for another one first, so if can endure, just
              live day by day first but I expect something to happen on the 15th,
              my next off day when I will refuse to cover for him. but actually,
              i want him to make the first move.</p>
              <p>He think he so "garang", take action first win.</p>
              <p>This the sms I replied to him.</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yea u right! Dun forget it's
              you who terminate me! You already so broke, need to borrow money
              from me. Even need to pocket the money I give you for car wash. Now
              Chinese New Year coming, need money for any bao, need money for
              everything, you go sweep the road alone la. I am not living off
              your charity u know? I am paying you full half of yr rental, no
              discount, no "otang".  I am helping you bear 50% of your
              burden everyday. Today, it's you who terminate this 50%, so enjoy
