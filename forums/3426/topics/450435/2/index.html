              <p>"said average net income per cab per day has risen by 12 per cent to $210.93." Is this statement justify? Many had done more than that, or else which TU dare to go home.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Careful on our meter,especially CDG drivers, do not on/off for fun as our MDT is link to the main system in Cablink, every log is capture, so if you are very protective on your income, drive for other company. I did not or intend to block any information? Did I?</p><p>
              
              </p><p>How good, how bad a company is, whether link to PAP or government is non of our TU business, especially if you are not driving for that particular company. You pay rental to operate a business, if rental too high, you jolly well do your own calculation and judge by yourself, not to criticize here and there, we don't own a living to the company, so is the company.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Don't try to be a smart alex, giving all the assumption and trying to sleep over it. I'm serious this time, will expect all kind of bombardment. We TD know ourselves, good or bad to drive? Is it a decent jobs to bring home bread and butter? Why worry on good or bad critic?</p><p>
              
              </p><p>And lastly, nobody can sell news, you are insulting thousand of SPH staffs. You call, whether Shin Ming want to entertain you or not is up to the editor, not by offering monetary benefit, you had to really watch your statement.</p><p></p>

              <p>CDG tabulate their calculation through our MRT log report, how to arrive these report? Is through their drivers daily routine on the road. From the moment you log on and pick up the first pax to last.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>CDG don't need to sent an officer to sit beside your cab and see what you do, neither they need to sit in coffee shop and tcss with you, but when they release the statistic, people criticize by hell but without knowing that is a facts.</p><p>

              <p>People said TD 2 hrs can collect $200 already, and some said 1/2day driving can collect $200 already, can go home shake legs. And some said they earn 6 to 10k per month driving taxis...so on.</p>
              <p>As a jack of most trade myself including TD, frankly speaking, TD are the only peoples who like to take their part and knock on their own heads.</p>
              <p>As Marine worker, most of us corporatively alway tell people/ captain or customer we earn peanut, $30 per day, which in fact is much higher</p>
              <p>As Casket drivers, togather thru understanding, we tell clients, we only earn $40 for 12 hrs work, in hoping peoples gives us generous tips</p>
              <p>As car dowloader, we as a team understand the need to alway tell other that we earn $10 per car downloading and many wanted the job, so the most we make is $20 to 30 per night of downloading</p>
              <p>As Peng bak kwa, this one no need to say, few dollars per hours, like macdonald partimers.</p>
              <p>But TD is a different lots, instead of marking it down, they expose their income and even overshot it higher one after another, really bang head.</p>
              <p>Even if you tell people from 6pm  to 12pm, you take $200, the assumption from peoples is, 6 hrs already $200, then 12hrs, sure $400, that is how people look in us. It is a grave mistake to put assumption into naive people.</p>
              <p>And another mistake TD use to make is to come out with a statement, "you can come and try few day driving, then see how" that is not the way to justified the hardship of TD, people will tell you, why not you take over my accountant or fish soup or bus driving or manager job a few days, People do not own us a living, nor do we owe any one.</p>
              <p>Together, we, TD should be united, the main objective is to serve the public and earn as much as we can, and by the rule of thumb, we must not over exaggerate our income, which is pathetically low, not that you do not have to work/drive hard for it.</p>
              <p>So, brother and sister, huat or obk, keep it to yourself, if not, you are just shooting your own foot</p>

              Ok Guys...I m really puzzled that why taxi`s and Td `s are no 1 matter in Sg..Almost every week news about TD.. What all those news try to hint at ? I drive long hrs and got spine problem , life has been miserable... who is earning more td or taxi companies ? I m also thinking that some of the writer has problem with td`s.. 
              
              even if  td s are earning 3 k..do we have cpf? medisave ? Mc? we have no luxury to not to drive unless our health has problem... 
              
              WHy try to portray TD must be low income screwed "self employed" and must whack if they earn beyond their limit(whoever and how they limit has been set in ppl mind don't understand also)
              
              Even if we earn let say 20k a month why does it bother to others? 
              
              we never question to other ppl income..why do they have ours? 
              
              For the God`s sake ..come and drive 5 days min 12 hrs and come and talk here..
              
              Is there any good soul out there can write about real life and real issues about the td and publish once a month in the newspaper?
