              <p>Guess the data is to please big fellas,</p>
              <p>See big fellas are working very hard to see both px get cab they wanted and TD earning increases bravo great job! well done, so long as everybody is happy lor.</p>
              <p>Px complaint cannot get taxi, call the hot line also cannot get through. Operators too busy answering calls. But my cab have no calls on Sat and fews on Sunday Can't remember how many but I know is less than 5.</p>
              <p>I personally tried calling the hot line to convince myself true indeed no one pick up the call and put on hold for more than 15 mins????</p>
              <p>Business so good untill like dats. haha oh yes they have forgotten to report number of calls increases and dat mean $2.30 non peak and $3.30 peak hour the TD can enjoy lah.</p>

              <p>TD was never a lucrative business, everybody knows about it.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>But we enjoy equal status in this tough society. A cabby's daughter was awarded bursary to pursue in Law, ST reported yesterday. Nobody deny us to earn a decent living. Statistic is mean to please 'big fellas'? Be it.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>These days is tough to ply on the road, for me, I had my easy ways out, why must do 20 trips if you can get the same amount return at 10 trips. Unless you telling us that 20 trips generate double of your income which I don't think it works that ways.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>The reports generate by CDG, and I don't think they had any cng taxi in their fleet, so no comment for cng.</p><p></p>

              <p>What do you expect them to report, if they report after taxi fare adjustment, taxi driver are not earning as much as before adjustment, what is going to happen,</p>
              <p>1. Meaning there are a group of LTA/govt scholars at LTA who planned and executed fark up system, shame to them.</p>
              <p>2. And since not making and lost, the govt is going for another adjustment?</p>
              <p>So, of course they will report gain, but who gain from it, you and I should know better.</p>
              <p>Long long before the fare adjustment, govt already told you, this is a fare adjustment to reflect the real cost of operating. Read properly, fare adjustment, not fare hike ok.</p>
              <p>And the cost of operating meaning their cost, not you or me, the poor TD</p>
