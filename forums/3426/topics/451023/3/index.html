              <p>Chief, this type of pax, you should be experience, like penjuru close warehouse logistic company alway get this type of advance call around 7pm, wanted at least 7 to 10 taxis, if you take it, what you should do is you go up only near the end of call time, by that time, left only 2 paxs, and the most 2 places nearby.</p>
              <p>Knocking off time, most staff will want to go home first or get out of the company, so the first few will be 4 places, even 3 places also take in one more because you hv not appear yet, and when you arrived, still within the time, you get the most 2 destinations.

              <p><br>Carry body lah, carry coffin leave it to the funneral peoples, everyone got is own job, like TD, I take my pax and strategy, you take your own pax and strategy, we do not disturb each other, knn, you go carry coffin, then the parlour workers no job liao, If you include knocking nail and praying, then the monks and sai kong can go fly kite liao, knn, monks and sai kong driver jaguar and merc ok.</p>
              <p>My job is just driving, help assistant to carry death body from mortuary, sign and fark off, designation can be parlour, HDB void deck, private house, anywhere in singapore, then collection, usually in body in coffin, peoples will carry into the van, throw flowers or whatever.</p>
              <p>Then for chinese one, got mobile escorts you to main road, relatives follow behind your van, you feel like president, 10 to 20km per hour only..then all the ching tong cheng until main road, after main road, no more escort, drive all the way to cemetry or cremate places like kong meng shan. Then download the coffin, the monks will take over, I ask the parlour leader to sign and fark off liao to the next job. Nabei, sometime 2 to 3 jobs very close, if got jam, knn, siao liao, office keep chasing where I am,...wha, better drive TD</p>

              </p><p>Complaint, overcharging, unreasonable behavious of TU is just part and parcel of Taxi industries.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Who's the regulator? None other than LTA. Some time ago, my friend due to greediness, by securing a 5.2 advance booking from a taxi stand, license was revoked by LTA.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Thinking nobody monitoring the whole system, he simply charge the pax a flat rate of 40 every time he bid the jobs from the taxi stand.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>When company found out, tracing back, the call was despatch by taxi stand, and every stand, for recording purpose, normally will note down every job been despatch.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>The issue get bigger cause money involve not small sum, LTA step in, investigate, found no fault from the taxi stand(they had to protect themselves than protecting the drivers), and my friend was charge for overcharging and result? No need me me to elaborate.</p><p>
