              <p>Don't worry patriots. After all singapore born men die during war, Ah Tiong will take care of your wife. Ah Tagalog will take care of your family. The country will build a memorial for you and glorify how you died. Life will go on without you. Singaopore will continue to have good gdp growth. Our nation even more cannot function without new migrants.</p>
              <p>A prostitute once told me. Her father lost all the family's money gambling and investing. He made his son sleep in the corridor so he can rent out the room, so the family can continue to survive and her father can continue drinking. The new tenant had money and offered money to the father to screw her. He was her first client. But his brother is a faithful brother. He will sleep in the corridor and will fight off any thieves or armed robbers. One day the brother was asss raped by some armed robbers. Till today he still sleep at the corridor and say he is a proud son and brother of the family. He will die with no regrets. Father not very good? no choice. family mah. anus tear can heal one. I really admire him. He's got loyalty. He's got faith.... or maybe I don't admire him.</p>

              <p>I am pleased to say in my previous job serving the country, I have worked on all public holidays, at least once, but only on National Day, I have never worked or refused to work.</p>
              <p>Our Govt don't care about lower classes in the work force or society. Sure they do help or come up with policies to our benefit sometimes, but only because they have to, either they need our votes or they had already done something for the rich, the elite, their kind of people (including foreigners), so they bo pian must come up some policy for us.</p>
              <p>Take yesterday, our dear Labour Minister (not sure his exact ministry), Lim Swee Say. The Govt instead of having minimum wage has come up with a plan to help the lower income earn more thru retraining (their favourite word together with upgrading - worker's skills).</p>
              <p>He says for those earning $800 the goal is bring to $1000, those on $1000 to $1200 and those on $1200 to $1500.</p>
              <p>Sounds very nice right? Veru caring right?</p>
              <p>Wtf? How did salaries end up at $800 or $1000 in this era in the first place. Hello this is 2012 not 1982 or 1992. In 1992 or 1982, $800 can sure cari makan. Now even $1200 to $1500 is a real struggle.</p>
              <p>So how did this happen? I used to work in cleaning sector, had a contract or two and I myself got work a bit also. 10 -15 years ago, $800, nobody want, even 1k, veyr hard to find takers. market rate was $40 a day minimum or $1200, ok maybe some cheapo company offer $35 a day or around $1100 a month but that's it.</p>
              <p>The market was keeping up with inflation rising costs etc. Then what happen, our brilliant Govt open the floodgates, you got cleaning contract, retail outlet, restaurant, no problem, we bring in FT for you, cheaper and better.</p>
              <p>Once these FT come in, forget $1000 or $1200. Pay them $600 to start with and after 2 or 3 years, raise to $800, they steam one.</p>
              <p>Before waiter in 2002-2003, can easily earn $6-7 hour minimum, lucky can get 8 or 9. Now can get $5 an hour consider very good. Why? Who allowed FT to come in for such jobs. Who give companies the choice?</p>
              <p>Now they wanna talk about raising salaries from $800 to 1k, screw them, they are the ones who caused the problem to begin with.</p>

              <p>Let's put national defense and politic separately...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Somehow or rather, we gone through NS, turn into NSmen and so forth, pass on to our next generation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>National Defense is one thing we cannot afford to compromise. We understand the important of it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While every citizens were happily celebrating National Day at whichever venue. Do you guys aware that thousands of soldiers was deployed and on standby?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ever since 911, we know national threat can happen in any parts of the world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While we celebrating, units were on standby force with live ammunition, weapon units were loaded with live missiles guarding our airspace, fighter jets ready to scramble out any time...no bull shit, go check around...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if there's really any real threat, direct command will come from non other than our PM himself(do notice a hearing device on his ear and same to the CDF, not for them to listen to music!).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Really sad when listening to people taking national threat likely...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>National Day, is meant for a nation to be born, just like how you and me had born, isn't it worth celebrating than contemplating into other issues.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My last rank in Army is Staff Sergent and holding a CSM appointment. If I couldn't instill the important of National Defense to fellow soldiers, I had failed on my duty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your son or your nephew might be involved in this coming National Day...do think about that....where some forummers been posting nonsense.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you take national threat likely, you are worst than those FT residing in here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I never been as serious as now, and I won't feel obligated on offending anyone here, because I don't take nation building for granted.</p>

              <p>This country damn tokong. Able to brainwash people better than communist country. Read the stories again. I am happy for those that can talk about patriotism after asss kena fucked until tear. Go rave about old stories again all u want. i am the minority that thinks the country is gone. So FXXK national day!  Those that don't get it will never get it. Especially civil servants. Dunno what they put in your food. All like robots.</p>
              <p>Wah knncb national day call ppl back reservist to entertain 50% Singaporean and 50% rojak? Like I said some are happy with cucumber in the asss some are not. And these 2 can never see eye to eye. You think I no pride I think you stupid. So if want to comment, comment on event and not on people. Hard not to step on each other's toe.</p>

              <p>Patriotism . Such a big word but do anyone understand how does it comes about and why?</p>
              <p>Its all adds up. The stakes that each and every singaporeans have and build in this country.</p>
              <p>And when singaporeans are losing stakes year by year in their birth land. What patriotism are we left to talk about anymore?</p>
              <p>There is no smoke without fire and definitely people dont feel unpatriot towards their own birth country overnight. It all build up over time.</p>
              <p>Look around all hdb flats come 1st august the day where we are all suppose to hang and display our national flag by our corridor parapet til the end of august.</p>
              <p>Why are lesser and lesser people doing it now? See for yourself guys when you are driving your cab around singapore and you can see how many unpatriot singaporeans we are having now and this trend will only continue growing.</p>
