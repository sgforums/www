              <p>The below is rept in the news 2day. Wat would u do if your pax take out a knife n tel u 2 handover all your $ ? <strong>Even if u know martial arts n unarmed combat or had put a iron rod below your seat, in a small enclosed place like inside a taxi, all tat is bullshit !!!</strong> If the taxi driver had met a really desperate n mad robber, I tin he/she would be stabbed n lying in hospital or even dead liao.........<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>jus for $83, worth it meh???   </strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong> Police have arrested a 35-year-old man who's believed to be involved in at least two taxi robbery cases.
              He's believed to have robbed a 62-year-old taxi driver who had picked him up at Clementi St 2 last Friday evening.
              <br> <br> Police said the suspect, who was seated in front, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">brandished a knife</span></span> </strong>and demanded $83 from the taxi driver.
              However, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">taxi driver did not give in to his demands</span></strong></span> and the suspect fled empty-handed.
              <br> <br> The suspect was arrested yesterday near Clementi West Street 2.
              He'll be charged on Wednesday with Armed Robbery.
              If convicted, he faces a jail term of up to 14 years and caned up to 12 strokes. <strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></span></p>

              <p>Precisely. In a confined area such as a vehicle, any martial art also useless one when you have a knife pointing at your neck.</p>
              <p>I would handover the money first.  Keeping my life is more important.  Then, as he fled, I will chase after him with weapon in my hand.  I will make sure to break his hand/s or leg/s once I caught up with him.  Make him feel very sorry for what he has just done...</p>

              <p>Those are usually druggies desparate for a few straws, comfort got a red button to press on for emergency, they also taught us how to use it, premier do not have it, i do not know about other companies' taxi.</p>
              <p>Being druggies, most are very weak, however, as TD, we are at a very disadvantage position, facing front and easily get attacked. Usually these people will seat directly on the back of the TD, so becareful.</p>
              <p>Of course if kenna robbed at knife point, give them the money lah, you got only one life, money can anytime earn back, plenty of it in Singapore, just that you need some work and intelligent to get it.</p>

              <p>I love to fetch trouble makers. Got knife also can. Got gun also can. If they think they are tired of living, they need to try me. I am even more tired of living. Just pass them the money, when they see money and forgot to be on guard, I will pounce on them. And let them know uncle is just as tired of living as they are.  :)</p>

              <p>You must remember, the standard response from the authorities is always "Do not fight back. Just surrender. Life is more important. Let the police do their jobs". This is to make their jobs easier too mah.</p>
              <p>But the fact of life is that if a terrorist threatens the passengers on a plane and nobody dares to fight n risk his/her life, the whole plane may end up in flames, killing even more people. 911 twin towers remember?</p>
              <p>Another fact of life is that in Singapore, if someone hits you and robs you, unless you are some minister or rich man, in all likelihood, you can complain to the police and your MP and LTA or taxi company. They will just tai-chi here and there, ask you to find a lawyer and pay him/her a few thousand dollars to document the case before the police will take action.</p>
              <p>So really, if you meet a robber or murderer and let him take your cash away without a fight, you lost not just once but twice. Lost your money, your pride and end up furious because police tell you they cannot take action without proof and documentation. Of course, the police officer will always tell you. Dont fight back, let us do our jobs.</p>
