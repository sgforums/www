              <p>Interesting to see so many now in here and some of the very interesting statements.</p>
              <p>For people like Poolman, you gotta get used to them and their style. Don't you remember when you were one as well, or if we go down the road some years later with pronouncements like how those 70s and 80s, even 90s, old timers are dinosaurs who are complain this and that...</p>
              <p>You were the 'new generation' like me in the 90s. Now you and I are the old generation, newbies some of them will have no time to listen to our complaints and advise.</p>
              <p>As someone said to each his own, but we gotta face it, our methods will eventually be carried on only by a select few, these new generation don't believe in coconut tree, a dollar per km, f care company etc.</p>
              <p>To them to hold the keys to their own vehicle is a statement in itself. And we must accept it and just move with our own style. Somone mentioned cowboys, it's important that we don't become heroes for nothing or rebels without a cause.</p>

              <p>Hi Joeraj, thanx for creating this thread by a lao jiao from you, as you can also know that you were once a "Cowboy" too.</p>
              <p>I too agreed that nowaday a lot of newbies (like me) will really be hard to adapt the older method being advised to them. But I believe the longer they hold the steering, the more they will appreciate the advice being given.</p>
              <p>Anyway, as long as one provide genuine advice, it will be up to anyone to listen or not. Of cos like the last para mentioned,  </p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">don't become heroes for nothing or rebels without a cause".</span></p>

              with the current situation in singapre
              
              driving taxi still can make a living to feed a family if asking is not much
              
              signing with any taxi company will not make a lot of different base on road sweping
              
              for newbie, my advise is first learn how to sweep,  cause learning how to sweep is
              
              the basic survival in this trade especially duing OBK time.

              <p>I have to admit that I am one of those describe by JoeRaj and Poolman. I took a SMRT Epica brand new right after attending the complusory MTD class, this is where u are pressurized to lease a taxi from SMRT due to the incentives. Furthermore there were a about 8 TC Wish TD there to also take a new Epica. So I kiasu take one also. Before I took the new Epica I had met Poolman once and had listened to his advise briefly. I did not want to take too much of his time during the 1st meeting since I see Poolman has no benefit in helping me whom he did not even know. So I had my doubts. It was only after meeting Poolman and other Kakis that I can see the strong bond and how these Lao jiaos have helped so many. It was after I started drivin the new taxi OMO for about 2 months that I realise what these people in this forum are saying is true. Yes driving OMO u can earn more but u have to drive 14-16 hrs a day without any break. imagine everyday driving the 1st 8 hrs just to cover the rental and diesel!!! Since I have signed the contract wt SMRT, i will serve out the contract and I look forward to the day I become a relief. As a matter of fact, I am thinking of being a Super Relief for CDG, SMRT and Transcab. Life will be so much more fruitful and less tiring. </p>

              <p>Actually, as a newbie, this forum and people here helped me a lot in starting this job as a TD. Without information sharing from the lao jiaos, I think many newbies will surrender key and find other jobs..... </p>
              <p>Chief Pool has helped me and gave me a lot of advise, take what car, where to go, what time go where, can try where, etc..... </p>
              <p>I joined LV not so much of the calls, but for the info given by other LV members, like where png, where got jam, etc....these are critical, as our time is money. My good buddy told me waste money, but maybe because he drive day, so he think that not useful for him, I drive night, so damn useful for me.....also listen to the guys crack jokes helps to relive some of the stress.....</p>
              <p>Also, just the other day, FT pax jumped in my cab and say Cathay Cineleisure... I mindblock a while, dunno is near Plaza Sing or behind Mandarin Orchard.... I picked up talkie, ask for SOS and members feed info almost immediately.... Ah Khoon still private me asking me if I was joking..... temporary mindblock lah, if pax just said Cineleisure, i know go where, add a Cathay, i think of the one near Plaza Sing.....</p>
              <p>Also, reading info here in the forum also kept me informed of whats going on, how to handle pax in certain situations, etc. These are valuable info that you dun need to long pia (bang wall) then say oh, so its like this......  I had one pax tell me he want go to Lor 40 there NTUC transfer money, then ask me can wait for him or not, fetch him back to the coffeeshop where i picked him up from, as I newbie, I sure will say OK, but reading about how pax try to run fares, I told him cannot, I got to rush off, cannot wait. So pay first then get off. Whether or not he will run, I dun care, I finish my job, you pay the fare. This is what this forum taught me.</p>
