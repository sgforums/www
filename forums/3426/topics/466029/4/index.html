              <p>1. CDG recently upgraded many pax to VIP status without the pax knowing it. With VIP status, u nid to wait an extra 5mins b4 NO SHOW can be activated. This cause alot of time wastage if u hit a number of such NO SHOW cases.</p>
              <p>2. Don't be afraid to call up the Call Centre to cancel the Current Booking if u sense sumthing is wrong (eg: u saw pax hop into the front Taxi when u r close to reaching). Nowadays, during the morning peak, alot of CheeBye pax know they can't get cab easily... so many do 30mins ADVANVCE BOOKING 1st, at the same time either use another phone to try CURRENT BOOKING. If heng heng within the 30mins the CheeBye can secure 1 cab, they will cancel ur ADVANCE JOB. So dun be happy thot so good got $8 job when u drop pax in neighbourhood during morning peak. Lan Jiao ok... if they r genuine case, they will book the ADVANCE JOB on the previous nite.</p>
              <p>3. Pax NO SHOW wait at exit gate ? No nid to put BUSY, as usual put HIRE mode... past her wind down window show her the $3 finger sign. If she act blur, tell her $3 booking fee applies... out of 10, 9 cheapo will say no. Close window drive off. PERIOD. U put BUSY drives off she only tulan... u put HIRE drives off make her largi tulan.</p>
              <p>4. Received CURRENT CALL and u pressed &gt;5mins ETA... When heading destination, CALL cancelled. Nowadays, many pax like to cancel those cabby who respond &gt;5mins especially during morning peak. Then they book again trying to secure another 1 who respond in 3mins. Fark u ok... i kena this type b4 n pax kena fark by me in the whole journey becos 2nd booking satelite oso throw to me.</p>
              <p>this are some of the things i encounter... juz sharing wif all bros &amp; sis here...</p>
