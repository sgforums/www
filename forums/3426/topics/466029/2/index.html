              <p><br>Aiya, both of you, this is forum only lah, no need to say happy or not happy, alway remember that coming into forum is to be Happy and ENJOY.</p>
              <p>If come here argue and like most posting ending up here ban, there lock, then it is not worthy of coming in, better join the rest 20 over thousand drivers out there that never want to know this forum at all.</p>
              <p>Anyway, everyone has his own way of doing business, just respect each other and be happy will do good and make this forum an enjoyable one instead of a place where people argue for the sake of nothing.</p>
              <p>I have also experienced pple call and then upon seeing the cab, cancelled, but the key here is cancelled, the current call is cancelled, please do not proceed, this one I have to admit it is a flaws that passenger can take us on, but what can you do, at 8pm ION on call you do not want to take, you go into wisma Q and take, whose fault, not yours or pax fault, it is the system.</p>
              <p>If the system allow pax to cancel, that is it, if the system say wisma is CBD, that is it, TD will take advantage of it.</p>
              <p>You can term pax who cancel call upon seeing the cab as cheapo or whatever, but that is his or her way of exploiting the fark up system set up, just like you go into wisma and let ION paxs rot??</p>

              <p><br>It is not a matter of your problem or not your problem, it is we, the taxi brother of singapore, make ourselve as one united drivers, put that into your head and you will be a better man, if not a better chief.</p>
              <p>I mean I drive for cdg and TC crown taxis during CNY cum few private casket disposal, TC sweep all the way, cdg advance calls here and there, both can make it, but cdg less tiring cos can wait under the payaya trees.</p>
              <p>But i have never undermine any color or group a taxi driver come from, whatever, you still need to peng steering, on meter or collect call fees. You can end up earning 7k, I only 2k, but what the fark, still peng steering mah, end of the day, outside people still look at you as a TD, in your cab, may talk nicely to you, oh, Td very hard hor, you all work very hard, money also hard to earn, but outside, they will think, siao lang peng taxis.</p>

              <p>Think got member prev say, if reach location call cancel will drive off. Cheapo pax will have their just rewards. Don"t take, cos if you do, you help to create their cheapskate mentality.</p>
              <p>Receive many no show in  first 2 months. After that think smarter. Now within a minute of call receive will call pax first to confirm and let them know eta. Up to now no pax ever siam. Of course if call no pick up, will cancel call cos pax most likely aeroplane already.</p>
              <p>These apps all have flaws. 1 month back, SMRT system crash 8-9pm. Receive call for ORQ. Call pax, confirmed p/u. Wait 10 min, call pax, then realise system give office address when he at home. Try call SMRT, even driver line also crash.</p>

              <p>Base on our vehicle pricing, we're the 1st world country with the most expensive vehicles and so low cab fare till its sometimes pax have to plead with td to take them.</p>
              <p>Detractors think first before you say our taxi fare is x, its the surcharges that make it x. Our day drivers are the ones most luigi.</p>
              <p>Compare like for like, vehicle pricing and taxi fare as a percentage together. The only place I find can fair comparision is japan.</p>
