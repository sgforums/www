              <p>There is this place called simei Green, full of Indian Ftrash, alway cancel call and then wait at the guardhouse, as you move out, they will act like happily flaggin you down, one of the pax will be looking at his or her HP, this is a sign of caller cancelled call.</p>
              <p>Recently, no cabs entertain this condo, those who are geninue pax living inside also get sabotage, they hv to come out of the condo roadside and flag for cab, and for that matter, the condo is located near end of simei, by the time most cab already picked up pax along simei streets.</p>
              <p>End up cdg called up some who did not pick up the call nicely, the reason being, no shows 70%, cdg talk to the condo management and tell them the problem.</p>
              <p>Now, 100% call, 100% pax no cancel.</p>
              <p>Therefore, we taxis driver must be united, those who cancelled call can be easily noticed, either still looking at HP or act like blur blur, for some of these bastard paxs, they alway think TD are stupid fool can easily trick them, one of the low class people, knnccb, if all of us ban the same area, that place will get rot and end up complaining to taxi companies</p>

              <p>Chief, you mistaken my idea.</p>
              <p>In order to make Taxi Booking, you must link your Local Bank Account or Credit Card.</p>
              <p>Same as booking tickets for Cinema Shows.</p>
              <p>Deduct $3 from Pax first then search system for nearest cabby.</p>
              <p>For the trouble to take in the e-transfers, maybe CDG (or whoever TC) can charge a $0.20 Admin Fee.</p>
              <p> The idea is to discourage prank calls, not to make more money from them.</p>

              <p>I cannot help but tell you a piece of my mind.</p>
              <p>DON'T EVER DO THIS AGAIN.</p>
              <p>You will only encourage this kind of irresponsible actions from Pax.</p>
              <p>Whenever I got cancellation upon reaching location, I will not pick up passengers for the next 1 km. Sometimes they waiting further down the road.</p>
              <p>If cancel before I reach destination, I will automatically make a U-turn. Don't even want to find out who. Waste my time.</p>

              <p>Just avoid taking calls whereby there are taxis moving in to drop off people along a road or alley, and also where taxis can be easily available, this apply more on city including school, offices and shopping places.</p>
              <p>For houses, HDB, as said before, if there are lot of paxs, why take calls? Just sweep better lor. If not many paxs and call just around, take lor, usually those in isolated places are the best to take, this type, seldom taxi go in, have to turn here and there along after entering the precinct.</p>
              <p>For private property house, most calls 100% pax waiting, because they are inside their house waiting, you come late also they got thing to do in their house.</p>
              <p>For Condo, this is the most fark up one, if stated basement or apartment location, take, if front lobby or guard house, forget it. Morning can take, afternoon also can take, evening try not to take.</p>
              <p>This is my style for taking call, if tolan, no take call, sweep also can lah</p>

              <p>True, calls from advance to current are more for pax to play around, it is like giving them choices, and we hv to slave for it, as consumer, you will also like choices in foods and retail, like some like fish porridge, some want fish soup with rice, some just want fish soup.</p>
              <p>So, take it from a pax perspective, I got a choice, flag, current or advance call.</p>

              <p>during my first week on the road, I was so excited by the calls, i did stupid thing, but I learn fast. </p>
              <p>I was about to turn into IKEA queentown, when a call came, it was for Mapletree business centre, stupidly I click ok, guess I was inexperienced, by then i have already turned into IKEA taxi stand, the passengers waiting at the queue was stunned, when they saw my taxi message switch to "ONã€€ï¼£ï¼¡ï¼¬ï¼¬"ï¼Ž in five minutes time, I reach mapletree, pick up a passenger, should be happy right? NO, the passenger says "BT purmei". !@#$#@%^.</p>

              <p>u haven factor in the fuel lost for the 5 minutes travellling distance to reach the call destination.</p>
              <p>let says it is 5 km away</p>
              <p>1 L diesel = 9km</p>
