              <p><br>The demographic of singapore situation is that we are facing a greying population, many of us in our middle age 35yo to 55yo which were born during the baby booming period are facing difficulties in earning a living here, not that there are no jobs, but by weighing and balancing the pros and cons, from salaries to benefits to type of jobs, peoples tend to move toward contractual job such as taxi driving and other job base on contract like project A, B or C from construction to marine to tunnel drilling.</p>
              <p>Factoring in the social political decision to bring in tonnes of foreigners can also be the decisive factor for locals to give up corporate jobs and take own self employ job like taxi driving for a start. Long gone are  those japanese way of working where loyalty, never said die and productivity, because the ever changing environment cannot substain the samurai discipline anymore. Not that peoples do not want to be loyal, but because I do not know what happen tomorrow, what for be loyal, TDs can throw keys here and there, so are bosses, who can close this, retrench that, sack this and call in foreigners.</p>

              <p>same here lah. I also work 12hrs 6 days rest on sunday. If need
              more money, can super relief on a weekday, but sunday must still
              off. This is still the best way to drive a taxi year in year out
              without hurting your body too much.</p>

But like any other trade where got perfect job with "perfect" pay???. Even professional like doctor,lawyer , accountant they have their fair share of ups and down. I know of a dentist friend practicing at Jurong Point , ton of business , once he steps into the clinic work non stop. Average monthly income 30K. But he is not a happy man. It is his temperament. So whether you are a Taxi uncle/aunty or law professor or cleaning lady.... if you live life unhappily what's the point. so to all TD don't worry be h.a.p.p.y</div>
