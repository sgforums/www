              thanks for that pointer again.
              
              actually i dont know how my story now becomes a dabate about sitting capacity , i was just trying to share my experience more about the meter and hp thing. or maybe i didnt write clearly enough or explain more before. i am just new i really dont plan to break any rule so far and take more and i wont argue if i really know i wrong.
              i say i see 2 men 2 women and 2 small small children. 1 of the 2 men did not come up, he only open door tell me road. the 2 children small small i think is less than 4 or 5 yrs old.

              <p>Aiyoh... Don't get too bothered what some TDs may say about U turn for paxes lah.  If you want to take, just take. If don't want, then don't lor.  Are you going to say that even if that particular day is super OBK for you (like eg. coming to the end of your shift and you still haven't cover your rental + expenses) then suddenly you see people waiting for cab, you won't u turn??</p>
              <p>Having said that, I personally do not u turn for paxes anymore UNLESS the u turn point and the pax is very close to each other.  I have experienced umpteen times whereby I u turn for paxes only for the to board the first available cab before you reach them.  Passengers are always heartless one.  I even kenna before pax who On Call my cab, saw me opposite the street (and even pointed to her boyfriend that their cab is just opposite the street) took another cab when I was doing u turn to take them.  Halfway doing the u turn, call cancellation message came in.  Well, at least they have the heart to cancel the call and not make me wait for 5 minutes before the No Show button can be activated.</p>
              <p>When I was new, every cock thing I also do. U turn for pax lah, volunteer to load luggage lah, pick up pax just 20-50 m outside CBD zone lah (This is CRIMINAL! Some pax actually purposely walk in front of the gantry and wait there, just to save the $3.) etc etc.  You will learn as you go along the way one...</p>
              <p>As for going above capacity, always learn this well and always maintain your stance even if the passengers are On Call passenges.  4 adult + 1 children, can take?  You may think you are doing them a favour by taking them. But, what if you got involved in an accident (** touch wood **)? Do you know that insurance can refuse to pay out for the simple reason that you have exceeded the seating capacity?  Then, worst still... passengers sustained injury and when they can't get compensation from insurance, they turn around to sue you.  And on top of this, you need to fork out $2k for vehicle repair.  And we have not talked about your own injury yet (if any).</p>
              <p>So, you may think that you are doing them a favour.  Once things go wrong, I bet you wish that you had not been born at all.</p>
