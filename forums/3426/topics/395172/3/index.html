              <p>MDT dont show destination, I will not take the calls. If the destination is lousy, I also wont take. If the pick up point is lousy, I also will not take. Hahaha... Simply dun fark care anymore. I pay them $0.5 for bookings, they also must show me some customer service. I dont owe the booking centre a living.</p>

              They could put bogus destination to entice you to take
              
              I ever got a call at unity street taxi stand, 10plus pm , destination is airport
              but when i go there, its 2 destination, toa payoh and amk
              
              and how much resources cdg muz invest just to put destination for you ?
              
              nowadays when we book cab the system is automated just press 1 or 2 for last called pick up pt can already, they need not have a human there to ask you for destination
              
              Base on the DOES that we log in, analysing the call serial no. , there is an estimate 30,000 calls per day
              so if every one needs to ask for  destination how many ppl cdg must employ to ask pax ?

              <p>got a call by a Ms XYZ (Ang Mor Name), got there, out of 8-9 pax waiting around, ONLY SHE is the Ang Mor there..and not only that, from my window screen, I could tell shes immediately arrow-eyed me out of the arriving 2-3 cabs also getting there, she even lift one her hand towards me but like didnt wave..when I stopped next to her with window winded down, guess what she said with some hesitation (abit mumbling)?..</p>

              <p>theres another Ang Mor (mid thirites with an older one) at near Fort Rd. not call, just street pickup round the corner as i happened to drop off an on call. He said "Parkway", so i just tilted towards Mountbatten, immediately he raised his voice "Hey! Where you going!? I said Parkway! Shouldnt you go the other way?!" I said "Ok sure, either way's fine." Then he quickly add "I am heading for the OCBC!" I said "Ok"</p>
              <p>During the trip he kept talking about his new car, and with his older friend,kept criticising the drivers and traffic here, like no hope, so many rules, meaningless, that he wouldnt drive if not that "they" (not sure who) are replacing him with a new car. I kept quiet all the way.</p>
              <p>When we got near, he suddenly sprang into action "There! Stop There by the Bus Stop!" even though the bus stop had 2 buses inside and another one coming from the back. I was paiseh to even read out the fare to him..which is only $5.60. Guess what he next say he wanted to pay by?</p>
