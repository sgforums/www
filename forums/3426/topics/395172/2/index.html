              <p><br>If comfort still maintain this type of attitude, eventually calls will go to private booking group. Just imagine call given to you is very far away or must go 1 big round, once we decided not to bid they ban us for 1 hour after 3 rejections. If during peak hour, the group of cabbies will become smaller and pax cannot even get a taxi to serve them so end up calling private group.

              <p>Dun worry wor. When too many kena suspension or not enough cab in that area, they will release some of them to take call.</p>
              <p>After 3 rejects they suspend you for an hour. They still throw call to you during the suspension hoping you'll take. Only after another 3~4 rejects then they "cheng sim" liao, total suspension until the full 1 hour.</p>
              <p>My personal record for suspension was 3 full hours between 8pm+ to after 12 mignight. Basically whole night gone. No choice but to interview pax.</p>
