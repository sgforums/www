              <p>There is no short cut, we have to physically in action (driving) to reach the extra mile, but there is effective way.</p>
              <p>Yes, there will be a trade off. It is how individually tade it. eg. When i am landed in HDB area after 8pm, i could trade off by driving empty to CBD for a better return then doing feeder service around the estate.</p>
              <p>Fairness are not given equally. If one are gifted the life of shaking leg and make more money, i can only envy him. I have my own gift, it might not be popularly demanded, i have to learn to notice and maximize from it.</p>
              <p>Wake Up, everybody got to wake up, that a new day for a wonderful life. (a life that's full of wonder)</p>

              <p>Wow! psychology at its best.</p>
              <p>Again the answer goes back to you see me good, I see you good. You see him shake leg, you envied him, and envy turn to jealousy, the 7 evil of thoughts, rich also got many rich problems, shake legs also got shake legs problem, shake too much, the legs muscles and bone can cracks.</p>
              <p>TD is a stagnation job, whichever you turn and twist, you still hv to start the engine, as said, 20 years down the road, if you are still driving TD, you are still a Taxi Uncle, not a taxi companies boss, not a taxi executives, not a taxi manager, or taxi MD or officers. For this you have to understand first!</p>
              <p>What peoples said, listen and analyse, not listen and agree to everything, if people want to talk, be a good listener, people tends to like you, but you need to anaylse what people said, take the good and throw the bad away, in this way, you will not go into an arguement for nothing, I see many TD argue over something for the sake of nothing.</p>
              <p>In every trades, there is a price to pay, but there is also a price to take in. Look at the good side of your trade, for eg as taxi driver, look the freedom you have, the luxury of taking break or relax as you like, the HUAT time, the good buddies around you and most importantly, your family and health. There are many peoples envy TD as we envy them, some just do not have licence or unable to take such job. Alway stay focus, think of the good, your family and the freedom you have, the peoples/paxz you meet everyday, there is no price for being happy.</p>

              <p><br>Cabbies must learn to be like actor, same like when you work in army or corporate world, have you ever heard people says, life is a movie and you are the actor of your own life.</p>
              <p>English good or not, is not very much essential to cabby trade, the essence is service, pax do not expect cabby english to be good, korean, thai, jap and so on taxi driver make their living without english and yet still can ferry singaporeans, americans and british all round their country. We might be bless with a english education background, for me, Sec 2 standard, not even O level, then go sailing liao.</p>
              <p>The key to public services like taxi driving is to know who is your customer, treat every customer as boss for 20mins the most, the trick, alway learn to lower your status, your income, your conditon of life with pax, do not take or think highly of yourself against them, some taxi driver I sit on can tell me they are former operational manager this and that, but why become TD? so do not make a fool of yourself, you might be one before, but infront of pax, speak simple english, if they ask how is the business, alway said so so or no good, very hard to make a living, too bad never study well like pax, but still have to drive on for many hours, encourage empathy from them, not boast yourself as someone great and without driving also can go on with life and all those last time bla bla ...black sheep. Once you click in with them, the journey will be enjoyable, even you make a mistake, it is still excusable, and perhap, more tips will be given for your nice trip. What pax hate most are boasting taxi driver, taxi who never acknowledge them, act like a stone, or someone who need to beg inorder to get moving. As TD myself, I ever took cab where the driver do not speak a single word, you tell him, Eunos link, he just move on, yet go a big round, then, I told him turn right, turn left, he did it, but no acknowledgement, then reach already, just point to the meter, no conversation at all, that is time bomb waiting for complain.</p>

              <p><br> Cabbies must learn to be like actor, same like when you work in
              army or corporate world, have you ever heard people says, life is a
              movie and you are the actor of your own life.</p>
              <p>English good or not, is not very much essential to cabby trade,
              the essence is service, pax do not expect cabby english to be good,
              korean, thai, jap and so on taxi driver make their living without
              english and yet still can ferry singaporeans, americans and british
              all round their country. We might be bless with a english education
              background, for me, Sec 2 standard, not even O level, then go
              sailing liao.</p>
              <p>The key to public services like taxi driving is to know who is
              your customer, treat every customer as boss for 20mins the most,
              the trick, alway learn to lower your status, your income, your
              conditon of life with pax, do not take or think highly of yourself
              against them, some taxi driver I sit on can tell me they are former
              operational manager this and that, but why become TD? so do not
              make a fool of yourself, you might be one before, but infront of
              pax, speak simple english, if they ask how is the business, alway
              said so so or no good, very hard to make a living, too bad never
              study well like pax, but still have to drive on for many hours,
              encourage empathy from them, not boast yourself as someone great
              and without driving also can go on with life and all those last
              time bla bla ...black sheep. Once you click in with them, the
              journey will be enjoyable, even you make a mistake, it is still
              excusable, and perhap, more tips will be given for your nice trip.
              What pax hate most are boasting taxi driver, taxi who never
              acknowledge them, act like a stone, or someone who need to beg
              inorder to get moving. As TD myself, I ever took cab where the
              driver do not speak a single word, you tell him, Eunos link, he
              just move on, yet go a big round, then, I told him turn right, turn
              left, he did it, but no acknowledgement, then reach already, just
              point to the meter, no conversation at all, that is time bomb
              waiting for complain.</p>

              <p>Wow! psychology at its best.</p>
              <p>Again the answer goes back to you see me good, I see you good.
              You see him shake leg, you envied him, and envy turn to jealousy,
              the 7 evil of thoughts, rich also got many rich problems,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> shake
              legs also got shake legs problem</strong></span>, shake too much, the legs muscles
              and bone can cracks.</p>
              <p>TD is a stagnation job, whichever you turn and twist, you still
              hv to start the engine, as said, 20 years down the road, if you are
              still driving TD, you are still a Taxi Uncle, not a taxi companies
              boss, not a taxi executives, not a taxi manager, or taxi MD or
              officers. For this you have to understand first!</p>
              <p>What peoples said, listen and analyse, not listen and agree to
              everything, if people want to talk, be a good listener, people
              tends to like you, but you need to anaylse what people said,
              take the good and throw the bad away, in this way, you will not go
              into an arguement for nothing, I see many TD argue over something
              for the sake of nothing.</p>
              <p>In every trades, there is a price to pay, but there is also a
              price to take in. Look at the good side of your trade, for eg as
              taxi driver, look the freedom you have, the luxury of taking break
              or relax as you like, the HUAT time, the good buddies around you
              and most importantly, your family and health. There are many
              peoples envy TD as we envy them, some just do not have licence or
              unable to take such job. Alway stay focus, think of the good, your
              family and the freedom you have, the peoples/paxz you meet
              everyday, there is no price for being happy.</p>
