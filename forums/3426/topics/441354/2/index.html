              <p>Bowah angried told kids: Sorry no drink or food on cab?</p>
              <p>Kids look at parent then replied: Hello, drink also cannot, where got such rules?</p>
              <p>Bowah: Ask your smart Daddy to look at his left side windown stick decal, please refrain from drinking, otherwise, I will have to ask you to get down in the middle of expressway and collect my fares as stated.</p>
              <p>Dad: What kind of manner is this? threatening us? because of your this type of characters, that is why you are still a taxi driver, you better be more polite or you need me to teach you to be polite, you taxi company never teach you?</p>
              <p>Bowah: Sir, again, once your kids stop drinking, I will drive to your destination, if they insist to drink, then I have to stop, if you want me to pick you up, I can use my private car, but this is a taxi with rules and regulation, if you do not teach your childrens to understand rules and regulation but instead to look down on other people trades, then I feel so sorry for you and your family.</p>

              <p>Bowah: Ok</p>
              <p>Wife: See, you kids can see for yourself that this type of job
              is not for your future, so study hard, then people will call you
              sir, not the other way round.</p>
              <p>Kids start to take out milkshake and drink</p>
              <p>Bowah angried told kids: Sorry no drink or food on cab?</p>
              <p>Kids look at parent then replied: Hello, drink also cannot,
              where got such rules?</p>
              <p>Bowah: Ask your smart Daddy to look at his left side
              windown stick decal, please refrain from drinking, otherwise, I
              will have to ask you to get down in the middle of expressway and
              collect my fares as stated.</p>
              <p>Dad: What kind of manner is this? threatening us? because of
              your this type of characters, that is why you are still a taxi
              driver, you better be more polite or you need me to teach you to be
              polite, you taxi company never teach you?</p>
              <p>Bowah: Sir, again, once your kids stop drinking, I will drive to
              your destination, if they insist to drink, then I have to stop, if
              you want me to pick you up, I can use my private car, but this is a
              taxi with rules and regulation, if you do not teach your childrens
              to understand rules and regulation but instead to look down on
              other people trades, then I feel so sorry for you and your
              family.</p>

              <p>The essence of good service is not about pax is alway right, or we have to put on smile no matter what happen, or that pax are the paid master and we have to respect them so on.</p>
              <p>The essence of it is a reciprocating one,</p>
              <p>First, you must be a good pax, then you can expect good services unreserved from taxis driver.</p>
              <p>If you are a good pax, nice and polite, understanding, calm and cool, you will most likely get the uptmost good services from most TD, but if the TD do not reciprocate or render his good service to a nice good pax, and instead get offensive, then no offence, he should not be in a service line, especially those frontline job of facing customers all day long like a cabby.</p>
