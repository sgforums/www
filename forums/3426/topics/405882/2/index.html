              <p>Mind you , Beach Road , Taman Jurong , Boon Lay ,
              Singapore's Top-3 radio taxis centre , average about 300+ members
              .</p>
              <p>Their Bosses make money .</p>
              <p>Lake View bosses lossing money since tookover at May 2009 .</p>
              <p>Why ?</p>
              <p>Cos only 90 members at February 2010 .</p>
              <p>Now maximum 150 .</p>
              <p>Why LV good ? Cos got calls , but less competitive than Beach
              Road .</p>
              <p>Imagine one call 300 members eyeing ?</p>
              <p>LV calls , one call come , less than active 50 eyeing .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lake Views calls all go Pasir Ris , Tampines , AP , or short
              distance from CBD .</p>
              <p>Or Hotel to Hotel .</p>
              <p> Or restaurants to hotels .</p>

              Yishun , Sengkang , Punggol , Sembawang paxes get their cabs .</p>

              <p><br> Uncle Pool, pls don't keep bashing my SMRT hor, respect a bit leh!</p>
              <p>Me with SMRT since day 1, and I've no complain so far with them hor.</p>
              <p>I must say that you are a bit bias when you talk about your red engine. Always how good your red engine company &amp; how good your cng to the environment.</p>
              <p>Cannot like dat lah!! I don't think SMRT TDs collections is any lesser than any other taxi coy TDs.</p>
              <p>So what if CDG got many calls with or without destinations???</p>
              <p>So what  if Transcab got calls with destinations???</p>
              <p>So what if SMRT got less calls with or without destinations???</p>
              <p>End of day, I don't think TDs collections from different coy with same experience got big difference.</p>

              <p>lookin at the last few bits of this thread, my opinion is there will be pple driving for smrt no matter how bad or sucks they are.</p>
              <p>but i can tell u... as an ex SMRT driver from there. like Teolk have just said , There is NOTHING good about them.</p>
              <p>Now so many have nothing good to say about them so there really must be something that mercabs bro sees in them that is good ( wat is it i really dunno la ).</p>
              <p>thats mercabs choice, lets respect him.</p>
              <p>But end of the day , if something unpleasant arises , dont vent your anger here . coz we will only reply this line ' see? we told u so .</p>
              <p>Another to add , lets end all this which taxi co is the best discussion. really doesnt seem to be going anywhere.</p>
              <p>And the best part is our dear THREAD starter Islandwide hasnt even replied or posted anything in response haha</p>
