              <p>Don't worry ... you never take the phone, so just let police do their job.</p>
              <p>Besides his own words, your pax got no evidence that the phone was left in your car in the first place.</p>
              <p>Even if he did, maybe one of your pax who you picked up later took it, so once again not your fault.</p>
