              <p>Ask you guys....when you dispatch pax at T1 and you want to go T2 queue. When coming from Airport Boulevard left U-turn into T2 Arrival Drive if both side got taxi queueing what will you do?</p>
              <p>I will usually go into T2 departure one round come down from the ramp and join the queue behind. It is fair right? Cos people are queueing from the start of T2 Arrival Drive we cannot just cut in right? Although by the time we go one round and queue from the back there will be more taxi in front but we must be fair to those who come empty cab down from nearby town.</p>
              <p>KNN alot of time I see people bo chap, face skin thick thick just cut in in the middle when they do the left U-turn loh. Today happened to send pax to T1 and go T2 queue cos T1 queue too long I cannot find a way to join from the back. So I do my usual routine go up the ramp departure T2 and queue from the back. Time is evening peak. When I approach the opening of the U-turn a cab from TAXI CO. OF THE YEAR do the cut queue stunt in front of me. I honk at him bo chap treat me as transparent. KNN fed up then when approaching the toilet from the main road section I switch to my petrol mode and overtook the farker by surprise and block the path with my red engine diagonal across. Come out and $*^&amp;@# him first ask him to go and queue from behind again but he bo chap. I refuse to give way end up hog up the queue for about 5 mins the Aux Police come and threaten to book me. I tell him CARRY ON and I will JUST LEAVE MY CAB THERE UNTIL HE CALL TOW TRUCK. THE MOST I THROW KEY DUN DRIVE.</p>
              <p>I tell him I got DVR onboard to prove the bastard cutting queue. In the end lan lan he ask the stupid sampan to go queue from behind. Sorry if I held up those who are behind but I really cannot tolerate people cutting queue like that......This stupid idiot really spoil my day....Haizzzz</p>

              <p>To Hammer bro ...</p>
              <p>Sometimes u have to understand those drivers' frustrations  from the taxi co of the year .</p>
              <p>When i first drove a Wish , not many knew our flag down , they advantage , cos people can chose them .</p>
              <p>Now many people knew our flag down , no diff , just take , now they face competitions , they have their own frustrations .</p>
              <p>Last time NETS , they no fight , people chose them , on call them , they less competitions , now they have !</p>
              <p>Last time TransCab only 2000 , now 8000 , plus other taxi coy don't mention , their rental same , more competitions , frustrations arise .</p>
              <p>U have to understand their frustration when they got a call , and throw out to Northern Singapore and empty back to town again .</p>
              <p>U have to understand their frustrations , when inside CBD , so many calls , they can be thrown numerous outside cbd calls and got thrown back to CTE route .</p>
              <p>And when inside CBD , so many people need cabs , they can be thrown one call , that goes to 3 places or more .</p>
              <p>This is Comfort !</p>
              <p>When u drove a Comfort , and got a call that throw you to Punggol , and to no alternatives , u head to AP , and the last thing u want , it's to see someone red cut your Q !</p>

              <p>i also dont like those cbk who cut q and pretend, super thick skin and pretend nothing happen. but usually if i see i just hide in my cab and read my newspaper i dont confront them. cos i think one fine day someone sure will be fking dulan till confront and punch them, or they will be punished in some other way. </p>
              <p>dont confront them la, just lun lor, why risk getting yourself in trouble and your tvl, its our ricebowl afterall.</p>

              <p>Sometimes u have to understand those drivers' frustrations
               from the taxi co of the year .</p>
              <p>When i first drove a Wish , not many knew our flag down , they
              advantage , cos people can chose them .</p>
              <p>Now many people knew our flag down , no diff , just take , now
              they face competitions , they have their own frustrations .</p>
              <p>Last time NETS , they no fight , people chose them , on call
              them , they less competitions , now they have !</p>
              <p>Last time TransCab only 2000 , now 8000 , plus other taxi coy
              don't mention , their rental same , more competitions ,
              frustrations arise .</p>
              <p>U have to understand their frustration when they got a call ,
              and throw out to Northern Singapore and empty back to town again
              .</p>
              <p>U have to understand their frustrations , when inside CBD , so
              many calls , they can be thrown numerous outside cbd calls and got
              thrown back to CTE route .</p>
              <p>And when inside CBD , so many people need cabs , they can be
              thrown one call , that goes to 3 places or more .</p>
