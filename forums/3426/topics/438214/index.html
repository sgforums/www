              WE ATTENDED the Oktoberfest event at the Swiss Club last Wednesday and following their advice, did not drive but took taxis. However, going home was a nightmare.
              
              It took more than half an hour for us to reach the start of the queue. When we finally got there, we were directed to a Chrysler limousine cab that charged an additional $10 booking fee. When we said we wanted an ordinary taxi, we were told to queue again. We finally boarded a Comfort taxi but the driver insisted that the Swiss Club had an arrangement with all taxi drivers to levy a surcharge of $10. 
              
              If we refused to pay, we were told we would have to get out of his taxi immediately. 
              
              I called Comfort and finally got through to a Miss Rose who was extremely helpful. By that time, we had arrived home, but the cabby refused to let us out until we paid the additional $10. 
              
              We refused to pay without the operator's endorsement of this surcharge.
              
              Finally, the cabby relented and gave us change according to the metered fare.
              
              Could the Swiss Club explain why, out of 10 taxis that arrived, nine were Chrysler limousines and on what authority is such a surcharge levied.
              
              Also, what should we do when taxi drivers hold us to ransom? After all, we were travelling in a relatively quiet stretch of a long road.
              
              Further, although the operator explained to the taxi driver that the surcharge was not allowed, he refused initially to let us out. 
              
              Can we get clarification from the respective parties?

              <p><br>True, but i heard some drivers do not even take a mile, not to mention that extra mile.</p>
              <p>Like it or not, we are in services, like any other services sector, we need to do a basic service our client, becos they are the pay master, if they are good pay master, we surely will serve better.</p>
              <p>I did do a small survey on TD in singapore from 50 peoples in my workplace, and most said TD are like robot, some do not even acknowledge what you said, just drive on, kind of strange, on the other hand, majority understand the hardship of driving taxis, and of course nearly all said, Taxi drivers appear only on the peak or surcharge period, when ask if that effect their plans, most agreed, and most hate the meter below the big meter, but taxis driver love it when the below meter move.</p>

              <p><br> True, but i heard some drivers do not even take a mile, not to
              mention that extra mile.</p>
              <p>Like it or not, we are in services, like any other services
              sector, we need to do a basic service our client, becos they
              are the pay master, if they are good pay master, we surely will
              serve better.</p>
              <p>I did do a small survey on TD in singapore from 50 peoples in my
              workplace, and most said TD are like robot, some do not even
              acknowledge what you said, just drive on, kind of strange, on the
              other hand, majority understand the hardship of driving taxis, and
              of course nearly all said, Taxi drivers appear only on the peak or
              surcharge period, when ask if that effect their plans, most agreed,
              and most hate the meter below the big meter, but taxis driver love
              it when the below meter move.</p>

              <p>Our basic service is to <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">DRIVE</span></strong> the pax to his/her destination, period. no more, no less. if want service, take limo.</p>
              <p>ask Bo Call Liao, we Q at our usual place during midnight for more than 30 minutes and when a pax appears, he simply skipped us and take a cab by the road side rather than walk to the taxi stand to board our cab. who pity us?</p>
