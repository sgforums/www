              <p>I think the stomper has not thought about how hard life is for the taxi drivers. </p>
              <p>Usually when I very lazy take bus, plus need to walk long distance from the stop to my destination, I will take a cab. No trouble flagging one down anytime within 10mins. I feel so paiseh that I like waste the uncle time, cos within 5mins I will be able reach liao, then fare is only $3.40 (if uncle fast), or at most $3.80. I will give 4 or if i happen to have more money that day 5 bucks. </p>
              <p>Please spare a thought for all types of professions. Everyone is just out to make a living, don't make life difficult for a already hard life here. </p>

              <p><br>It is always pleasurable to see TCL making his post. As usual, let me fire some rounds on him and this topic. ^^ FIRE!!!!! BOOM!</p>
              <p>I remember hearing pple says some wise saying about "taking in the good thing and throw out the bad ones." We have an interesting stomper who is so free to copy and paste a MRT plan and makes some interesting demands to TD.</p>
              <p>Seriously, we should just ignore the portion where he state his demand. All who have read it will know right away that those words are said in the heat of the moment. It is like a child throwing tamtrum to their parents crying out, "I want that and I WANT IT NOW!!!!!". Why should we entertain a kid's request online?</p>
              <p>Let us examine his rant. He is steaming his head off when the taxi he wanted to see on the road is not there. He is forced to wait more than 15-30min at times. I am sure there are times where he is aware through first hand or 2nd hand account on how TD from mainly Comfort and Citycabs prefer to park one corner waiting for call instead of just make street pick ups.</p>
              <p>He implied TD are greedy and lazy.</p>
              <p>He get all steam up over the fact that he rather wait and waste precious time waiting for a taxi that never turn up (or worst - intercepted by some idiot who walk infront of him lol) than paying $3.50 or $2.50 booking fee. He feels that TD should appear magically for his sake.</p>
              <p>So do we TD need to make a fuss abt his demand? To me such are a matter of whether one is willing to pay for a prompt service vs wasting precious time. It is like a person says why he should pay over $50+++ to eat the famous chicken rice at Mandrain Orchard when he can eat hainanese chicken rice for $2.50 at coffee shop. Answer obvious right? If u dun wan to pay $50 for service and heavenly make chicken rice, then go to coffeeshop. It is a no brainer answer...sigh...if only the stomper think.</p>
              <p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>However, we need to ask ourselves whether his complain is valid. Too many times I see in places like One Raffles Quay, the TDs just simply parked behind the building thinking no one can see and no one will know what the heck they are doing. This happen while long queue of pax are queuing at the taxi stand!!</p>
              <p>These TD dun even know how to jiali makan. Hide also dunno where to hide. Tell the world that they are waiting for calls. No wonder pple complain. And TCL here is my swipe to u again ^^. You belong to one of those TD since you openly tell everyone how u like calls and avoided more than 1/2 of Singapore locales destination.</p>
              <p>So dun start blasting off and say things that is almost the same as what the stomper want.</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>However, can we blame TD? Yes and no. Pple may call us greedy. But I call it business opportunity. Like wad Poolman said before, we are always playing cats and mouse game. U hide, we seek and catch. Sometimes mouse win, sometimes cats win.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Point no 1</span></strong> </p>
              <p>We are like everyone, we go where the money is. There is only a small percentage of pple in the world who is doing volunteering work. Why? I guess one of the main reasons is money not enough in those kind of job. U go for the job that has the most prospect, most monetary returns, with best incentive and leaves benefits etc.</p>
              <p>U dun go to a company and says, "Hey I like ur company that only pays $1000 doing 5.5days works and shit load of work. I will work like dog for u even though there is another company that has the same job scope but pays better."</p>
              <p>So yeah Stomper, dun makes me laugh ^^. U have ur point, but pls stick to the point. Dun be emo ^^.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Point No 2</span></strong></p>
              <p>Comfort and Citycab has a company rule. U dun take calls, u kanna banned for a period of time. U will be called up and asked why u dun take any calls. As time goes by, the driver will be blackmarked.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Point No 3</span></strong></p>
              <p>Street sweeping can be tiring. Who dun wan an easier life if I can drive less and get more? We deserve some rest. When the Stomper said what he said, it is as if that we dun deserve to be treated well.</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Lastly, we know the said Stomper is just making fart when he implied all TD seems to be like that. Comfort and CityCabs consist about 60% market share. There are 40% taxis on the streets whose TD dun really depend on MDT calls for a living. (for eg me...Silvercab got nothing. No MDT, no talkie unless u apply for it)</p>
              <p>So if a person dun get a cab on the streets, it is only because the crowd (ie the customers) has driven us to different part of Singapore at different time. For eg, during week day nite, many pple tend to go home and less pple go to town. So for those who work late, of course not enough taxi lar............</p>
              <p>So I invite all, pls calm down and think think think.....problem arise for a risen (&lt;-----"reason"  hahah wrong spelling sorry ^^ Add on edit ^^). They dun suddenly appear....and it is not so simple so that a person can straight away pin point the fault in one single locale. If everything so simple, I dun drive taxi liao, I go be ur boss. HAHAHAHAHAHAH</p>

              Those who take cab regularly won't complain about this.
              They know when to queue at taxi stand and when to book for a cab.
              They know what is supply and demand.
              They  appreciate our service.
              
              
              
              
              
              This idiot thinks that he takes cab he is a big fark.
              Customer is king mentally.
              If taxi service is not up to ur expectation, please don't avoid taxi.
              
              
              
              
              
              So free ! Go home and teach ur father how to fark instead of telling other what to do !

              <p>I think in the area of tipping, we Singapore TD are thousand times better. Down there, tipping is a must, a culture. U dun tip, u get tick off, u get lousy service. It defeat the purpose of tipping. Tipping has lost it's meaning.</p>
              <p>I am proud for the fact tipping is not a must nor is it demanded. One will not be considered as rude if they did not tip. When a pax tip us in Singapore, it is because not only they feel like it, it also imply we deserve it.</p>

              <p>^^. Dun be angry. I just like to poke fun at u only. I know u wun read cause too long ur eye tire. Brain also sluggish.</p>
              <p>Anyway, in short. I notice whenever u read such a post, u tend to be a little extreme on the vocal side. As such, some pple may misunderstood ur gesture.</p>
              <p>Of course we know that Stomper and the previous guy who said something abt why police never summon taxi drivers in another car forum are pain in the butt. Do we need to care? One day over few hundred thousand of pple taxi. Do we need to react the way we are over the net screwing them dunno how many times over?</p>
              <p>Does it help to educate the public abt our plight? Do we understand them as well? U like this forum where TD and public do a forum bash out screw each other ten thousand times over until some one born a child with no butt? lol</p>

              <p>So are we continuing to discuss about the Stomper guy attitude and what do you guys think we can do to address it in our own small way. We are all small firefly. One slap we die. But when we r together giving out light, it is beautiful.....opps I talk too much. The cow come home liao. Got to go milk it ... chao ^^</p>
