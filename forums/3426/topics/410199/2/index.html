              <p>It takes a very skillful TD to survive on 100% calls. MDT goes ping, and straightaway you know whether can take or not. Not easy at all. This is the mark of a real pro taxi driver. And if you earn more by just taking calls 100% of the time than from street sweeping, than you are a real taxi god. No kidding man.</p>

              <p><br>I fully agree. It is a combination of both instinct, timing and skills.</p>
              <p>However, the discussion is that whether certain group of TD has carried such practised a little too far.</p>
              <p>In some of our previous thread and discussion, remember that some TDs here make boast abt not taking certain kind of call, or refuse to street pick and depend on MDT. Some even mention before in conversation that if the MDT call taken is not the kind he/she wan, he just press the meter and "cancel" call himself/herself. paying the levy is nothing as it is only few cents to them.</p>
              <p>Of course no one has the right to instruct them how to earn a living. However, when pple come here read the thread and see, wow got such kind of taxi driver. No need to pity them. So instead of winning them over, they go join the side that the mentioned Stomper is.</p>
              <p>Opps I say too much again. Dun worry, I one hand typing the other milking ^^ YAHOOOoOOOO</p>

              <p>^^. Dun be angry. I just like to poke fun at u only. I know u
              wun read cause too long ur eye tire. Brain also sluggish.</p>
              <p>Anyway, in short. I notice whenever u read such a post, u tend
              to be a little extreme on the vocal side. As such, some pple may
              misunderstood ur gesture.</p>
              <p>Of course we know that Stomper and the previous guy who said
              something abt why police never summon taxi drivers in another car
              forum are pain in the butt. Do we need to care? One day over few
              hundred thousand of pple taxi. Do we need to react the way we are
              over the net screwing them dunno how many times over?</p>
              <p>Does it help to educate the public abt our plight? Do we
              understand them as well? U like this forum where TD and public do a
              forum bash out screw each other ten thousand times over until some
              one born a child with no butt? lol</p>
              <p>I dunno, ur choice ^^. I dun hate u, like I say I just like to
              take a pot shot at ur writing.</p>

              <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>So are we continuing to discuss about the Stomper guy attitude
              and what do you guys think we can do to address it in our own small
              way. We are all small firefly. One slap we die. But when we r
              together giving out light, it is beautiful.....opps I talk too
              much. The cow come home liao. Got to go milk it ... chao ^^</p>

              <p>Again , i havent read the full length of your reply. You can take pot shots at my english , at my views , at watever but dont question the fact that i rely heavily on bookings , avoid going to this and that and still able to jali makan.The way u have phrased it implies that i am bullshiting which i take offence at.</p>
              <p>And why am i able to survive without having to ply the streets too much? coz i put in the extra effort to head to isolated areas. These places are my supporters , have u ever have a pax board the cab and say ' uncle , thank u for coming for me , i waited very long to book a taxi . have  u? i doubt u have thats why u doubt this and u doubt that</p>
              <p>And these are the people that brightens my day and make me push forward for the rest of the night.</p>
