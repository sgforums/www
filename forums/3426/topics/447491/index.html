              <p>Eg, a 4year old sonata gives 9km per litre of diesel</p>
              <p>a new sonata gives 12km per litre of diesel</p>
              <p>as an OMO you do 400km per day</p>
              <p>If you drive an old sonata</p>
              <p>your diesel cost is (400 / 9 x 1.13) = $50.22</p>
              <p>whereas for a new sonata</p>
              <p>your diesel cost is (400 / 12 x 1.13) = $37.66</p>
              <p>Your savings in fuel cost would have made up for the differences in rental !</p>
              <p>Sometimes i take over old sonatas when pressing the accelerator, its all sound and black smoke , no power !</p>

              <p>Base on SHC plate, i can't really tell you how many years old veh,</p>
              <p>You can ask the hirer , or if he put the documents in the glove compartment you can take a look , the age of the veh is stated there</p>

              <p>Yes, I drive CDG, yet you always see me say 'bad things' abt them. No, I'm not being picky or fussy. CDG good thing no need to say, they already say it for themselves. You can read it in their flyers, magazine, online and in the press, no point I keep parrotting it.</p>
              <p>But why I raise any issue abt them I don't like? No love lost. If the day come, when either I quit or they give me the red card, so be it. Until then, just as they will never let me off easy, I also cannot be soft on them.</p>
              <p>My advice to everyone who drives for them, be you a hirer or relief - never fail to take advantage of your rights.</p>
              <p>If the vehicle is not good or roadworthy, make sure they do it up. So far my policy is to write 3 or 4 pages of email, to complain and highlight any issue of the cab, even though I am only the relief. Yet each and every time, something gets done. Who benefits? Definitely me and my hirer. Why? Because hello, we are not renting the cab for free, or got special member discount. When you rent a car from car rental company, will you tolerate if the vehicle alignment is out? If tyres are bald, or got bearing problem? Even if you did, you will ask for hefty discount. CDG don't give discount, so why keep quiet.</p>
              <p>1 thing they like to do is ensure the cab comes out by 6pm, because after that, they gotta keep it overnight and lose rental. So if the cab comes out, and the problem is the same, I will raise the roof, I even tell them, if they can't do properly and only interested in money and not safety, I will write to Mr Yang, or any NTUC MP and maybe the press, unless they can give me a guarantee they will answer for accident.</p>
              <p>Old vehicle can't be helped, you will consume more fuel, but that process can be slowed if the vehicle is properly maintained at all times. Maybe 1 week to servicing, can tahan a bit, anything more than that pls make sure the vehicle is done properly. Don't feel sorry for the workshop. If anything goes wrong and you get involved in an accident, the blame is yours, and yours alone.</p>
              <p>Other companies maybe cannot, but CDG has made their stand very clear, they are No 2 in the world and are service oriented, so don't be afraid.</p>

              <p>Since most of us here have some basic knowledge of the Net, I've found the best way to get CDG to do something about our taxis that give problem, is to write an email to their dros: email address dros@cdgtaxi.com.sg</p>
              <p>The DROs will forward the email to the respective workshop and cc copies to the senior executive in charge of maintenance and repairs.</p>
              <p>Sometimes because of the seriousness of the complaint, they won't reply but nevertheless immediate action is always taken. Sometimes after a complaint, no one replies but the very next day, the taxi is called back. I've had my previous cab taken out on test drive with their workshop manager and senior executives.</p>
              <p>My advice is to keep a note on how many times the taxi has to be sent for repair for the same old problems, with no proper solution. If you can give a proper timeline of these problems and make a helluva noise for the amount of time and loss of earnings you had to put up, and demand some form of compensation, I notice that the correct remedial action is then taken.</p>
              <p>I sympathise witht the workshops also, they have a lot of FT who aren't skilled with repairs and are learning on the job, plus they have a helluva lot of vehicles to repair and service, naturally mistakes will occur. But the whole point is that we are not asking them to sacrifise or work extra. It's their job to do this and CDG never give us a discount. Instead they cover themselves very well. Read the handbook for eg: Drivers are told not to drive with balding tyres, yet the workshop sometimes tells you, aiyah still can last another 3-5k. If you have an accident because of those tyres, they will point at the handbook and say it's your fault for not asking for a change.</p>
              <p>CDG as I like to show short-comings, but their good thing also is when you force them or take a stand, they will do the repairs you ask, if it's justified.</p>

              <p><br>Black smoke is the diesel wasted, the piston and piston rings are worn against the liners, so instead of getting the power of a full combustion that push the piston down to crank the crankshaft, it only get 3/4 of the power, making the engine less power, the other 1/3 diesel in smoke escape thru the worn btw the ring and liners into the exhaust manifold out into the catalytic converter (just before the rear exhaust pipe, it add as a filter of exhaust air) before going out the back of your car with or without a muffer.</p>
              <p>As too much wasted diesel become smoke, your catalytic converter can be damage, once it is damaged, you smell foul diesel smell just like some car and taxis having it.</p>
              <p>So the more you find it less power, the more diesel you step on leading to more usage, starting in moving off takes up the most fuel, cruising take the least due to crankshaft in momentum, once stop and move again, another 10 cents gone, so if you are start in jam it can actually takes up more of your fuel, and with a worn out engine, you tend to see black smoke of unuse diesel when moving off.</p>
              <p>In long run, the engine get hotter and hotter due to unuse fuel heating up the engine instead of pushing the piston, this will further burnt gasket and seals and also need more cooling water, when seal or gasket burnt, you can also smell it, and that is where some car get smoke all over and hv to pull over.</p>
