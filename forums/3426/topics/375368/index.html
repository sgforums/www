              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Yeah die-die must wait ....</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Pre-requiste for becoming a Taxi Driver:</strong><br>- You must be at least 30 years of age.<br>- Valid class 3/3A driving licence. <br>- A Singapore Citizen.<br>- Able to converse and write basic English.<br>- Have at least 1 year’s driving experience with a clean driving record.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Maybe u can appeal to your MP , to let you take the taxi course first , then until 30th birthday can start driving .</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Actually i support the idea of anybody , any age above 25 to apply fo a TDVL , but must wait until 30-yr-old then can ply the trade on the road . </span></span></p>

              <p>I just wanted to try out the taxi driver life, am a PT night driver, after driving for a yr, I felt that not easy, if u really hv a big family to support, the energy n effort u spended is balance that what u earn, like what ALN mentioned No fine n No Accident is a gd day.</p>
              <p>For me, am drive experience abt 18yrs, but I really not very familiar Sin routes, so am doing the orientation only, not the die hard cabby, but now my cash flow is pretty awesome, why still got cabbies oweing loanshark, if go as normal routine driving, I think soon can buy condo n employ maid, hor..... pool/ ALN. lastly my advise that pls driving carefully n safely on the road, don pick up pax n shoot out to the road, dont alight pax in the taxi Q, that is I hate most, So wishing all Taxi Bros Good LUCK n Happy Driving. Get enough sleep then go on the road, Take gd care of Ur health. Money Will nv enough, but only one. Cheer...............catch up wf U guys.</p>

              <p>young man, my advise to you is still look for a proper job and upgrade yourself. There are many learning curves in life exposure for you.  I think that's part of the reason of our Gahmen strategy to impose a minimum age limit.  Otherwise the whole streets are full of young people who never work before become Taxi drivers.</p>
              <p>I remember many years ago , the criteria was tougher. Age limit must be above 35 and must prove that you are unemployed for a certain period before you can apply. Then they relax the rules to create more taxi drivers as the demand is there for the infrastructures.</p>
              <p>Taxi driving is not a career or a job.  You have to fight your way.  You cannot take leave or sick leave or a proper holiday becos you still have to Pay Rental Every Day.</p>
