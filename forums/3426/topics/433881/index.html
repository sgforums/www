              <p>All the taxi companies have been laughing all the way to the bank cos they r collecting more rentals from the huge amt of taxis they rented out.</p>
              <p>When was the last time the FLAGDOWN meter price was increased? Confirm.........no, I DOUBLE CONFIRMED it's more than 5 years ago even before I was a cab driver.</p>
              <p>Spore taxi fare is dirt cheap (when compare to other cities of similar living standards like Hong Kong) even when we include the peak hrs n midnite charges.</p>
              <p>I appeal to all taxi passengers here to b fair n calm cos i believe u have friends or many relatives n father or uncles who r taxi drivers. pls dun bombard me   :)</p>
              <p>I suggest just a <strong>FLAT 50 cents</strong> increase flagdown for all taxi models n companies. Tis is jus to help all taxi drivers to offset the high fuel price etc etc...........</p>

              Raise taxi meter fare? Wait long long, as long as rental remains as now, incentive and benefit dun cut, I pray tq to god already. LTA now got so many problem of three major public transport here already. COE price is now more expensive then car price, you think new batch of taxi are rental cheaper??? Wait really nobody want to take taxi that peak hour, LTA officer will take camera and say smile to your taxi. Bcos you overshot at taxi stand queue. I prefer life will just go on, every TD will no queue long in stand anywhere.
              Dun forget we have so many Asian foreigners that dun tips.

              <p>By raising fare can be both pros and cons for we as TDs, we can become a pawn for the taxi companies and govt use, increase of fare will ultimately lead to increase in rental of taxis, the consumer, that is the paxs, will be the one who paid for all these, end up, we become sort of like a bridge between these profit minded taxis companies and paxs, what you earned goes back to them. For taxis companies, your rental fees is a cash flow, not a liability, for us as TD, it is a liability, because you cannot predict if you can "huat" on the road or worst, lost.</p>
              <p>I drove premier silver cab as relieve, some pax asked, why oil price goes down, your surcharge still on, I just told them, it is the company policy. And when paxs asked, why other taxi do not impose 0.50cts surcharge, your taxi put in the surcharge?? It is not the paxs who not want to pay or demanding, they also want to know why silver cab is special. And for most other taxis driver from trans or cmfxxk, which i also drive, but not as hirer, the benefits including calls of silver cab is lower than transcab and cmfxxk, so are the fuel prices, give and take, if silver cab bosses do not impose a surcharge for their cabbies, most would had throw keys and go for SMRT or Prime. And as a super relief, I would had not take up silver cab if not for that extra 0.50cents surcharge. Therefore give and take, it come to sq one, you do not see a surge in silver cab hirers, because hirers also calculated the odds and even.</p>
              <p>There are always hidden agendas in every taxi management move, however, as laymen, we tends to see the face value rather than the hidden problem that make taxis companies to implement and execute their executive order.</p>
              <p>If really need to increase, my logic here is, since it is more base on oil prices,  to increase the per km rate, will be justifiable than merely a fare increase. Firstly, fare increase is more or less a visible cost to pax, even a kids will know taxis fares increased, per km rate will be more of a hidden cost, if oil increases, consumption of oil prices will be different, every km, witht the same litres will be higher in prices, and that can better to explain to paxs who can better understand the logic behind the increases, and finally, again, whatever taxis prices increase, rental must not increase, if rental is to increase in tandem to fares increase, LPPL applied.</p>
