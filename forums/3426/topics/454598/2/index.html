              <p>If u r coming in from JB, take a cab there, $30 sing only, anywhere in Singapore, can go two places provided the location are on the way, but mostly they will said $50, then bargain now, and depend on the time, day or nite, it can be settle around 30 to 40 dollars.</p>
              <p>Sing to KL is $300 one way transfer, if 2 ways, $400 only on the next day, because of the return trip, mostly empty, but if client like your driving and comfort, mostly they book you 3 days, that will be about $1000 due to hotel stay, at the same time, you hv to ferry them here and there, 3 days + free hotel, free breakfast + $1000, why not? and after, their companies are paying.</p>
              <p>Singapore being one of the largest economy partner with malaysia, there are many executives crossing the highway rather than waiting for planes, 2 or 3 can travel in comfort and my cousin knows all the road, 20 years experience, he told me, he can also tell you where are the hole and pit to avoid in the north south highway</p>

              <p>All of us knows that if you own your taxi, you can make better money. So does our goberment.</p>
