              <p>Start liao! I witness first time. Couple pax. Sg women with strong Singlish accent groping with FT from India. Pick up from Marina Financial centre. Ya, apart from collecting fare and drive around, I am interested @ the development of Singapore. I am watching with pop corns. Now local women and Pinoy man I still haven't see yet. Soon I guess. Being more prominent in big offices in finance and IT sector, The India FTs got exposure advantage. Guess we will be expecting to ferry more of our own buys to Thai discos liao</p>

              <p>Nevertheless, Local girls are also our sisters, our daughters or even our granddaughters, what we see is not a local gender disagreement here, I alway believe the social and environment conditioned a person to what he or she is now.</p>
              <p>Education, tho makes our local girls economically smarter, able to earn a living and independent, it also have it downside, the lost of feminity, lost of female gracious and a lost wifey responsibility. Therefore in country like rural china and vietnam, you can get women who serve men as their household lord, and that completely differ from our local Singapore women.</p>

              <p>Yo. Many TDs are old folks lar. the generation of women born pre 80's are not half as bad as the women of newer generation. I can understand how some will be upset with the stereo type of SG women being biitches. Some having young daughters, some having a loving wife. But the stereotype is very very true la. I did kick my biitch out of my house for reasons I have known long ago. Women do not contribute to the well being of a family as much as our mother's time.  I feel pain when my best friend calls me and tells me how his wife tortures him. I feel pain when my PAX break down in tears over an SG women. I felt pain kicking my woman out of the house but I have no choice. She is not a good wife and will not be a good mother. </p>
              <p>This is my retribution. I admit to having various encounters with married women(not that i knew they were married). Those periods made me learn a lot about women. How every women has a dark secret that will be brought to their grave. How they are unsatisfied irregarless of how hard the men contribute to the family. So I am punishing myself by condeming my sex endaveous only to hookers for the rest of my remaining life. While at it, sometimes I mock at others buying a lemon. I entertain myself for thinking I know. But I never stop once to envy the rare few that have married gems. Maybe it's the circle of friends I have. Divorce rates on the rise and birthrate on the decline. I have dated various nationalies before. My Australian gf was the best, followed by a few Malaysian girls. The crappiest ones I had were from SG, all they ever did for me was take. </p>
              <p>Now my best friend has a wife in Batam. She's has given him a son. He keeps telling me. All she ever does is give, all his SG wife ever does is take. Those that think SG women damnn good? Ignore me la. This is only my personal opinion obtained from my personal experience. Perhaps I have limited sample size. But still, I am looking forward to hear the first case of SG women bangs Pinoy FT.... I will go buy pop corn again.</p>

              <p>This is the common stereotype of local women now. You can't say there is no truth in it.</p>
              <p>I myself have been trying to find out the causes of this change.</p>
              <p>The generation of our mothers also were not satisfied with their marriage, but their general attitude was to suck thumb. The next generation underwent a change.</p>
              <p>There is something in the Singapore system that causes such trends in local women.</p>
              <p>But for me the reasons are still not yet clear.</p>
