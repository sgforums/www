It is happening daily - in the pharmaceutical industry, banking as well as IT ... it's just a matter of not getting caught," he noted.<br><br>In this era of equal opportunity, and with ever more women working their way to success through knowledge, talent and hard work, instances of women sales professionals offering sex in exchange for a quick, sure-fire way of clinching deals have been thrust into the limelight.<br><br>Last week, former Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) chief Peter Lim was charged with 10 counts of corruption for allegedly obtaining sexual favours from three women - two vendors and one potential vendor.<br><br>In return, he would allegedly show favour to their companies in IT-related tenders called by the SCDF.<br><br>There is a certain irony to all this. <br><br>Executive Director of the Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) Corinna Lim points out that more such incidences may be occurring these days because modern women are getting into career roles that draw the big bucks.<br><br>Yet, this is ultimately "disempowering" for women.<br><br>"Ideologically, the using of sex to get ahead reinforces the idea that their greatest asset lies in the fact that they are desired by men.<br><br>"This perpetuates patriarchy as it makes women's value dependent on how much men desire them... they do not have value in their own right," said Ms Lim.<br><br></span><strong>PREDATORY BEHAVIOUR</strong><span><br><br>Academics and women's rights organisations that TODAY spoke to suggest various factors may be at play in determining the way some women in business behave.<br><br>Ms Lim, as well as sociology professor Teo You Yenn of the Nanyang Technological University, suggest taking a closer look at organisational cultures that influence how employees act.<br><br>In those with "masculine leadership cultures" and very few women at the top, "sexual predatory behaviour may be implicitly encouraged", Ms Lim added. <br><br>"Although the customer may not outright ask for sex in exchange for sealing the contract, there is still some element of sexual harassment, through implicit, subtle suggestions or hints from the customer that the sales representative may not get the deal if they do not offer sex. <br><br>"There is an imbalance of power between the two parties."<br><br>This is happening in industries where clients are mostly male.<br><br>A pharmaceuticals sales representative with 12 years' experience said that in the cases she has heard of, doctors are bold in asking for sexual favours due to the strong competition that sales representatives face.<br><br>Ms Lim called for stronger sexual harassment laws, arguing that where it is the norm for transactions to be conducted in such a manner, the professional may find it difficult to lodge complaints.<br><br></span><strong>IT'S COMPLICATED</strong><span><br><br>But is it too simplistic to cast women in such transactions as naive or manipulated victims?<br><br>There is, after all, the fact that there are women in the same lines who choose not to exchange sexual favours for a contract. Or who decide to leave the industry altogether. Personal greed, and perhaps also the extent of one's ambition, factor into a woman's choice, some point out.<br><br>Their actions earn some detractors' scorn. In a day and age when women advocates and business leaders are calling for more female participation on corporate boards and in top management positions, on the basis of their competence and talent, it surely does no good when a female company director or manager or chief executive makes the news for allegedly sleeping with a client to further the company's business.<br><br>Prof Teo, who is also an AWARE board member, said: "From a sociological viewpoint, all individual actions have to be understood in a broader social context. We should ask why the system is such that sex is rewarded but capabilities directly related to the job alone are not.<br><br>"Men continue to dominate higher positions across almost all organisations and we know with certainty that they are almost never asked for sexual favours in order to get there - why is it that comparably capable women are put in such positions wherein this so-called choice is even a possibility?"</span></span></p>

              I happy for them. Like I said it's just interesting observation.
              Lukily our own boys still got Geylang. I ferried a young boy some
              time back. "Uncle Geylang Lor 18" He sat in front. He looked like
              17 years old. Then I look at him a while and ask "åŽ»å�«é¸¡æ˜¯å�—ï¼Ÿ“ Then he
              got so shy and smiled, "æ²¡æœ‰å•¦ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚æˆ‘åŽ»å¾ˆå¤šæ¬¡å•¦ï¼Œè¿™æ¬¡æ˜¯è�Šå¤©æ‰�ã€‚“ but HIV on the rise

              <p>I thinks TDs have first hand ground sentiment of what's going on in our coutry. Who are the people enjoying in the evenings in theatres and resturants (majority foreigners), and who are the people we pick up late hours from office buildings(our poor overworked sgporeans). Last time we had stories of sarong party girls, girls that seek the white men because they were normally expats holding high positions. Now it's an entirely different scene.</p>
              <p>Our country change too rapidly, mindsets need change too. The new generation is learning fast. Our boys continue to be undermined and our girls are discovering quicker and easier ways to have an easier way in life. Last time our parents will grumble if the girl we bring home is not chaste, now parents worry son become a dog for local women and don't come home. But most worry their son will have no children. The new worry I think will be daughters bringing India FTs home, or Pinoy FTs. Whereas daughters using sex to trade for advantage in work, this one normally remain a dark secret unless busted.</p>
              <p>I like the term FT. It serves as a strong reminder for Singaporeans that local men have to do more but still undermined. The poor standards of Philipines degree will kick the ass of your son's years of hardwork and phsycotic study environment in his own land because the country wants population. Our local girls will need to choose their men. Would they choose the handicapp ones? I have heard many times before the sg girl will say " I am self sufficient and i don;t need a man." But they need to fxxk something means they need to fxxk something.  </p>
              <p>Luckily my time over liao. lucky I experienced the times where the SG women loved us, Taiwanese girls fantasises us and Malaysian girls adore us. Those party early days one will know how we can pick up girls from Fires Disco and Rumours. Those early days go ROC training ones will know. It was heavenly romance in Taiwan. The Tai Baos there will find trouble with us because their women love us. Well times change.But at least I know good times exsisted.</p>
