              <p>nobody wants your life if taxis really crosses the 35k line...</p>
              <p>it all depends on how aggressive the taxis companies wanting to expand their fleets of current vehicles on the road.</p>
              <p>taxis companies operate more like a rental company - the more vehicles they have, the more revenue will be generated - but also have to know the numbers of available full-time cabbies willingly to ply the road.</p>
              <p>HK - 2x the size of Singapore... ( with many visitors from Mainland China daily ) has a cap (LIMIT) of 18,000 taxis licences.  Singapore - now probably with 25k taxis already.</p>
              <p>with more MRT stations on the pipeline - eventually many of the existing cabbies will find it hard to go by with years to come....</p>
              <p>unless COE is at the HIGH END... if not, ppl still prefers their own transportations.</p>
              <p>Look at the private estates - almost all parking spaces are occured with vehicles - if you need to drive past - you really must zig-zag to get thru ... but to the owners - free parking... and they preferred not to park within their landed properties (inside gates)...  One good eg - Mariam Way..</p>
              <p>Hence.. LTA have to decide on the "cap of taxis" required by the READY POPULATED ROADs in Singapore.... probably NEW ERP gantries will pop up here and there....</p>
              <p>a forumer mentioned 90k cabs ???  errr.... this is very very unlikely... i bet my life on it...<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>from the recent ST reports... ( i think 1 month ago )</p>
              <p>the current taxis population is at 24.5k. ( and increasing gradually )</p>
              <p>the Union taxis is current very aggressive on getting their fleet increasing to near 5k.</p>
              <p>hence.. maybe the smaller companies may merged up to save on operational cost.</p>
              <p>i think CDG have around 14,500. ( with thousands as weekends cabs - Thurs to Sunday drivers - mainly toyota crowns ).. many parked at Sin Ming Ave. (near my place at Bishan) <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p><br>More taxis licences  was released on the road was to curb unemployment figures which was shooting higher and higher back in 2002-2003 period...</p>
              <p>there are 6 local banks merged into 3 ( now remaining the DBS, OCBC &amp; UOB still around )... the other banks got bought over ( OUB, Keppel-Tat Lee, POSB )... don't be surprised if there are ex-bankers, stock/forex brokers now plying the road as cabbies !!!</p>
              <p>hence many ppl was retrenched... then came the SARs period - the economy growth dropped below negative.. RECESSION within RECESSION (mid 2003).</p>
              <p>To curb with the expanding unemployment figures.... more taxis licences was released...</p>
              <p>A win-win situation to the govt... No actual paid-jobs was created.... taxi cabbies need to pay for rental of cabs... and at that time - only 3 stat boards linked companies are in the industry, ie - Citycab, Comfort &amp; SMRTs.... cabbies are giving revenues to govt instead.... !!!!!</p>
