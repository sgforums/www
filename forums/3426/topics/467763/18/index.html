              will be happy to provide infos .</p>

              such character he describe .</p>
              <p>And let BJ to decide to drop case or not ?</p>
              <p>At least inform BJ the progress ...... there was nothing after
              the police inform him that they received the police reports .</p>
              <p>Dun let BJ hanging in suspension , hoping for the good .</p>

              <p>No point la arguing with fools or if not a fool, someone whose

              <p>You explain logically also no use, he is a Legend in his own

              counter with something else.</p>
              <p>He will say never mind, next time I bash back, make the case
              bigger by lying, and just to make his argument better, will take 1
              or 2 incidents elsewhere and connect it to his argument and say -
              see, I told you so - that 1 can, means this also can. He might even
              bring the pledge to bolster his case.</p>
              <p>When his friend kena, he scream murder, others kena, he relax
              one, post relax one. His friend knocked down and killed 2 persons,
              that 1 he can ask for advise to see how to mitigate. Other people
              killed 2 in a an accident, he demands 20 months jail.</p>
              <p>This is the Taxi Mentor's theory. Must record all down, put in a
              sticky, maybe sent to press also, so everyone know, what is the

              <p>Among other things, the magistrate will say: If the Police (after consulting the DPP) doesn't want to pursue to the case, then you will have to take civil action yourself.</p>
              <p>When will the Police make such a statement (they will inform the victim/complainant)?</p>
              <p>Only when investigations are complete and the DPP based on the evidence and statements of the victim AND culprit, feels there is insufficient case for them to secure a conviction.</p>
              <p>Here investigations are NOT completed. The identity of the culprit is NOT known, what is there to say must go Legal Aid blah blah. Go Legal Aid for fark? Wanna sue who?</p>
              <p>You know the name and full identity of the culprit? Don't know right? So talk so far down the road about money and cost for fark? Got use that small brains to think?</p>
              <p>2 weeks no reply from the IO means what? Nothing done? How you know? You the Commander/Head Investigations of Clementi Div? This kind of case doesn't mean nothing done, the IO has a Chief Investigator to report to, who monitors cases. This is a press case, a case written by an MP, you think the police cho bo lan? Talk in cofeeshop and small kids they will believe you.</p>
              <p>Although this is not a seizable case doesn't mean nothing done at all. The case is not closed, it won't be for a long long time, maybe 7 years at least. If next year BJ spot the culprit, doesn't mean, case closed, still can call the police to verify the particulars and take the matter to the next step.</p>
              <p>Anyway talk so much for what, why not tomorrow go down to CC View with your kakis. Talk so much about junior this junior that, I advise, he my best friend for fark. Go down la, your best friend what, go do something, help police to nab the culprit, instead of posting rubbish after rubbish online.</p>
              <p>Lucky this is only 1 small forum, not EDMW or Asiaone, you go and post stupid things like asking people to lodge false reports and take law into their own hands, see whether anybody go and lodge police report against you. Here only taxi drivers, who got no time to do such things. Go post elsewhere la, with your solid advises.</p>
              <p>Moderator means what can suka suka lock other people's posts and edit, but his own one can tell people to break the law? RSM Andrew, your silence in all this means you agree with your fellow Mod's advise to forummers to break the law and take into their own hands.</p>
              <p>Wanna post, post responsibly - not just rubbish. As the saying goes better to be silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt.</p>
              <p>All of us here want justice, whether we know BJ or not. We don't like taxi drivers to be assault regardless of race or company. That guy caught and charged in court we all happy. Go and do something, don't come and say tax payer, police job - anybody can open their big mouth and say this.</p>
              <p>If really care about your friend's case, tomorrow go down CC view, Tuesday go down. Put in effort then talk.</p>

              <p>Anyway this whole case boils down to BJ and what he wants to do..</p>
              <p>He never come and post and update on what info he provided the police IO, what the IO said, or what other action he has taken, why must people become a cyber warrior?</p>
              <p>1 moment say got progress, 1 moment say advised to zip up, and then the next start posting and grumbling. Worse still bringing unrelated cases into the picture and then making all sorts of assumptions when he doesn't have the full facts.</p>
              <p>BJ if he doesn't want to do anything more except hope the police can somehow trace the culprit based on the information he's provided, then he's got accept if the outcome remains the same as it is.</p>
              <p>That is not to say the IO has done nothing, the police will rarely reveal what investigations they have done, especially when a case remains open. And 2 weeks even a month, based on paper investigations like tracing video cams, writing to taxi companies etc, is very short.</p>
              <p>Even when police write to banks or hospital for records, the reply will come at the earliest in 2 weeks.</p>
              <p>But perhaps the police investigations can go no further despite all this, therefore it's crucial that BJ himself make the effort to go down to CC View (with friends) and do some snooping around. Go and talk to the IO again, ask the status, ask what else can be done, can he BJ do something to assist. Can the IO write to the OC NPC of the area, to ask the men to keep a lookout.  After all it's only BJ who can identify the culprit (and perhaps the witness who called the police).</p>
              <p>If the suspect's photo can be traced then perhaps that witness also besides BJ can help in the identification.</p>
              <p>Instead of meeting at Lavender every other night for kopi, cannot sacrifise 1 or 2 mornings at CC View or the Adelphi?</p>

              <p>To come straight to the point - if this happened to my 'best friend', I can guarantee you, I will personally organise some kind of ambush duty at the vicinity.</p>
              <p>That is the least I would do. I would sacrifise my time and money and go with my friend and help try and locate the culprit, irrespective of what the police may or may not do.</p>
              <p>No need even to be 'best friend', if BJ was my friend in real life, I would volunteer.</p>
              <p>A friend in need is a friend indeed.</p>
              <p>As the forum MM likes to say, I leave it to others to decide if this is a proper thing to so.</p>

              <p>The point is , it took Jurong Station Division HQ just less than 24 hours to locate the robber , for just robbery of a handphone .</p>
              <p>And it took Clementi Division 22 days , up to date , not even a simple hello to BJ , to update him on the developements .</p>
              <p>That was why i felt there is something not right .....</p>
              <p>I felt a rob handphone , far more important than a 56-yr-old life ?</p>
              <p>Maybe they just need less than 24 hours to find culprit if BJ is found dead .</p>
              <p>BJ dead or seriously injured , to me , it's still a crime to me .</p>
              <p>Thank god BJ is still alive .....</p>
              <p>There was a saying , see blood then it's serious .</p>
              <p>There was blood all over BJ that night .</p>
              <p>Shirt , pants , eye brow , forehead .....</p>
              <p>At the least , they inform BJ , there was an interview with the witness , and the investigation is still on or not , the complications within the case , see if it's worthwhile to drop the case at all ...... that's all he wanted .</p>
              <p>That seriously has got nothing to do with me , but it's my character to speak when things are not right .</p>
              <p>I will still say what i felt , what i thought , i cannot pretend things never happen .</p>
              <p>When we have problems , we report police , police just write reports . Investigate ....... dun no when finish investigation .</p>
              <p>When we take the law in our own hand , they will say why never report police ?</p>
              <p>BJ had reported to Police , it's the Policeman's job to update BJ .</p>

              <p>That was precisely what BJ was trying to know ?</p>
              <p>Since reported to Police , still no update from them , that was why he email to Teo Ho Pin .</p>
              <p>He is still awaiting for progress days after days , to see how the things goes .</p>
              <p>He's a simple man , he talked to me , never login forum all the time .</p>
              <p>Now next step , perhaps some is right , to ask the Police if it's okay to try to locate the culprit at Chwee Chian View , before it jepoardise their investigations , if it's on going .</p>
              <p>I guess BJ has to make a move , don't have to wait for them to update him .</p>
