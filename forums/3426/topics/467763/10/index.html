              <p>1 more point overlooked - it's almost certain the guy took another cab home. Higher chances another CDG taxi. BJ should ask DRO whether can trace data if any taxi picked up a fat Indian man along North Buona Vista or nearby at the time of incident and sent to CC Dr. That driver can be an indirect witness or help to pinpoint better.</p>
              <p>Or if CDG dont hv such record can ask Poolman or CT check with Transcab or Premier, see if they can assist in any way.</p>
              <p>Of course the IO can do this, can ask him for help.</p>
              <p>Now not the time to piss IO off or feel fed up with him if he moves slowly, now must try to win his favour and make him sympathy for you, so he will try his best.</p>
              <p>If only after 2-3 weeks no movement or nothing, then can make some moves to get the police to try harder.</p>

              self defense......</p>

              kill the other party.......</p>

              <p>You cannot use a hammer, steering wheel lock or baseball bat to defend yourself. The law doesn't work that way. The Law cannot solve and prevent every crime from happening it can only be there as a guide and a form of punishment.</p>
              <p>Strictly speaking, fist attack you must use hands. But sometimes see the condition, you pickmup something to block like that can, but all subjective, all depends what the other party say and whose version is believed. Is this unfair? Of course, is life unfair, why some rich goyang kaki no worries while others gotta struggle?</p>
              <p>Somebody hantam you, you hantam back that can be affray - fighting in public, both kena charged.</p>
              <p>You use weapon or something that be construed as a weapon like the steering lock, this becomes VCH with Dangerous Weapon much more serious than BJ case. Got caning one. That person injured can become VCGH - causing grevious hurt (BJ case not VCGH, injuries not permanent or fracture of bones), also got VCGH with dangerous weapon, that 1 more jialat.</p>
              <p>Person die, then charge is murder later reduced to manslaughter, can expect 8-10 years minimum, maybe more, sometimes life. But also depend on the provocation, who started, who right who wrong.</p>
              <p>BJ case is VCH, usually a fine $2000 to $5000 or a very short jail term, maximum say 1 month, a bit more serious injury 3 months.</p>
              <p>However, the courts have said that public transport workers must be protected from assault, anyone found guilty of it, will be jailed - usually starting at 4-6 weeks, sometimes can go a few months.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; list-style: none; color: #404040;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #404040; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The passenger wanted to go to Chwee Chian View, near South Buona Vista Road.</span></p>

He said he wasn't a 15-year-old boy and that he wasn't drunk so he could direct me there."</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; list-style: none; color: #404040;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #404040; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The instructions meant the cab was headed for the Merchant Road entry into the Central Expressway towards the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE).</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; list-style: none; color: #404040;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #404040; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Once the cab entered the AYE, Mr Tan asked the passenger which exit to take. The passenger refused to tell him, saying that Mr Tan should know the way since he was going by the AYE.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; list-style: none; color: #404040;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #404040; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Mr Tan explained that he didn't know how to get to the destination and asked the passenger to direct him.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; list-style: none; color: #404040;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #404040; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The cabby said: "He sounded irritated, so I explained that all he needed to do was to give me the postal code and he could sit back and relax.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; list-style: none; color: #404040;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #404040; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"But since he insisted on leading me personally, I had to trouble him to do so, but I respected his decision."</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; list-style: none; color: #404040;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #404040; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Mr Tan said: "I can deal with passengers scolding me, because it is part and parcel of being a taxi driver... But when the passenger challenged me to get down from my cab when we reached his destination, I got worried."</span></p>

I used my arms to cover my head and block his blows, but he was very strong and continued hitting me. I thought I was going to pass out.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; list-style: none; color: #404040;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #404040; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Three cars stopped and sounded their horns.

              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; list-style: none; color: #404040;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #404040; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Mr Tan called another cabby for help and a TransCab driver he knew came to his aid.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; list-style: none; color: #404040;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #404040; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Said Mr Toh: "When I saw him (Mr Tan), he looked stunned and in a daze. His shirt was stained and there was even grass stuck to the back of it."</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; list-style: none; color: #404040;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #404040; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Mr Tan, who became a cabby in December 2011, said the incident has not put him off driving the night shift.</span></p>

              A few people including the New Paper journalist asked me if I would change my driving strategy to drive in the day and not to pick up any more Indians or drunkards. My answer : This is just a one off incident-life goes on as usual.
                  
              I am back to work – at a rather reduced pace at the moment. Still pick up Indian pax at the moment, encounter 3 Indians in fact.
              
              First assignment was a airport trip from the hotel in Sentosa. Encountered this Indian porter, big bully as usual. He treat TD as slave. Just point to all the luggage and order me to load in myself. The others would all load them themselves with me helping then. It was then I realized the serious of my internal injuries – the pain – back and shoulder was excruciating. He still stand there just watching – I just bear with it and struggle – for the peace and harmony of LV sake.<p></p>

              Last night also pick up another Indian lady- a very petite one. I am just on the fringe of CDB, a few metres more, can collect another $6.30. But I “chin chai” la. Go Jurong East some more. For that few seconds, honestly, it did occur to me that she is an Indian and I did think twice but still ok la. Was travelling along Holland Rd and almost turning to Adam Rd PIE when she ask me to go by Ulu Pandan instead suddenly. Really upset me abit but I know I am just biased from the bad experience. Plus the fact that she is a girl, can easily bully but I tell myself no way I am going to do that. I will not push all my bad experience to her, not fair for her, not gentleman too. How much difference would I be from the bully if I did that?<p></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">Pick up 2 girls to Ophir Rd’s Blue Jazz. When they alighted, a very beautiful lady asked if my cab is available and there again, just one turn outside CBD but I still say ok. She walk in for a while and came back with another man – omg another Indian, he looks drunk and in a blurred condition some more. This time, I really want to turn him down but after a few seconds thought- since just Toa Payoh, bear with it la, hopefully nothing happen. This time, I am more prepared, feel where that alarm is, checked my plastic bags and my walkie.  As I drive I feel more relaxed this time, he just keep quiet and sit there and alight without any incidents – ooossh! Then almost immediately, a Chinese gentleman ask to go MBS – how’s that for a good reward?</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">Actually, I am ok with Indians, no difference for me – any races. My biggest tipper was Indian - $50 for a $17’s trip, not once but 3 times.</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">What’s more worst off? Picking up an Indian or 3 burly Chinese army boys just out from incamp training? U choose</p>

              <p>Many here initial thoughts was that it was foreign indian who whack Michael Tan .</p>
              <p>It was very fiercely debate about FT indians involving here .</p>
              <p>As what i had promised , i am a fair guy , FT Indian was never involve in such incident , be fair to them . Content was taken out and clarified .</p>
              <p>It was a local indian ..... so something i said about this local indian brought shame to the Indian community .</p>
