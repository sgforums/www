              I guess by now, itâ€™s a open secret that that lucky guy was ME.

              Andrew RSM, thanks so much for your help and effort. I am very
              touched that you have set aside our difference in viewpoint and
              standing to do the extra mile for me.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria;">
              Uncle 310, thanks so much too. I only call Poolman after the whole
              thing is over (or at least I thought it was), Your presences there
              that night makes a whole of a difference, akin to sending water to
              someone thirsty in the desert. I owe u one ok. Next time, I promise
              I wonâ€™t find you irritating on Channel LV.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria;">

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria;">
              Lastly Poolman, - no need to say u, We know from the heart. But I
              still want the XX ok?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria;">

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria;">
              I was in a semi blur state which I make the police statement and
              even after giving the police that half â€œfxxxkâ€� info, still kanna
              censored by them â€“ they cut and paste what they think is important
              for the case.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria;">
               </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria;">
              Last night, when newpaper interviewed me, I am able to give me a
              clearer version of what happen that night but even before that, I
              am rather skeptical as they would also cut and paste the points
              that sell and left out the more important ones.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria;">
               </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria;">
              As such, I have written down a full version, point by point of what
              happen, now that I am in a clearer state of mind as follow later
              on:</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria;">
               </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria;">
              During my interview with the magistrate, I was ask that in the
              event that the police doesnâ€™t want to pursue the matter, do I want
              to take legal action on my own or am I prepare to mediate?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria;">
              My answer to her honor is â€œCourt games are only meant for the rich.
              In the end, the one who can afford the best lawyer wins the case.
              With that in mind, I dun even have a choice as I might even end up
              paying more to the lawyer than what I can get in return, So itâ€™s
              not really a choice for me.â€�</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria;">
               </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria;">
              Anyway, any possibility that the police decides not to pursue the
              case? What kind of message would the police be sending in they
              decide not to pursue the case? To the taxi driver and to the
              aggressors.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria;">
               </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria;">
              Anyway, here is my story:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria;">
               </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">On Sunday morning 31<sup>st</sup>
              March 2013 at 1am, I pick up a street fare at North Bridge Road at
              the Coleman Street Junction. He ask me to send him to Chwee Chian
              View. As I am not familiar with that road, I ask him to give me his
              postal code so that I can use my GPS to take me there.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">He remarked that he is no 15yo boy
              and that he is not drunk so he can direct me there. So I ask him
              which road he likes to take now and he ask me to go 2 traffic
              lights and then turn left, when would be Merchant Road, so I take
              it that he wanted to go by CTE-AYE. </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Then I ask from AYE which exit he
              wanted to get out to and he answered that I already said go by AYE
              then you should know the way. I told him that I still donâ€™t know
              the way and since he doesnâ€™t want to give me his postal code, I
              would still be expecting him to give me instruction on where is
              Chwee Chian View. </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">As he sounds abit irritated now, So
              I made the following off the cuff statement:</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">â€œActually sir, all I need is your
              postal code and it can guide me to your place and you can sit back
              and relax but if you choose to guide me personally, I got no
              problem but just feel sorry to trouble you only. Whichever you
              choose, I respect your decision. Aferall, my main objective is to
              make sure I send you home safely.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Then I realized that he took it
              negatively and started to grumble.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Then he start to repeat that he is
              no 15yo boy and gave the following comments:</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><em>Are you worried I get drunk and
              vomit in your car? You only a fucking taxi driver. I pay you the
              money ok, u must listen to me.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
               </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">As a SOKA Buddhist, I realized that
              he is in what we Buddhist term as â€œin the world of ANGERâ€� so I
              figure that itâ€™s no point talking to him so I just keen quiet.
              Afterall I always believed that itâ€™s our karmic relationship with
              each other for me to pick him up and him to take my cab, even
              though that relationship only last a few more minutes so I just
              bear with it.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Instead of cooling down, thinking
              that I am so gullible, he stepped up his tempo. What started as a
              grumble suddenly become abusive scolding:</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><em>You fucking Chi Na, u want to
              fuck around with me is i? If you think u are real smart, go and be
              PM la, knnbccb. You are only a fucking taxi driver. I own the place
              I staying u know, not like u useless fucker, living in HDB flat.
              Bloody Chi Na, really useless! u heard me or not? Fuck your mother
              chee bye. Hey u heard that? I am fucking your mother, u fucking
              bastard.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Again I kept my cool, all the while
              chanting in my heart. I was thinking that he will stop if I dun him
              up or stroke his fire but I was dam wrong. Instead, he increased
              not only his tempo, but also his volume, he is practically shouting
              on top or his voice, even screaming, all those things about my
              mother till his throat really sore. Then he mention something :</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><em>If you got guts, later at my
              place u come out to meet me la.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">That really makes me worry but I
              still maintain my cool. But he still carry on with his â€œfuckingâ€�
              and suddenly he is now using his right hand to punch my left
              shoulder, not once but a few times which is the last straw.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
               </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">The next exit is South Bouna Vista
              down to Pasir Panjang, a road famous for being long and unwinding
              and accident prone. With his consistently getting physical and from
              earlier experience should gain tempo and once in the narrow
              dangerous road, I figured that even if his being physical doesnâ€™t
              escalate, my mental fear might affect my driving and endanger both
              our life. Plus I dunno what's going to happen when I reach his
              place so I stopped the car at the side of the AYE just after
              Normanton exit. </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">I told him that I cannot carry on
              driving as he is now resorting to physical. He insisted that I send
              him back which I refused. I am already outside the cab with the
              door open and he ran over my side saying that he is going to whack
              me and before I can do anything, grab my hair(head) and slam it at
              the cab causing the glasses to drop. Then I felt blows after blows
              ramming at me and I am a 56yo small size uncle who is definitely no
              match for this 190cm, 100kg plus Indian guy in his 40s.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">I tried avoiding his blows and ran
              to the back of the taxi and he just follow suit and pinned my down
              the road and continue blashing me. </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">I tried blocking off his blows till
              I got really tired and cannot even breath and virtually give up.
              This lasted for a good one minute or more and as there was very few
              cars passing by and even those who did dun bother to stop, he just
              had his way till suddenly, I saw three cars stop by and a few
              horns, then he stop and walk off toward the Bouna Vista exit.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">After he walk off, those who stopped
              by drove off too and suddenly I realized that my glasses is gone
              and was looking very hard for it in the dark and without glasses. I
              wanted to drive to follow him but I realized that my key is not
              around anymore.  I spend a good 15 mins or so looking for both
              my glasses and my key in a semi blurred condition until a black car
              pulled over and a gentleman in his 30s asked if I am ok.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">This guy said he saw the whole
              incident and had followed him when he walk off towards South Bouna
              Vista exit and had already reported to police who should be on the
              way soon. He is so nice to make a big detour back to see if I am
              ok. He even help me to find my glasses.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">He left once he knows that I am in
              the good hands of the police.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Later after I reached home, I found
              out that Chwee Chian View is only a small road off Chwee Chian Rd
              which should only have a few landed house, so tracking a 190cm
              Indian man who stay there should not be a big issue but I wonder
              why the police dun act on the info immediately.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">My glasses was chipped on one lens
              and the whole shirt was soiled and bloody. Bruises was found all
              over my body especially my face and my legs which could be worst
              off if not for the jeans and one of my lower front teeth was
              loose.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
               </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">When washing my hair, I realized
              that there is a lot of â€œbalukuâ€� all over my head and this morning,
              the doctor found some area badly bruises too.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">This morning, both sides of the
              shoulders are aching real bad. I then recalled that he uses his
              full body weight of 100+kg to pin me down and the other hand to
              bash me.  My back was aching too and both my arms start
              showing marking as I uses them to block my face.</p>

              Take care bro, SPF is like that long ago. 25 yrs ago, I had the same experience on the road but not driving taxi , patrolled police car passed also never stopped , I was not only hit but stapped  by the two men. One of them is from Traffic police TP83 in his civilian suit later I found out.    The other stayed in bungalow house operating illegal mess. What the police done?   Haha, I never trust the police will have the right attitude. 
              
              Hope you recover well, get back to driving soon.

              <p>I remember once an Ang Mor char bor drove and hit a Korean Woman and her child at outside Anchorage .</p>
              <p>He was acquitted , no wrong .</p>
              <p>Killed someone , but nothing wrong . Got scott free by the court .</p>
              <p>Because she engage Queen's council to fight the case .</p>
              <p>Anyone can remember this case ?</p>
              <p>How if i hit that Korean woman and killed her and both her child ?</p>
              <p>I knnbccb tua ki liao , find si mi lan chiao council also die one .</p>
              <p>Because i am a taxi driver !!!! Or suay suay i can say , i am a Singaporean .</p>
              <p>if i am ang mor , i maybe acquitted bo tai chi .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I followed up the case on papers .... The Judge actually went to the scene , i would say that's an unprecedented move .</p>
              <p>And the Judge agree , at that point , it was too dark , cannot blame ang mor char bor for hitting and killed the koreans , blame the Korea women ...... for walking under low light and got hit by the car .</p>
              <p>Question now :  How if i was the one to kill the two Koreans , and i debate it was low light situation , cannot see clearly , and hit her ?</p>
              <p>Singapore law ?</p>
              <p>I've seen just too much ...... lost too much faith .</p>
