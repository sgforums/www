              <p>That's why when Mr Tan give good advise to zip up, some people don't know how to take advise, only know to talk big big, exagerrate and link unconnected things together.</p>
              <p>Robbery is a very serious offence, can be said after murder and all other offences of a capital nature, robbery is in the next most serious list of crimes.</p>
              <p>Hgpin kena robbed did the police take it lightly? The multiple stabbing at Tampines did the police hesitate? Nope they went into it straightaway, why? Because robbery is a seizable offence of a very serious nature.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan's case is 323, VCH - a non seizable offence. Even if say tomorrow Mr Tan identify the culprit and the police come down, they CANNOT arrest him, they can only verify his particulars (only if he doesn't produce an IC or passport, then they will arrest, that also only until his identity is verified, he will be released thereafter). After verification he will told to await an order to appear at 'D' Div, pursuant to the relevant section under the CPC (Criminal Procedure Code).</p>
              <p>323 or common assault, cannot warrant a major police investigation by going house to house, they have no power to go banging doors and demanding to search residences whether 1, 2 or 52. Maybe when Poolman become Police Commisioner he can order this when his friends are assaulted. Because it doesn't happen for all 323 cases so far.</p>
              <p>Maybe if Mr Tan is the nephew of Pres Tony Tan then the police might do it, but not for BJ, not for me, not for my neighbour or any Tom Dick or Harry.</p>

              <p>Once when I was in the force, some police handcuff 2 Indian suspects, but somehow, 1 manage to free himself from 1 of the handcuff rings and took off running to a block of flats.</p>
              <p>Naturally they gave chase but couldn't catch him as he went up the block. So what next, they block's exits was sealed. Reinforcements called in, and an ASP came down (under many laws, an ASP is a 'walking warrant' meaning he can enter into any premises and search it, just like a CNB officer, he can break and force entry if need be).</p>
              <p>Escaping from handcuffs is a very serious offence - escape from legal custody. That block's records were taken out and after searching every floor, they came to the conclusion that the suspect might be hiding in 1 unit (let's just say 10th floor). That block got very few Indian families, so narrowed to this one.</p>
              <p>Police knocked on the door, the residents came to the gate and was told whether they knew of the suspect and whether he was inside. They denied any knowledge but also refused a request by the police to enter and search.</p>
              <p>The Law is very clear on this, if a policeman (any rank) sees a suspect fleeing a scene and entering any residence or building, office etc, they have the power to go into that unit to search for him, and use force to gain entry also.</p>
              <p>Here no one saw which flat the suspect went into, or whether for sure (100%) he was in that block (maybe he did managed to escape before the sealing). What did the police and that ASP in particular when entry into the 10th floor was denied?</p>
              <p>Nothing. That's right nothing, because no one could say 100% he was seen entering the unit and the home-owner refused entry. Of course the ASP could invoke his power and demand entry but supposed really it was the wrong unit, then how?</p>
              <p>In the end they were unable to arrest him that day, only thru investigations and the assiatance of the mother, did they manage to persuade the guy to give up. He didnt stay at the block, he had a friend there, and although the police strongly believed he was hiding there, he did not admit it and as such no charges of harbouring a fugitive was preferred against the flat owner.</p>
              <p>That kind of serious case, also the police did not go knocking very door of the block or all the other Indian families, for this kind of 'kachang case' where the Law doesn't empower them, you want the police to bang 52 doors?</p>
              <p>Ya ya, very nice words and a wonderful story, something you tell some school children, they will listen attentively.</p>

              <p>Finally don't go far, let me give a better example.</p>
              <p>Last Sunday my friend a TD was drinking with a few other cabbies in a coffee-shop in Hougang. Like many areas, these coffee-shops always will have 1 or 2 Indians who cause trouble (mabok sibok we call them).</p>
              <p>They came to friends table and started their nonsense, 1 thing led to another, my friend keropok both of them, my friend like BJ's attacker, nearly 90+ kg, 1.8m. Police called in.</p>
              <p>My friend in his anger at the 2 monkeys kept on farking them and wanted to whack some more despite the police arrival. The police told my friend to cool down, but he yaya, in the heat of the temper go and f the cops using vulgarities. He was arrested for this (abusing police officers).</p>
              <p>Monday he released on bail, Tuesday he was charged in court for the abusing case, in court the Prosecutor asked for 2 weeks adjournment because maybe the police might also want to charge for assault. Yes assault - 323 (no serious injury to the victims but they gave a statement to the police about being assaulted). So now that case is being investigated. The IO told my friend ok, maybe we might charge you, you see whether can settle with victims and they offer to withdraw, the file will be sent to the AGC for a final decision.</p>
              <p>So you see, even assault cases the police will investigate and charge if they are told to do so. Why they did in my friend's case? Because the assailant was known, if my friend had chowed from the scene maybe he might not be caught unless identified by the victims.</p>
              <p>So dont go saying police inefficient and all the rubbish story. The police will act, provided sufficient information is provided, not fanciful talk big theories or hearsay, clear correct information provided the police will take action if the AGC advises them to do so.</p>

              <p>So many things  and proper effort could have been done and still can be done to help BJ. But no, instead of doing something, some ppl prefer only to talk about it and then blame the police.</p>
              <p>You want justice for your friend, get off they cyber war and go do something proper. Like I said in the beginning it's important to gain the IO's sympathy. The IO of course cannot go down order a major investigation for a case like this, but he can advise and maybe give his blessings to the NPC in charge of the area. Take BJ and go to the NPC where CC View falls under. Down there got plainclothes team also. NPC not like Clementi main station, NPC got time to investigate small 'kachang' cases too. Talk to them, ask them for help, officer do you now anyone of such description, if spotted can call me down to verify if it's him, or if know the house?</p>
              <p>On your part, get off your ass and accompany your firend and try to locate him, instead of blabbering here, cursing the police linking a major case of robbery in CCK to a simple assault in Buona Vista.</p>

              <p><br>Lesson to be learnt,</p>
              <p>Do not pick a drunk man, especially a ah neh, they behave the worst after drinking, but when not drinking, they can be the best pax at time or best pal.</p>
              <p>As for BJ case,</p>
              <p>Of course, we must understand that most TDs here are not solely looking into being asking for justice on behalf of BJ, but rather, for all of us in concern. So, his case was not well attended by the ah pui force of Singapore, it set a precedent for us, the future TD on the road to be very wary of drunkards.</p>
              <p>Singapore is not a highly crimed place, and it is peace that bring lots of business and peoples to this country, with a small population and area and yet with a full police force, people expect SPF to be efficient and effective.</p>
              <p>Yes, you can say police dun do this, dun do that, but they can improve and change, we do not want our Police force to be so stagnated and living like a puppet with no flexibility in improvement and innovation.</p>
              <p>Police should tackle the problem at the bud before the flower blossom, if BJ case is not well attended, then it also set a precedent to that ah neh and many other drinkers in this country that whacking a Cabby in the middle of the night and walk off is perfectly fine.</p>
              <p>If that is so, if I am the chief of NTA, to the extreme of no action or not even a warning in public by SPF, I might call for all taxis to stop plying those night areas or do not pick up ah neh after midnite...reason being, safety first.</p>

              <p>so according to expert here , assaulting is no case , but sgp phui force did ask for medical report , sent in an io to investigate , and call up BJ to ask if indian go via buona vista , for no case ?</p>
              <p>For what then ?</p>
              <p> Must well tell BJ , no case , case close . U may go assault other , nothing wrong Thanks now i know , assaulting people no case one . Spf cannot do anything one , i didnt know that</p>
              <p>Good to know , dun pay fare we just whack . .. .. whack until they go hospital . Nothing wrong one , wrong ???? as long as no weapons found , whack n run , no case one , As long as dun rob , nothing wrong one .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another , got whack , must report got robbed , even if they didnt rob , or else police wont investigate one .</p>
              <p>Cannot say handphone kena robbed , must say money kena robbed Wrong ?</p>
              <p>Loop holes of Singapore's law , and that son of the bitch indian certainly know the law .</p>
              <p>Too bad BJ didn't know that , if i know , i would have told him to say he was also robbed off his money .</p>

              <p>To show that they did not rob u .</p>
              <p>U know well now kena assault in Singapore no penal code one ..... but robbery very serious offense . So must report kena robbed .</p>
              <p>Dun say kena robbed handphone , just say kena robbed off $200 .</p>
              <p>Some fifties , some tens , some twos .......</p>
              <p>Around say $180 like that .</p>

Whether or not criminal assault charges are being pressed against the person who hit or otherwise physically struck out against you, you can still sue the perpetrator in a civil court of law. Depending on how serious the case is, you can do it yourself in small claims court or secure the services of a personal injury attorney to sue the assailant in a higher civil court. </em></p>

Your lawyer can best help you if you provide him as much information as possible. If you have a police report or restraining order against the assailant, you have a much stronger case. Be sure to obtain any proof of lost wages or medical bills.</em></p>

              <p>But if BJ sue him and he "NOT GUILY" , stretch up to 10 years , BJ also will go bust !!! .</p>
              <p>So in short , want to whack , must whack layman who cannot afford legal fee  , cannot whack rich people . Cos layman lan lan one , no money to sue you one .</p>
              <p>Layman aka less loaded people in Singapore is like that one .</p>

              <p>But let me try 1 last time, if not for suffering fools than at least to set the record straight:</p>
              <p>When
               wanna talk or make a point, must be logical, not start blabbering and 
              bringing all sorts of unrelated things and then mix it up and pass it 
              off as the truth or as a fact. Just look from the beginning from this 
              thread to where it stands:</p>
              <p>1. Started talking abt the Korean lady's case to support his logic that the law here is biased against Singaporean.</p>
              <p>2.
               Bring a case of robbery to show the inability or inefficiency of the 
              police in regards to this case, when under the Law they are 2 distinct 
              offences, with distinct investigation powers.</p>
              <p>3. Demanding the police do this and that and start whining like a school girl when it didnt go his way.</p>
              <p>4. Making wild statements and making assumptions based on those silly wild statements.</p>
              <p>5. All talk but no action for a person he calls his best friend.</p>
              <p>I
               never claim to be an expert but what I don't do, is start trying to 
              show how great I am or force my opinion. I don't claim that the forum is
               so big and if the police do good, I will praise them or if bad condemn 
              them. I don't claim to be a guru or mentor and then give stupid advise. 
              What I do claim is to be logical.</p>
              <p>Who said no case? Maybe he 
              can't understand English. Assaulting taxi drivers if convicted in court 
              is definitely a jail term, as opposed to to person A assaulting person 
              B. The courts (the very courts he claims is useless) have made this 
              clear.</p>
              <p>Did the police not investigate? Did they not ask for 
              medical reports, record statement etc? What they cannot do is simply go 
              barging house to house, unless they receive credible information 
              especially from the victim. Why can't they do this?</p>
              <p>Use logic 1st. Did the assault happen at CC View? No. That was only the destination given.</p>
              <p>The
               monkey stated he stays in CC View, is there any other evidence to 
              confirm this, besides his remark? No. So according to our guru, the 
              police can simply go house to house. Supposing the farker was lying, CC 
              View not actually his house, maybe he rent, maybe his friend, his gf, bf
               house how? So easy ah, police just go knocking door to door, based on 
              hearsay. This forum hearsay very powerful, especially from the Minister 
              Mentor, but in real life, it has to be seen logically.</p>
              <p>Moreover is
               this a seizable offence? No. But if the identity can be ascertained the
               police can and will investigate given the publicity and the authority 
              from the magistrate. Until then the scope of their investigations might 
              hinge on the few details provided by the victim.</p>
              <p>Instead of 
              talking cock and trying to prove a point, there was so much that could 
              have done at the beginning. Look at the advise I gave as opposed to the 
              talk cock stories and condemnation of the police, the MM did.</p>
              <p>What I suggested?</p>
              <p>1.Study the area at Buona Vista and Coleman St, see if got camera. If got inform the IO as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>2.
               Stake out CC View for a few days, in the hope of spotting the culprit. 
              Can organise makan, can go Lavender and impress newbies, but cannot go 
              and do something for a 'best friend'? Phui la.</p>
              <p>3. Go and push CDG, seek their help to urge the police to solve the case.</p>
              <p>4.
               Ask CDG, Transcab (can talk so much about his connection within TC and 
              the lady boss) and Premier, to see if anyone picked the culprit up from 
              Buona Vista to CC View. He must have taken another taxi back. This 
              definitely could have been done.</p>
              <p>5. Get BJ to go down and try to 
              convince the IO to sympathise with him, so he will do his utmost for 
              this case. The IO will for sure do somethings, but if you can make a 
              personal connection, I am sure he will at least try even harder despite 
              other cases.</p>
              <p>I was willing to advise further, even if  BJ wanted,
               meet up and explain more on how best to solve this matter, but the Mod 
              was more interested in editing, deleting and trying to defend BJ online 
              than doing something about the case.</p>
              <p>6. Find the NPC CC View is 
              under, go and speak to the officers there, or call the OC, explain 
              nicely the situation and ask whether BJ can come down and give more 
              details, and hopely persuade the OC to direct his men to patrol there 
              more often to locate the culprit or even better get some of his 
              plainclothes team to walk around and make enquiries.</p>
              <p>7. On his 
              own, help BJ by getting fellow kakis to go down to CC View, and ask 
              passers-by about the culprit and see if anybody can pinpoint the 
              residence. If identified, all that was required was to play a waiting 
              game and wait for the farker to leave and get his photo/residence and 
              call the police to get his particulars.</p>
              <p>All these never do, but 
              come and grumble, mumble and claim he's a taxpayer, the police job, not 
              his! Like that the police no need to investigate other cases, everyday 
              in SG dont know how many 323 cases, the police should drop everything 
              else and investigate! No logic.</p>

              <p>Next let's look at his next advise:</p>
              <p>Because 323 is non seizable, next time, you also hammer back until the bugger head pecah go hospital.</p>
              <p>If kena assaulted don't report as assault, report as robbery.</p>
              <p>Are these words from an adult or child?</p>
              <p>Teaching people to take the law in their own hands and then make a false report. Good la, Taxi Mentor teach these, all his followers can follow, all can end up in jail, for causing grievious hurt and making a false report!</p>
              <p>But then he say, no la, bo pian must do like this, Police farked up only investigate robbery. Oh like that ah? Not because the  Law doesn't give the police the powers, but because Poolman says so, means can.</p>
              <p>So every time, something happen, please make false reports. Like that you and the culprit can go to jail together and after come out, can forget about driving.</p>
              <p>If kena assault, report assault, if kena theft report theft, if robbed report robbed, but as he love to say, I leave to others as to which advise they want to follow.</p>
