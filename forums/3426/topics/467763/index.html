              <p><strong style="color: #ff0000; line-height: 1.231;">The New Paper: Cabby attacked because he didn't know directions</strong></p>

              <p style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, '“DejaVu Sans”', sans-serif; margin-bottom: 0.75em; border: 0px; line-height: 18px;">Then the passenger punched Mr Michael Tan’s back while he was driving his Comfort taxi.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, '“DejaVu Sans”', sans-serif; margin-bottom: 0.75em; border: 0px; line-height: 18px;">When the 56-year-old cabby refused to continue driving and stopped on the Ayer Rajah Expressway near Normanton Park around 1am yesterday, the burly passenger rained blows on him before throwing him into a roadside bush.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, '“DejaVu Sans”', sans-serif; margin-bottom: 0.75em; border: 0px; line-height: 18px;">The relentless attack stopped only when passing motorists sounded their horns.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, '“DejaVu Sans”', sans-serif; margin-bottom: 0.75em; border: 0px; line-height: 18px;">In this incident, Mr Tan was not sure of the drop-off point and had irritated the passenger by asking for his postal code so that he could key in the destination on his Global Positioning System, and this triggered the attack.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, '“DejaVu Sans”', sans-serif; margin-bottom: 0.75em; border: 0px; line-height: 18px;">Read the full report in The New Paper on Monday (April 1).</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>If a driver don't know the way. Can ask pax which way the pax intend to go by. Not the driver intention go by where is go by where. Unless pax tell driver any way. But pax say any way. Also can't go by long way. If driver want to long way to earn more money why not take more advance booking. Just like my friend, he driving taxi. He can bid up to 7advance booking. At least is the pax call to call centre. Anything happen to driver the pax can't run away. Drive safely n reach home safely. Ask the pax which way the pax wanted to go by has no wrong. Don't curse people or other driver. You have plant a bad karma in return, bad karma return will be paying much more then you have done before. I heard before got a driver had a advance booking. This driver reach the place without waiting for pax to say CAN on meter, this driver goes on the meter. End up the pax got up the cab. And the pax say why you on meter so early. The driver reply is the waiting time. The pax say again, I will not pay for the taxi fare. End up nobody help him. Cos this did the wrong things. Even he call to control centre, control centre say you doing wrong things. Control centre just tell the driver, sorry sir we can't help you about this matter. Unless like my uncle pick up staff back home. They can early on meter. Karma is what you has planted. Plant good karma get good return. Plant bad karma get bad karma. </p></div>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Let's Listen the true story from the victim.</strong></span></p>
              <p><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/3426/topics/467763?page=3">http://sgforums.com/forums/3426/topics/467763?page=3</a></p>
              <p>
              </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ On Sunday morning 31<sup style="vertical-align: super;">st</sup> March 2013 at 1am, I pick up a street fare at North Bridge Road at the Coleman Street Junction. He ask me to send him to Chwee Chian View. As I am not familiar with that road, I ask him to give me his postal code so that I can use my GPS to take me there.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">He remarked that he is no 15yo boy and that he is not drunk so he can direct me there. So I ask him which road he likes to take now and he ask me to go 2 traffic lights and then turn left, when would be Merchant Road, so I take it that he wanted to go by CTE-AYE. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Then I ask from AYE which exit he wanted to get out to and he answered that I already said go by AYE then you should know the way. I told him that I still don’t know the way and since he doesn’t want to give me his postal code, I would still be expecting him to give me instruction on where is Chwee Chian View. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">As he sounds abit irritated now, So I made the following off the cuff statement:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">“Actually sir, all I need is your postal code and it can guide me to your place and you can sit back and relax but if you choose to guide me personally, I got no problem but just feel sorry to trouble you only. Whichever you choose, I respect your decision. Aferall, my main objective is to make sure I send you home safely.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Then I realized that he took it negatively and started to grumble.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Then he start to repeat that he is no 15yo boy and gave the following comments:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><em style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you worried I get drunk and vomit in your car? You only a fucking taxi driver. I pay you the money ok, u must listen to me.</span></em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">As a SOKA Buddhist, I realized that he is in what we Buddhist term as “in the world of ANGER” so I figure that it’s no point talking to him so I just keen quiet. Afterall I always believed that it’s our karmic relationship with each other for me to pick him up and him to take my cab, even though that relationship only last a few more minutes so I just bear with it.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Instead of cooling down, thinking that I am so gullible, he stepped up his tempo. What started as a grumble suddenly become abusive scolding:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><em style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">You fucking Chi Na, u want to fuck around with me is i? If you think u are real smart, go and be PM la, knnbccb. You are only a fucking taxi driver. I own the place I staying u know, not like u useless fucker, living in HDB flat. Bloody Chi Na, really useless! u heard me or not? Fuck your mother chee bye. Hey u heard that? I am fucking your mother, u fucking bastard.</span></em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Again I kept my cool, all the while chanting in my heart. I was thinking that he will stop if I dun him up or stroke his fire but I was dam wrong. Instead, he increased not only his tempo, but also his volume, he is practically shouting on top or his voice, even screaming, all those things about my mother till his throat really sore. Then he mention something :</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><em style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you got guts, later at my place u come out to meet me la.</span></em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">That really makes me worry but I still maintain my cool. But he still carry on with his “fucking” and suddenly he is now using his right hand to punch my left shoulder, not once but a few times which is the last straw.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The next exit is South Bouna Vista down to Pasir Panjang, a road famous for being long and unwinding and accident prone. With his consistently getting physical and from earlier experience should gain tempo and once in the narrow dangerous road, I figured that even if his being physical doesn’t escalate, my mental fear might affect my driving and endanger both our life. Plus I dunno what's going to happen when I reach his place so I stopped the car at the side of the AYE just after Normanton exit. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I told him that I cannot carry on driving as he is now resorting to physical. He insisted that I send him back which I refused. I am already outside the cab with the door open and he ran over my side saying that he is going to whack me and before I can do anything, grab my hair(head) and slam it at the cab causing the glasses to drop. Then I felt blows after blows ramming at me and I am a 56yo small size uncle who is definitely no match for this 190cm, 100kg plus Indian guy in his 40s.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I tried avoiding his blows and ran to the back of the taxi and he just follow suit and pinned my down the road and continue blashing me. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I tried blocking off his blows till I got really tired and cannot even breath and virtually give up. This lasted for a good one minute or more and as there was very few cars passing by and even those who did dun bother to stop, he just had his way till suddenly, I saw three cars stop by and a few horns, then he stop and walk off toward the Bouna Vista exit.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">After he walk off, those who stopped by drove off too and suddenly I realized that my glasses is gone and was looking very hard for it in the dark and without glasses. I wanted to drive to follow him but I realized that my key is not around anymore.  I spend a good 15 mins or so looking for both my glasses and my key in a semi blurred condition until a black car pulled over and a gentleman in his 30s asked if I am ok.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">This guy said he saw the whole incident and had followed him when he walk off towards South Bouna Vista exit and had already reported to police who should be on the way soon. He is so nice to make a big detour back to see if I am ok. He even help me to find my glasses.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">He left once he knows that I am in the good hands of the police.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Later after I reached home, I found out that Chwee Chian View is only a small road off Chwee Chian Rd which should only have a few landed house, so tracking a 190cm Indian man who stay there should not be a big issue but I wonder why the police dun act on the info immediately.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">My glasses was chipped on one lens and the whole shirt was soiled and bloody. Bruises was found all over my body especially my face and my legs which could be worst off if not for the jeans and one of my lower front teeth was loose.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">When washing my hair, I realized that there is a lot of “baluku” all over my head and this morning, the doctor found some area badly bruises too.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">This morning, both sides of the shoulders are aching real bad. I then recalled that he uses his full body weight of 100+kg to pin me down and the other hand to bash me.  My back was aching too and both my arms start showing marking as I uses them to block my faceã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚</span></p>
