              <p>This we cannot condemn the police the fully, normally the decision for these kind of thing is not made by them, but by the DPP. Maybe the statements conflicting, no independent witness or the witness dont want to come forward to court. The police hv some say in what the IO and his boss recommend to the DPP, but the DPP makes the final call.</p>
              <p>No matter how we feel strongly abt the case and that we are right, the DPP got to base on the facts available. Say for example the farker is identified months later, then got to see whether can really prove it was him or could it be mistaken identity. The farker never admit, it's really 1 parties word against the other and the DPP might think the case is too weak to go to court.</p>
              <p>As for CDG, I dont think so unless really they let their in house counsel take it up. If they help out good, but these kind of things we also got to think in their perspective, DPP dont want to proceed should we and bear the costs? If lose the case how? But I really dont know in this case how they will react, I only guessing here.</p>

              <p>Agree.. DPP acts on sufficient evidence.  That's why the Police has to act fast to avoid any evidence being diluted or destroyed with the passage of time.  That's why all the press publicity is important...</p>

              My view on this :
              
              Members are you aware that street directory is a compulsary item in a taxi
              TD could be fined without it.
              Can ask pax for 3 minutes...flip thru the st directory.
              
              If pax willing to guide, I will insist that pax guide all the way, not half fxxk guide or guide half way then stop. This request has to be confirmed before the start of the journey.
              
              There is a skill to use GPS. Do not rely on it completely. TD still need to know the major express ways and how they are linked. Use GPS for direction when approaching the destination. GPS has served me very well as a TD. 
              
              Always ask pax...is it ok I go via PIE ? never give second choice. ok, let's move on...any conflicts...you can said pax has agreed.

              <p>Last night, I had the good fortune to meet some of the forum members, Profatsir, Mpv30sg and the almightly BCL. Listening to these guys talking passionately about helping and improving the forum and the taxi industry really gives me the confidence that this forum will be in good hands, 10, 20 years from now in the hands of the younger generation. You can actually see sparks in their eyes when they sit down together and brain storm on how to make taxi driving a safer occupation. Well done Guys! Keep up the Good Work!</p>

              Since we are in apologising mode, I need oso to apologize for unwittingly exposing yr nick when i saw yr photo...had no idea it wud cause such a hoo ha. ..unnecessaey at a time like this...
              
              I spoke to you only once or twice and find u a jovial guy...unlike the ultra serious guy who wl "stand by every word" said in the forum.

              <p>Before openly criticising Bingjames , u have to makan with him and judge his character .</p>
              <p>BCL saw him last night ...... and has turned around his view on Bingjames totally , more forgiving after talking with BingJames .</p>
              <p>It is never easy to change BCL's opinion on someone .... only genuine character like BingJames can shown to BCL that .</p>
              <p>He dun deserved to kena whack .</p>
              <p>He did not provokde that Indian bastard moronic barbarian .......... he just panick that's all after som pressure from that Indian man .</p>
              <p>I know Bingjames , he just panick at that point .</p>
              <p>He is lost and perhaps started to lost focus on driving .</p>
              <p>And that was the cause that could have pissed off an impatient SOB .</p>
