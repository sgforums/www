              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ On Sunday morning
              31<sup style="vertical-align: super;">st</sup> March 2013 at
              1am, I pick up a street fare at North Bridge Road at the Coleman
              Street Junction. He ask me to send him to Chwee Chian View. As I am
              not familiar with that road, I ask him to give me his postal code
              so that I can use my GPS to take me there.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">He remarked that he is no 15yo boy
              and that he is not drunk so he can direct me there. So I ask him
              which road he likes to take now and he ask me to go 2 traffic
              lights and then turn left, when would be Merchant Road, so I take
              it that he wanted to go by CTE-AYE. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Then I ask from AYE which exit he
              wanted to get out to and he answered that I already said go by AYE
              then you should know the way. I told him that I still don’t know
              the way and since he doesn’t want to give me his postal code, I
              would still be expecting him to give me instruction on where is
              Chwee Chian View. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">As he sounds abit irritated now, So I
              made the following off the cuff statement:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">“Actually sir, all I need is your
              postal code and it can guide me to your place and you can sit back
              and relax but if you choose to guide me personally, I got no
              problem but just feel sorry to trouble you only. Whichever you
              choose, I respect your decision. Aferall, my main objective is to
              make sure I send you home safely.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Then I realized that he took it
              negatively and started to grumble.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Then he start to repeat that he is no
              15yo boy and gave the following comments:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><em style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit;"> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you worried I get drunk and vomit
              in your car? You only a fucking taxi driver. I pay you the money
              ok, u must listen to me.</span></em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">As a SOKA Buddhist, I realized that
              he is in what we Buddhist term as “in the world of ANGER” so I
              figure that it’s no point talking to him so I just keen quiet.
              Afterall I always believed that it’s our karmic relationship with
              each other for me to pick him up and him to take my cab, even
              though that relationship only last a few more minutes so I just
              bear with it.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Instead of cooling down, thinking
              that I am so gullible, he stepped up his tempo. What started as a
              grumble suddenly become abusive scolding:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><em style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit;"> <span style="color: #0000ff;">You fucking Chi Na, u want to fuck
              around with me is i? If you think u are real smart, go and be PM
              la, knnbccb. You are only a fucking taxi driver. I own the place I
              staying u know, not like u useless fucker, living in HDB flat.
              Bloody Chi Na, really useless! u heard me or not? Fuck your mother
              chee bye. Hey u heard that? I am fucking your mother, u fucking
              bastard.</span></em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Again I kept my cool, all the while
              chanting in my heart. I was thinking that he will stop if I dun him
              up or stroke his fire but I was dam wrong. Instead, he increased
              not only his tempo, but also his volume, he is practically shouting
              on top or his voice, even screaming, all those things about my
              mother till his throat really sore. Then he mention something
              :</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><em style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit;"> <span style="color: #0000ff;">If you got guts, later at my place u
              come out to meet me la.</span></em></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">That really makes me worry but I
              still maintain my cool. But he still carry on with his “fucking”
              and suddenly he is now using his right hand to punch my left
              shoulder, not once but a few times which is the last
              straw.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The next exit is South Bouna Vista
              down to Pasir Panjang, a road famous for being long and unwinding
              and accident prone. With his consistently getting physical and from
              earlier experience should gain tempo and once in the narrow
              dangerous road, I figured that even if his being physical doesn’t
              escalate, my mental fear might affect my driving and endanger both
              our life. Plus I dunno what's going to happen when I reach his
              place so I stopped the car at the side of the AYE just after
              Normanton exit. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I told him that I cannot carry on
              driving as he is now resorting to physical. He insisted that I send
              him back which I refused. I am already outside the cab with the
              door open and he ran over my side saying that he is going to whack
              me and before I can do anything, grab my hair(head) and slam it at
              the cab causing the glasses to drop. Then I felt blows after blows
              ramming at me and I am a 56yo small size uncle who is definitely no
              match for this 190cm, 100kg plus Indian guy in his 40s.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I tried avoiding his blows and ran to
              the back of the taxi and he just follow suit and pinned my down the
              road and continue blashing me. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I tried blocking off his blows till I
              got really tired and cannot even breath and virtually give up. This
              lasted for a good one minute or more and as there was very few cars
              passing by and even those who did dun bother to stop, he just had
              his way till suddenly, I saw three cars stop by and a few horns,
              then he stop and walk off toward the Bouna Vista exit.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">After he walk off, those who stopped
              by drove off too and suddenly I realized that my glasses is gone
              and was looking very hard for it in the dark and without glasses. I
              wanted to drive to follow him but I realized that my key is not
              around anymore.  I spend a good 15 mins or so looking for both
              my glasses and my key in a semi blurred condition until a black car
              pulled over and a gentleman in his 30s asked if I am ok.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">This guy said he saw the whole
              incident and had followed him when he walk off towards South Bouna
              Vista exit and had already reported to police who should be on the
              way soon. He is so nice to make a big detour back to see if I am
              ok. He even help me to find my glasses.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">He left once he knows that I am in

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Later after I reached home, I found
              out that Chwee Chian View is only a small road off Chwee Chian Rd
              which should only have a few landed house, so tracking a 190cm
              Indian man who stay there should not be a big issue but I wonder
              why the police dun act on the info immediately.</span></p>

              and the whole shirt was soiled and bloody. Bruises was found all
              over my body especially my face and my legs which could be worst
              off if not for the jeans and one of my lower front teeth was
              loose.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">When washing my hair, I realized that
              there is a lot of “baluku” all over my head and this morning, the
              doctor found some area badly bruises too.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">This morning, both sides of the
              shoulders are aching real bad. I then recalled that he uses his
              full body weight of 100+kg to pin me down and the other hand to
              bash me.  My back was aching too and both my arms start
              showing marking as I uses them to block my faceã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚</span></p>

              <p>No la public forum must allow for both sides, not just the mods and their kakis can do whatever or post whatever, but everybody else, edit or close thread.</p>

              <p>I am a father, I allow my girls to use mine IBM ThinkPad <br>(Because it's new, surf net much faster then their Desktop)</p>
              <p>I also never hide any thing with my Laptop, so they can see all mine data etc.</p>

              <p>Ya lor, first time back, my first post which is this:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by JoeRaj:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>This thread is a classic example why I have stayed away. It
              seems this forum has changed. Every thing also edit, everything
              also close thread, but if certain ppl do or say some things can
              one.</p>
              <p>This goes to both Poolman and Ang, as moderators. Is this LV
              forum, a Poolman forum or is it an sgforum?</p>
              <p>We are all adults here, like what RBS said forum is to exchange
              idea and opinion not to encourage havoc. But it seems some ppl can
              encourage havoc and post certain things but others can't.</p>
              <p>Pls la we are all adults here, not just young adults but some of
              us are already in our 40s and 50s, maybe even 60s. Adults can and
              should speak their mind, even if it upsets 1 or 2 ppl, so be it,
              provided the person giving is prepared to receive. As long it
              doesn't insult a race, religion or encourage hate and violence, it
              should be fair game.</p>
              <p>As adults we can judge whether what 1 says got lieu or not. A
              forum should be left untouched as much as possible, not just in
              support of some people or groups who can say what they like, but
              when they get answered back, the thread is quickly edited or
              closed.</p>
              <p>Remember when you left this forum because of Fireice's constant
              meddling? It seems that now the very things that you didn't like
              her doing, you and Ang are doing. Just because she doesn't come and
              intervene anymore, desn't mean you have a license to post
              inflammatory things, which she definitely would have intervened for
              in the past.</p>
              <p>If she had her way, this thread would have been closed long time
              ago. In fact if somebody else posted a thread like this, I think
              you or Ang would have closed it, very quickly. Why the double
              standards? Think about it.</p>

              <p>And I am accused of stirring? What stirring? Am I kid talking cock or what? I write got lieu or not?</p>
              <p>And I am not even condemning BJ here, so what stirring? Or is it because I highlighted an issue which I think the Mods have done improperlY?</p>
              <p>My first post back, also cannot give face or show some mutual respect, straightaway accused of stirring? Who did the stirring here? Who asked to carry baseball bat? Who condemned the police, judiciary blah blah?</p>
              <p>This is not a post made because of bad feelings or intentions on my part, but a genuine belief at what I see is wrong. It's not a personal attack either.</p>
              <p>Perhaps it is a condemnation of some people's actions and the way they go about their responsibility in the forum, not against them personally.</p>
              <p>The persons may very well be better human beings than me. I cannot compare to them and their level of assistance, but doesn't mean everything I say is wrong and they always correct.</p>
