              <p>U know well now kena assault in Singapore no penal code one

              <p>Around say $180 like that .</p>
              <p>Cos SPF will never take action once u kena ssault , but they

              <p>But if BJ sue him and he "NOT GUILY" , stretch up to 10 years ,
              BJ also will go bust !!! .</p>
              <p>So in short , want to whack , must whack layman who cannot
              afford legal fee  , cannot whack rich people . Cos layman
              lan lan one , no money to sue you one .</p>
              <p>Layman aka less loaded people in Singapore is like
              that one .</p>
              <p>So in short , Singapore law indirectly protect rich people from
              committing crimes .</p>
              <p>However cock law they have here , less loaded means poor people
              , like u and me .</p>
              <p>So play dishonest games to law also good .</p>
              <p>Remember , never robbed also must say kena rob when kena whack
              .</p>
              <p>Just my opinion , be a clever dishonest man for once .</p>
              <p>Dun say i teach u .</p>

              <p>As they say empty barrels make the most noise.</p>
              <p>What has money got to do with this? Whether the assailant rich or poor, whether BJ rich or poor, what has that got to do with the case?</p>
              <p>When you argue with a fool, this is what happens, they talk got no logic one, will hantam from Point A then jump to d, go to g and then come back into B.</p>
              <p>The issue here has never been money, but the identity of the culprit. All they got is a description.</p>
              <p>The Law here very clear, assault cabby, bus driver any transport work = jail. And don't say money la, dunno don't hantam and pretend to be smart. Ang Mo got go jail for assaulting cabby, Japanese got go jail for assaulting cabby, anyone who did it and was convicted in court has gone to jail, does the Mentor know this?</p>
              <p>No la, his law is what he read from 1 or cases, what he hearsay, what he imagine and assume.</p>
              <p>2 weeks already, nothing but grumble and mumble, curse this, trying to connect other cases into this, but NO ACTION (on the ground), TALK ONLY.</p>
              <p>Even his friend give good advise, tell him to zip up, he cannot one la. He is the big shot of this forum. He say means correct, his posts are read by thousands even LTA, the press who knows maybe the Govt also, that's why must post and complain.</p>
              <p>You think I support the police? Rubbish, I don't like the police also, but they are the ones we still have to turn to. We want justice, we too must play a part and help them and prod them, not just sit on our fat arses.</p>
              <p>But sometimes unfortunately, justice is not served because the culprit got lucky. Remember the Malay man who got smashed on his head with a wine bottle? That case also unsolved, and quite a few others. Some were caught, but some escape. Some criminals get lucky, but we hope eventually they will get caught.</p>
              <p>I have not been a victim of assault but my cousin was. He was a kachang puteh seller at Leisure Drome. 1 day as he was going home after midnight, there was a fight between Indians and Malays. Unfortunately the Indians escaped before the Malays could round up their numbers, they looked for the fellas but couldn't find, then they spotted my cousin, just because he was an Indian, they whacked him jialat and then fled.</p>
              <p>His face swollen etc, but what could we do, we went down to find them the next ffews days, but they never return. Police medical report all done, but nothing came from it. Was it fair to him? Of course not, but that's life, sometimes unfair too and we and him just had to live with it.</p>

              <p>No point la arguing with fools or if not a fool, someone whose ego is way too big.</p>
              <p>Cannot be wrong one, everything he say must be right one.</p>
              <p>You explain logically also no use, he is a Legend in his own mind. You provide facts, give advise also waste time, he will counter with something else.</p>
              <p>He will say never mind, next time I bash back, make the case bigger by lying, and just to make his argument better, will take 1 or 2 incidents elsewhere and connect it to his argument and say - see, I told you so - that 1 can, means this also can. He might even bring the pledge to bolster his case.</p>
              <p>When his friend kena, he scream murder, others kena, he relax one, post relax one. His friend knocked down and killed 2 persons, that 1 he can ask for advise to see how to mitigate. Other people killed 2 in a an accident, he demands 20 months jail.</p>
              <p>This is the Taxi Mentor's theory. Must record all down, put in a sticky, maybe sent to press also, so everyone know, what is the correct way of doing things - he will lead you to glory, for sure!</p>

              <p>Cool it both of YOU!</p>
              <p>Be it egostic or laws abidding, both of you are doing good in addressing BJ case.</p>
              <p>Let us go back to the root,</p>
              <p>BJ get whacked by a drunk indian, make police report, police up till now still no action, pool not happy, so are most of us, consulted our ex police brother JR, he gaves his sound advices.</p>
              <p>Then out of a sudden, thing get personnal,</p>
              <p>Pool, please take JR advices as advices, not that he is the law maker and keep insisting this and that, this is the laws, what you do most is 2016, everyone of us also feel the frustration when our voice are not heard, but we should not let our ego play into an issue. As a leader, it is not about championing for your buddies, as long as you did your uptmost, can do or not, people will notice you, your good heart and leadership, not you go and chiong all the way and get other into the picture</p>
              <p>JR, please do not go too much into personnal and start calling name, Chief is not new, all of us know his high ego and wanting to champion for other, yes, that to him is good, but to most of us, is his weakest point, but as buddies, since knowing him, we should just give our uptmost good advice and that is it, no use getting hot up and turn thing out of the issue, which only kopitiam aunties and uncles do. To be a good friends or buddy, your understanding of each characters, tolerance and trust is important.</p>

              <p>If you say TP farked up, never bother with road management, only out to summons, that 1, I 1st to agree.</p>
              <p>In fact, it's not wrong also to disagree with a court judgment. The AGC wont go after you if you disagree, they will only do so when you make grave allegations that you have no evidence to support. Accuse judges of being biased, without proof, whther pro-foreign or not, and then highlight 1 or 2 case, which he dont know the full facts and quote that as a fact? All of us must diam diam and keep quiet and say yes teacher is it?</p>
              <p>You maybe the expert in taxi matters, good for you, that one some areas we can raise our hands to you, how to find 13 magical pax, how to be CBD warrior etc. That one, each own style, nothing to say for or against, we can disagree but nothing against.</p>
              <p>But just because you expert in 1 field don't start becoming expert in every field. Don't question people integrity etc.</p>
              <p>When you do so, then others also have a right to point out your many flaws.</p>

              <p>If the police have his identity and did nothing, then I will be the first to criticise them, unless in the unlikely event the AGC really told them not to proceed. (but for that they will keep the victim informed of the DPP's instruction).</p>
              <p>No identity, the police have little to go on except a description and a possible location of CC View which cannot be said to be 100% certain.</p>

              <p>thats my sentiments , was there any progress and updates ?</p>
              <p>because there was too many flaws in the system that allows that son of the bitch indian scott free . .. plus not putting any rounds of effort to find culprit . </p>
              <p>why that cck ave 4 robbers can be identify ? there was an effort from jurong police division HQ .</p>

              <p>very typical , "got many things to do , no case one put one side , let others due with it ." </p>
              <p>"i only earn that much , 5pm off work ..</p>
              <p>The police can anytime ask neighbourhoods surrounding whether or not was there any indian of that description  ,  did they do that ? </p>
