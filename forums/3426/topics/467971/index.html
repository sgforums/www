              <p>Dropped a pax around 3am at Hougang Ave 3 bus stop opp Blk 23. In front was a Citycab taxi 9973. Concentrating on pax, wanted to pay by Nets, but dunno why my machine something wrong.</p>
              <p>So was back and forth, then the front TD came out and a Chn pax also, the driver came to me, say the bugger tried to rob him. Because I was still busy with my pax, told him to call police and observe where the guy go, the farker started to run away.</p>
              <p>Anyway I had to go over the opp side for my pax to try at the Atm, but this Td driver also dunno where disappeared, later saw him driving around. He never called the police.</p>
              <p>He was kinda lucky I appeared behind him, if not just him and the robber, I think the robber saw another cab, got cold feet.</p>
              <p>Anyway nothing much to add, but be safe, first sign of danger, ditch your cab, take your phone and chow from the scene. The cab is company vehicle not yours, your life is yours, that 1 must protect.</p>

              look like that guy trying to rob without a weapon
              
              if not the citycab driver will not be able to come and help for help
              
              sad for him, but hope the bastard robber did not get way with any of his money
              
              maybe for CDG driver, please remember you have a distress button, try to use it
              
              unless it is spoil.

              <p>Anyway I not so scared of robbery, more of accident. I also will never carry large sums of money on me while driving, even a few hundreds also wont, will leave at home, just take out the minimum for float. Rob me maybe $100 also dont have because once the rental and diesel is made, that one also I separate, left only the balance, which also I put in 2 places. Rob me, also will only take from 1.</p>
              <p>I think some years back I did feel fear when picking up to Thai guys, but in the end also nothing. Sometimes I pick up these type of guys, thai, sarawak etc, I try reverse psycholocolgy, talking to them nicely, about their country, pity them, tell them I also jialat, hopefully that will put them off any bad ideas.</p>

              <p>Vehicle with child lock can, but have to "enable" it, thus need to open each door enable child lock then close door then lock all doors...</p>

              <p>Wah very nice nowsadays got use bold and underline to highlight things, using the quote button not enough, maybe this forum also like a school, got teacher to teach lesson and highlight and underline things.</p>
              <p>You hero will bash ppl head, but I'm not. Most important the TD was safe, and my presence there stopped the robbery. Anyway the guy already run, the most appropriate thing to do is to observe him, which block he run and call the police.</p>
              <p>Very easy to say what to do or will do, when not there? Anyway why must I give my pax a free trip after driving for 30 mins or so, he go 2 places somemore? Most important no injury and the threat was no longer present. The other party also never call police what more shuld i do. If he stay put at least I can support him. At least I went around after looking for the culprit.</p>
              <p>Anyway why talk about free fare? You got do free service and standby at CC View? Priority is TD is safe and no robbery took place, he only lose a fare. Why should I also lose a fare? My bills who pay?</p>

              <p>Just some observations....</p>
              <p>I first learnt about "TCSS" when I was in SAFTI's common bathroom/toilet in the early 70's.</p>
              <p>Talk cock? All would compare who's longer or thicker. Someone would say "serious, mine's as thick as my wrist when excited!".</p>
              <p>Sing song? Singing praises like "I can do it seven times a night!" or "I can shoot the farthest". Even "I can last several hours non-stop..true!!"</p>
              <p>Cyber interactions are like this toilet except that each is in his own cubicle without revealing his true ID. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Interestingly, many in here had come out of the cubicles, mingle and thus have to behave in a different way.</span></p>
              <p>It's a human condition, this urge for peer acceptance.</p>
              <p>I'm fine with this forum, as long as no grenades or shit/urine bags are hurled out of the toilet.</p>
