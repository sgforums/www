              <p>Some ppl down here think they hereos or school teachers talking to 12 year old kids.</p>
              <p>Talk so much about money for what?  Last Mon Tues Weds got throw rental and forgo time and money and go CC View to stake out and find the fella? No right? But come here post like internet warrior, scold this and that, curse this and that, all talk no action. And this for 1 of his best friends or 1 of the nicest ppl he's ever met, according to his words.</p>
              <p>At least I know if I got trouble, some of my friends will volunteer to go down to the scene the next day if I ask them, or they will do on their own accord. They will not be posting rubbish on the Net.</p>
              <p>How stupid can 1 be, 2 middle age men going to chase after the robber in his 20s? If he got weapon how? No injury and robbery already is the best thing in the circumstances, but no some ppl say they will do more, but never think or think thru their arse.</p>
              <p>You abandon everything and go after? That means a) you let the fare go (ok fair enough) b) will you lock the cab? c) will you wait for the other party to lock the cab?</p>
              <p>Say 1 of you never lock and run after the guy who's already had a headstart, you run until pancet, and then walk back, suddenly your cab not there how? They robber go 1 round take your cab and escape? Or someone else take it and go for joy-ride? Who gonna answer for this? If the victim run never mind and his cab got stolen, but you only witness, your cab stolen, you think CDG, Transcab etc will be very nice and let the case go? You think insurance will cover?</p>
              <p>Say you manage to catch the guy how, you fight with him, bash his head etc, he get injured how, serious injury? You think police will let you go? You think his defense lawyer will let you go? He kena charged 1 thing, you also hero will kena.</p>

              <p>1 time in Sims Drive, a van run over a kid, some guys at the void deck go over the scene and bash the driver. You know what happened, the driver got charged of course but the 3 guys who assaulted him also kena.</p>
              <p>What is the best action (also the police advise when robbed or attempted)</p>
              <p>1) Do not resist Surrender valuables if have to.</p>
              <p>2) Observe his description</p>
              <p>3) Call the police immediately.</p>
              <p>Did this driver do that? Nope maybe he never resist but 2 and 3 he never do. Here got 7000 strong police at your service at a call, but ppl don't activate them, activate Poolman, he's the superman who might or might not come to the scene, but be rest assured he'll post in support of you on the Net!</p>

              <p>You can doubt my integrity but I have no doubts about your stupidity!</p>
              <p>After everything over come here, talk this and that. Not at the scene, dont talk so much. If the guy is fighting with the robber or got injured then I never do anything, like that question my integrity, I got no problem.</p>
              <p>Robber already making good his escape and driver not injured and robbery failed because of ppl around, what's the best thing to do?</p>
              <p>Yes, that's right carry baseball bat, run after him and break his head because you're in your twenties, very strong and fit.</p>
              <p>Solid advise for school children!</p>

              <p>For victims of robbery or assault pls la, you decide which is better.</p>
              <p>If you feel your life in danger, abandon your vehicle is alright, just observe the robber/assailant, his description etc and call the police. Wait for them at the scene or somewhere safe.</p>
              <p>Dont be a hero, you are not in your 20s, unless got passers-by, like that shout for help.</p>
              <p>Dont carry your own weapon and use it, if it's taken by the fella, you'll kena even worse, or if you inflict very serious injury you'll also have to face the music.</p>
              <p>Somebody use a weapon on you, dont go after him, observe his flight and call the police.</p>
              <p>If you want to be a hero or cyber warrior then by all means pls continue to do so here and teach us what you will do. Can become like school lesson again.</p>
