              <p>Hi to all bro TD out there, I had jus quit Citycab(Toyota Crown). It's almost impossible to find jobs with jus my O-Levels qualifications that can pay 3K or even jus 2/2.5K or more. I believed u guys agreed with me that we taxi drivers can easily hit S$100/- net per day, dun matter whether u r a full hirer or relief driver.</p>
              <p>I quit Citycab b cos I had owed them 1K+ rental. I have the following questions which I hop big bro like Poolman can assist me:</p>
              <p>1) Do taxi companies share info among themselves n blacklist TD who owed rental n then switch 2 other companies?</p>
              <p>2) I do not have 1K to pay deposit, which companies can I join? With contract or no contract?</p>
              <p>3) Any lobangs in the private sector tat can offer jobs which pay 2K+ with only O-Levels qualifications?</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>If you want to die hard, go ahead and try. Please have NOTHING to do with SMRT. I say NOTHING! SMRT is a company that greet you "partner" when they want you to join and treat you like shit when you quit. I am running into unrefundable deposit issues with them. They are withholding my security deposit for 6 years after I quit.</p>

              <p><br>If you like fixed salary, then go and be a SMRT or SBS bus driver. Everyday same route, no need to worry about not hitting your daily target. Pay is almost the same I think. But do not ever become a fixed salary taxi driver. It is the worse and most rotten job.</p>

                      Well I believed is so good that they don't not want to make it public (not even on their web site).
                      It might cause a stampede at their TD recruitment centre you know ?
                  
                      
                      Your average daily collection must at least cover the rental, your salary and some extra lah! If not those genius who come out with this eat what ? Sound logical ??
                  
                      
                      Was told they had this some years back. Some good cabbies signed up. In the end @$%&amp;*#88888.  One of the conditions... daily collection of at least $300.
                      
                      Maybe this time round they improve it. Can somebody try it out and tell us how goood ?
                      Not me, I am lazy so not likely to meet their requirements.

              <p>I have in fact enquired SMRT on this.</p>
              <p>Fixed salary $2k only if you bring back 4.5k income per month for them.</p>
              <p>Ad claims: with incentives up to 3.5k earnings ...... I enquire, 3.5k for you if you bring back income of 6.5k per month... they have a formula I forgot, only remember these key figures...</p>
              <p>now you know why SMRT ONLY company to offer this assinine scheme &amp; why no other company follow? anybody interested ?</p>
              <p>My reflex response: nnb, if i can earn this kind of income, I must be stupid to take home so much less .... end of story.</p>

              <p>They used to offer their Toyota crown for this scheme. But if one looks carefully, right now they used their Hyundai Azera. Why? Cos nobody is renting them from SMRT and they are stuck with hell lots of them. It doesn't take an idiot to know it does not make sense to use high end car for such scheme.</p>
              <p>And why people are not renting the Azera? Cos some Gek Kiang people in SMRT introduced a petrol drinking and CNG sucking machine into this company lor. Ask anyone who drive Azera how many time their got to top up their CNG a day.</p>

              <p>Why SMRT need to bring in China man  to become taxi driver. Cos they thoughts they have china man bus driver, they also can produce china man taxi driver.</p>
