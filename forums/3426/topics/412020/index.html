              <p>Hail one of the cute antique convertible taxis buzzing around the old city, 
              and the driver -- a lovely young woman with a ponytail that whips in the wind, 
              if you're lucky -- will zoom along the shorefront at 50 miles an hour.</p>
              <p>On your left, Old Havana continues to decay elegantly. On your right, young 
              Habaneros hang out on the seawall seeing and being seen. Faster than you can say 
              "Guantanamera," you're pulling into the elegant Hotel Nacional with a screech of 
              tires and a flourish. All for about $5 -- if you're a good negotiator. (Of 
              course, American citizens shouldn't forget that the Cuban experience technically 
              requires the blessing of the U.S. government.)</p>

              <div class="slide_caption"><strong>Hong Kong: Airport to the city</strong></div>
              <p>The ride from Hong Kong International Airport at Chep Lok Kok to Central Hong 
              Kong is a marvel of civil engineering. Leaving the massive terminal, you soon 
              find yourself racing over Kap Shui Mun Bridge on your way to the very impressive 
              Tsing Ma Suspension Bridge -- at 4,500 feet, one of the longest bridges in the 
              world and the longest auto/rail crossing.</p>
              <p>Way down below you'll see lots of ship traffic navigating the fast-moving 
              currents of the channel. Next comes the smaller Ting Kau Bridge, which links to 
              the mainland, and from there it's a not-so-scenic trip across Kowloon and 
              through one of the three cross-harbor tunnels to Central Hong Kong. Quite an 
              eyeful for about $45.</p>

              Square</strong></div>
              <p>A straight shot down 5th Avenue in the back of a yellow cab with an 
              aggressive driver can feel like an amusement park ride (albeit one where English 
              may not be the primary language spoken, but thanks to the city's grid system, 
              that's usually not a problem). By day, he'll weave in and out of traffic while 
              you watch landmarks such as the Plaza Hotel, St. Patrick's Cathedral, the New 
              York Public Library, the Empire State Building and the Flatiron Building go by 
              (not to mention Forbes HQ).</p>
              <p>By night, he'll take advantage of the lighter traffic and synchronized 
              traffic lights to achieve near warp speed before screeching to a stop at the 
              brightly lit Washington Square Arch. Step into Mario Batali's Otto (1 Fifth 
              Avenue) to recover with a glass of good red wine and a pizza.</p>

              via Avenida Nueve de Julio</strong></div>
              <p>Stick out your hand at the right time of day and five or more 
              black-and-yellow taxis will cut across traffic to compete for your business. On 
              this ride you start near the grave of Eva Perón (have coffee in one of the many 
              pleasant cafes outside the cemetery gate) and cut through the Retiro, one of 
              BA's most chic and European-style neighborhoods, on your way to Avenida Nueve de 
              Julio.</p>
              <p>Talk about a major thoroughfare: At 425 feet wide, it's said to be the 
              world's widest street. As you're dropped off at the ornate Teatro Colón (take 
              the tour), you'll notice the imposing Obelisk at the Plaza de la Republica. Huge 
              though it may be, its scale shrinks in the middle of such a grand 
              boulevard.</p>

              Jie</strong></div>
              <p>Sprawling Beijing is a great taxi city. Cheap, fast and numerous (there are 
              66,000), taxis are the best way to get around, especially when you discover how 
              surprisingly small the subway system is. On this ride, you start at the big new 
              hotel and shopping zone and zip past the old foreign legations (site of the 
              siege of the Boxer Rebellion) until your taxi shoots right across the top of 
              Tiananmen Square.</p>
              <p>On your left is the vast plaza ringed by government buildings and Mao's 
              impressive tomb. On your right is the bright red main gate of the Forbidden 
              City, with the iconic image of Chairman Mao keeping a watchful eye over the 
              square. Continue along to some of the old-style hutong neighborhoods, where you 
              can hop out and continue your journey in a bicycle rickshaw with a guide who 
              will show you around some of the city's rapidly disappearing back 
              alleys.</p>

              <div class="slide_caption"><strong>London: Marble Arch to the London Eye</strong></div>
              <p>Your taxi driver doesn't need your directions; after all, he has The 
              Knowledge -- the comprehensive street sense that all drivers must possess to get 
              a license. But to get a quick look at three centuries of London architecture and 
              a feel for the bustle of the city, head along Oxford Street and turn onto the 
              elegant curve of Regent Street.</p>
              <p>After the flash of Piccadilly Circus and a bit of Haymarket, go around 
              Trafalgar Square and down Whitehall, with British government buildings lining 
              both sides. You'll head right for Parliament and Big Ben and then go over 
              Westminster Bridge to the world's most impressive Ferris wheel. From its 
              443-foot pinnacle you can easily see the entire route you've just taken.</p>

              <div class="slide_caption"><strong>Iceland: Reykjavik to the Blue Lagoon</strong></div>
              <p>After beginning your ride, it's amazing how quickly the tiny candy-colored 
              city of Reykjavik falls away and you find yourself cruising across a stunningly 
              desolate landscape of treeless lava fields that tumble to the sea. Forty minutes 
              later, you pull into a parking lot and spot clouds of steam rising from behind a 
              small lava mountain. Head down the path carved through the lava for the soak of 
              a lifetime. You can even continue right on to the airport when you're done. It's 
              the perfect way to say goodbye (or hello) to Iceland.</p>

              <p>You may find yourself in the back seat of a Mercedes as you take this 
              relatively quick ride along some of Paris's most famous boulevards, an equally 
              compelling trip by day or night. From the bustling tourist area just north of 
              Notre Dame, you head west, with the majesty of the Louvre flashing by on your 
              left and then the shopping arcades of the Rue de Rivoli on your right. At the 
              majestic Place de la Concorde you pass the <a href="http://www.forbestraveler.com/hotel/102/33172/">Hôtel de Crillon</a> and 
              then speed along the magnificent 1.25 miles of the Avenue des Champs-Elysees to 
              the Arc de Triomphe. Stroll back to Louis Vuitton for an authentic taste of 
              Parisian shopping madness.</p>

              <p>In this pulsating city, 18,000 little yellow Fiats (called "taksis," 
              appropriately enough) dart through traffic on the ancient hilly streets. This 
              ride starts at busy Taksim Square and heads downhill along the main 
              thoroughfare, Istiklal Caddesi, past countless shops and restaurants, with 
              occasional views of the Bosphorus ahead and off to your left.</p>
              <p>Crossing the Golden Horn on the Galata Bridge you can see the minarets of 
              several mosques including the Hagia Sophia, but you'll lose sight of them as the 
              car plunges into the narrow winding streets of the old town. Get out at the 
              spectacular Blue Mosque, ignore the touts, take off your shoes and explore the 
              awe-inspiring tile work inside.</p>

              <div><strong>Venice: Anywhere to anywhere</strong></div>
              <p>In a city where, as Robert Benchley memorably noted, the streets
              are full of water, your taxi will be a boat. Sleek, private
              water-taxis are available at several spots throughout Venice, and
              the mahogany beauties are a primary means of transportation between
              Marco Polo Airport and the city center. These are unique and
              memorable taxis for a unique and memorable city, but be prepared to
              pay. Just note that it'll cost close to $100 for even a short ride,
              since rides from the railway station to a nearby hotel start at 60
              euros).</p>
              <p>knn 100 euros and all those cb pax are screaming about our high
              fares. and better still complain about the service.</p>
              <p>I dont need 100 euros , 100 SGD bucks will do, then u see wad
              kind of service i give u. sorry not those specials la haha</p>
              <p>for $100 fare , u will get a very well dressed TCL , with proper
              shoes and shirt + opening of doors  when u step in &amp; out
              and behind u will have newspaper + sweets + drinks ( not cold coz
              no fridge). i might even have a netbook installed for pax exclusive
              use. 2 stops 3 stops?? sure no problem!</p>
              <p>For a $10 fare which is average fare here in sg , WHAT SERVICE U
              WANT?</p>

              </span></p><p><span class="articleLocation">SYDNEY</span> (Reuters Life!) - London taxis, 
                      with their friendly drivers who actually know where they are going, are ranked 
                      best in the world, according to an annual taxi poll.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The survey by travel website hotels.com found London taxis, despite being the 
                      most expensive, beat rivals across the globe to head the list for the third 
                      consecutive years, scoring a total of 59 percent in votes on several categories 
                      by travelers.</p>
              <p>London taxi drivers were voted both friendliest and most knowledgeable. 
                      Drivers in the English capital must pass a rigorous examination called The 
                      Knowledge to earn their taxi license.</p>
              <p>New York's yellow taxis came second in the list, scoring 27 percent which was 
                      up 10 percentage points from last year even though Manhattan's cab drivers tied 
                      with Parisian taxi drivers as the rudest.</p>
              <p>Travelers said New York had the most available taxis.</p>
              <p>Cabbies in Rome were voted the worst drivers in the world with almost one in 
                      10 travelers thinking the Italian capital had the world's worst taxi drivers 
                      when it came to the quality of driving.</p>
              <p>"Traveling by taxi is one of the first experiences that many travelers have 
                      upon arrival in a new city. In fact, the research found that cabs are by far the 
                      most popular method of traveling from the airport to their hotel," a spokesman 
                      for hotels.com said in a statement.</p>
              <p>The global poll scored city based taxis for their levels of cleanliness, 
                      value, quality of driving, knowledge of the area, friendliness, safety and 
                      availability.</p>
              <p>Rounding out the top five were Tokyo with a total score of 26 percent, Berlin 
                      with 17 percent, and Bangkok famed for its tuk-tuks scoring 14 percent.</p>
              <p>Madrid's taxis were ranked sixth in the poll, followed by Copenhagen and 
                      Dublin with 11 percent and Frankfurt and Paris with 10 percent.</p>
              <p>Taxis in Sydney fell short of the top 10, scoring badly in the areas of value 
                      for money, availability and knowledge of the area.</p>
              <p>The survey for hotels.com, part of the Expedia group, was conducted among 
                      over 1,900 travelers between May 11-28 this year.</p>
