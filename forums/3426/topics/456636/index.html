              </p><h2>Linking taxi availability to COE availability may only complicate matters 
              further</h2>
              <p>The Straits Times - August 2, 2012 <br>By: Christopher Tan</p>
              <p> <span style="font-size: small;">IS THE Government mixing up two separate 
              objectives in its latest move to remove taxi bids from Category A of 
              certificates of entitlement (COEs) - long the staple of buyers of 
              bread-and-butter cars?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Or is it trying to kill two birds with one 
              stone?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">In an announcement with few details last week, 
              Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said that taxi companies will no longer have to 
              compete with mainstream car buyers for COEs. Instead, their certificates will be 
              drawn from the Open Category, currently the domain of big-car buyers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">As a concession, cab operators will not have 
              to pay Open Category prices, but a three-month average of Category A prices. The 
              latter are usually 10 per cent to 50 per cent lower than the former.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Exactly how many COEs will be drawn from the 
              Open Category for taxis will hinge on how available the cabs are to 
              commuters.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Despite having one of the highest number of 
              cabs per 1,000 residents among developed cities, Singapore, it seems, remains 
              one of the hardest places for someone to get a cab.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">So the Government's decision to remove taxi 
              bids from Category A, and tying how many COEs cab companies can have to a basic 
              service standard, appears to be a double-barrelled strategy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">First, it aims to remove an upward pressure on 
              Category A premiums by taking taxis out of this category. This will have a 
              profound effect on the affordability of cars, as well as on Singapore's worrying 
              inflation rate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Category A accounts for more than half of all 
              COEs that car buyers bid for.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Second, it is putting the onus of ensuring 
              taxi availability on the cab companies. If they want more COEs to expand their 
              fleets, they will have to meet this service standard somehow.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Seems like a neat cure-all solution. But is 
              it?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Let's examine the issues at hand. Singapore 
              has 5.2 cabs per 1,000 residents, compared with 3.3 in London, 2.6 in Hong Kong 
              and 1.5 in New York.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Since the Government liberalised the taxi 
              industry in 2003, the cab population has ballooned by nearly 40 per cent to more 
              than 27,000 last year. Yet, commuters constantly gripe that hailing a cab is a 
              chore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Taxi ridership grew merely 16 per cent from 
              2003 to last year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">It is clear that cab companies currently have 
              no direct incentive to improve taxi availability. Their primary objective is to 
              collect rental from hirers (cabbies), with as big a fleet as they can 
              muster.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">So, pegging an operator's expansion to taxi 
              availability is ingenious, no?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">But this is what could well happen: Taxi 
              companies will come out to support the Government's initiative, but their 
              efforts to raise taxi availability will fizzle out.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Taxi availability (or the lack of it) is 
              largely a function of the current business model and fare structure. Driving a 
              cab is not a career choice for most people. For many drivers, it is often the 
              last resort.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Another cohort is made up of drivers who are 
              not "career cabbies". It is estimated that up to one-third of cabbies today are 
              folks like retirees or small business owners, who will ply the streets just long 
              enough to cover their daily rental, and use their cabs as their personal 
              transport for the rest of the day.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Cabbies will naturally drive when the yield is 
              highest. Thus they will drive when and where surcharges apply. They will also 
              wait for call bookings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">As long as this status quo remains, it will be 
              hard for taxi availability to improve.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">In fact, taxi companies will, in all 
              likelihood, rush to expand their fleets before the new rules kick in in 
              2014.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The authorities could of course mandate a 
              minimum mileage a cabby has to clock a day. But this will have an environmental 
              cost, with no guarantee that the extra mileage will be "occupied mileage". In 
              other words, cabbies may be forced to cruise empty.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The second issue at hand is COE premium 
              spikes. While the current Category A price spiral is fuelled by taxi bids, the 
              underlying cause is a record supply shortage.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">If the COE supply had not plunged to less than 
              a third of what it was just four years ago, the influence of taxi bids would not 
              have been so strong.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">What accounts for the supply shortage has been 
              well documented. The COE system suffers from a feast-and-famine supply 
              phenomenon that the authorities have long ignored. Until now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">But instead of a bold overhaul of the 
              22-year-old system to improve equity, we are going to see yet another tweak. The 
              latest one, to remove taxi bids from Category A, will remove further upward 
              pressure on premiums, but it is unlikely to send premiums to saner 
              levels.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">This is because Category A COE supply for the 
              current six-month period is nearly 40 per cent lower than that of the last six 
              months.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">So, even without bids from taxi companies - 
              which account for around 25 per cent to 30 per cent of total bids - COEs in this 
              segment will probably remain firm.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">What car buyers and sellers have been 
              clamouring for is a more stable and predictable supply pattern: one that does 
              not see premiums at $5,000 in one year and $90,000 in another.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Mr Lui has said that he is likely to "save" 
              some certificates during the next bonanza period from 2014 to 2018 for future 
              years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">But how many? And how will the "saved" COEs be 
              dispersed later?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Even before clarity dawns upon those issues, 
              we now have yet another uncertainty: how the supply of Open Category COEs will 
              be affected by taxi bids post-2014.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">It is admirable that the Government admits 
              things are not working as well as they should, and is looking to fix the 
              system.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">But linking taxi availability to COE 
              availability may only complicate matters further.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">As with all problems, it is better to go right 
              to the root cause for a permanent fix. In both cases, the root causes are not 
              unknown.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">But, to reiterate, taxi driving has to be made 
              more attractive as a career choice; cabbies need to be incentivised to pick up 
              more fares as and when they appear, rather than face disincentives if they don't 
              meet a quota.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Next, the vehicle quota system should 
              contribute to a more sustainable vehicle population growth pattern, with as 
              little social, economic and political cost as possible.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">If it is unable to do that, a complete rethink 
              is probably the thing to do.</span></p>

              <p>I think the main problem is the policy makers are always trying to solve problems without losing revenue streams.</p>
              <p>eg, what's the objective of ERP? Congestion control, right?</p>
              <p>Then why does an empty cab going into CBD need to pay erp???</p>
              <p>Doesn't making easier access to cabs inside CBD incentivise car owners to leave their cars at home?</p>
              <p>Furthermore, COE system was to manage vehicle population growth thru quota and bids. Now they want to control taxi quota.</p>
              <p>So why do cab company need to pay coe (a cost that will utimately be passed down to TD) when they are not allowed to bid?</p>

              </p><p>If you ask me, in terms of availability of cabs, there is an obvious mis-match between rewards and effort/overheads for TDs.</p>
              <p>Hong Kong for eg has the mini-bus industry and taxis to supplement the public transport system.</p>
              <p>The authorities here have to decide whether to treat our taxi as a supplement to the buses/mrt, a premium mode of transport or a combination of both.</p>
              <p>Premium transport obviously requires premium fares and would make taxi only affordable to a certain income groups, people on business duty and tourist who have not much choice.</p>
              <p>As a supplement to bus/mrt, the fares have to be kept affordable and therefore overheads of TDs must correspondingly be reduced, eg no COE or diesel tax and non payment of erp when empty.</p>
              <p>Being land scarce, I think increasing number of cabs is not the solution. Enabling each cab to complete more trips, I feel, is.</p>
              <p>Let cabs use the bus lanes. After all, besides the public buses, cabs have to be next most efficient road users.</p>
              <p>Through legislation (for new buildings) and perks (for existing buildings), require/encourage dedicated access for taxi.</p>
              <p>Hopefully, an improved experience for pax taking taxis would sway them from the idea of owning a car. </p>
              <p>Discentives, through the fare structure, is another way to discourage hogging and inefficient use of cabs, which must be considered as a national resource.</p>
              <p>Fare stages (1,2 or even 3) should be both time and distance based, eg 1st 10 km or 1st 7 mins. This should discourage some who like to choose scenic and slow routes for a small or perceived/non-existent saving.</p>
              <p>To improve service, charges for open-trunk, waiting and multiple stops should be implemented. After all, hotels and restaurants are allowed to levy service charges. Even porters are rewarded with tips.</p>
              <p>Thus, through the fare structure, treating taxis as a no-frills solution for point a to b transit should be encouraged.</p>
              <p>When sg truly becomes a 24/7 city, a favourable fare structure and related gov measures could even result in a 3 shift taxi industry.</p>

              <h2>Linking taxi availability to COE availability may only
              complicate matters further</h2>
              <p>The Straits Times - August 2, 2012<br> By: Christopher Tan</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">IS THE Government mixing
              up two separate objectives in its latest move to remove taxi bids
              from Category A of certificates of entitlement (COEs) - long the
              staple of buyers of bread-and-butter cars?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Or is it trying to kill two
              birds with one stone?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">In an announcement with few
              details last week, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said that taxi
              companies will no longer have to compete with mainstream car buyers
              for COEs. Instead, their certificates will be drawn from the Open
              Category, currently the domain of big-car buyers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">As a concession, cab operators
              will not have to pay Open Category prices, but a three-month
              average of Category A prices. The latter are usually 10 per cent to
              50 per cent lower than the former.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Exactly how many COEs will be
              drawn from the Open Category for taxis will hinge on how available
              the cabs are to commuters.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">It is admirable that the
              Government admits things are not working as well as they should,
              and is looking to fix the system.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">But linking taxi availability to
              COE availability may only complicate matters further.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">As with all problems, it is
              better to go right to the root cause for a permanent fix. In both
              cases, the root causes are not unknown.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">But, to reiterate, taxi driving
              has to be made more attractive as a career choice; cabbies need to
              be incentivised to pick up more fares as and when they appear,
              rather than face disincentives if they don't meet a
              quota.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Next, the vehicle quota system
              should contribute to a more sustainable vehicle population growth
              pattern, with as little social, economic and political cost as
              possible.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">If it is unable to do that, a
              complete rethink is probably the thing to do.</span></p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Sometimes when we condense the post, we can see what the writer's agenda really is. Appears that he is more concerned about buying a new car, than the welfare of taxi drivers because he is going to be one.</p>
              <p>I agree when he says "<span style="font-size: small;">linking taxi availability to
              COE availability may only complicate matters further". Taxies are public transport vehicles and should be taken out of the COE system. But if this is done, then the reporter might drive a taxi as his own private car. <br></span></p>
