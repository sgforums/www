              <p>I emphasis , u cannot be a cabby if u have intentions to get married and buying a flat .</p>
              <p>CPF is very crucial in buying a flat . IR8A also not as powerful !</p>
              <p>Still can buy , not say cannot buy .</p>
              <p>But when u are tagged "Taxi driver" in that application form , u will have several hurdles to clear , unlike if u have consistent CPF contribution with good salary .</p>
              <p>But do not find those jobs in what BCL quote "Contract" basis , unless that contract provides CPF to you .</p>

              <p>Like mine case . . i tookover the flat when i was 21 .</p>
              <p>Cos we cannot afford to pay cash every month that time , but with CPF easier .</p>
              <p>I already owned a 5 room now , from 4 rooms ... so can i be a cabby ? Yes for sure .</p>
              <p>Cos at this stage , i dun need them anymore ( CPF ) .</p>
              <p>I prefer cold hard cash .</p>
              <p>In Singapore , i conceded that one cannot never be rich .</p>
              <p>I have to thank God , during my time , i contributed 20% , and boss 20% of the salary to CPF .</p>
              <p>Now i don't want to know how much total contributions , cos i dun need to worry .</p>
              <p>But newer generation need to worry .</p>
              <p>My father bought the 4A HDB at $65,900 at 1987 . 110 square metre , not shoe box HDB hor .</p>
              <p>Now 4 room what price ? Size ? I dun want to know .</p>
              <p>Driving a cab .... i really cannot imagine what kind of flats HDB allow you to buy ?</p>

              It's a very sad situation in Singapore now. I'm in my late 40s and a graduate, has been jobless for almost a year now. I'm taking my taxi course now and in my class there is another young graduate in his early 30s also jobless for some months now. What's the point of us striving and studying so hard for a degree at 24 or 25 years old when our working lifespan is only 10 years after that? As a lot of graduates will be faced with the prospect of being retrenched or replaced by the time they are in their mid 30s onwards.
              
              Mr Tommy Koh's article sums it up very well on the income inequality in Singapore. We are the highest if not one of the highest in the world on this issue. Prof Lim Chong Yah has rightly warned us of this when he first mentioned the wage gap being too wide. If these unhappiness or undertones are not managed well by the government, I fear what life is going to be like in Singapore when it's my child's turn to enter the workforce.
