              <p>Actually I have long time wondered why in Singapore this is allowed.</p>
              <p>If three person want to go to three different destinations, they should take a cab each.</p>
              <p>I one person want to go to three destinations, he only need to inform the driver first.</p>
              <p>A taxi is personalised transport service.</p>
              <p>Would the taxi driver be satisfied, if the rule stipulates that when three persons want to go from A  to B, C and D. He reset the meter at  B and then proced to C and does the same at C to D. Each pax pay for their journey, or the last pax pay the total.</p>
              <p>Like this the driver don't <em>rugi</em> the boarding charges, and the 2nd and 3rd pax each still pay less than if they were to take a taxi by themselves from point A.</p>

              <p>Hello frd, Pun loti is the most farked up trip esp during hot hours. Do u know the time , taken to bring 3 of u monkeys is a big waste of time? so what if is $20?? with that time taken , the TD could have made double.</p>
              <p>Just to cite u an example , a regular commuter i took from my usual waiting place, he go to Toh Guan alone , fare is $18.60. Last nite his colleague hop on board to 2 places Jurong East St 13 and then to Toh guan. Fare $19.20.</p>
              <p>One big loop and additional time taken , for 60 cts more??? Earn So much???? and this trip is a midnight one. Imagine if its normal hours??</p>
              <p>Normal hours if kena 3 or 4 places , i will definitely reject. not happy pls complain. T</p>
              <p>I give good service to commuters but not to the extend of jeopardizing my run time just so u fellas can save $.</p>

              <p>No offense to BCL, black car TD like me love pax who request to go 3 different stops all in different parts of Singapore. One trip from CCK &gt; jurong &gt; woodlands &gt; AMK can easily collect $55 including midnight surcharge, assuming I took &lt; 1 hr to finish this job.</p>
              <p>Peak hour, off-peak hour all never mind. I already at CCK, anyplace also can go liao.</p>
              <p>But hor if driving the red, white, gold, silver, yellow-top, blue or yellow car, then things are completely different liao. Must take BCL advice seriously or face loss of income.</p>

              <p>Breaking up this into 3 continuous trips would mean less revenue unless you got something like 3 peak hour CBD bookings between 8pm-11pm. For this kind of HDB to HDB transfer, it is better to just let the meter run non-stop for 1 hour, it can be pretty good income.</p>

              <p>No offense to BCL, black car TD like me love pax who request to go 3 different stops all in different parts of Singapore. One trip from CCK &gt; jurong &gt; woodlands &gt; AMK can easily collect $55 including midnight surcharge, assuming I took &lt; 1 hr to finish this job.</p>
              <p>Peak hour, off-peak hour all never mind. I already at CCK, anyplace also can go liao.</p>

              Hello Cheapo, how frequent you take taxi? Do you always choose the type of taxi you like? Have you taken a ride in black chrysler before? Should get a name card from f1taxidriver, so he can pick you guys up after you all book out. But I think nowadays youth like you prefers to buy your own car and drive. I driving Red ones, so don't hop in mine. Thank you.

              <p>Actually at Sungei Gedong Camp , those guys can actually keep on supporting Silver Cab .</p>
              <p>Cos Silver Cab surrounding West side , their calls very bad , so if given a chance to get a job out of Jurong , they will love it .</p>
              <p>Because SilverCab do not have abundance of calls like comfort in Jurong , so basically they need Sungei Gedong camp as a back up .</p>
              <p>Unlike Comfort , Comfort at Tuas area so many calls , they need not take Sungei Gedong calls .</p>
              <p>Also TransCab Tuas also so many calls , we dun need Sungei Gedong .</p>
              <p>Comfort they ya ya kapala , kpkb , because their calls so many !!</p>
              <p>Due to the Military area ... The satellite system from Comfort dun actually worked well in that area .</p>
              <p>SilverCab still better for Sungei Gedong cos Silver used walkie talkie type of transmissions . Islandwide transmissions .</p>
