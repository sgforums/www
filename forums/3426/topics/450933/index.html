              <p>I need your help.</p>
              <p>I only have o levels and due to financial difficulties, I have decided to drive a cab. I have a few questions and i hope you can guide me on the right path.</p>
              <p>1. I should take the license from comfort (not the full time course but the self study computer type). I am wondering for first time taxi driver, should I stick with comfort?</p>
              <p>2. I intend to drive 12 hour shift everyday, but which timing should I choose to make the most money? I am in need of cash to pay for my mother's medication.</p>
              <p>3. How much roughly can I make if I were to chiong for 12 hours? I know that different people drive different styles, but what approch should I take and what areas should I be going for?</p>
              <p>4. If you have any tips for me, I would be very grateful.</p>

              Relaxing taxi driving is the way to go (long term substainable). Cannot expect everyday to earn tat much. Take breaks in btw as needed.

              <p>Question 1</p>
              <p>Self-study, computer type, this has been dis-continued. They now have the Express 3 weeks course and the Normal 6 weeks course. But remember to factor in the 'wait time'. Even though it's 3 weeks, if the course starts in June, also LL.</p>
              <p>CDG and SMRT have 'Train &amp; Place' Package. meaning they will give you special incentives if you register for the course thru' them. The last time I read through their Contract Terms (in January 2012), CDG requires you to sign with them upon completion of course, whereas SMRT, you will only loose your incentives, no need to sign with them.</p>
              <p>If you read through this forum, the regulars here will advise you to go Relief first, which means the incentives is no use since it is only for the hirer.</p>
              <p>I have seen a lot of my classmates sign for the New Epica, because the feeling is great to drive a New Epica. But a few weeks later, they are crying, desperatly looking for somebody to relief with them. At $100+ per day, they cannot afford not to drive everyday, and they must drive at least 6 hours minimum to break even.</p>

              <p>Sharing my experience here...</p>
              <p>During the first 2 weeks of driving, cannot make head or tail of what is happening, just drive.</p>
              <p>(This is like BMT in the army. You charge up and down the hill, and you dont even know why)</p>
              <p>After 2 weeks, start to 'see' some patterns, able to improve on driving strategy.</p>
              <p>(This is like Vocation training in the army where you understand why certain things happen)</p>
              <p>After 1 to 2 months, start to fine tune driving strategy.</p>
              <p>(This is like posted to unit, where you can start to 'keng')</p>

              <p>To this little brother , studying part time , and need to work 12 hours ?</p>
              <p>I think like that will die very young .</p>
              <p>Either one will give way ... study give way , taxi driving give way , and body give way .</p>
              <p>Either one good enough to kill u .</p>
              <p>We full timer , also can hardly get that sort of money u looking for .</p>
              <p>And we are experience and sometimes or most times , we need to face economy setbacks as well .</p>
              <p>Economy no good , we will also be no good .</p>
              <p>However hardworking u might be , sometimes if it not your day , it will never be your day .</p>
              <p>We called it off form .</p>
              <p>Say $4000 , divided by 31 days , = nett $129 .</p>
              <p>$129 + rental $50 + diesel $40 = $219 collection .</p>
              <p>That is base on 31 days , i worked 31 days as well , but never everyday can fetch $219 collection everyday , i dun study part time .</p>
              <p>I have got lots of rest , my concentration must be tip top .</p>
              <p>$219 minus cigarettes , kopi , lunch , dinner , supper , car wash etc .... how must balance ?</p>
              <p>Lower your expectations , nett $70 u should be happy liao .</p>
              <p>That is about $2100 a month .</p>
              <p>Cannot rest in between , but 1am u can go home rest .</p>
              <p>Like that not so fast up the lorry .</p>
              <p>If everyday 12 hours , next day study part time , very fast ur eyes will be like panda .</p>
              <p>And up the lorry soon .</p>
              <p>Worst , not enough rest , one moment of dis-concentration , piang !</p>
              <p>Bye bye $2000 .</p>
              <p>U think drive taxi easy like ABC ?</p>

              <p>Taxi driving like boss, self employed.</p>
              <p>The only difference with this self employed so called business as compare to most i know or seen.</p>
              <p>You are exchanging your TIME for MONEY. And when you are using time to make money there is a capacity on how much you can really make everyday.</p>
              <p>Unless u r warren buffett or as lucky as facebook founder mark zuckerberg.</p>
              <p>Tidor money still flow to your bank account</p>
              <p>Want more money? Spend more time on the road.</p>
              <p>More time on road means less time for something else.</p>
              <p>Health is also neglected.</p>
              <p>Makan also neglected.</p>
              <p>Cos you are always on a rush to be otr for as long as possible eating junk like curry puff, fried popiah, oily fishballs while driving(I mention this 3 makan becos i also guilty of it at times).</p>
              <p>And if you have a short temper character than taxi may not be suitable. Why? Ask urself do you get angry and agitated easily when you encounter reckless and uncourtesy driving by other road user or irritated when they are constantly horning you.</p>
              <p>Cos when u r on the road more than any other user you are constantly getting all these from other road users whether you like it or not.</p>
