              <p>You areadly told OMO what is OMO one man operation,meaning day and night you must drive. You know what is PT meaning part time. so part time one shift from 5am to 5pm from sunday. once a week only half shift full of energy no need recharge...  Since you areadly told you driving full sunday...battery already weaken...is there any different on weekdays and on sunday the road condition. How about the crowds and connections. The extra families going out, meaning example.. familyday bringing childrens out and some church activities, sports and games, look at kallang, turf city and many other area and eatery outlets... extra bonus... whereas weekday only working crowds, childrens go to school, only some tai tai out for shopping,hospital appointments etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your question finding sunday relief difficult, cause only sunday no taker lah cause you need to rest other also need to rest five days work or six days work... those who take sunday the weekdays they are working as like ALN. For me 2 to 3 days either weekdays or Sunday, me is ok. So Sunday I chiong like nobody business cause hirers are not there or only those half of the population like you kind OMO or some hirer...ya. another thing some hirers using their own taxi as weekend car for their family. giving discount rate on sunday as hirers is offering and still difficult...who? say so ALN areadly one Taker...hehe. and me also can consider.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That why? I Told  .. only three to four days i am driving as PT.my  weekday collection, only my Sunday is better, What? so strange as you mentioned, actually you are refering, own data cannot be wrong right. and now my partner already taken my sunday now only left saturday and two weekdays, so is that enough on my explanation.</p>

              <p>Strange, if Sunday is such a good day for taxi, why OMO still want to give discount rate to a Sunday relief and also so having difficulty in finding Sunday relief driver. I am now driving full day Sunday.</p>

              <p>Family is very important to cabby , and i am serious .</p>
              <p>On Sunday , money is less important , family is more important than that .</p>

              <p>Thanks all for the inputs. Me actually family man.</p>
              <p>I am driving Sunday full day and just getting the feel of it, i doubt i could tahan this long term. As most of you have said, family important, money can't earn all of them. My hirer give me the option to rest if i feel like it but this is only the initial stage.</p>
