              <p>Sometime the best GPS is the pax, talk to them nicely, most will bring you to their destination, diam diam also no meaning, drive taxi whole day tiam tiam can fall asleep easily, but also cannot talk so much, talk moderately, I like good conversation, it makes the journey more lively and even a long one, get shortened.</p>
              <p>It is also good to keep some jokes with you, some people love jokes, those who took my taxi alway commend that they never laugh so much in a taxi and wish that the journey is still on. 2 married guys picked up after midnite going to jurong west, one told the other that his wife will sure scold him and nag the whole nite for drinking and going home late, the other also said the same.</p>
              <p>I told them if you want your wife to stop nagging, go home, bang close the door, throw the shoes on side, then before she nag, shout to her that you demand sex with her now, most wife will quickly go inside the room, cover blanket and act sleeping, who would want to sex with a drunker?? they laugh n laughed.</p>
              <p>Then they asked me why I drive taxi, such a waste, so much public talent, I told them I got Phd, every hard to find job, then they said, Oh!, you got a doctorate, can be university professor mah, outside cannot pay you. I told them my Phd is not permanent heachache type, it is Poly Halfway Dropout</p>

              <p>Then got once I picked up an american old couple at mustafa going back to shangri la, the wife said the indian might had overcharged her on a pair of shoes, I said cannot be lah, anyway, it is just $20, cheap and good, standard price. Then she asked, are you sure? The hubby shake his head in disbelieve on his wife action, then I said, sure, did you not notice most doorman and security peoples in singapore are indian? The husband asked, so? because they are the most trusted people here, so how can you said indian cheated you. Both laughed.</p>
              <p>Then the wife asked me, you think such shoe can last, I said, sure, why not, cheap, good and lasting, unless you are travelling back to USA, then no guarantee, she in shocked asked why? I told her you should know better, in america, the immigration check all shoes and most of the time, people lost their shoes due to high volume of passengers, they laughed in agreement. Then if you got that mustafa name on your shoe, you may end up going home with no shoe, because your shoe may be send to the america terrorism office.</p>

              <p>I think...</p>
              <p>for experienced TD : The GPS between the ears is still the best</p>
              <p>for Newbies or TD still not completely familiar yet : Use the GPS between the ears to go between Areas, like from Tapines to West Coast. Then use the electronic GPS to find the block or building. (But you must set the GPS before the start of trip).</p>
              <p>When you travel at 80 km/h and wholely dependent on the GPS, sometimes you will miss a turn.</p>

              <p>For those completely never drive before and now starting as a TD, GPS is sure to be helpful but not a dependable tool as yet.</p>
              <p>I take into an analogy of cooking, a completely new cook will cook a lousy soup, because he followed the book too closely and may had missed either on some ingredient or the temperature settings. He gets commented, scolded, or even criticised, if he takes it as a part and parcel of a learning journey, he move on and cook again, and again until perfection or near perfection.</p>
              <p>In TD, the first GPS are the pax, unlike delivery or bus, when destinations are pre planned, TD journey is not pre planned, this you have to understand, as newbie, there will be sudden shock and stress because of new directions in every pick up or call up. For every road lead to Rome, but which is the best is also critical and for that matter, the paxs are the best peoples to ASK first.</p>
              <p>Taxi courses, no matter what \</p>
              <p>practical or theory, they never teach you how to ask the paxs, how to gel with the paxs, how to get into the groove with the paxs ending up with a nice journey. They teach you more on the rules and regulations, the road directions, prominent locations and discipline. Eg from TP to Regent hotel, the road is TP ave 5, PIE&lt; steven&lt;orange groove and so on..but what if you are from CCK?, so, would say, the course is not flexible, it gives no room for creative thinking.</p>
              <p>GPS is best use when paxs do notknow the way, you also do not know the way, stop a while, go thru it, then on meter and move on without looking at it.</p>
              <p>Lesson 1, ask pax first, if he or she knows the way, best,</p>

              </p><p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px;">Hi Bowah, agreed. Me is a newbie and thus I will let my pax to be my GPS to guide me to their destination. To be honest, till date, about 90% of the pax is my GPS. Thus, my existing GPS (Sygic) is mainly used for the 10% of the pax that doesn't know the way or let me decide.</span></p>
              <p>Give an example, that yesterday I picked a couple going from AMK ave 3 to BB Ind Pk A. I know is going to PIE then out BB ave 3 (Transcab fav exit for CNG) But how to go?? The pax knew that have to go Marymount then Lornie then Adam out PIE. Being New, I'm blank as the pax mentioned they know is this route but don't know how. Luckily, my GPS save my day and guided me esp the short turn from Marymount to Lornie (very tricky if u not sure esp for me)</p>
              <p>Another one, yesterday drop a pax to Tuas South St 5 (very very deep but not the deepest), after that got one call (Kanna playout) to go Tuas Road. Imaging me being new, how to go there in the shortest way?? My GPS save my day again and guided me to Tuas Cresc then Pioneer road then Tuas road....</p>
              <p>So, really at the start need the GPS for some reasons...</p>
              <p>Just sharing....</p>

              <p>Hi brother, thanks for sharing,</p>
              <p>As said, GPS is helpful in it own way, but never be too relying on it that you become attach to it, meaning without a GPS, you do not know how or what to do? Just like do you know many people can go dumb nowaday with out a handphone with them, some may end up in bedok reservoir.</p>
              <p>In the age of high technology, we begin to alien ourselve as human and rather be part of the gadgets, you use to see so many peoples today looking at their hp more than others, be it movies, games, porn or messaging, even crossing the road also looking at the screen, and those telco shops are more crowded than the coffeeshops tell you how immerse we are in such world.</p>
              <p>I never start with a GPS, it was new during my time, expensive and I got no money to buy then, so, end up getting scolded, thrashed and sometime even banged car doors, and that was how many olden day TDs learn the trade, so, the question here is, after 6 months, remove that GPS for a few days, can you still drive?</p>
