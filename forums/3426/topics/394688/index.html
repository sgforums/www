              <p>4 times encountered. 3 Crowns. 1 Lorry. They charged out of the side road onto my main road. I had to fast brake. Usually they also had to brake. But after that, as they slowly drove off, they would try to stare back into the window to see whos the driver with a sneering, twisted face, machiam they wanted to find fault with whoever caused them to stop (or slow down). WTF?! Chiong out of side road never check never ease down, put the blame on the main road user?? Ever since these, every time I saw a Crown, a Lorry or a Corner, I siam far away.</p>
              <p>From my observation, I also noticed the Taxi Drivers that horned (not sure flash) the most were driving Sonatas. They were the most impatient Taxi Drivers with Crown Drivers but they showed by expressing their intents, Crowns showed by doing. Interestingly, Transcab Toyota Wish Drivers tended to sidestep, change lane then drove off liao. so far that is la. Merc/Limo Drivers were either so patient they drove like they didnt care about anyone else, they simply occupy a lane at a slow and steady speed totally disregarding traffic building up behind them, or they are completely impatient they drove like they are in a mad rush, weaving past everyone. They seems like in a world of their own. Good.</p>
              <p>Passengers also one kind. Met 2 of the same type in the one same day. Both directed their routes down to the last details, which lane, which turn. But along the way they got more and more upset because they blamed why never chiong those 4 traffic lights when they turning amber, why never overtake those 2 buses in front, why let that 3 cars overtake your lane, end up taking (a few more minutes?) longer than their 'expected' timing. hence they felt why they had to pay more $ as they compared with the last and the last last trip they took. When suggested to them why dont they try the Bus which is about about the same journey, one passenger even remarked in this manner, Yeah Lor! Why should I pay extra for Taxi if its the same as Bus lei?? Obviously the Taxi is NOT doing its job rite?! Its supposed to be faster, more comfortable and take maximum advantage of traffic since I am the customer paying more than Bus what! If everyone drives so 'slow and steady' like you, then no one would take Taxi, everyone would just take Bus and Mrt liao! Chey!</p>
