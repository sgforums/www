              i cannot say killing it's own kind or united whatever can.be said
              
              To achieve our ultimate aim of united so call , we first must eliminate black sheeps in our industry  . Then we can say good ones join hand . Yup that's it. 
              
              Cannot close two eyes on such acts . We must in fact join hand or united to eliminate such acts . It's those closed two eyes people that make it possible them to be like that.

              <p><br>Black sheep can be ignorance peoples, in every trades, you agree with me, there are blah blah black sheep, from navy to seamen to factory workers or electricial and hospitals.

              <p>Most of us are in our middle ages, and i guess ego and pride do play a high role here, you can see all the never said I am wrong kind of attitude here. If we can save black sheeps in our day in a day out plying the road, aren't we doing a good deed to ourselves and also to the taxi companies, I see newbies or black sheep do illegal U turn to take pax just infront of me, I stopped and tell him that it is dangerous and if got TP around or camera, he can be in trouble or $$ fly away, passenger he can take, but drive with care. Some black sheep are due to ignorances, maybe new or just start driving. I jumped Q once at woodland checkpoint when I was a newbie, cos I do not know that there was a long Q before the bus stop, a old man came to me, hello, Siao lian ye, mana ye sai an ni kuan, I glance at the back and saw, oh, so long Q, so I told him I am new and did not see the Q, he smile and said, it ok, but learn to look further ok, since you are new, I cover for you, I move out so that the others will not scold you later, I will wave to them, one in and one out, no differences, I was stunned by this old man gesture, I denied and move out bought a pack of coffee for him, till now, we still call each other, he is a kind of master to me.</p>
              <p>So, you see, we can make a difference if we want, unless those who really have not manner and take thing into his own hand, then that is unforgiven. But I still prefer to talk then to picture and cam people and then show it to the public.</p>
