              <p>
              </p><div style="color: #424242; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana, sans; font-size: 13px; background-color: #fbfbf3; text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: left;">I flew back to Singapore at 1.40 in the morning today. Our Jet Star flight was delayed, David and I took separate cabs so he could get straight home to sleep instead of detouring and dropping me off first (he had to wake up for work at 6).</span></div>
              <div style="color: #424242; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana, sans; font-size: 13px; background-color: #fbfbf3;">I know that taxi drivers have to queue up at the taxi ranks and they want to have a long ride instead of taking passengers close by to places like Pasir ris, Tampines, Changi. That’s why I always tip them generously, over and above the surcharge that all passengers (regardless of how close of far a destination) will have to pay.</div>
              <div style="color: #424242; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana, sans; font-size: 13px; background-color: #fbfbf3;"><img style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; position: relative; max-width: 450px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #ffffff; width: 120px; height: 55px; text-align: center; padding: 5px; border: 1px initial initial;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AXU8Spu-Czc/TyJJ3p9VrxI/AAAAAAAAPjA/4ESqFsCPEO4/s400/trans.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div>
              <div style="color: #424242; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana, sans; font-size: 13px; background-color: #fbfbf3;">As I wheeled my luggage to a red transcab, the driver, all smiling, takes my bag from me. As he was putting it into the boot, I told him I was going to Pasir ris.</div>
              <div style="color: #424242; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana, sans; font-size: 13px; background-color: #fbfbf3;">He tells me angrily, “Alamak you, Taiko lah. Kapala Bhutoh you!”</div>
              <div style="color: #424242; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana, sans; font-size: 13px; background-color: #fbfbf3;">And slams my bag into the boot. I don’t know what Taiko is. I think Bhutoh means cock/penis.</div>
              <div style="color: #424242; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana, sans; font-size: 13px; background-color: #fbfbf3;">I am an idiot. I should have got out of the cab immediately. But I didn’t. Then I suddenly thought, OMG, I better have small change for this guy because he’s going to shout at me again if he has to break a $50.</div>
              <div style="color: #424242; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana, sans; font-size: 13px; background-color: #fbfbf3;">I looked into my wallet, and saw plenty of tens, so no problem, then I look at the meter, and noticed, the surcharge was $9 plus. This was just barely 30 seconds of being in the taxi.</div>
              <div style="color: #424242; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana, sans; font-size: 13px; background-color: #fbfbf3;">I thought it was strange, but I didn’t pursue the matter. He was driving very rough and fast. Obviously pissed off with me living in Pasir ris. Then a call comes in, he speaks on the phone (handsfree), and he speaks loudly, but in Chinese (maybe a dialect), and all I could recognise was – Hijack, Pasir ris, nabei, Cha bo, Bhutoh.</div>
              <div style="color: #424242; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana, sans; font-size: 13px; background-color: #fbfbf3;">When coming off the expressway, he shouts impatiently, “Exit where!?”</div>
              <div style="color: #424242; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana, sans; font-size: 13px; background-color: #fbfbf3;">By this time, I had already taken down his license plate number ( SHD 46 C, red Transcab ) .</div>
              <div style="color: #424242; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana, sans; font-size: 13px; background-color: #fbfbf3;">When I got back (whole drive was barely 5 minutes). The fare came up to $6.70, plus the surcharge and midnight charge it was a total of $17.20 . I suspect I have been cheated at the initial starting point when the starting surcharge was already $9plus.</div>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; color: #424242; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana, sans; font-size: 13px; background-color: #fbfbf3;">(I asked David later on how much the starting surcharge in his cab was, he said $4.80. )</p>
              <div style="color: #424242; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana, sans; font-size: 13px; background-color: #fbfbf3;">
              <div>Anyway, I gave him $20, and said he could keep the change. I did not get a thank you, he was still just pissed off, didn’t bother to get out of the cab to get my luggage out (but I was expecting that he wouldn’t help anyway)</div>
              <div>As I exited the cab, I left my passenger door open, because quite frankly, I felt like he would just drive off before I can fully get my heavy luggage out of the boot. So I thought if the passenger door is opened, he can’t drive off.</div>
              <div>Then When I got my luggage out of the boot, instead of shutting the boot and the passenger side door, I just felt like.. WTF, he’s so rude to me, cheated me, I let him keep the change, and yet he is still so hostile towards me. He can shut his own damn doors.</div>
              <div>So I just left.</div>
              <div>As I got into the lift, I could hear him slamming the doors shut.</div>
              <div>I got home, and lodged a complaint with Transcab. The staff said that I would get a response in 7 – 1o days. That’s a long while. But I don’t mind, as long as they really look into it and not sweep it under the rug.</div>
              <div>I’ve never been in such a hostile situation before… but I wish I had stood my ground sooner. I wish I had got out of the cab that very moment when he scolded me with vulgarities instead of putting up with that shit. Also, why am I such an idiot? I should have asked him to verify the surcharge…. and made a fuss about it.. instead of letting him keep the change some more. I was just too shocked and scared</div>
              <div>Whatever, I hope I never see this asshole driver again.</div>
              </div>
              <div style="color: #424242; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana, sans; font-size: 13px; background-color: #fbfbf3;">Also… now I am scared to take taxi from airport!!</div>

              <p>Last week, a friend of mine took my cab. He ask me how I feel about cashless payment and if I know how to operate.</p>
              <p>I told him actually I prefer cashless, money goes direct into my account, can use to pay stuff. He ask me if I am sure.</p>
              <p>I told him I am different from those uncle, told him this uncle here very tech savy. Always encouraging ppl to pay nets.</p>
              <p>Then he told me that he is in a mist of writing a complain letter to company. He said the week before, he took a cab home and ask the Comfort driver if he can pay by card as he run out of cash. Wah lao, he said the driver's mood 180degree changed and start scolding him from the start to the end of the trip.</p>
              <p>Anyway, why taxi driver like that? what's wrong with cashless payment? what's wrong with Pasir Ris? You want to queue at airport must play by the rules la, something u get Jurong West and smile all your way there, kanna Pasir Ris also must swee swee la. Be more professional. Uncle here kanna Crown Plaza also like that.  my first time there, need help from Poolman to lead me there but end up joining the T3 taxi queue. Takes alot of time and illegal turn before I can get out of it. Customer still happy and say thanks for fetching us, they can see my effort. I also thanks them for letting me learn this new route. </p>
              <p>Btw last night drop a pax at Conrad hotel and pick up another 2, ask to go Airport Hotel. Cool, I know the way cos I just learn it. Send them there smoothly without a need to ask them for instruction, something very rare of this new driver.</p>

                  was, he said $4.80. )</p>
                  <div style="color: #424242; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana, sans; font-size: 13px; background-color: #fbfbf3;">
                  <div>Anyway, I gave him $20, and said he could keep the change. I
                  did not get a thank you, he was still just pissed off, didnâ€™t
                  bother to get out of the cab to get my luggage out (but I was
                  expecting that he wouldnâ€™t help anyway)</div>
                  <div>As I exited the cab, I left my passenger door open, because
                  quite frankly, I felt like he would just drive off before I can
                  fully get my heavy luggage out of the boot. So I thought if the
                  passenger door is opened, he canâ€™t drive off.</div>
                  <div>Then When I got my luggage out of the boot, instead of
                  shutting the boot and the passenger side door, I just felt like..
                  WTF, heâ€™s so rude to me, cheated me, I let him keep the change, and
                  yet he is still so hostile towards me. He can shut his own damn
                  doors.</div>
                  <div>So I just left.</div>
                  <div>As I got into the lift, I could hear him slamming the doors
                  shut.</div>
                  <div>I got home, and lodged a complaint with Transcab. The staff
                  said that I would get a response in 7 â€“ 1o days. Thatâ€™s a long
                  while. But I donâ€™t mind, as long as they really look into it and
                  not sweep it under the rug.</div>
                  <div>Iâ€™ve never been in such a hostile situation beforeâ€¦ but I wish
                  I had stood my ground sooner. I wish I had got out of the cab that
                  very moment when he scolded me with vulgarities instead of putting
                  up with that shit. Also, why am I such an idiot? I should have
                  asked him to verify the surchargeâ€¦. and made a fuss about it..
                  instead of letting him keep the change some more. I was just too
                  shocked and scared</div>
                  <div>Whatever, I hope I never see this asshole driver again.</div>

              <p>Last week, a friend of mine took my cab. He ask me how I feel about cashless payment and if I know how to operate.</p>
              <p>I told him actually I prefer cashless, money goes direct into my account, can use to pay stuff. He ask me if I am sure.</p>
              <p>I told him I am different from those uncle, told him this uncle here very tech savy. Always encouraging ppl to pay nets.</p>
              <p>Then he told me that he is in a mist of writing a complain letter to company. He said the week before, he took a cab home and ask the Comfort driver if he can pay by card as he run out of cash. Wah lao, he said the driver's mood 180degree changed and start scolding him from the start to the end of the trip.</p>
              <p>Anyway, why taxi driver like that? what's wrong with cashless payment? what's wrong with Pasir Ris? You want to queue at airport must play by the rules la, something u get Jurong West and smile all your way there, kanna Pasir Ris also must swee swee la. Be more professional. Uncle here kanna Crown Plaza also like that.  my first time there, need help from Poolman to lead me there but end up joining the T3 taxi queue. Takes alot of time and illegal turn before I can get out of it. Customer still happy and say thanks for fetching us, they can see my effort. I also thanks them for letting me learn this new route. </p>
              <p>Btw last night drop a pax at Conrad hotel and pick up another 2, ask to go Airport Hotel. Cool, I know the way cos I just learn it. Send them there smoothly without a need to ask them for instruction, something very rare of this new driver.</p>

              <p>Those who read my posts know I'm very pro TD. I dont like to
              question other driver methods, even if I disagree because I believe
              I'm not in a position to judge given I'm far from perfect
              either.</p>
              <p>But I cannot condone what this driver has done, if the
              allegations are true. There's no reason to take out your
              frustrations on a paying customer who has done nothing to incite
              you.</p>
              <p>You don't complain when kena JW Ext, so the same must go with
              Pasir Ris. You cannot always hope have your cake and eat it, even
              on days where you desperately need funds.</p>
              <p>Life doesn't work that way.</p>
