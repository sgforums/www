              <p>Learn the rational way to defence yourselves, don't expect CDG to be understanding.</p>
              <p>When paxs are abusive, even verbal abusive can kill, it is for the safty for both to reason it out with CDG.</p>
              <p>Pax begin abusive can be use to cover your action, and is difficult to proof......</p>
              <p>If the IO question and doubt about verbal abusive, demostrate it right in front of his face, with all his parents, wife, children and even himself, even thereafter, he still unable to get it, you still get to enjoy F ing them and give them a "good" time before leaving the company.</p>
              <p>Cabby are giving those IO a good time, cabby fear them, cabby beg them........ this leading those IO feeling important and begin lacking of compassionate.</p>

              <p><br>Actually, complaint is still subjective in a sense, cdg knows it, they take it as a pinch of salt if you have been a good driver for them, paid your rent on time, not often get into  accident of Own Fault and still argue with them insistently,</p>
              <p>Most of the time, it is those regularly get complained and prove to be true, then still keep telling lies,  accident issue arguement till bang table here and there, will easily get into termination.</p>
              <p>The rights to hirer a cab and return is the perogatives of a taxis driver</p>
              <p>The rights to terminate or rent you a taxis is the perogatives of the taxis company.</p>
              <p>To be fair, given no reason, cdg can terminate you without any reason, but then society do not work in a such a way, because if cdg or any other companies practice such thing, it will give the company a bad reputation. But then on the whole, they have the right to take back their cabs, as you also have to right to return their cabs and throw keys at them.</p>
