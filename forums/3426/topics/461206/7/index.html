              <p>Ya lor, old habits die hard. But so far so good, but I'm prepared for the consequences of my actions.</p>
              <p>But if I take call, then bo pian must take cashless.</p>
              <p>But why worry abt complaints, let the complaint come then I decide to comply, adjust or f care and wait for the red card.</p>
              <p>But of course I won't let a simple complaint jalan, must hv substance and will make a big issue if I feel the investigation is unfair or improperly done.</p>
              <p>But as you said once, best thing drive CDG is act blur. Kena complaint also act blur, say cannot see properly, got so many excuse to make.</p>
              <p>But to avoid complaint must kao tim with pax first, you must not give make excuse to complaint suka suka. You explain nicely and be reasonable no complaint will follow.</p>

              <p>Anyway fuck care CDG.</p>
              <p>The only reason I drive for them is the convenience - more
              hirers to choose from and I stay close to sin ming. And I like my 2
              current hirers - both very cincai and they are prepared to do the
              topping up and washing - saves a lot of hassle.</p>
              <p>But I was seriously thinking of going Beach Rd or switching - an
              option that is there.</p>

              possible 1 day either they will piss me off so much or I will fuck
              a pax good and proper that leads to a parting of ways.</p>
              <p>No Big deal. To borrow a phrase from the $7k driver - 'the taxi
              is a cash machine" not a 7k machine like his, all I need is a cab
              to drive to earn my salary, doesn't matter which company it belongs
              to.</p>
              <p>Got no cab or license then big problem, gotta become normal

              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Smoke in vehicle</p>
              <p>2) Wear slippers (unless drive morning - then must wear shoes)</p>
              <p>3) Refuse cards routinely</p>
              <p>4) Speed (sometimes)</p>
              <p>5) Interview</p>
              <p>6) Refuse calls (this not serious matter of choice)</p>
              <p>7) Ignore pax waving frantically</p>
              <p>8) Bypass taxi stand (of course I stay in lane 2, never in left most lane)</p>
              <p>9) F pax</p>
              <p>10) Chase pax from vehicle. (of course 9 &amp; 10 rare)</p>
              <p>So how long can i last? If open tote is this like Liverpool v Norwich? $ 1 pay $1.25?</p>

              <p>Yah, if use GPS use it like streetdirectory. Key in the location, then look at the destination, like how u see the streetdirectory.</p>
              <p>Roughly see where the place, then which road to turn in to that place. If still not familiar, look for landmark in your GPS like shopping center, bus interchange, MRT station, etc..</p>
              <p>Unless u like one TD i know Yew Tee MRT also don't know which part of Singapore, then problem liao.</p>
              <p>Don't like robot listen turn left turn right make u turn...</p>
              <p>If follow what the GPS say forever will not learn one...</p>
              <p>I use technology to make it faster, key in GPS find, see, go, Still listen on earpiece just in case, but i only listen when nearing destination.</p>
              <p>Streetdirectory still use also sometimes, Google map also use, the app Singapore Maps also use, but i don't use all at once ah. Just see see, cos my mind a bit slow..</p>
              <p>I can say newer generation of TD that always take MRT during their youth will have more problems with routes, cos most of the time underground, no landmark one, above ground also cant see road. Ask me take MRT i lost one, now with so many lines even worse. I young that time nothing to do like to take bus/cycle islandwide.The new generation army topo also use GPS, LoL..</p>
              <p>Best is listen to pax, pax always know many shortcuts, the shortcuts important, cut here cut there thru carpark, small back alley to avoid jams and traffic lights! Save a lot of time!</p>

                              <p>My update after coffee session with CDG.<br>
              <br>
              Went in earlier than appointment time. Thought can choose good
              coffee. No coffee at all. No drinks offered at all. Next time,
              bring your own drinks.<br>
              <br>
              Once in room, interviewer look at your records and tell you your
              offence. My offence was 3 complaints about wrong routes and one
              reckless driving. Ask me to explain.<br>
              <br>
              Wrong routes, I say I am new and need to use GPS. Their answer
              other new drivers got no complaint. You got 3 complaints within 3
              months.<br>
              <br>
              Reckless driving, I say I always within speed limit but may exceed
              speed without knowing. I speed only when road is empty. But I am
              not reckless. How can I be considered reckless with no accident.
              Answer I got was accidents can happen to fast and slow drivers. I
              kept quiet.<br>
              <br>
              Next, The Sentence. After reviewing my case, his senior decided my
              service is not suitable for Comfort image. Pre-prepared letter of
              termination was passed to me. He said he does not know it's
              contents but managed to tell me anyway. My CDG pass will expire in
              10 days. He said I can appeal but this was not stated in the
              letter. So I will not appeal.<br>
              <br>
              As far as I am concerned, case closed for me. I am not a good taxi
              driver. I will stop driving taxis. But I will never stop
              driving.<br>
              <br>
              Those thinking of joining CDG as new Taxi Drivers, be warned! 3
              complaints for wrong routes, within 3 months and you are out.</p>

              <p>Yah, if use GPS use it like streetdirectory. Key in the location, then look at the destination, like how u see the streetdirectory.</p>
              <p>Roughly see where the place, then which road to turn in to that place. If still not familiar, look for landmark in your GPS like shopping center, bus interchange, MRT station, etc..</p>
              <p>Unless u like one TD i know Yew Tee MRT also don't know which part of Singapore, then problem liao.</p>
              <p>Don't like robot listen turn left turn right make u turn...</p>
              <p>If follow what the GPS say forever will not learn one...</p>
              <p>I use technology to make it faster, key in GPS find, see, go, Still listen on earpiece just in case, but i only listen when nearing destination.</p>
              <p>Streetdirectory still use also sometimes, Google map also use, the app Singapore Maps also use, but i don't use all at once ah. Just see see, cos my mind a bit slow..</p>
              <p>I can say newer generation of TD that always take MRT during their youth will have more problems with routes, cos most of the time underground, no landmark one, above ground also cant see road. Ask me take MRT i lost one, now with so many lines even worse. I young that time nothing to do like to take bus/cycle islandwide.The new generation army topo also use GPS, LoL..</p>
              <p>Best is listen to pax, pax always know many shortcuts, the shortcuts important, cut here cut there thru carpark, small back alley to avoid jams and traffic lights! Save a lot of time!</p>

              <p>Ya lor, old habits die hard. But so far so good, but I'm
              prepared for the consequences of my actions.</p>
              <p>But if I take call, then bo pian must take cashless.</p>
              <p>But why worry abt complaints, let the complaint come then I
              decide to comply, adjust or f care and wait for the red card.</p>
              <p>But of course I won't let a simple complaint jalan, must hv
              substance and will make a big issue if I feel the investigation is
              unfair or improperly done.</p>
              <p>But as you said once, best thing drive CDG is act blur. Kena
              complaint also act blur, say cannot see properly, got so many
              excuse to make.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But to avoid complaint must kao tim with pax first</span>, you must not
              give make excuse to complaint suka suka. You explain nicely and be
              reasonable no complaint will follow.</p>
