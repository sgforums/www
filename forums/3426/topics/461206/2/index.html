              That.s why there taxi driver keep complain non stop.  In fact there are time we should ask yourself where there nonsense happen? We also sometime must do review on our part and see could it be our part that goes wrong.  if cannot take it or understand this trade. Then should think twice about driving and think of a better opportunity for the future.
              Lastly don.t challenge me to delete. Mention again i Will do so.

              <p>GPS is good to have but cannot 100% depend on GPS.</p>
              <p>I use it also, but mostly when me and pax don't know how to get
              there..</p>
              <p>The trick as a newbie like me is ask, ask, ask ..</p>
              <p>Like Pool said before in other thread, as a newbie, know the
              route also ask, don't know must ask.</p>
              <p>For example:</p>
              <p>Pax: Go Jln Kechubong</p>
              <p>You: Jln Kechubong, hmm.. Where is it near ah? <span style="color: #ff0000;">(1. If you don't know)</span></p>
              <p>You: Jln Kechubong, near Yio Chu Kang Rd ah? <span style="color: #ff0000;">(2. Roughly know)</span></p>
              <p>Normally pax will tell u near some major road, if still don't
              know, ask for a landmark.</p>
              <p>For this case pax might say near Yio Chu Kang.</p>
              <p>Yio Chu Kang very long, so ask pax again near Upp Thomson side
              or Serangoon.</p>
              <p>Pax will normally say near Jln Kayu.</p>
              <p>Still can ask its near Jln Kayu towards Hougang or towards
              AMK</p>
              <p>From there you should know roughly which route to take. Key in
              to your GPS also just in case.</p>
              <p>When u roughly know how to go, ask pax.. Wanna go by which way,
              if pax say anyway. Then say what u have in mind, let's say CTE-
              exit AMK ave 5.</p>
              <p>Then pax will say go CTE - exit YCK.</p>
              <p>Lets say exit CTE, GPS say turn right, just confirm again with
              pax, "I go right ah?"</p>
              <p>Normally if u ask a few times pax will know u new/not sure they
              guide u all the way.</p>
              <p>Near destination, GPS sure ask u turn left into Gerald Dr.</p>
              <p>Confirm with pax again, "i turn left at traffic light there
              ah?"</p>
              <p>From there must remember how to go already.. After pax alight,
              try to visualise the route you take. Then try see in GPS or street
              directory if got alternative route or if u come from other place
              how to go that same place.</p>
              <p>Important thing to note, be humble bro, especially with pax. See
              some of your post sometimes you the type easily get angry.</p>
              <p>If pax angry angry you go wrong way, do what TDVL instructor
              taught. Either give them discount or if see pax sure going to
              complain type. Just give free ride, free ride no receipt so
              unlikely pax complain.</p>
              <p>Got once i go wrong long way, pax also know..</p>
              <p>Pax still can say, "where the hell you going!"</p>
              <p>I also realise i went the longer route and apologise nicely</p>
              <p>End trip fare was something like $22.60, i say $20 will do since
              i went wrong way earlier.</p>
              <p>Pax gave me $25 ask me keep the change and ask me have a nice
              day!</p>
              <p>Yes Pool say correct to learn your route is by learning from
              pax. Pax stay that area, some stay there for many many year and
              some take cab daily. They know the route to where they going, u
              might only go there 1-2 times they might be taking taxi everyday
              for past 30yrs. After a few times, u surely see same pattern with
              other pax going same area. Most will take same route, different
              time of day sometimes different route. Cos pax know where will jam,
              where won't jam cos they always go that way.</p>
              <p>Reckless driving doesn't mean you speeding, it could be you keep
              looking at GPS while driving, or suddenly turn abruptly that made
              the pax say it's reckless...</p>

              Google maps not that good in Singapore. For instance if your search for Greenbank Park it will take you to somewhere in UK.
              
              Use Singapore Map app by Streetdirectory.com better for local streets, but no turn by turn navigation.

              actually driving taxi may not really need a GPS.... when i just started one year plus ago, told myself i must die die buy a GPS but till now never buy any...
                  
              i forced myself to learn the very hard way..  it wa  a costly but a fast learning prcoess.. cuz must give discount to pax when went the wrong way. at the same time, it also forced me to rememeber the route .
                  
              so for the first two mths, made mistakes here n there. bo bian. apologised to pax n move on..
                  
              during off shift.. while online reading forum,  also spent time reading maps on the estate.. conquered one by one... 
                   
              after driving abt one year plus, i think the best road directory is still the pax.... usually they will know the place well...it is common that brain dun work that well or choose to hang at the time when u trying to plot a path to destination especially after u drove for several hours
                  
              but if the pax unsure, i can use the MDT map function to find it... always work well for me... usually i locate the main road first, then slowly track down the small lanes...
                  
              i also driving comfort.. till now no complaints from pax.... i am not saying i am at the same class as some gurus here... i still do make occasional mistakes, the main thing is to be humble... just apologise, i think almost of all pax will be forgiving enuf to let it go.
                  
              but if u r the type that will get offended easily or will start to argue with pax whenever they confront you on the routes that you take, then it is akin to throw stones at your own feets...
                  
              Attitude matters most in our line of trade...

              <p>Yes Pool say correct to learn your route is by learning from
              pax. Pax stay that area, some stay there for many many year and
              some take cab daily. They know the route to where they going, u
              might only go there 1-2 times they might be taking taxi everyday
              for past 30yrs. After a few times, u surely see same pattern with
              other pax going same area. Most will take same route, different
              time of day sometimes different route. Cos pax know where will jam,
              where won't jam cos they always go that way.</p>

              <p>GPS is good to have but cannot 100% depend on GPS.</p>
              <p>I use it also, but mostly when me and pax don't know how to get
              there..</p>
              <p>The trick as a newbie like me is ask, ask, ask ..</p>
              <p>Like Pool said before in other thread, as a newbie, know the
              route also ask, don't know must ask.</p>
              <p>For example:</p>
              <p>Pax: Go Jln Kechubong</p>
              <p>You: Jln Kechubong, hmm.. Where is it near ah? <span style="color: #ff0000;">(1. If you don't know)</span></p>
              <p>You: Jln Kechubong, near Yio Chu Kang Rd ah? <span style="color: #ff0000;">(2. Roughly know)</span></p>
              <p>Normally pax will tell u near some major road, if still don't
              know, ask for a landmark.</p>
              <p>For this case pax might say near Yio Chu Kang.</p>
              <p>Yio Chu Kang very long, so ask pax again near Upp Thomson side
              or Serangoon.</p>
              <p>Pax will normally say near Jln Kayu.</p>
              <p>Still can ask its near Jln Kayu towards Hougang or towards
              AMK</p>
              <p>From there you should know roughly which route to take. Key in
              to your GPS also just in case.</p>
              <p>When u roughly know how to go, ask pax.. Wanna go by which way,
              if pax say anyway. Then say what u have in mind, let's say CTE-
              exit AMK ave 5.</p>
              <p>Then pax will say go CTE - exit YCK.</p>
              <p>Lets say exit CTE, GPS say turn right, just confirm again with
              pax, "I go right ah?"</p>
              <p>Normally if u ask a few times pax will know u new/not sure they
              guide u all the way.</p>
              <p>Near destination, GPS sure ask u turn left into Gerald Dr.</p>
              <p>Confirm with pax again, "i turn left at traffic light there
              ah?"</p>
              <p>From there must remember how to go already.. After pax alight,
              try to visualise the route you take. Then try see in GPS or street
              directory if got alternative route or if u come from other place
              how to go that same place.</p>
              <p>Important thing to note, be humble bro, especially with pax. See
              some of your post sometimes you the type easily get angry.</p>
              <p>If pax angry angry you go wrong way, do what TDVL instructor
              taught. Either give them discount or if see pax sure going to
              complain type. Just give free ride, free ride no receipt so
              unlikely pax complain.</p>
              <p>Got once i go wrong long way, pax also know..</p>
              <p>Pax still can say, "where the hell you going!"</p>
              <p>I also realise i went the longer route and apologise nicely</p>
              <p>End trip fare was something like $22.60, i say $20 will do since
              i went wrong way earlier.</p>
              <p>Pax gave me $25 ask me keep the change and ask me have a nice
              day!</p>
              <p>Yes Pool say correct to learn your route is by learning from
              pax. Pax stay that area, some stay there for many many year and

              time of day sometimes different route. Cos pax know where will jam,
              where won't jam cos they always go that way.</p>
              <p>Reckless driving doesn't mean you speeding, it could be you keep
              looking at GPS while driving, or suddenly turn abruptly that made
              the pax say it's reckless...</p>

              <p>Google GPS just gives shortest route. Usefull only to get an idea of overall route.</p>

              <p>Wrong assumption ....</p>
              <p>Pax treated all drivers like experience driver , cos they dunno
              , and they expect all taxi drivers are the same like our level
              .</p>

              <p>Best part, CDG agree with pax and think all drivers same level.</p>
              <p>When pax enter, I always ask if they know the route. If not, I must use GPS because I don't know how to go.</p>

              bro, not sure u have been driving how long.. if you keep kenna warning letters or free kopi, somewhere must be wrong with ur style of driving, ur handling of pax and lastly the most important.... YOU.......           
                  
              you need to reflect on what you had done. ie why paxs complain, whats wrong.... if u keep thinking its all pax problems and not yours... hmmm then soon u will have to find another taxi company liao......
              
              other taxi kakis have already proven that it is possible to drive ten over year without getting a single official complaint from pax............        
                      
              you can do it if you wanna put ur mind to do so.
