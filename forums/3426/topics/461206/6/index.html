              <p>Yes , avoid termination , but stern warning for wearing  sandals , even with a valid reason .</p>

              <p>So best is to fuck care them and drive others. Like that you

              <p>Ah pek, I am a new driver and I quit driving taxis. I am not going to see any MPs' on Deepavalli because there are none available. All celebrate it.</p>
              <p>CDG must take care of the old and experienced drivers. If they die, they will have lots of GPS using drivers.</p>

              <p>I got a friend 56 years old just got license. He also dunno routes, pri 6 education.</p>
              <p>Got so many old drivers on the road with pax with the latest gadgets, how come no issues, when they dont know the way?</p>
              <p>It's all a question of how you deal with the pax. If the pax got google maps then ask him to guide. Pax wanna go any way, let them.</p>
              <p>Yesterday I had a pax wanted to go Pasir Ris St 51, which I would go via Bedok Res, Ave 10 and Ave 9, the route the pax wanted.</p>
              <p>For the fun of it, keyed into the GPS and surprise surprise the GPS gave a completely different and longer route.</p>
              <p>So why depend on GPS? The pax is the best choice to choose the route because he's paying.</p>
              <p>If the pax dunno and you not sure, then it's how you talk to them and explain.</p>
              <p>But if you choose to go your own way or the GPS route without given clarifying with them, then whose fault is it?</p>
              <p>You can deny, refuse to accept the blame or make excuses and blame the pax or gadgets, and yes sometimes some pax are demanding and dont deserve sympathy.</p>
              <p>If you let your pride or your refusal to ask get in the way, then the next complaint is not very far away and this problem will always keep surtacing.</p>
              <p>The question is how to resolve the problem and the first question is always to ask, how or what could I have done to improve and solve this.</p>
              <p>Making excuses for your mistake, I'm afraid leads no where. Change and improvement must always start with self.</p>

              <p>perhaps there were some other factors that they decided to terminate you ...</p>
              <p>maybe your attitude towards customers ?</p>
              <p>maybe u insist your world class GPS never goes wrong ?</p>
              <p>maybe u rude , stubborn that the way u took is 100% right ?</p>
              <p>there could be other factors ..... only u and those complainants know ....</p>
              <p>For CDG , customers comes first .... the rest secondary .</p>
              <p>So once u adept to that motto of customers comes first , perhaps more tolerance being lan lan , maybe u can continue to drive for them .</p>
