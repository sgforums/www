              <p>That is no excuse. Consider it lucky that pax only complain to CDG. If this was a complaint to LTA, you could easily be hauled to court.</p>
              <p>There was this case where a Merc driver drove 'recklessly' according to woman pax who complained to LTA. He wasn't accused of a longer route (from Marine Parade to Shenton Way - straight forward ECP, exit Rochor etc). Instead he was accused of speeding and being reckless.</p>
              <p>The woman complained of motion sickness because of the ride and went to see a doctor. Later complained to LTA. Merc driver charged in court.</p>
              <p>His defense like yours , never speed only go maximum 100kmh along expressway - also mentioned unwritten rule, TP normally don't summon for people who go above 10 - 15kmh.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately judge didnt buy the story, said the law says 90kmh, why go at 100kmh?</p>
              <p>He got fined over $1000 and obviously license was suspended, forget whether revoked  or not.</p>
              <p>So going at 110kmh is not a good idea or excess on normal roads.</p>
              <p>Of course, nobody drives at 60kmh on normal roads and 90kmh on expressways all the time. I have even driven pax at 130kmh - sometimes just got itch to speed, but why no complaints?</p>
              <p>Because you must see your pax la, if woman, old people, executive types, pregnant, thise with kids or babies, definitely they don't appreciate speeding, even 90kmh might also be too much, they would rather you drive 70-80kmh on expressways.</p>
              <p>If youngsters, then speeding they dont care, some may even encourage.</p>
              <p>As far as CDG goes, driving for this company comes with the baggage - they are pro-themselves and and pro-pax above drivers.</p>
              <p>Now they have a lot of drivers and not enough cabs, so they can be even more yaya.</p>
              <p>My hirer's friend's relief got terminated because of speeding. They issued him a warning letter for speeding and later he again did it, and that was that - termination. Dunno if pax complained or they retrieved it from MDT.</p>
              <p>Simple rule is once you get your warning letter the first time, standard one they will pay attention to you. They can't go around monitoring all 15-16k drivers, just a few who were warned.</p>
              <p>As for routes, again this over and over again has been mentioned ask, explain and advise pax - sorry i am new, I really dunno how to go, if you can show me, then we can proceed, if you not sure, maybe you take another cab.</p>
              <p>GPS works 2 or maybe 3 ways - I know of - shortest route (via normal roads but journey time will be longer, and fare usually lesser) or faster (highways usually), time shorter but fares usually more. Over dependence on them will lead to some problems sometimes.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, we also gotta be fair to pax, we are also pax sometimes - why should a person pay more for the same kind of service he takes everyday (barring traffic jams etc)? Who would like to pay $12 when he normally pays only $10, and this extra comes because of the driver being unsure? </p>
              <p>I mean this is not like driving our own car and ferrying our friends or family, like that we can go any old way, make mistake also never mind. Here we are providing a service, we gotta do our part to be fair to the person paying.</p>
              <p>My own rule is very simple, if the mistake is mine, I auto deduct from the fare, if the mistake is from the pax - wanted to go a certain way - end up jam or whatever, then that one usually expect full payment unless I really kasihan the pax.</p>
              <p>There is a grave possibilty tht CDG might terminate you or give you a last warning.</p>
              <p>It's no big deal, let it be a lesson and in the meantime, start saving for deposit to drive another company.</p>

              friends or family, like that we can go any old way, make mistake
              also never mind. Here we are providing a service, we gotta do our
              part to be fair to the person paying.</p>
              <p>My own rule is very simple, if the mistake is mine, I auto
              deduct from the fare, if the mistake is from the pax - wanted to go
              a certain way - end up jam or whatever, then that one usually
              expect full payment unless I really kasihan the pax.</p>
              <p>There is a grave possibilty tht CDG might terminate you or give
              you a last warning.</p>
              <p>It's no big deal, let it be a lesson and in the meantime, start
              saving for deposit to drive another company.</p>

              <p>CDG, Pax also accuse you of being reckless.</p>

              <p><br>There is no such thing as agreement that pax can ask you go faster over the limitation of the speed indicated on the road, just follow the speed limit, nothing will go wrong, meter goes by distance, not by time.</p>
              <p>If paxs want me to go faster above the specified limit, I can tell them to take another cab nicely, this is the usual case on those mon to fri morning, those late ones will alway pressure you with make up reason, Uncle, I need to go tai seng, I am late for a meeting, please hurry,</p>
              <p>I will tell him/her, I can only travel within what I deem possible, if you really want a fast one, please take other cab, thank you.</p>
              <p>What meeting?? late means late lor, if not late, you think you take cab ar? never let pax pressure you, drive at your own time, own target within the rules of the road, but of course dun drive like 40 to 50km/h lah.</p>

              Why are you giving other td warning advise ISO giving it to yourself?
              
               From the past thread and post, many snr had already explain about a td job what it is like and expect and how to counter it, only that you did not take it and master it.
              
               I give example, if my pax say need to rush, must reach by certain time, my answer is i try my best,. when i try my best, it does not mean i must speed and drive recklessly.
              
              Once a pax ask me if can alight opp site of the taxi stand at robinson road, i say yes, but the fare would be $130 plus meter. she ask why i say bus lane and i could be fine if being caught, but if i did not receive summon for the next 6mths, she can claim back the money from me.
              
              But not all the pax i answer this way, some i would just explain, i repeat,explain to pax about the rule we td must follow, simple as that. So today you are taxi uncle A very polite , tommorrow you may be uncle B very cold blooded type. this is the real world. wake up.

              explain about a td job what it is like and expect and how to
              counter it, only that you did not take it and master it. I give
              example, if my pax say need to rush, must reach by certain time, my
              answer is i try my best,. when i try my best, it does not mean i
              must speed and drive recklessly. Once a pax ask me if can alight
              opp site of the taxi stand at robinson road, i say yes, but the
              fare would be $130 plus meter. she ask why i say bus lane and i
              could be fine if being caught, but if i did not receive summon for
              the next 6mths, she can claim back the money from me. But not all
              the pax i answer this way, some i would just explain, i
              repeat,explain to pax about the rule we td must follow, simple as
              that. So today you are taxi uncle A very polite , tommorrow you may
              be uncle B very cold blooded type. this is the real world. wake
              up</p>

              PS2U is day or nite shift? i drive day shift all this while go wrong or long routes duno how many times but never get fucked leh.. i have thot abt this issue and most comfort drivers are getting fucked, the reason i can think of is that the paxs are of the opinion that drivers tat able to drive comfort cabs are well trained and thus going wrong or long routes must be on purpose.. 
                      drive taxis dun talk what ego, what principle lah.. wrong just say sorry give discount lor.. end of day, got money in pocket more important.. i even got once go in erp unnessarily cos miss the exit, tell pax i will absorb the erp, end trip, pax pay me the erp plus tips cos he say i very honest.. lol..
