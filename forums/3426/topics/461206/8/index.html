              PS2U,
              
              if you are leaving this trade, all the best for your future
              
              but if you still want to continne, please change your mindset, attitude, accept mistake make by you, less kpkb, learn from your mistake, learn from advise then you will do better.
              
              As what you describe, you kena call up, they want to see how you response towards your mistake,  your reply to them give them the decision to let you go .
              
              This is CDG style of running their operation, they have guideline to follow also though i don't quite agree 100% .
              
              in my earlier reply, i have mentioned , you continue to react this way, terminate is what you will be expecting,
              
              Driving for other taxi company is another matter even they are not as stict as CDG, but remember, there is still LTA which complaint may go direct to them instead to the taxi coy.
              
              So learn or not again it's your choice

              <p>Wow! Thanks for the long reply. I have no wounds for you to rub
              salt in and this post hurts me. Thanks for considering my feelings
              while posting, but as long as it helps other members in this forum,
              I am cool with that.</p>
              <p>One question, In have for you. Experienced Ah pek, Ahmad and
              Rajah started driving when? During Yellow Top Taxi days is it? How
              you get your experience? Those days got GPS ah! Nowdays got GPS. I
              use it and got termjinated.</p>
              <p>I got farked by Pool for using GPS. I have no choice. I can
              always park one side with meter running and look at street
              directory. That was what happened when I was a passenger years ago.
              Did I complain? No.</p>
              <p>You should thank your lucky stars that you started driving taxis
              when there was no GPS. Thus no complaints. Nowdays you drive, pax
              using GPS to make sure you take correct route.</p>
              <p>Enjoy your holidays Ah Pek.</p>

              <p>You know the saying "Last time Policeman wear shorts" </p>
              <p>Last time:</p>
              <p>1.   Pax not Complain King/Queen, unlike today.</p>
              <p>2.   Singapore Roads not so complicated.</p>
              <p>3.   You own your own Taxi, got no 'Complaint Department.' Complaint procedures not so simple.</p>
              <p>4.   Taxi company not so 'Corporate', not so Ya Ya.</p>
              <p>5.   The general public is not so educated.</p>
              <p>6.   Pax are more accomodating (most important factor)</p>
              <p>7.   etc....</p>
              <p>So the learning curve is longer.</p>
              <p>Today, you need to be on par with other drivers when you start, otherwise kena criticised "dunno then why drive Taxi"</p>
              <p>But,.. I realised that almost, almost all the paxes are forgiving, if you sound out to them you are new and need guidance. They somehow put down their attacks and become more forgiving.</p>
              <p>Forgive me if I am wrong, I believe you gave the impression that you know the way, but actually you dont know.</p>
              <p>By the way, JoeRaj is Rajah, not Ah Pek...</p>

              <p>Immediately, I apologised that I missed a turn and will turn back at Moulmein.</p>

              <p>End up he gave me 20 cents tip.</p>
              <p>I attribute it to..</p>
              <p>1.   Honesty, that I missed a turn. (dont let him wonder why)</p>
              <p>2.   Resourceful, told him that I will turn back at Moulmein.</p>
              <p>3.   Admit mistake and gave discount.</p>
              <p>Regarding the missed truning. He said, "sometimes it happen".</p>

              yourself and happy driving on the road. Invest some time to learn

              My personal thinking that the change the heading is wrong.
              
              it should not be about termination of a cdg driver.
              
              it should be about new taxi driver quitting  driving

              <p>How I responded was, stop meter, MDT says the fare amout, pax pays it. There is no argument or discussion at all. Pax pays it and goes off.</p>
              <p>Few days later I get call from CDG asking you remember this and that at this day and time.I huh!!</p>
              <p>Sometimes the call comes when I am sleeping, so my answer is arrrghphuiiii! knooorrrrkkkkkggggg. So CDG ask me to go down and drink coffee. I went down and there was no coffee.</p>
              <p>If I make mistake, I will offer discount. But if pax give poor directions like tell me keep right and then turn left when I am on lane 1, how??</p>
              <p>I have already thought about it. My conclusion is CDG only wants experienced drivers to maintain their image. But in-experienced drivers who they terminated earlier, got their experience from other companies. Would these drivers want to go back to CDG? PHUIIIII!</p>

              <p>Taxi if get terminated, can just jump to other company next day as long as your TDVL never revoked.</p>
              <p>Other business if u get closed down when people complain unethical, or some other reasons, not that easy to just close and open new company/business.</p>
              <p>U open shop sell food, people complain also the place u rent the stall also can close down your stall, if people complain unhygenic licence also get revoked. Its about the same in any business actually.</p>
              <p>U open shop in airport even worse, every shop there airport monitor their sales, how much they make also they know. They see your shop not making much sales, close shop!</p>
              <p>And airport not the only place there are some shopping center also doing same thing, some even worse, see sales good rental increase next year.</p>
