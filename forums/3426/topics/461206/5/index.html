              <p>Relax bro. At least this forum allows us to voice out what happened. Other than that, what voice we have? After the 7k taxi driver news, most pax are suspicious when taxi drivers say they are new. They immediately come out with their Google maps on smart phone and try direct us. They think by taking them longer route, we can earn 5k at least.</p>
              <p>I have received some good advise and help from some in this forum. That is all I have. I appreciate it. My taxi driving days are over. No need to say this company that company. All companies the same. Taxi driving is just a job. It is not a business.</p>

              <p>But this is just advice.</p>
              <p>You are indeed luckier than others, many just got 2 warning letters and terminated and some not even complaints by pax - my hirer's friend got terminated because of warning of speeding taken from MDT.</p>
              <p>Here you got 3, in fact after receiving 1, you should have been more cautious and realised the posibility of termination.</p>
              <p>But what I feel is wrong here is your attitude towards these matters. Instead of raising your hands and saying yes, I am wrong and will try to improve or change, you instead insist you're innocent, treated unfairly or try to pin the blame on everything but yourself. I am not just refering to today but just the way you post and explain some of your issues.</p>
              <p>I mean just look at some of your answers - you exaggerate the scale of the issue.</p>
              <p>The other day you compared the policy of being charged in court for dangerous driving to molest. Today, just because CDG terminate you - you straight away said you not a good driver and wanna quit driving.</p>
              <p>Why CDG so big ah, they terminate means cannot drive cab? CDG not the authority, LTA is. CDG care for their image or whatever reason, so what?</p>
              <p>You know how many thousands CDG have terminated and still driving today? Drive for them when demand for cabs by hirers is high is always like this, they will be very yaya.</p>
              <p>But their are so many other cabs and companies out there that do not follow this method by CDG. You deffo can try them out.</p>
              <p>Or instead of driving for a company why don't you try Beach Road Taxis? When you get your 1k back, go pay the $80+ for the pass at premier and drive Beach Rd. Free and easy, at your own time and own target.</p>
              <p>Nobody gonna complain you unless you abuse pax and speed excessively. That too will only be investigated by LTA. And LTA investigation not like CDG one, has to be a formal complaint, the complainant will hv to come down Sin Ming and give statement. Must hv susbstance.</p>
              <p>Unless you do something very serious, very few pax actually will go all the way or LTA will not go all out.</p>
              <p>So don't worry abt CDG, go and enjoy your Deepavalli, let the 10 days pass, in the eman time scour around for which other company or cab, but most of all reflect on what you did and how to avoid a repeat.</p>
              <p>Sorry if this post hurts you, but I hope you can take heart and make it.</p>
              <p>Remember if Ah pek, Ahmad and Rajah without proper schooling can make it, why you can't? They cannot speak proper English, some newbies struggle with routes too but all still can make it, why you you cannot?</p>

              <p>Relax bro. At least this forum allows us to voice out what
              happened. Other than that, what voice we have? After the 7k taxi
              driver news, most pax are suspicious when taxi drivers say they are
              new. They immediately come out with their Google maps on smart
              phone and try direct us. They think by taking them longer route, we
              can earn 5k at least.</p>
              <p>I have received some good advise and help from some in this
              forum. That is all I have. I appreciate it. My taxi driving days
              are over. No need to say this company that company. All companies
              the same. Taxi driving is just a job. It is not a business.</p>

              <p>Sure can make an issue.</p>
              <p>But in the long run I think CDG is not suitable for you, even if your appeal successful, you will put yourself into more stress driving with a warning over your head.</p>
              <p>So best is to fuck care them and drive others. Like that you start afresh without any pressure.</p>

              <p>Wow! Thanks for the long reply. I have no wounds for you to rub salt in and this post hurts me. Thanks for considering my feelings while posting, but as long as it helps other members in this forum, I am cool with that.</p>
              <p>One question, In have for you. Experienced Ah pek, Ahmad and Rajah started driving when? During Yellow Top Taxi days is it? How you get your experience? Those days got GPS ah! Nowdays got GPS. I use it and got termjinated.</p>
              <p>I got farked by Pool for using GPS. I have no choice. I can always park one side with meter running and look at street directory. That was what happened when I was a passenger years ago. Did I complain? No.</p>
              <p>You should thank your lucky stars that you started driving taxis when there was no GPS. Thus no complaints. Nowdays you drive, pax using GPS to make sure you take correct route.</p>
              <p>Enjoy your holidays Ah Pek.</p>
