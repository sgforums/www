              <p>Have to admit,.I suck at routes. I depend on GPS as a taxi driver.But what is the problem of passengers giving clear directions.</p>
              <p>Latest complain was about me taking long route on purpose! because passenger directed me to the correct route. PLUS! I was a Reckless Driver.</p>

              <p>I never exceed more than 10 or 15 kmph above speed limit. GPS always shows the speed limit. I go reckless above 15 kmph.</p>

              <p>GPS is good to have but cannot 100% depend on GPS.</p>
              <p>I use it also, but mostly when me and pax don't know how to get there..</p>
              <p>The trick as a newbie like me is ask, ask, ask ..</p>
              <p>Like Pool said before in other thread, as a newbie, know the route also ask, don't know must ask.</p>
              <p>For example:</p>
              <p>Pax: Go Jln Kechubong</p>
              <p>You: Jln Kechubong, hmm.. Where is it near ah? <span style="color: #ff0000;">(1. If you don't know)</span></p>
              <p>You: Jln Kechubong, near Yio Chu Kang Rd ah? <span style="color: #ff0000;">(2. Roughly know)</span></p>
              <p>Normally pax will tell u near some major road, if still don't know, ask for a landmark.</p>
              <p>For this case pax might say near Yio Chu Kang.</p>
              <p>Yio Chu Kang very long, so ask pax again near Upp Thomson side or Serangoon.</p>
              <p>Pax will normally say near Jln Kayu.</p>
              <p>Still can ask its near Jln Kayu towards Hougang or towards AMK</p>
              <p>From there you should know roughly which route to take. Key in to your GPS also just in case.</p>
              <p>When u roughly know how to go, ask pax.. Wanna go by which way, if pax say anyway. Then say what u have in mind, let's say CTE- exit AMK ave 5.</p>
              <p>Then pax will say go CTE - exit YCK.</p>
              <p>Lets say exit CTE, GPS say turn right, just confirm again with pax, "I go right ah?"</p>
              <p>Normally if u ask a few times pax will know u new/not sure they guide u all the way.</p>
              <p>Near destination, GPS sure ask u turn left into Gerald Dr.</p>
              <p>Confirm with pax again, "i turn left at traffic light there ah?"</p>
              <p>From there must remember how to go already.. After pax alight, try to visualise the route you take. Then try see in GPS or street directory if got alternative route or if u come from other place how to go that same place.</p>
              <p>Important thing to note, be humble bro, especially with pax. See some of your post sometimes you the type easily get angry.</p>
              <p>If pax angry angry you go wrong way, do what TDVL instructor taught. Either give them discount or if see pax sure going to complain type. Just give free ride, free ride no receipt so unlikely pax complain.</p>
              <p>Got once i go wrong long way, pax also know..</p>
              <p>Pax still can say, "where the hell you going!"</p>
              <p>I also realise i went the longer route and apologise nicely</p>
              <p>End trip fare was something like $22.60, i say $20 will do since i went wrong way earlier.</p>
              <p>Pax gave me $25 ask me keep the change and ask me have a nice day!</p>
              <p>Yes Pool say correct to learn your route is by learning from pax. Pax stay that area, some stay there for many many year and some take cab daily. They know the route to where they going, u might only go there 1-2 times they might be taking taxi everyday for past 30yrs. After a few times, u surely see same pattern with other pax going same area. Most will take same route, different time of day sometimes different route. Cos pax know where will jam, where won't jam cos they always go that way.</p>
              <p>Reckless driving doesn't mean you speeding, it could be you keep looking at GPS while driving, or suddenly turn abruptly that made the pax say it's reckless...</p>

              YOu better start learning.  You are being risk of getting yourself terminated. 
                  Keep cool. And see what you need to adjust yourself and happy driving on the road. Invest some time to learn from old bird. Where you can learn our makan session is one of it.  . For me to say.

              <p>The taxi fares these days arent exactly cheap and with a few freaking cannonballs who come out in the press and talk abt 6k 7k income , expect passengers to be less forgiving.</p>
              <p>Its going to be a war zone out there , pax will be calling for blood at the very slightest mistake made by TD.</p>
              <p>Good news for me coz this will help get rid of the mickey mouses and cowboys.</p>

              <p>If you have the experiences or concepts that most paxs are lan chiao type, then, pardon me, I also dunno why you end up driving taxis, should quit, what for serve all these lan chiao and chee bxx peoples right? Go back to daily job, at least the lan chiao person is only your supervisor.</p>
              <p>Taxis driver got different roles, your personalities can be those Gangnam or garang type, but once inside your cab plying your trade, you need to be humble and know your roles, be professional of what you are doing as a living. Human relationship cannot go without proper communication, and for good communicaiton to go thru, both must understand and agree on the issue, not that you said, OH, I told pax already, but did pax acknowledge?? Communication is a 2 ways process, for a person who is poor in communication, the basic training will be, learn to be a good listener first.</p>
