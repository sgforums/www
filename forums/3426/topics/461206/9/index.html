              <p><br> Even before you join CDG, their drivers already face such problem. I'm sure you read before here, it's CDG style. They got too many drivers waiting in line, even if you tell all your story to them that also won't bother.
                      Those join TC or other company also many got boot from CDG. Sometimes I hear their story when I go servicing also scared.
                      Night actually not that bad, cos usually send back to housing estate, those in morning going to work and late are worse, everything you do also wrong.</p>
              <p>Night pax that tend to give problems are drunk, those seldom complain actually. Those like complain is those between 5-8pm, cos usually they bad mood cos wait 30-45min for cab.</p>
              <p>Ladies standard ah, time of the month mood swing one, those middle age (30s-50s) ladies also complain queen, purposely wanna find trouble one.</p>

              <p>If i were you i'd give myself another chance and join another company. Its not like CDG only company out there, and i think u still within 6months since u got TDVL still can get back the TDVL course fee if u join other company.</p>
              <p>But if u think only with CDG u can survive as a TD, because of their calls and popularity, then i wish u all the best in whatever u do.</p>

              <p>Like JW st.81, many younger locals prefer exit Pioneer North,

              generation like to exit Corporation Road then go by st.71.</p>

              <p>No, I dun think taxi driving is stressful. On the contrary, I find it a tedious, boring thing to do with NO challenges!</p>
              <p>What so difficult, driving from pt a to b? If any tom dick and harry can do it, why can't you??</p>
              <p>There are only 3 things you need as a TD:</p>
              <p>1. Routes knowledge (so hv to be humble till you master them)</p>
              <p>2. Safe driving (always safety first and you'll always be right, not wrong)</p>
              <p>2. Ego control (rein in yr ego, keep quiet even if you are angry. Unless pax is so unreasonable but then always remember you are 100% accountable for yr actions as a TD).</p>
              <p>I had been in the SAF, taken orders and later giving out orders, slapping and kicking juniors/subordinates around, commenting, criticising and correcting mistakes in both military and later civilian business (family biz) and jobs.</p>
              <p>Imagine the culture shock I encountered when I had to start driving taxi. For a few dollars, turn left, right, straight all the way, then halfway...stopppppppp!!</p>
              <p>So I think you hv to come to terms with yr own ego. Taxi driving is yr own business but with the corresponding terms and conditions.</p>

              <p>So different ppl have different mindsets when driving...some drives cause of financial requirment ...some drive but never check EGO always think they are correct and keep saying others are worng...some drive with low expectations that is as long get 50 bucks ok liao..so many td with different views on how they want to drive or expect from driving their taxis....but one thing for sure all wanna get as high cash as possible in the least amount of time or work...</p>

              <p>No, I dun think taxi driving is stressful. On the contrary, I
              find it a tedious, boring thing to do with NO challenges!</p>
              <p>What so difficult, driving from pt a to b? If any tom dick and
              harry can do it, why can't you??</p>
              <p>There are only 3 things you need as a TD:</p>
              <p>1. Routes knowledge (so hv to be humble till you master
              them)</p>
              <p>2. Safe driving (always safety first and you'll always be right,
              not wrong)</p>
              <p>2. Ego control (rein in yr ego, keep quiet even if you are
              angry. Unless pax is so unreasonable but then always remember you
              are 100% accountable for yr actions as a TD).</p>
              <p>I had been in the SAF, taken orders and later giving out orders,
              slapping and kicking juniors/subordinates around, commenting,
              criticising and correcting mistakes in both military and later
              civilian business (family biz) and jobs.</p>
              <p>Imagine the culture shock I encountered when I had to start
              driving taxi. For a few dollars, turn left, right, straight all the
              way, then halfway...stopppppppp!!</p>
              <p>So I think you hv to come to terms with yr own ego. Taxi driving
              is yr own business but with the corresponding terms and
              conditions.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Most important knowledge for taxi drivers is route knowledge. Most experienced taxi drivers have GPS implanted in their brain. Pool is one of them.</p>
              <p>I have poor route knowledge. I must use GPS. There were occasions when I even never collect anything because I cannot send pax to their destination.</p>
              <p>Taxi driving is stressfull if you are in my shoes. I had no culture shock collecting few dollars for a few turns. I left my ego at home when I was driving taxi. Problem starts when I pick up customers with ego.</p>
              <p>So you are suggesting that CDG was right in terminating me for taking the wrong routes based on passenger complaints!</p>

              <p>cdg taxi is highly in demand?</p>
              <p>latest news, 40+ units of Merc had returned, inclusive 8 units of new Merc........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Taxi driving had been tough ever since the restructure of fares, commuters behavior change, empty Taxi had been increase on the road, waiting time is getting longer, and LTA is still increasing the Taxi population..............</p>
              <p>Yes, we still have some great time, but it unable to offset the damage on off peak........ cdg will soon require FT to be in the picture.</p>
              <p>The $7000 recruitment excercise is here for a reason.... standby with pop corn and coke for the show to begin.</p>
