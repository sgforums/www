              <p>Go buy Mighty Minds Street Directory. Inside got one CD rom. Install it on your PC. Just click on the short-cut and you can see all the roads and buildings in Singapore. This was how I learn before I got a GPS.Everyday after work go home and look thru where you travel that day.</p>
              <p>My Gps is for me to look for short-cuts. Seldom use, just to pai swee and also to let pax know "New driver". Most of the time I very lazy to think. "sorry, which way u like to go" unless they give me a route sure jam, only then will I suggest another route.</p>

              <p>Bro, not all calls have to take...when I 1st started also eager to take call...but kenna a few $&amp;#$(^ one...I aso wonder wtf I took the call...curse and swear while on the way..but as what the seniors said...if you want to take call...must be ready to have "no show" or "call canceled" while you are on the way.</p>
              <p>how long you drove? if not feeling well..don't push it too hard for safety reason...slowly your body can adjust after getting used after a while..</p>

              <p>Actually 11:55pm esp on weekdays is very good to take if in town because of the $3 - the starting fare is $3.20 + $3.80 (more depending on type of cab) = $7. If at 12mn it is only $3.20 + $1.60 = $4.80.</p>
              <p>So between 11;55 to 12mn, can take.</p>
              <p>But other than that as mentioned let go, CDG calls all usually lousy one. Decline decline decline until you get one that's within distance and practical.</p>

              <p>Play with the 'Busy' button. When in a traffic jam or in the city, put on Busy. Rooftop still 'TAXI' but no incoming Current Jobs.</p>
              <p>Learn how to sweep, that way you do not depend on their Current Bookings.</p>
              <p>Else you learn from Chief, how to maximise. But better to have some Road experience before using their methods.</p>

              <p>Hi all, I just started TD as a super reilef . First day I kena 4 current booking one after another with only 2 mins idle. The most scariest one was I was at comfort transport sim Ming , I got booking at mayflower garden. How come so far I still get this booking?! I reach there around 14 mins due to road works. Lucky pax still there. Then I kena one booking when I turn in to cte , how to take ?! Sway I one booking rejected in my first day. Call mdt hotline very busy. What else I can do? Also is it normal for first day TD to feel very giddy after end driving for the day?</p>

              <p><br>This one u hv to ask our Hammerhammer, he likes the ting ting type, ting until ting tong, so if keep taking calls, no sooner, you become a ting tong on the road, you will be at the mercy of cdg call centres, no more yourself.</p>
              <p>You can forgo those call, knn, when I drove for Cdg, get many suspension for 1 hr into scheme B, I also heck care, off the volume, sat and sun, take call kamlan? let them make you a servant or maid of taxi companies only. Only if gum gum the calls is right infront within 3 minutes, then take it, so far take for fark? and you know why you get calls so far away, because all other cdg lau kwees fark care them.</p>
              <p>$104 on a SAT? sorry, but you can get much lower price lah</p>

Go back tell the hirer, hey, market rate is for newer cab maybe 90 ok lah, after 2 years, 80, not happy, dun drive for him lor, so many looking for sat and sun relief, this type of hirer, haiz. But nevermind learn from mistake, and when you next time become hirer, please dun chop you relief ok.</p>
