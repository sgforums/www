              <p>Hi, all expert/senior from here. I am considering TD, but got the following question hope to be advised. Thank you.</p>
              <p>1) Biggest drawback/concern is unfamiliar with Singapore roads/landmark. Any advice for this?</p>
              <p>2)  From 1), if considering getting GPS for a start any brand and model to recommend?</p>
              <p>3) Does MDT have GPS capability? Which Taxi companies MDT have it?</p>
              <p>4) Which Taxi company to join as a relief for a beginner and why?</p>
              <p>5) Any link or any ex-topic on the pro &amp; con in joining each Taxi companies as relief?</p>
              <p>6) What is the common timing (given by hirer) as relief TD?</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              <p>Thanks. This is gd sharing. Can share which model of garmin GPS u got and what is the damage?</p>
              <p>For common timing, my understanding from reading online is most hirer prefers to drive in the day and give night timing for relief?</p>
              <p>You have drive 2 wks &amp; how is your driving pattern? You mostly CBD type, sweeping type or airport/hotel type?</p>

              <p>He uses GPS, maybe he never mention much in the blog. Anyway my opinion on GPS is that it is not really useful. When I first start, die die must invest in GPS cos new ma sure lots of routes unsure. Then hor after OTR liao, realize not really useful la cos it confirm take longer routes unless straightforward place la. Also with updated maps, a lot of place can't find leh. Somemore mine is the supposedly better garmin brand one lol. So nowadays I don't really use liao except glance sometimes to see the next three expressway exits. </p>
              <p>Best way to learn routes is by remembering road names and landmarks imo. And that will come on the job, from your pax guiding and u memorizing etc. If kana destinations u dunno and pax also dunno, then just tell pax better take behind cab, dun later misunderstanding. Anyway like that maxi driver say, many pax flagging for cab no downtime one lol</p>

              <p>If unfamiliar with certain town/neighbourhood PrOfAtSiR style good!</p>
              <p>Go shopping mall pick up pax, most of the time with shopping bag sure nearby. Yes make less, but have to sacrifice the money during learning stage. Roughly master one neighbourhood move to next one u not familiar with.</p>
              <p>For me, first 2 months, difficult part is CBD area most of the streets ok, but so many building names and can't just drop off pax anyhow. Must learn which is Taxi Stand which is Taxi Stop. Also must learn not only shorttest route in CBD, but cheapest route the least number of ERP gantry.</p>
              <p>GPS in CBD can say most of the time pointless, so many tall buildings, sometimes GPS also lost. LoL.</p>
              <p>Peak hour pax, especially morning, don't really like new(blur blur) driver. Cos usually people who take cab in morning rushing to work. So chances of getting pax scolding you during learning stage very high during those hours. All this have to face, never face never learn. </p>
              <p>The average $2k-3k per month actual fact only about half, cos medical expenses all on your own, sick no income rental still goes on. Need a lot of discipline, when you your own boss, high tendency wake up late, go home early, idle, shopping, </p>
