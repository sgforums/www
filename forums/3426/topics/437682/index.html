              Hi everyone,
              
              Had been awhile since I logged in.
              
              Thanks bro poolman for introducing his friends for me to take over this wish for 10 days.
              
              Today the wish went dead on terminal 1 and therefore now writing here on my iPhone while waiting for the cab to be repair. I would like to share my thoughts with everyone and especially the newbie wannabe.
              
              There are sure money to be made driving taxi but it will never be any professional first choice of job. Super relief is very great in demand and you pay lesser rental and most important is no commitment. And here why driving should not be the first choice of people with certs;
              
              1. You will be starting your day at 6am to start picking people up. Failure to do so will result missing out on the golden period.
              2. You will end your day after 10pm. That mean that you will not be able to eat dinner and spend quality time with your family.
              3. You will feel very demoralize as you can see other professional boarding your cab and realize that you miss the feeling being able to knock off after 5 or 6. 
              4. You can earn the same amount with lesser time. And there is a limit on how much. 
              5. You will start your meal at a very different time. Resulting in some health problem if this were to continue.
              6. Your brain will start to deteriorate as driving a cab is all about experience and discipline.
              
              Of the above, I think the main reason why you should consider cab driving when you are jobsless is that; Your children
              
              But I think most of the fellow drivers are very friendly and helpful. Did make a lot of friends here though...

              Con't...
              
              It tough to type on iPhone... Kekeke...
              
              But driving a cab has it perks too!
              
              1. It allow you to meet up with all kind of people. Nice and the ugly. Poor and the rich.
              2. It will make you realized that some things that matters a lot of you; is in fact insignificant. You get to see the under previliage and sad people. You will actually feel how things is actually not so bad.
              3. On seeing how some really rich people is actually very humble.
              4. You get to see the entire Singapore 
              5. Definately no office politics... Drivers here is nice and simple... Well... There are some ugly I admit. Hahaha
              
              So it actually let you see life in different perspective and I think it will do more good then bad and I think all professional should have a try as a TD for a week or so...

              <p>still driving taxi will be better than becoming a URA/ HDB car park attendant , pizzas despatch rider , couriers service , mcdonalds , storemen , warehouse keeper , shipyard welders etc  . . .</p>
              <p>Of course cannot compare to bankers , financial controllers etc .....</p>
              <p>what you see , what u get .</p>
              <p>The two words still applies to me everyday i start driving a cab :<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"> Being Happy .</span></strong></p>
              <p>Cos i am just an O level , can go how far i know .</p>
              <p>Just being realistic .</p>
              <p>I went into taxi at the age of 30 .</p>
              <p>Believe me , i foreseen i cannot get a job , cos i forenseen our government will chute pattern everyday , how am i right ?</p>
              <p>11 years down the road . Experience became my advantage .</p>
              <p>Imagine i kept dreaming to find a USD5000 job until 40 ?  I died liao .....</p>
              <p>If you ask me does driving a cab made me wiser ?</p>
              <p>I would say a BIG YES .</p>

              <p>If i still stick to my previous $1380 per month job almost 11 years ago ....</p>

              <p>Just that just good enough for my simple lifestyle .</p>
              <p>It's still depends on what you need .</p>
              <p>If u need $4000 to finance just your credit cards repayment monthly , u'll became a very sad cabby .</p>
              <p>If you need to buy Louis Vuitton , Gorgio Armani , etc posh products , driving a cab can kill you .</p>
              <p>Cos taxi driving can never fulfill that ambitions .</p>
              <p>If one has got the the ultimate ambition of buying a Condo driving a cab , he eventually will be a slave to the condo .</p>
              <p>Even driving a cab can never be able to even finance a simple HDB flat .</p>

              <p>Like to carry on ....</p>
              <p>Does taxi driving good for Komade ... now ? I think so .</p>
              <p>Does working in the navy allows him to go holiday in HCMC once every two months ? He would have be sacked by the Navy then .</p>
              <p>Does working as a cabby good for people like taxinoobs ? I think so .... every monday holiday ... or even Tuesday .</p>
              <p>It's what u want in life .</p>
              <p>If u want to stay in a condo , drive a BMW , wallets with plenty of credit cards , weekends go Latitude or MBS see night view ...... every school holiday go holiday with family. U are going to be very disappointed as a cabby .</p>
              <p>Cos being a cabby just can never delivers that !!!!</p>
              <p>If one has heard driving a cab can get $10000 a month for every driver , on the road there shouldn't be anymore taxi drivers .</p>
              <p>Hit $3000 rest for the rest of the month .</p>
              <p>Obviously if one has to get $10k a month , he must be bloody hell in debt .</p>

              <p>Not everybody who wants to earn 10K a month is in debt. There are many gamblers among taxi drivers but I am not one of them. Used to play online casinos but the I stopped after a while because it was not enjoyable at all. Not that I lost money and lost interest. It is just that gambling is not in my genes, just like I dun smoke and drink. Tried before but never got any kick out of it whether win or lose.</p>
              <p>There are cabbies with Alfred dunhill belts and wallets. Even wear a 10K Rolex watch. If u dont gamble and play with women, sure can buy one.</p>

              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>Had been awhile since I logged in.</p>
              <p>Thanks bro poolman for introducing his friends for me to take
              over this wish for 10 days.</p>
              <p>Today the wish went dead on terminal 1 and therefore now writing
              here on my iPhone while waiting for the cab to be repair. I would
              like to share my thoughts with everyone and especially the newbie
              wannabe.</p>
              <p>There are sure money to be made driving taxi but it will never
              be any professional first choice of job. Super relief is very great
              in demand and you pay lesser rental and most important is no
              commitment. And here why driving should not be the first choice of
              people with certs;</p>
              <p>1. You will be starting your day at 6am to start picking people
              up. Failure to do so will result missing out on the golden
              period.<br> 2. You will end your day after 10pm. That mean that you will not be
              able to eat dinner and spend quality time with your family.<br> 3. You will feel very demoralize as you can see other professional
              boarding your cab and realize that you miss the feeling being able
              to knock off after 5 or 6.<br> 4. You can earn the same amount with lesser time. And there is a
              limit on how much.<br> 5. You will start your meal at a very different time. Resulting in
              some health problem if this were to continue.<br> 6. Your brain will start to deteriorate as driving a cab is all
              about experience and discipline.</p>
              <p>Of the above, I think the main reason why you should consider
              cab driving when you are jobsless is that; Your children</p>
              <p>But I think most of the fellow drivers are very friendly and
              helpful. Did make a lot of friends here though…</p>
