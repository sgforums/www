              Hey bros...
              
              Just relaxed after dinner and decide to begin my sharing session.
              
              The last 3-5 days of Super OMO was super challenging; Reason being;
              
              1. I have being working 6-10am for the morning shift, continue my office work till 5pm and continue OMO till 12pm.
              2. I continue to take pax even though I'm very near to my house(bad decision!!)
              3. Over estimate myself. Thinking my body can take it.
              
              Sometime like bro poolman say, it time to rest mean time to rest. I drive on hunger mode. Just wanna make as much money as possible in the 10 days or so.
              
              Driving a OMO and trying to make a lot of money does not make sense at all. Unless your target is 2-2.5k per month, then you may consider this. But then again, are you able to substain your life style that you are used to?
              
              And all it take is a accident, you can kiss your whole month effort good bye. Imagine that you are fighting on the road just to bring additional income and you make a bad judgement...
              
              I also saw some brother saying having good work-life balance in TD. I just couldn't understand at all. If you have to be on the road during the peak hours (7-930 &amp; 5-9), how do you find time to;
              
              1. Eat dinner with your family
              2. Watch TV with your family
              3. Have a relax stroll in the park
              4. etc....
              
              Off-peak time between 10-4pm is just not worth your effort, collecting between $5-$7 on average.
              
              My conclusion and sharing with all TD wannabe, you are able to acheive either following;
              
              1. Good Income &amp; No family life
              2. Average or low Income with family life
              
              For me, I will continue to be a super relief and take on jobs as and when my body and work allows.
              
              Last but not least, you will need to find a very easy going hirer to partner. Else you can also kiss good bye to your income. As in our line of work, you will never know if anyone scratch or put a dent on your car. It can cost you a day worth of work for a simple scratch.
