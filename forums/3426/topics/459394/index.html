              <p>i started not long ago with this company but i meet 2 problems i hope the old birds here can help give advise</p>
              <p>this
               company insist drivers must continue pay or giro rent even if car is 
              under servicing. they say they will refund back the downtime. but from 
              my experience so far, their refund takes very long, like usually once or
               at most twice every month. they can offer other replacement cars during
               servicing but all the cars i took all have problems on the same day or 
              after one or two days. end up still go back again and again and again..so the problem becomes paying the rent during downtime of 1 bad car, but still get another bad car like that how?</p>
              <p>second
               problem is i suspect this company will quietly suspend any driver who feedback car problem too many times. but the issue is so far all their 
              cars all have problems!..and if the driver feedback car problem more than a few times, then they will not inform the driver his car is ready to collect after service or there is available car for his use..but in the meantime the driver must still continue 
              paying rent!..it is like the driver is sponsor to them to pay for their cars  even when their car is bad cannot drive.</p>
              <p>my deposit still with them, how</p>

              you want answer to your questions, but from which old bird do you want?
              cdg , smrt . smart , premier , transcab ????
              one would be able to explain only cos me, driving premier will only comment or explain how matters work in premier, not able to do so for other taxi companys
              
              So my only answer to you now is please change taxi company since you find their operation not up to your expectation

              <p>In TC, there is a lot of different between driving Wish and Epica, the treatement are different, the servicing are different and I dare to say, those driving TC Epica are treated better. So, epica are alway swee swee good good</p>
              <p>Wish is a start pts of TC, to break into the market, they do a push selling, low rental, high rebate and cheap CNG, so furious and fast that people like our chief also join in the gang, the so call the red gang and within a year, they are nos 2 on the market, followed by alot of hearsay, truth say and horse say, it did very well in the first few years, until the CNG hike come into the picture, it cannot go on sustaining it cost, so get the korea assembled Chevrolet epica in, ordering it together with Smrt to tap on the niche of the economy of scale.</p>
              <p>So, the focus now is on Epica, the shift of focus with higher rental, lower rebate, good diesel sales, forget about CNG station all those problem, these ultimately would make them treat Epica drivers better, as for Wish, which is anytime a better car than Epica, more expensive, is left to scavange whatever they can from the driver who are still paying low rental and get high rebate.</p>

              <p>i started not long ago with this company but i meet 2 problems i hope the old birds here can help give advise</p>
              <p>this company insist drivers must continue pay or giro rent even if car is under servicing. they say they will refund back the downtime. but from my experience so far, their refund takes very long, like usually once or at most twice every month. they can offer other replacement cars during servicing but all the cars i took all have problems on the same day or after one or two days. end up still go back again and again and again..so the problem becomes paying the rent during downtime of 1 bad car, but still get another bad car like that how?</p>
              <p>second problem is i suspect this company will quietly suspend any driver who feedback car problem too many times. but the issue is so far all their cars all have problems!..and if the driver feedback car problem more than a few times, then they will not inform the driver his car is ready to collect after service or there is available car for his use..but in the meantime the driver must still continue paying rent!..it is like the driver is sponsor to them to pay for their cars  even when their car is bad cannot drive.</p>
              <p>my deposit still with them, how</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I think basically for driving Red is that you pay on time and dont get into accident, Jasmine will be very nice to you.</p>
              <p>She may even help you on some of your difficulties, like traffic summon.</p>
              <p>But if you got problem with the basics, you are just another piece of shit in her black book.</p>
