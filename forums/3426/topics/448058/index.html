            <div class='col-md body'>We reduced a great number of commuter complaints on our transportation problem in our country. We reduced the heat put on LTA by commuters for cramped MRT train and Bus problem by providing an alternative to move commuters from point A to point B. We also help Tourist Promotion Board to promote Tourism industry by moving tourists from point A to point B to point C to point D ....... and indirectly we also help our 2 IRS to sustained their business here. I think all Taxi Drivers deserve some recognition on our effort from LTA and Tourist Promotion Board. The recognition can be a form of a medal and few monthly subsidy on our taxi rental and removal or great reduction in CNG, Disel and Petrol tax. What do you think?</div>

              Singapore Taxi drivers are the most hard working workers compared to other countries, we have to slaughtered 12 hours a day and 7 days a week to pay our high daily rental rate, high diesel or CNG or Petrol rate in order to support our family by paying various bills,hdb loans,foods .... you name it. We also have to take care of our elderly parent who are old and sick or the parent maintenance act is going to fall hard on us.
              
              Our noble job has been taken away by foreigners and we are being forced to become taxi driver to solve our national problem and also provide a nice and comfortable lives to those taxi company management staffs sitting in the aircon rooms shaking legs and have so much time nagging or shouting at us when we are late in our daily rental payment.

              I been to many countries. The smiles on their taxi driver faces are very natural and I believes they are high motivated and fully charged up to perform their best in their job, they smiles when their passenger come onboard till their passenger aligned. 
              
              The smiles put up by our taxi driver are really fake, last something like 3 to 4 seconds. Those smiles more than 4 seconds are those retirees who do not has financial burden to take care off, they drive taxi to kill their time.  
              
              Some taxi driver do not smile and I do understand them. They are stressed out and have heavily financial burden to take care off. 
              
              Do not smile but put up a long face also not allow, it will lead to criticism and complaints. Putting up a fake smile is worst than no smile. Even try to put a good smile and greeting passenger coming onboard, sometime can be very discouraging. Few times I greeted my passenger Good Morning and their reply to me in a harsh tone, what so good about the morning, some even keep quiet and ignore you. 
              
              Only our government can help us by reducing our financial burden which I mentioned it earlier.

              <p>TDs are mostly middle ages to old peoples, most of our strength and energy were drained during the initial nation building period whereby we helped in a all inclusive true blue Singaporean only.

              Taxi driver rent taxi to solve National Problem has to pay GST for daily rental rate, has to pay cng, petrol, diesel tax, pay erp, medisave, income tax etc  I consider it a big joke. We are not rich and own pte car,  we are solving National Problem and same time helping our government to keep the country unemployment rate low. 
              
              Just read a recent news, our government coming spend millions buying buses to improve bus services, why not spend some money buying more taxi to improve services and keep our rental cost down.

              <p>Let me give u a senario:</p>
              <p>How much does a plate of wanton noodle usually cost? $3 right? some place $2 or $2.50 also have.</p>
              <p>I saw a simple wanton noodle stall in Lavendar with long queue all the time. Tho not really a fan of wanton noodle, I thought just tried and see if it's really that fantastic to warrrant such long queue all the time.</p>
              <p>While queuing up, I noticed the price list stated $4 for small, $5 for big. Gosh? $5 for a plate of wanton noodle.</p>
              <p>After trying the noodle, my comments is that it's good - if it's the same price of $3, if compare to others apple to apple. But if u increase the price to $5, the expectation is totally different. What so special? same like others, got wanton, cha siew, vege and noodle. What's the value in it?</p>
              <p>Back to TD subject - Same, already go through a recent increase. People are complain so expensive liao. Still not happy but ask for more?</p>
              <p>More Singaporeans are never satisfied with what they have. Just imagine if there is no increase. Also like tat right? Increase fare for you, now u want lower rental, cheaper diesel ,,,,,,,,</p>
              <p>Take for example when Government give money to people, how many people really appreciate it? what is their response?</p>
              <p>1. It's actually our money.</p>
              <p>2. Election time.</p>
              <p>3. They give us, but eventually will take back from other means la.</p>
              <p>How many people actually wonder if other governments do similar thing?</p>
              <p>Most MNC relocate their factory to China cos labour there is cheap right? are they having that edge for long? The Chinese people get 'smart' with time, they ask for more and so, doing business in China is no longer cheap. They are sourcing for other countries now, Vietnam maybe. In the end, who loses?</p>
              <p>As a taxi driver, the job we doing are what we are paid for. If u reach a stage when you think your contribution is worth more and start asking for it, people on top would re-access you, like that plate of wanton noodle. If they think you still worth it, they pay, otherwise ......</p>

              <p class="first">Petaling Jaya (The Star/ANN) - An English tourist was charged 450 ringgit (about US$150) for a taxi ride from KL Sentral to the Suria KLCC shopping centre, a distance of less than 10km.</p>
              <p>The Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD) said the tourist paid the fare before lodging a report against the driver.</p>
              <p>SPAD chairman Tan Sri Syed Hamid Albar said they were investigating and would take action against the taxi driver and the operator.</p>
              <p>He said the taxi driver was believed to have threatened the tourist into paying the fee.</p>
              <p>"Taxi drivers are our frontliners and ambassadors of the country as they interact with tourists daily.</p>
              <p>"We are taking this seriously as it affects the country's image," he said after opening SPAD's new enforcement centre at the Persada Plus here yesterday.</p>
              <p>He said SPAD was conducting a study to regulate the pricing mechanism for the taxi coupon system.</p>
              <p>"We want feedback from taxi drivers and passengers before proceeding with the study," he said, adding that there were mixed views about the coupon system.</p>
              <p>While some supported it, he said, others saw it as restrictive.</p>
              <p>"Some drivers said they would be unable to take passengers if they were not part of the taxi coupon system, while others felt it restrict-ed their movement," he said, adding that the system was implemented privately by mall and airport operators.</p>
              <p>SPAD also announced the purchase of 17 new vehicles, which will be used by its enforcement officers nationwide.</p>
              <p>Syed Hamid said the highest number of reports SPAD received were against illegal taxi touts, followed by complaints about overloaded lorries on the road.</p>
              <p>In the 3,845 operations conducted since Jan 2010, 74 individuals and operators have been taken to court.</p>
