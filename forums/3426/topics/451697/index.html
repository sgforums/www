              i am just starting so i usual follow what the front taxi do. we queuing at this food court next to the cavengah rd, when the front first taxi leave, i go up to the first position in front i think so. but after a short time, another this citycab come up from the side then reverse park in front of my queue. he reverse park until very close. i can see he look back to see at me but cannot see clearly becus light rain, then he just turn back put on handbrake and sit back and wait. is this normal practise, so next time any taxi also reverse park into any queue
              
              btw this is not the first time i see another taxi cut in. i saw at some time, some taxis will speed to the front of the queue, suddenly cut into first position by turning in head first then the passenger will go up. (i just want to ad these cut in front taxi, not once i see is on call, all green, becus if red on call, i can remember)

              sory i think i didnt say that before he reverse park in front, he was drive up from behind us in the queue, we already see he is green top. that why i don know why he suddenly stop then revser park in front queue, but i already see this type action before so i guessing. then when i drive out to drive away, i look rear view he top is still green, but the taxi queuing behind me drive up to fill my space end up behind that new comer. ?
              
              and the new comer taxi did not put hazard lights, only last min signal light to cut in front of queue. he then revser park very close, his action is look back look around no problem, then on engine sit inside wait. at first i thought he parking to go toilet or smoking but no.

              thanks poolman. iit was raining at that time and i am not sure i know enough to arugue or not
              
              yesterday another 2 blue sonoata almost accedent. 
              
              the first one i i see behind me quite far away and steady speed so i signal change lane and prepare move hlaf body inside, but he accelerate up so fast from 4-5 car space, almost hit my back right door. i see him so fast so i stop in half, but i surpirse he still continue to move forward toward my door. i think he want me to turn back into my lane to give way let him pass then after that i turn lane.
              
              the second case the second sonata is traveling one car space in front me on my left, in a 2-lane road. then the sonata suddenly like want to speed up but we come up to a traffic light is red the sonata jam brake. then suddenly a silver taxi uturn very fast from the oppositie direction raod. then we see it stop just 20 metres in front of that sonata to pick up a passnger on our side of road. just when the passenger getting into the silver, the traffic turn grean so we start moving but i think the sonata jerk forward first. the private car in front of me then turn right into right car park, the blue sonata still moving 1 car space in my front left. further up the 2-lane road after round a small bent, i can see a small car park on leftside lane partly blocking it. only when we reaching the park car, the sonata still 1 car space in front me then suddenly on signal at the same time jump out into my lane then overtake the left side park car, but i almost hit it back ihave to brake hard. my guess is this sonata  dont want to slow down or give way becus he already miss that passenger in front of him to that silver, but i want to ask here
