              <p><br>2k++ still wait for what, grab lor, grab already then see, scare what, taxis like most said, can alway come back and peng one lah. And 2++k in few years time, who knows, maybe you become boss's favorite, can earn 10k++, drive big car liao, hope by then, please dun fark TDs on the road.</p>
              <p>For people who drove taxis for a period of time, then switch back to working life, most of them are already tougher up, can meet and communicate with all kinds of peoples, able to have good foresight and planning too, all these, like it or not, are taxis trained in a way. And most will be able to take the hardship, because driving taxis train you up in a certain way.</p>
              <p>And even if come to company's target and KPI&lt; as a former TD, you are able to appreciate and understand it, and you got the ability to work toward it, because as a TD, a businessman yourself, you also set target, you also set achieveable KPI for yourself, you learn how business is run, a boss mindset, any bosses will be more than happy if you have a boss mindset and ability to understand profit and loss.</p>
              <p>As for driving TD, after few years, still driving TD, like me and chief, but at least I got licence to drive casket, a step higher</p>

              <p><br>Life is a learning journey, there is no way you can forget about peng steering life, same goes to you, and please be remind that because of your former peng steering life, you are now better and able to take almost all the hard knocks of life, so, have some respect for your former job, and like it or not, in some way, it did help to tougher you and most important, bring up your family with bread and butter on the table.</p>
              <p>I would said, once you are out of Taxi trade, you then can compare and manage your life well or better, but some peoples on the other hand, do the reverse of what you are doing, lousy jobs outside and then, with not much choice, went into TD, and they found that hey, this is the job I wanted, why did not I took it up earlier. And they are a happier lots, it all goes into individual preferences.</p>
              <p>Some tired of corporate life, go into TD to choose a less sinful and honest job, lead a simple life and perhaps give him more time to practice his religion and do other good which he had wanted so much to contribute formerly. Some simply drive a 9 hrs on a 12 hrs shift, cool and steady with a mindset that money is a must, but not everything need money.</p>

              <p>For fun of course cannot lah, knn, people died, you go there fun fun, relatives see already, can fark one, I am trained to produce a sour face while driving casket, even want to laugh also must control, then later drive taxis as super relief, can laugh all I want.</p>
              <p>Do you know that driving casket too long can make one become quiet and sour faced? Maybe that is why your wife say cannot, I was once soured face no matter where I go, friend, family and relatives said, I alway look moody, never smile or laugh, so, I decided to drive partime taxis, now more cheerful liao. Who said drive taxis no life??</p>

              <p><br> Life is a learning journey, there is no way you can forget about
              peng steering life, same goes to you, and please be remind that
              because of your former peng steering life, you are now better and
              able to take almost all the hard knocks of life, so, have some
              respect for your former job, and like it or not, in some way, it
              did help to tougher you and most important, bring up your family
              with bread and butter on the table.</p>
              <p>I would said, once you are out of Taxi trade, you then can
              compare and manage your life well or better, but some peoples on
              the other hand, do the reverse of what you are doing, lousy jobs
              outside and then, with not much choice, went into TD, and they
              found that hey, this is the job I wanted, why did not I took it up
              earlier. And they are a happier lots, it all goes into individual
              preferences.</p>
              <p>Some tired of corporate life, go into TD to choose a less sinful
              and honest job, lead a simple life and perhaps give him more time
              to practice his religion and do other good which he had wanted so
              much to contribute formerly. Some simply drive a 9 hrs on a 12 hrs
              shift, cool and steady with a mindset that money is a must, but not
              everything need money.</p>
