              different story loh. Cos drive taxi need to pay cash. So got CPF

              <p>That's the reason that I think twice. I don't want CPF. No use for it. Can see cannot spend unless buy HDB but oversea got property can only buy from open market. No house here, staying with parents. JB got one but just sold last month. Buying a bigger one near to legoland.</p>

              <p>One thing for sure, you are right. Not getting idle. Always idle but nowadays more idle. Last time Wed, Fri and Sat die die must drive.</p>
              <p>Now &gt;</p>
              <p>Friday almost all expressway jam. If rainning lagi jiak lat. So, after 9pm then start driving till 5am keep car.</p>
              <p>Sat, wife and son at home. No mood. Sometimes drive sometime just let the car take a day off. Mostly 10pm then start driving till 6am.</p>
              <p>Sun, wife and son at home.Also no mood. 9pm start till 12mn.</p>
              <p>Come to think of it, Who say drive taxi no life?</p>
              <p>Actually, going back to working line is not so bad. Problem is this company has tons of OT and all is subjected to CPF contribution. Imagine let say gross S$3600 -$720CPF = S$2880.</p>
              <p>$720CPF can throw 6 days rental leh. Most think got CPF can buy house. Me only wants to keep my money in my pocket.</p>
              <p>Wife want to have our own place in sg, that's why she suggested me to change job.</p>
              <p>Wife happy, me not happy.</p>
