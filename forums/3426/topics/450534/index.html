              U may W/O Knowing u have dropped small items like keys, cards,hp or other documents inside the taxi (becos u went shopping,happy hrs,etc).
              
              If u have been nice, have courtesy,"well behaved" to the TD,he will return the missing items to the company,otherwise he will just throw them away.

              Most of the time is those non-seasonal paxs finding fault and trouble.
              
              Taxi side is those new drivers who don't know the way and how to handle paxs.
              
              And I really hate those pax not in good mood, purposely finding trouble in the driver.
              
              And those got mental problem like some artiste who really shouldn't be served.

              <p>But I did told him, what have I done wrong to make him so unhappy. A surpising turn, he apologies to him for the rudeness and told me to keep the change.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, that is the way. Talk so much for what, we are pay to drive, not talk.</p>
              <p>As we are alway openly at the expense of public exploitation, there is point to argue or talk alot, once place and route is confirmed, move on, alway check back with pax if not sure or, tell pax your way of going.</p>
              <p>Ironically, in term of buyer and seller relationship, TD and pax relationship is of no different. When pax board a cab,, they expect the cabby to know the way, just like you want to eat wanton mee, you expect the stall selling know what they are doing. However, that is not the case, and that is why cabby learn to say "Sorry, I am new, can you guide me abit, thanks" As for pax, like cabby, out of the sudden we have to think of the road, the shortest and quickiest, with less traffic light and also no jam, so both can get what we call a brain jam.</p>
              <p>It is not that cabby do not know the place, but from many different direction in singapore, it is totally different in approach, you tell me Tampines st 41, I know, but from east, north, south and west are totally different, and for a while, you just get stuck there having to think of the way, and if you ask pax, they will get annoyed to use their brain again, because frankly, taking a taxis is for relaxation, and out of the sudden, having to think of the road could add more stress to them if they already had a bad day in office or home. And that can turn ugly if the cabby still go by the wrong road they wanted.</p>
              <p>The best is provide pax a road direction and seek their approval, it will lighten the burden on them and also give them a sense that this cabby knows his job well.</p>

              <p>Exactly. As they are your customer, treat them as boss for a few minutes, you do not have to satisfy a pax, you only need to delight them. You see, bosses tends to work in a way of sitting down and listen to presentation and options, and then make a decision on which presentation/option he wants to take on, success or failure is his responsibility, that is why they attend meeting after meeting, then go play golf and massage or find PRC gals.</p>
              <p>In a way, we give paxs options, right or wrong options is ok, at least it spark up their brain cells to give a jump start,</p>

              <p>Pax: which is better</p>
              <p>Bowah: PIE down got less traffic lights than KBukit.</p>
              <p>Pax: Go by first option</p>
              <p>Bowah: Thanks, we go by PIE, bedok north, BR into tampines.</p>

              <p><br>Not siao... Perhaps a few green available taxi zoomed past him before you fetch him, so he already late, very angry... so naturally some people cannot control temper will just release on the next unlucky person... but you managed to kill the situation and let him know his issue... it could easily become a shouting match if the taxi driver scold him back, then the pax already in bad mood, shout even louder, then taxi driver more angry, shout back... that's how fights begin lor... at the end when you did what you did, you let him know he was being rude, which i believe he doesn't even realize... sometimes people do insensitive things hurting others without realizing it... for example, some insensitive guys like to joke about fat girls, it hurts the girls feelings but the guys won't understand the hurting because it's not them... something like that lor... so it's not siao... it's normal.</p>

              <p>bro what I can say is you are not wrong,but he is also not wrong....why? I explain</p>
              <p>from PIE to tampines st 83,the correct way is to exit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bedok Reservoir</span>,the exit just before Bedok North rd</p>
              <p>then when you exit,drive straight along Bedok nth rd-turn right Tampines ave 10-turn right ave 1(Temasek poly)-turn left ave 8-turn right ave 3-turn left to st 83</p>
              <p>alot of turns but to kiasu pax it is a much shorter route.</p>
              <p>same as Pasir ris st 71 &amp; 72,PIE should exit Bedok reservoir.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the man should tell you more clearly, he should say exit Bedok Reservoir,not use Bedok Reservoir....</p>

              <p>Aiyah, by right we must be good to our pax, basic courtesy. I may choose pax, but once pick up, you have my respect to begin with unless of course certain types who really make you sian. Then again, even if don't like I just ignore them and do my duty my sending them to Point A or B.</p>
              <p>No extra, but no show face or scolding them, they are paying for the journey and thats what I should give them.</p>
              <p>Of course if pax show you show you respect, you shouldn't be rude to them. I like pax who call me uncle, it's basic Asian culture to respect your elders and I am grateful for pax who say it. But some go even further and call me sir, I will say no need, I should call you that instead.</p>
