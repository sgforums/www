              <p>from PIE to tampines st 83,the correct way is to exit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bedok Reservoir</span>,the exit just before Bedok North rd</p>
              <p>then when you exit,drive straight along Bedok nth rd-turn right Tampines ave 10-turn right ave 1(Temasek poly)-turn left ave 8-turn right ave 3-turn left to st 83</p>
              <p>alot of turns but to kiasu pax it is a much shorter route.</p>
              <p>same as Pasir ris st 71 &amp; 72,PIE should exit Bedok reservoir.</p>

              <p><br>At first i also think he say this way...But what he point is From PIE exit Jln Eumos then turn right to Bedok Reservoir...(More traffic light n more time,Right?)I think he also know his say wrongly liao,thats why when i ask :can u let me know or teach me what i did wrong..he keep on say never mind..Yester also got 1 Marriged guy bring China girl go hotel...keep saying very Broke,show me walletr,No $!Fuck!No $ still want play Girl!</p>

              <p><br>Yes, that is the way. Talk so much for what, we are pay to drive, not talk.</p>
              <p>As we are alway openly at the expense of public exploitation, there is point to argue or talk alot, once place and route is confirmed, move on, alway check back with pax if not sure or, tell pax your way of going.</p>
              <p>Ironically, in term of buyer and seller relationship, TD and pax relationship is of no different. When pax board a cab,, they expect the cabby to know the way, just like you want to eat wanton mee, you expect the stall selling know what they are doing. However, that is not the case, and that is why cabby learn to say "Sorry, I am new, can you guide me abit, thanks" As for pax, like cabby, out of the sudden we have to think of the road, the shortest and quickiest, with less traffic light and also no jam, so both can get what we call a brain jam.</p>
              <p>It is not that cabby do not know the place, but from many different direction in singapore, it is totally different in approach, you tell me Tampines st 41, I know, but from east, north, south and west are totally different, and for a while, you just get stuck there having to think of the way, and if you ask pax, they will get annoyed to use their brain again, because frankly, taking a taxis is for relaxation, and out of the sudden, having to think of the road could add more stress to them if they already had a bad day in office or home. And that can turn ugly if the cabby still go by the wrong road they wanted.</p>
              <p>The best is provide pax a road direction and seek their approval, it will lighten the burden on them and also give them a sense that this cabby knows his job well.</p>
