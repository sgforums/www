              <p>I do encounter some TD who are like that:</p>
              <p>recently just drop a pax at Tan Tock Seng Hospital at the taxi stand and there is a cab in front of me and 3 person, one in wheelchair waiting at the queue.</p>
              <p>One of them approached me and ask if I can fetch them to Toa Payoh Lor 4 and I said ok. I ask how come the cab in front dun take them and she just shrugged it off.</p>
              <p>Worst still, this guy refused to move off and the lady got problem pushing the wheelchair down as the cab is occupying the slope side.</p>
              <p>I got to help her lift the wheelchair down gentlely.</p>
              <p>I told her this my first time handling such pax so I might not know how to move him, but she said no worry, he can get up the cab himself.</p>
              <p>Forgot to take a pic of that knn cab.</p>
              <p>I got my fair share of IKEA pax too, with 3 long carpet roll that needs me to bring down the front seat.</p>
              <p>No big deal, all in a day's job.</p>
              <p>Never once had I left my pax to put or retrieve things from the booth. Always make it a point to come out, out of courtesy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The very first pax in my life, more unforgetable. Just got my merc cab from my hirer the first day and just drive around in my neighbourhood getting a feel of it. One granny stop me and I thought "cool! my first pax"</p>
              <p>She told me she is a garong guni collector and her trolley wheel just broke, cannot move. She ask if I can give her a lift to her block, somewhere nearby. I thought, so old and still collecting, just help la,</p>
              <p>Then she led me to so many cardboard boxes and old newsapaper, enought to feel the whole booth and back seat. She even expect me to help her carry there and load it and upon reaching, help her carry all of them to her lift lobby.</p>
              <p>But all the time, she keep on saying thanks and "ah ma back no good, cannot carry".</p>
              <p>How's that for the first pax, great memory right?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>On the other point of view, try looking at the TD's position.</p>
              <p>as said earlier, he might not want to be responsible for any breakage.</p>
              <p>He might also have back problem himself right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If this 50 year old lady is there to buy a 42" TV alone, she must have taken forgranted that help is on hand, free, anytime. My next question after helping her put in is, what next when we reach her destination? Is she expecting us to help her bring up? if not, how she handle?</p>
              <p>Is people now expecting more of a TD's role? </p>
              <p>Offering help in this instant is surely out of goodwill and using words like "money mongering whore" on us if we dun is abit far fetch right?</p>
              <p>I am a transport service provider, I will bring u to any number of place, no matter how far or out of the way it is, that's my job and no complain, as long as it is in my job scope.</p>
              <p>There are those that I will definitely do, like I got a advanced booking to send 2 small boys alone, to his church. It's my responsibilty to see that they reach the church and alight safely with ppl there receiving them.</p>
              <p>But for those who expects extras or taking us forgranted like this old lady, it's different story.</p>
              <p>Berd, u ask yourself, if you are in this old lady's shoe and want to buy such big a TV, what would u do? Think of how u carry it back right? that's normal.</p>
              <p>and if "TD is expectiing to help you carry" is part of your plan - think again.</p>
              <p>How about us switching role?</p>

              <p>before becoming a td, many things i don't understand, why tds like this like that.</p>
              <p>now as a td, i understand why td like this like that</p>
              <p>cos many times, td help, people don't appreciate</p>
              <p>i do help but see how pax react. they expect td to do it by standing adside, i will also stand and watch too. it is suppose be too way, unless old uncle/aunties, disable, with infant, but for pax with proper hand and leg who act like someone high class, i will do the same.</p>
              <p>i do believe tds out there majority are good, many include me( i dare to say) does many good deeds like help towards the extend beyond what they need to, don't ask for favour or anything, maybe even free trip or so,  cos we all know it is not about money, we tds do have feeling also, human but not cold blooded.</p>
              <p>if we all know, this society have become more cold blooded in many things/areas</p>
              <p>if people do considerate,  many things don't happen.</p>
              <p>for e.g, once at the airport, family of 4 with many luggage, skip and waited until my turn, why they know other normal taxi cannot take/load up all as 4 of them will be taking all the seat up.  me(i30) even it is a wagon, manage to load up all with all the boot space taken up. reach their destination, a landed property. pay up the meter fare no extra, but note, right from the being, load up and unload of their luggage, they did not even lift a single finger............. i do as my professional, even no tips, still unload the luggage.  ..   but you think of it, should they call for a maxicab instead?</p>
              <p>many tds out there , have some how injure their back or hand while helping to load, even happen to injure just keep quiet cos cannot claim work related injuries where many other job can.</p>
              <p>we ask not asking to be pity by anyone, it is today society that result such to happen, blame who?  blame selfish pp lor.</p>

              <p>let's talk about mrt here in singapore, the train are much larger than taxi, then why is there a restriction on all this bulky item.</p>
              <p>why is there maxicab, limo or pte limo, movers, why do there exist, must be a reason.</p>
              <p>i believe that getting the right transport to transport the right things . just don't misuse,</p>
              <p>would anyone cater a crane lorry to delivery a 42" tv, ? answer should be every clear.</p>
              <p>i was call up by lta recently, because i told pax that taxi are point to point service and they not happy cos pax with 2 stop ( different between 2 stop is less than 100m)</p>
              <p>pax expected me to waited for them to go to a hdb flat to do distribution before moving to the next destination with waiting time expected to be longer than 20min, though i was told 2stop, but not inform about waiting time.</p>
              <p>of course reching the 1st stop when they  tell me to wait, i say cannot,  tell them they got a wrong transport. 1st stop and let them go.</p>
              <p> lta ask me if i want face to face talk, i say yes but pax dare not, wrong thing and want complain, but i lucky, the lta officer(was actually surprise) very understanding.</p>
              <p>i only one simple reason, in singapore you want a taxi solely for your purpose, must do hourly booking, if not why got hourly booking</p>

              </p><p>The Key word here is HELP.</p>
              <p>Help is an assistance given to a need, is an action out of good will, is an contribution out of sympathetic.</p>
              <p>When a person is complaining for not recieveing Help, he/she is actually demanding it as a Duty. He/She see it as a Duty others should perform without Merit.</p>
              <p>There is not rule stated that It is Taxi Driver Duty to load or unload goods. Hence, the complaint is invalid, it is the complainant unreasonable perception.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Help is given voluntarily, the needy can request but not demand. The needy could provide a little "motivation factor" to obtain a little help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is NO such rule as Should Help</p>
              <p>Help = Help</p>
              <p>Should Help = Duty</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A wise man will motivate for obtaining Help</p>
              <p>A stupid man will demand to obtain Help</p>
              <p>An idiot will support to the stupid man demand.</p>

              <p>i do help but see how pax react. they expect td to do it by

              <p>i do believe tds out there majority are good, many include me( i

              even free trip or so,  cos we all know it is not about money,

              <p>if people do considerate,  many things don't happen.</p>
              <p>for e.g, once at the airport, family of 4 with many luggage,
              skip and waited until my turn, why they know other normal taxi
              cannot take/load up all as 4 of them will be taking all the seat
              up.  me(i30) even it is a wagon, manage to load up all with
              all the boot space taken up. reach their destination, a landed
              property. pay up the meter fare no extra, but note, right from the
              being, load up and unload of their luggage, they did not even lift
              a single finger............. i do as my professional, even no tips,
              still unload the luggage.  ..   but you think
              of it, should they call for a maxicab instead?</p>
              <p>many tds out there , have some how injure their back or hand
              while helping to load, even happen to injure just keep quiet
              cos cannot claim work related injuries where many other job
              can.</p>

              <p>I think Beta is off topic and going personal. What TD does, he have his own reason. And there are many out there who will help, so dont label TD in a general manner. I will help too, but I will think this customer is too much. I will help because I accept the fact that this will be some of those idiotic situations where passengers dont understand the meaning of Public Transport and Home Delivery. Try bringing the 42" up the MRT or SBS Bus. Sure can fit. If the Train Driver or Bus Driver chase them out, Call them Money Whores? Or they supposed to be part of Service Industry?</p>
              <p>It tells me 2 things. Beta expects others to do things beyond their scope and which may have financial consequences. Secondly, Beta is one who tells others to do, but himself do not do. Why? Because if he does it himself (even driving his own car to help can be considered), he will understand what the forumers are saying. The word for this kind of people is 'hypocrite'.</p>
              <p>We can discuss and say a lot of things, but please dont go personal. As a Taxi Driver, my mission is to convey passengers to their desired destination in a safe, economical and timely manner.</p>
              <p>I wished you did not mention the temple thingy. Those are nice people implicated by you.</p>

              <p>Maybe next time when couples with children go Macdonalds asking for a baby chair, the staff will tell them "get it yourself, we don't work for free and we might injure our back". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><em>for e.g, once at the airport, family of 4 with many luggage, skip and waited until my turn, why they know other normal taxi cannot take/load up all as 4 of them will be taking all the seat up. me(i30) even it is a wagon, manage to load up all with all the boot space taken up. reach their destination, a landed property. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pay up the meter fare no extra</span>, but note, right from the being, load up and unload of their luggage, they did not even lift a single finger............. i do as my professional, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">even no tips</span>, still unload the luggage. .. but you think of it, should they call for a maxicab instead?</em></p>

              <p>I think Beta is off topic and going personal. What TD does, he have his own reason. And there are many out there who will help, so dont label TD in a general manner. I will help too, but I will think this customer is too much. I will help because I accept the fact that this will be some of those idiotic situations where passengers dont understand the meaning of Public Transport and Home Delivery. Try bringing the 42" up the MRT or SBS Bus. Sure can fit. If the Train Driver or Bus Driver chase them out, Call them Money Whores? Or they supposed to be part of Service Industry?</p>
              <p>It tells me 2 things. Beta expects others to do things beyond their scope and which may have financial consequences. Secondly, Beta is one who tells others to do, but himself do not do. Why? Because if he does it himself (even driving his own car to help can be considered), he will understand what the forumers are saying. The word for this kind of people is 'hypocrite'.</p>
              <p>We can discuss and say a lot of things, but please dont go personal. As a Taxi Driver, my mission is to convey passengers to their desired destination in a safe, economical and timely manner.</p>
              <p>I wished you did not mention the temple thingy. Those are nice people implicated by you.</p>

              <p>First of all, there is a difference between MRT and buses, they don't have a boot to convey luggage unlike taxis. Get the facts right first. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I didn't know by lending a hand (2-3 persons lifting) up a tv will have such dire financial consequences. But on the other hand, if you offer the taxi driver $10 tips, I am sure they will help you lift. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How was the temple people implicated by me? I merely stated that they shouldn't have helped the taxi driver, because they have no monetary incentive to do so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Geeeez.....come to think of it the temple people could have dire financial consequences, they could have been killed by the fare thief. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Same thing with the temple helpers, they have no obligation to help chase to robbers, but they did it out of a sense of righteousness. That's where taxi drivers fall short. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
