              <p>khoon very right, sometime when come near to pax drop off location, when pass by saw wheelchair pax waiting for taxi, most of the  time i purposely  return to the same spot where wheelchair pax are waiting, they are still there, some time feel so sad that some of the brother tds never stop to pick up even i look at the rear minor looking if got empty taxi coming pass. most of the time, pax will say lots of thank you reason being some td will avoid picking them.</p>
              <p>there is another case not wheelchair,  once i was driving along marine parade towards parkway, from far got see pax, but few empty taxi move close but drove off.</p>
              <p>thought so lucky, from center lane switch to left lane, still some distance away i saw a big dog with pax, first reaction, change back to centre lane again, but as i was driving close to them, suddenly the i the pax actually was holding a stick with red and white colour(blind man stick). quickly i see no car on the left lane and do a quick change and brake immediately. the pax sense got cae stopping and start knocking on my left door saying very loudy, is this a taxi, repeating a few times. when he board, first thing he say to me was he hand almost break as he has been standing there to wave for taxi some stop but drove off.</p>
              <p>i just mentioned but not sure why, i just felt that most tds here will do things like brother khoon and me did, except small minority who does other wise.</p>
              <p>of course there are better tds who does more greater thing than me , regular free service to the needy, my action here was nothing to compare to them</p>
              <p>just hope commuter has better understanding but not always see tds as bad driver just because of few rotten eggs.</p>

              Fare wise, they give i take. But loading+ unloading wheel chair, i'll do it. 
              
              The only time i would waive the fare is when i genuinely feel that those folks really needs our help.;(

              <p><br>True, but not all, some really appreciate it, and it just take one who appreciate to make your day better.</p>
              <p>And I also agree that Singapore are mostly kpkb type, but we hv to understand that is our culture and the stress most of us are going thru day in day out. What gives is what we want to gives, to appreciate or not is another matter, if one appreciated, it will certainly make us happy, if not, we touch our own soul and heart to tell ourselves, we did well.</p>
              <p>In giving, we seek no return, if we seek return, then, it is a motive, and that is not giving, that is transaction. Just like our govt, give you 1 thing, later take back 10 things.</p>
