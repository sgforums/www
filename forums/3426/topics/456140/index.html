              <p>1.  This is not true. Quite a few of us here are sotongs. I know Bukit Merah well, now I more or less familiar with Serangoon. Elsewhere...I will ask, "dont mind you guide me as I am two months new"</p>
              <p>2.  This one driving attitude problem. I know its happening, I also dont understand why they drive like that. I like to drive in such a manner that my passenger thinks he/she is sitting in a waiting lounge. I have mother and kid playing, dont even know they are in a moving vehicle. I have people reading books in my cab. (most times if you try to read a book in a car, you will surely get a headache). I also encounter a few times, ladies putting on mascara, IN MY CAB !! Scary, if I jam brakes, sure kena the forehead.</p>
              <p>3.  Before I became a TD, most people dont give way, whether cab or pte vehicle. When I became a TD, at least some TD gives way, Pte Car continues not to give way. I think this is a Singaporean problem.</p>

              <p>Thanks for answering.</p>
              <p>Point 1 still mollifies me because all the TD I flag down so far all know the way sia...cos I can only give directions like at the last 5 min when nearing the location.</p>
              <p>2. so far i only encountered one driver who drives like you. scarly it's you???? the rest make me feel liek throwing up..cos I have bad motion sickness.</p>
              <p>3. It's true many ppl dont like to give way on the road, but the biggest problem I notice about giving way seem to come from taxi lei. like most of the time if there's a taxi behind me and I indicate i wanna change lane, the taxi will speed up and cut me off. some pte cars will still give way to me. (altho there are those who dont) but one thing for sure i know is that pte car dont like to give way to TD because it's kind of like a common knowledge (at least among the ppl i know, even my TD uncle agrees with us) that if TD get given way to..that TD wont give way to you.</p>
              <p>just my 2cents..i dont purposely cut ppl's lane.</p>

              <p>I think u will face more problems with Toyota Crown taxis .</p>

              <p>I dun jam brake , I step gradually to slow then stop .</p>
              <p>Bacause of such driving habit , i dun follow too closely to the vehicle in front , cos i need more space to slow down and brake .</p>

              <p>1. Only those driving for many years can do this. New TDs have to take a test on routes but this is only on routes from Airport to City and some Landmarks. Very basic only.</p>
              <p>2. They are in a hurry to drop off the current pax for the next. Whether booking or airport etc...</p>
              <p>3. This depends on courtesy and private car drivers are more guilty of this than TDs'</p>

              <p>Regarding giving way, I realised one thing that Singaporeans do but most other countries dont do.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans DO give way to ambulance.</p>
              <p>Is it because we grow up to be conditioned to follow rules but not so much on courtesy?</p>
              <p>Maybe its the 'fine' factor, and the widespread use of in-car cameras?</p>
