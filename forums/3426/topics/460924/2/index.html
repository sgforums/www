              <p>Our govt are capitalist govt, they studied management, finacial and business economics more than social science, some dun even take social science, so what you expect from our govt is running a country like a business centre,</p>
              <p>The models of business adopted by all business entities here, including Taxi companies are exact replicas of our govt model or similar, so you tell me, how on earth is our govt going to come with a laws to fix the taxis companies, are you asking them to shoot their own foot??</p>
              <p>Now why govt still hold charity shows to ask you to donate, why govt got no money meh? we got billions of reserves, why must the citizens, after all the social taxes including gst, fuel taxs and so on, still have to give charities, why not govt do it on our behalf with the reserves from other taxation like ERPs and corporate taxes on companies.</p>
              <p>Because when you use the reserve, the sing $$ will fall, and if it fell more than 1/2, just imagine those rich peoples who had 5 millions in their bank under sing dollars, only get 2.4m left, what about those with CPF inside??..this are all fiscal policies, MAS, is the decision maker, it objectives is to grow singapore, and to growth, it must satisfy the rich and hold it reserve strongly inorder to attract peoples to invest with a stable dollars</p>

              <p><br>Banker? Banger maybe.</p>
              <p>MAS is the fiscal policy decision makers, and it decision affect everyone of us, from layman to businessman, if tomorrow interest rates is to go up by 1%, many would be in deeper loan debt, and those who saved, may gain, the whole financial ball game changed. Less borrower, more saving, meaning less spending, more conservation.</p>
              <p>And when there is less spending, economy goes down, less investment, what happen? less paxs on the road lah, and with less paxs on the road, what happen, TD like me, OBK loh. So you see the ecology of financial and social economy here. Many will park their money into bond and wait for the lower of interest rates to enter the market again. And that is the time you sell your bonds, if you had invested earlier.</p>
              <p>Currently with MAS decision to maintain or lower interest rates, it boost the spending, people borrow to invest, buy cars, buy condo, buy shares to gain from it, bonds lowered, many borrowed to by property, because property is the day you buy, the next hour it appreciate much more than the interest rate you have to pay the bank, but then borrowing from bank need requirements to qualify, as TD, you think the bank will loan you a milion dollars?</p>
              <p>And MAS decided to cap property loan return to 35 years max, and do you think you can pay back even at the lowest interest within 35 years as a TD?? guess my whole life + my next life, if there is a next life, also cannot pay finish. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Then, who does MAS serve? to be continue...</p>

              <p>The Rich and Richer.</p>
              <p>The disparity of Rich and poor in singapore is alarming, it protray a model of American way of governing whereby the country properous but an unfair society.</p>
              <p>If you visit america, from LA to NY, you see more beggars than thailand but still less than India.</p>
              <p>What then is the initial objectives of Singapore govt and singaporeans before the industrialisation and the quote used in the modernisation of Singapore industrial in 1969, the key words was "to Achieve growth in EQUALITY", as I drive TD with pax along some east side roads, you see more and more lamborgini, ferrari, maserati, porche and all those super rich houses and 39 million sentosa cove house, ...have we achieve equality in growth?</p>
              <p>In 1980, a SIngapore CEO earns only 20 times more than an average workers, let say that worker earn $500, which is alot during those time of cheap cost of living. A CEO would had taken 10,000 per month, and that is alot, but today, a worker earn $1.500, and a CEO is 50 times more than him, a 30 x increase and still increasing, not to mention those big fat bonuse and fees, luxury cars and houses for them. "Base on equality and justice" I guess we had recite that pledge thousand of times? But still so pathetically a TD earning 7k.</p>
              <p>Where did our govt get their master or PhD? Harvard? MIT, Cambrige, Pittburgs and so on, from the west, but the west model is failing, it modelled upon individualism whereas our asian context are mostly on Communitarian cutlure.</p>
              <p>The west wage structure works in a way of nepotism, management and CEOs will alway increase their own paid, increase and increase, all happy, for the workers, let them rot, not our problem, same goes to Taxis companies, they will every year want to increase profit to please themselves and shareholders, increase each other pay higher and higher leading to TD CEO earning millions and challenging each other to earn more, I earn 10 millions, but he earn 12millions more than me, so next year, I increase my own pay.., but TD on the road, like me, struggling to find bread and butter. Who cares??</p>
              <p>So, if singapore is not going to close the gap of rich and poor disparity and move itself away from the west individualism ideology, then this govt is history in the coming years</p>

              <p>Think not only taxis is tough .... every business in Sgp is tough .</p>
              <p>Cos the goverment can suka suka change policies very frequently that favour their PAP and their Minsiters .</p>
              <p>Eg like CNG case .</p>
              <p>Everything was very nicely on track for a greener environment ..... it was cheaper options than petrol not more expensive than diesel ...... nice vehicle to drive ..... welcome by both locals and foreigners ...... </p>
              <p>Until the god damn department place a $0.20 per kg tax and kill off the market !</p>
              <p>Why impose the $0.20 per kg ?</p>
              <p>Cos diesel taxes they generated from taxis is a big big amount .</p>
              <p>CNG taxi no meat for them .</p>
              <p>Diesel taxi one year like $3000 diesel taxis .</p>
              <p>CNG taxi paid about $300 per year road tax .</p>
              <p>See the diff ?</p>
              <p>It's the government ... </p>
              <p>COE was adjusted from Cat A to Cat E category .....</p>
              <p>From one expensive cat to another even more expensive cat ....</p>

              <p><br>You wait lor, if can last until your kids grew up, good luck liao. Having dream is good, but do not end up being an illusionist.</p>
              <p>Living overseas is no joke if you are not prepare, especially after spending 40 to 50years in Singapore, and then your kids may love city life more than a sea side. They would not like to end up being FT of cebu. And I can frankly tell you, you will miss alot of thing here, from yr fish soup to gullimard spa..hee hee, no joke, I being a seamen knows all these homesick syndrome.</p>
              <p>You will not get use to slow life, you will not want to every day drink coconut water and sway on a hammock between two coconut trees, and end up you may get skin problem out of too much sun exposure.</p>
              <p>We as Singaporean, here is our birthplace, a place that we call home, serve the army, help built the economy by ferrying peoples around, add population by giving childrens, pay our taxes and make this place nice and clean...now why should we leave?? Why should Singaporeans, with all the above sentiments and contribution, end up leaving our home and let others, with no contribution nor any loyalty taking over.</p>
