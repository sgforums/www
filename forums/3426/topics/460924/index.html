              <p>In the last ten years, singapore economy is good, as good as if can even evade the 2008 lemon brothers crisis, now much economy in this world can stand up to a recession of that magnitude, but our economy is good not just because of ability to lure good investment into singapore, but more on cheap Foreign workforce.</p>
              <p>EDB: Sir, you can invest on our country,we got the best infrastructure provern, best AP, best sea Port, best transportation, best financial centre around, hard and good workforce that can work long hours. Rest assure that you can growth with us and beat any of your competitors</p>
              <p>Investor: But in indo china and china, the labour is cheaper, I know singapore is good, but the wages is high, tho you hv a low corporate tax, but your singaporean high wages might dent the profit before income tax.</p>
              <p>EDB: Dun worry sir, we give you foreign workforces, you can employ within a 1 singaporean is to 3 foreigners quotas. So in another words, you get a good country to run your business while having a 3rd world cheap workforce, and when wages are low, the local will accept a lower income inorder to get job.</p>
              <p>So, the investor invested. Now, with cut down on foreigners, you see the growth slow down, but if we are to carry on importing cheap workforce for another 10 years, there will be 4 millions foreigners here, a million more than singaporeans. at the moment it is a 60% locals and 40% foreigners. And that is very high consider a country so desparate to get it economy booming at the expense of its citizens suffering.</p>
              <p>The theory of whatever goes up must come down is a natural theory of gravity and laws of existence.</p>
              <p>But our govt choose to go against such natural laws, it is alway up up and away, and in history, you see the fall of the mighty roman, the once great Qin, the great british empire, the never said die Jap, the chargeable Mongols...and you will see the fall of our country, because nobody can go against the laws of nature of whatever that goes up, must come down.</p>

              <p>Biggest threat is high rental and fuel prices. In other countries, taxi drivers can own the taxis after driving a certain number of years.</p>
              <p>World economy sick; people still need to travel. If they have the time, they can take public transport. If in a hurry or need to go to ulu or destination which needs lots of transfers on public transport, they will take taxi.</p>
              <p>Foreigners allow to drive taxis! this will create more problems on the road. Getting a driving license is easy in other countries, compared to singapore. Just imaging the likes of Ferrari Ma driving a taxi. In his country Red means Go.</p>

              <p>Singapore labour law is good. 44 hours work a week etc.. Too bad that taxi drivers are considered business men. As businessmen, there is no off day, you pay your own cpf and medisave. You not feeling well or even going to die, MC from government hospital also not recognised. Pay the taxi rental.</p>

              <p>Lots of jobs have already been taken over by foreigners. Reason given is because SIngaporeans want a higher pay and are choosy. Newspaper reporting lots of taxi driver choosing and earning $7k.</p>
              <p>If Singapore can employ foreign talents to be news paper reporters, it is only a matter of time before we have foreign talent taxi drivers. Then we will have ft taxi drivers complaining about singapore passengers. Always starts with the minority.</p>

              <p><br>This is call capitalism, and when it is built on a democratic society, it become more worst in the sense of its inequalities.</p>
              <p>Our govt are capitalist govt, they studied management, finacial and business economics more than social science, some dun even take social science, so what you expect from our govt is running a country like a business centre,</p>
              <p>The models of business adopted by all business entities here, including Taxi companies are exact replicas of our govt model or similar, so you tell me, how on earth is our govt going to come with a laws to fix the taxis companies, are you asking them to shoot their own foot??</p>
              <p>Now why govt still hold charity shows to ask you to donate, why govt got no money meh? we got billions of reserves, why must the citizens, after all the social taxes including gst, fuel taxs and so on, still have to give charities, why not govt do it on our behalf with the reserves from other taxation like ERPs and corporate taxes on companies.</p>
              <p>Because when you use the reserve, the sing $$ will fall, and if it fell more than 1/2, just imagine those rich peoples who had 5 millions in their bank under sing dollars, only get 2.4m left, what about those with CPF inside??..this are all fiscal policies, MAS, is the decision maker, it objectives is to grow singapore, and to growth, it must satisfy the rich and hold it reserve strongly inorder to attract peoples to invest with a stable dollars</p>

              <p>A good example of money now is EURO, those who invested in it, can kiss their ass goodbye, same goes to the green back, the US dollars, for euro, it was so strong in the begining of the century, even on par with pounds, and then, now nearly 1/2 its value gone.</p>
              <p>So you see those european who earn euro and put euro in their banks are now poorer.</p>

              <p>It is true that TD is in the lower rung of the society, 2 to 3k per month is consider low, recently the cut off point for lower income is $2,800, anything below it, is consider lower income and is eligible to apply for social benefit like vouchers etc etc from govt agencies like NTUC (must be union member), Community Centres and other help centres from mendaki to sinda to chinese chamber and clans.</p>
              <p>During the last pay hike, a lot of people paid had adjusted up ward more than other years since the turn of the century, this is due to the string of complaints and shock therapy from both employees and economists that singapore needs to reflect a realistic pays inorder to sustain its talent, and not to keep relying on cheap foreigners for it growth that lead to a depressive wages for many years.</p>
              <p>So, i would said, the average singapore income had risen from 2.8 to 4k, with add on allowances, CPF, 13th month AWS,  bonuses, Overtime pay, most can make a better living than a TD. and at the same time, not so stressful and tiring as TD, meaning more life than a TD or Casket Driver like me.</p>
              <p>Let then, examine into TD income, to increase our income, there only 2 ways,</p>
              <p>1. Increase fares? this is a nation decision, because it affect all the people pockets, it can end up with less paxs, or that paxs expect a better cabs condition and driver services. It must justify the cost of living, inflation and able to benchmark the paid of outside taxis job. But then, driving taxis is a business, there is no negotiation rights. It either you make it (huat) or dun make it (OBK)</p>
              <p>2. Lower rental and fuel? This can never work, for many years, never had see a Taxis company lower it rental to help their cabbies on cost of living, fuel might see a bit reduce, but the increase alway outsmart the reducing.</p>
              <p>So you see, as a TD, we are alway staring down a barrel, any increase of fares will add on with the increase of rental with newer cabs and fuel, coupled with inflation that is all time high from 4.5 to more than 5% every other quarters, our income  may still able to sustain for a while, but the cost living will go up and in a long run, we will be a dminishing lots in the society. Therefore, all being thing being this way, the only threat is therefore ourselves, we must decide, to move, to stay put or to strive ON.</p>
