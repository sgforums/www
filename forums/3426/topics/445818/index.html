              <p>Once the NY period ends, I got to reconsider my options.</p>
              <p>Tentatively I got 2 offers, so it would be much appreciated if some seasoned drivers can give me advice accordingly for both cases.</p>
              <p>Both are with CDG:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Hirer seeks relief from 10am to 5pm (the non peak hours). What should be range he can charge me for this period?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Currently super relief for 1 hirer. He charge me $40 for 1/2 day.  After CNY, he wants relief for every Sat/Sun night but at normal rate of $50.  Is this the normal trend? He charged diesel at 11cts per km, but since he gave the lower rental for this CNY period, I decided to kao tim a bit and pay at 13cts, but he will have to top up and wash the vehicle.</p>
              <p>Previously I full time relief, so was paying the full rate anyway, but now no way I will drive 6-7 days in return for no benefits from the hirer, also I doubt I want to push myself that much this year, maybe a max of 4,5 and sometimes 6 day driving.</p>
              <p>And if No 1 doesn't work out, I think I might just pay the $88 a year and drive Silver, ad hoc whenever I want with Beach Rd. Of course the vehicles might not be up to scratch but it might be a price to pay for a while, until maybe I switch to driving Red.</p>

              <p>fuel comsumption is about 10% more than a sonata . 1 liter can go about 9-10km</p>
              <p>maybe you should try looking out any other hirer with other relief option </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>12 hours shift on sat &amp; sun at $50 for Sonata is resonable or standard rate for regular basis,imho.I am also a Sat &amp; Sun CDG Sonata night relief.As for diesel,depend on your driving pattern too.I would said 11cts to pump yourself is resonable rate too.For my driving pattern,its about 10cts to 11cts on average per km.I always show my diesel reciept.If you offer him 13cts but he pump himself and wash car,its also fair enough.But you still have to see what he say lor,every hirer different character so is the relief driver too.Maybe its would be better if some CDG hirer come in here to give their opinion,at least we can see what both side are thinking.</p></div>

              <p><br>kenteolk , Joe has got massive experience driving a cab . Esp at night .</p>
              <p>Never will be difficult , for the beginning yes , takes a while to switch .</p>
              <p>After that . . . fuck lar sup sup water .</p>
              <p>Just sweep . He drive night , so night very easy to drive .</p>
              <p>Now drive night no need call one , people flag for you , just stop ; no people flag , just Q at TS , saw u just sweep , income same with grapping calls , or slightly less sometimes , sometimes faster . Depends on destinations as well . But no need headache no show , waiting time , jon cancell or u-turns . 25% extra , why not ?</p>
              <p>If got calls , taxi stand surely got people . Sweep $3 extra , why not ?</p>
              <p>If taxi stand long Q of taxis , we dun need to wait for calls , plus 25% surcharge , Competitiveness for calls and high risk of no shows and job cancelled .</p>
              <p>At night booking fee $3.30 , if with CBD $3 , good money means competition is there , unlike day shift , $2.30 , if convenience then take .</p>
              <p>Night time as long as got call , if within 5 mins , surely take one inside cbd .</p>
              <p>That is why some hire a comfort for obvious reasons at night .</p>

              <p>bro teolk,</p>
              <p>think of the rest 11000 non CDG taxis on the road how they make it?</p>
              <p>I start as a Premium(KIA) hirer when i got my TVDL,  in between drove cdg, then back to premium again,  more relax and less stree but i don't make less.</p>
              <p>it is and td who start driving must learn and gain experience, then in long run you will not have problem making a living,</p>
              <p>remember cdg don't give you a hard rice bowl, complain also sometime don't tell you until suddenly one day you receive notice to terminate the you will know why.</p>
              <p>recently some cdg td came to me , me refer them to drive i30 make some referal fee, but never ask them why leave, it's their choice, i don't ask as i guess is always the same reason, these td as i know hardly got complain one</p>

              <p>Thanks to all who gave their views here. Of course as a TD from 2 different eras, 90s and present, I got some experience, but since I restarted driving again 2 years ago, it's good to gather news and experience of other drivers, even newer ones.</p>
              <p>We all can learn things, and I learnt a lot here. Of course not everything learnt can be applied to the way/style I drive, but it's good to gain knowledge and at least you can have an idea when you're in such a situation.</p>
              <p>For example, some old TDs will scoff at some the things we raise in here, and they may have a point sometimes, but it's also now a very different era of TDriving then say in 90s, let alone 80s.</p>
              <p>I also got a culture shock when I restarted, Comfort was very good in the 90s, suddenly now, they have become this giant money making organisation and the difference in how they treat drivers now is very different, but thats another matter.</p>
              <p>I just wanted some advice here, and thanks to you guys, I more or less have confirmation now</p>
