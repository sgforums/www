              6 years in Limo, is too short to learn and venture to Pte Limo....haha
              
              For me, earliest years of driving TD is very tough, due to my gambling habit, my debt is mountain high....
              
              Being a TD really save my life, with high determination of settling my debt, I can drive as early as 4am and reach home by 12midnight, and sometime just sleep in the crown and start driving again, not forgetting that during those time, meter only jump 10cent.....
              
              So now debt free, mindset also change a lot, maybe one day will consider Pte Limo, but present moment very contended as what is it now, many thanks.....

              <p>That will be the safety way to enter into new limo vehicle with higher rental.</p>
              <p>I am not those safety man, i enjoy the excitement of taking calculated risk.</p>
              <p>Taxi driving is a low entry business, easy to come in and easy to go out. The risk is properly few month of low income and penalty of breaking the contract. It is not that severe that require years to recover.</p>
              <p>For the new merc, the opportunity, the exposure, the acceptance will be greater then others, and hence it will provide higher chances of securing value customer base and establish our personal account at a shorter time.</p>
              <p>And not forgetting on the enjoyment of a virgin Merc. People are paying at least $20,000 depreciation for a few months to a year of such virgin enjoyment.</p>
