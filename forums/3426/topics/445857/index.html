              <p>Ct2220,</p>
              <p>I also got a similar case as your silver award friend uncle Lim, but I was never suspended. No action was taken.</p>
              <p>For my case, it was not a car horning case, but it was a case of a car driver who did not like my driving style so he accused me of throwing a cigarette butt out of the window along the expressway.</p>
              <p>2 days later IO called me and asked whether I was along this stretch of road at this time.</p>
              <p>My standard response was always SOP - I do not remember.</p>
              <p>IO next question was did I throw a cigarette butt out the window. I straight away lost my temper and screamed into the handphone and fucked the IO because I am NON smoker. He said no need to shout. Of course I continued shouting. It was never a crime to shout at anyone. I told the IO if he got balls just tell who the fucker was. I will hammer him jialat.</p>
              <p>Case closed. No letter from CDG either. I got my CDG year end bonus, just no PB niah.</p>
              <p>So really I do not know why your friend and me got such different treatment. I was never ever once asked to go down to CDG to drink coffee.</p>
              <p>But just maybe, our acting skills differ. What and how you say things can change the outcome.</p>
              <p>Another case, there is an old maxi uncle who refused to pick up an Indian pax with alot of luggage and going to very very far location for the standard airport flat fare. He was very direct in his rejection, so he also got a direct 1 month suspension.</p>
              <p>For my case, I also kenna similar situation, but I was able to 'reject' the pax without suspension. It is all about diplomacy and how you talk and giving valid excuse. Say the right words, and nothing will happen to you.</p>
              <p>All these scenarios and the correct response must be programmed in your head. When the time come, you just follow SOP and put up a good wayang.</p>

              IMO, Mr Lim's case won't result in that way had he talk in a courteous manner.
              
              And also since it's words against words, IO can't really acertained the actual fact and gave him warning letter.. If he did, Mr Lim can go to higher authority for resolve.
              
              Most probably his bad tempered and rashness (ä»¤åŒ—ä¸�å¹²äº†) resulted in the unfortunately ending.;(

              <p>As I know, CDG IO's conduct investigations thru the phone, never thru kopi sessions.</p>
              <p>I kena twice, one of which was a woman falsely accusing me of punching her recently. IO queried me over the phone and advised me to lodge police report to cover my arse as it was a serious allegation of assault.</p>
              <p>IO was a Mr Lim on both occasions.Maybe he's in charge of citycab only...</p>
