              Today caddy care having their annual lunch at Civil Servant Club off Race Course Road.
              
              Guest of Honours, CEO of CDG, Mr Yang reassure Limousine Drivers that CDG will seriously look into the rental of this coming new batches of limousine vehicle....
              
              During the whole lunch session, this was the hottest topic debated. The top notch CDG limousine drivers had different view, and Mr Yang promise he will ensure the new structure of rental price shall be as comparable as market practice....
              
              It sound promising but who care, not my turn yet.....
              
              And I anticipated that the new rental price will be something between 155-160 inclusive of GST.

              <p>Gentlemen,</p>
              <p>I think we should relook on matters that causes problem to taxi drivers in a more pragmatic perspectives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What we joined or participated in social cricle such as Cabby care, union association or any other activities created by taxi companies are what you choosed to participate, it is not a force participation,  whatever you gain or lost in contributing to the acitivities is therefore, should not be in the concern of your driving discipline, rules and regulations. That you have to be clear first. If you join cabby care, you are in truth finding a route to contribute back to the society in what the society had given you so far,  your consicience is clear and happy in what you are doing which is deem as good deeds. For this, we have to learn about division of matters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What you wears, what you do, is your own problem, but if you get caught up with the rules and regulations of what the companies specified, take it as a man and move on, either you change for the better or you quit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not siding any companies rules and regulation here, but we must understand our action is actually our result, the cause and effect  play hand in hand. You go in and sign out a cab with your eyes opens, you read the rules, you agreed, you rented it out, make your living out of it.     </p>

              <p>Honestly what is the problem whether the car was assembled in
              India or China or Germany ?</p>
              <p>Have you not read about Lambo and Ferraris going up in flames in
              Malaysia and Singapore due to fuel leakage ? What about 7 series
              BMW giving owners problems ? What about Fragance boss sueing Rolls
              Royce for a problematic Phantom ?</p>
              <p>Was it for quality assurance or resale value ? At the end of the
              day, its all up in your mind. You felt good, so its good lor. You
              think something sucks, then to you it sucks lor. </p>
              <p>The most valuable skill was still the sales and marketing ppl
              who managed to buy shit, packaged it as gold and sold it at
              platinum prices.</p>

              <p>Cars (besides taxis) <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">have add-on value</span></span></strong> if assembled near to the place of origin.  For example, Toyota Alphard, imported directly from Japan normally cost more &amp; higher selling price (OMVs) than those assembled in Thailand or in Phillipines.</p>

              I don't know how many forumers here like me, CDG since day one....
              
              When I started, cumfcuk and city cab not merge yet, so city cab not my business those time....
              
              Our MDT is origin from city cab, cumfcuk those time still using sappfire set, if you know how to play with co-ordination, sure tio call one.....
              
              So how good is other company? I don't know? But I know cumfcuk had provided me with all the supports for so many years.....using my two hands holding steering wheel, I manage to bring up my children, provide them with all the necessary and holding a good job (not TD o)....
              
              So after all this years of changes, and changes.....the basic of TD is still driving, no drive, no money......
              
              No money than no honey....hahaha

              Forum good place to destress.....
              
              I use to wonder how other's survive not driving CDG....
              
              Around my kakis, mostly CDG, some switch, than lost contact.....
              
              Many switch company with no choice, some TL than switch.....
              
              Once not under same umbrella, tcss also very careful....
              
              After found out this site, learn a lot from different company prospect, than analyze myself and try to understand how people feel......
              
              TD use to be very low profile in public eye, until 3 years ago, fare hike.......
              
              No matter what, nothing will arise from this forum, people only can use it as a guild line pertaining to TD....to locate my taxi number real life is as easy as ABC for CDG, but to locate POB3173 in cyberspace, is like big ocean find needle......
