              <p>Yesterday, passed Queens street, 8:15pm. Saw Malaysian family desperate for cab as I walk past for dinner. Out of kindness, I told them to call for cab as they cannot get cab by waiting, they took up phone and started dailing. After I came back I saw SG family flag a CDG crown and TD just drove past. The (under 14 year old) daughter shouted at taxi "arsehole!" while both parents just watched. As I approached my cab and opened door. Father chased after me and asked me if I would ferry them. I asked back if they would consider calling for cab and father backed off. I told him "I am not willing to ferry your family and your kid need to learn some manners."</p>
              <p>They, need you to help them get home. They, give you the respect of a dog. With the $10 fare they pay! I told him TDs are honest income earners, they deserve a bit more respect which obviously many people are doing otherwise. Read every other internet news, even in yahoo. so many sg people curse at us during the same time they need us most. Today onwards, I offer no more grace to fellow Singaporeans! Before this, sometimes i see the desperate look on their face I forsake the extra CBD income to ferry them. Ungrateful basterds. Tomorrow onwards you get one less TD driving past the outskirts of CBD anymore. Look, TDs money are hard earned! Some retards make it sound like easy and lucrative job. IT IS NOT! TAKE IT FROM LEE KUAN YEW! YOU PAY PEANUTS YOU GET MONKEYS! I fxxking slog 6 hrs to cover rental and diesel and slog for another 6 just to make profit! It is definately not paying me enough to get humiliated by commuters! Dun take this the wrong way. Not that I'm high handed, but to hear a family actually cursing at TD. I think too much for me to swallow right after dinner. The low wage is certainly NOT helping!</p>

              <p>Aiya, what to do, to many, TD is consider under the maid category, I am sure many peoples if not fark infront of us, will fark at the back of us, we also do not know, but then, why bother to know, just take our $$, do our decent living and life goes on.</p>
              <p>If you are going to get emo over all these peoples reaction and action, then it will make your driving more and more difficult, for me simple, just on meter, pax fark me, i fark back, pax respect me , i respect double back. Journey end, press meter, collect fares and the next minutes forget them liao.</p>
              <p>If the kids no manner, shame to the parents, but that is their problem, one day the kids may also call his or her own parents asshole, we not happy, don't stop lor, drive thru them, if complain, tell company these people call our company asshole, see how the company react</p>

              <p>From my experiences, 80% of the time when i greet pax with "hi, hello", get no response n I feel very irritated. I mean, this is basic courtesy right. What are parents n teachers teaching our kids.</p>
              <p>Another thing, when they speak to you, they'll go "er, turn left". You got to address the other party when you speak to them right? Like "uncle or mister" or at least an "excuse me".  What are parents n teachers teaching our kids.</p>

              <p>What to do? Once I was in CBD, got so many ppl waiting near Boat
              Quay, but I say be fair, I saw 1 lady waiting at taxi stand
              opposite side, so I avoid all these ppl and go to her.</p>
              <p>She come in and say Good Evening. I said Yes, where can I send
              you. She say Good evening again, I said yes. She said you can say
              Good evening too, but I dont like her tone, so I still say yes.</p>
              <p>She said are you gonna say Good evening, I said why? She got
              out. I said to myself, good luck to you finding a cab.</p>
              <p>So must say good evening good morning good night like Ang Mo
              style, cannt say hello, hi, yes, like Singapore style? You go aunty
              uncle shop, they say &lt; ya you want what ar? Is that wrong?</p>

              </p><p>"Yes" is a very rude way to reply to a greeting. It just doen't sound welcoming in all type of tone you can have. I ignore and rude to those sales person when they greeting me with "Yes" when i enter their shop.</p>
              <p>Basic communication skill is essential, why respond in a way that you doen't mean it and let people misunderstand you? It might seem be a culture, but it is improper manner to socialise.</p>
              <p>You practice fair and shown caring to passes by pax and proceed further to serve those in Taxi Stand, why just can't finish it with beautiful words?</p>

              <p>From the perspectives of pax and taxi driver communication, one skill that is nicel and very much good, that is, if can do, do not ask for the destination first, I know most brothers would ask impatiently for the destination, and that erases all other good communication. As a TD, try not to be a straightlace guy, allow pax to fit in first, follow by greeting, all these takes only less than a minute. Most of the time, pax will tell you where to go, and that sit in well with them, cos they feel in control and the TD is calm and understanding. Once pax open mouth first of where they want to go, you can nicely ask them any prefer roads and so on.</p>
              <p>Set the tone for the enjoyable ride, no doubt we are anxious and tire at time, but paxs are also tire, may waited quite a while, or got work or other busy thing in their mind, I personally hv met a few paxs telling me seldom they met Cabbies who never ask for destination upon sat down. But interview of course is different, that one, haven't sit down yet.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Got paxs especially those ladies pax who come in, talk about the rain, the hot whether or the mrt breakdown, then after awhile, they realize I am not moving, just meter on, then they laughed and tell me the destination, and for the whole journey, we can talk joke over her forgetfulness of that she is in a cab.</p>
