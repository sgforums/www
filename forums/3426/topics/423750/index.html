              <h1 class="storyheadline">When you need cabs...</h1>
              <p class="storyheadline">TRY getting a taxi on Friday or Saturday within the city. The taxi queues are inevitably long and when one tries to call for a cab, the waiting time just to be connected to the operator is unbearably long and, frequently, you get the message that there are no cabs in the area to answer the call</p>
              <div class="ststory_large">
              <p>Sunday nights are equally frustrating. I asked a cabby why this was so, and he replied that it was because taxi drivers preferred to be home with their families.</p>
              <p>The problem extends to weekday afternoons in the Central Business District, where it is problematic getting a cab. Last week, I tried to hail a taxi at Raffles Place at 3.30pm to go for a business meeting, but finally gave up after waiting for 10 minutes and took the MRT instead.</p>
              <p>A few days later, I needed to guide my colleagues from abroad to a meeting.</p>
              <p>I decided to call for a taxi in advance, but it took 15 minutes of calling before I finally managed to book one, and another 10 minutes before the taxi arrived.</p>
              <p>We cannot claim to have good public transport when residents who cannot - or choose not to - buy a car do not have a viable alternative.</p>
              <p>Of course, one can take the bus instead of the MRT, but sometimes this isn't practical when travelling with the disabled or the elderly or children, and not all places are convenient to reach by bus.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, one can be forced to wait for up to 20 minutes for a bus.</p>
              <p>The erratic taxi service affects our reputation. It is embarrassing when overseas business travellers complain about how much more efficient Hong Kong's cab system is compared to Singapore.</p>

              TS said " Last week, I tried to hail a taxi at Raffles Place at 3.30pm to go for a business meeting, but finally gave up after waiting for 10 minutes and took the MRT instead."
              
              most probably they can claim the taxi fare.  what is $3 extra for CBD!    so my suggestion is the CBD $3 to start from 12pm (noon) to 12 am (midnight).  so easy to remember for TD &amp; paxs.
              
              why from 12pm to 5pm, we day TDs have to pay CBD surcharges to go in to answer on-call jobs? and sometimes kenna  no-showwwwwwww.
