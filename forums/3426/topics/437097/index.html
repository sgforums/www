              http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIq-EVX-ikE
              
              captured this at my friend place from his father's recording. from understanding, this happened at the bukit batok east ave 3 entry into pie towards changi airport:
              
              1) the Red Cab (right most) was already on the 2nd lane at the traffic light before my friend's father stopped at the same traffic light.
              
              2) when the traffic light turned green, the Red Cab (right most) moved off and blinked left signal one time, just only one time and stopped. It still kept to its own lane at first.
              
              3) nearer to the filter lane just before the entry into the expressway (left most), that Red Cab blinked left signal one more time, but again just only one time and stopped. But this time it also suddenly drifted heavily leftwards into my friend's father lane..
              
              4) then just at the end of the filter lane at the mouth of the entry into the expressway, that Red Cab forced its way in front and completely left side into my friend's father path, causing my friend's father to brake, almost causing a collision.
              
              5) when my friend's father tried to flash him to warn him of the near accident, that Red Cab driver stamped on brakes to try to create yet another rear end collision, and then as if thats not enough, flashed hazard lights to warn the driver behind (my friend's father) better watch out dangerous driver in front (Red Cab)!
              
              Experienced drivers, appreciate any advice you can offer

              <p>Cutlane, I am not siding the TD. This is a clear cut SELFISH Singaporean style of driving. Why can't he (yr dad) slow down and let him go? why can't he practise defensive driving? </p>

              <p>No need the signal to already know the Wish's intention to filter left. Somemore left lobang there, what's the point of closing the lobang when its so obvious that the Wish is intending to enter that lobang?</p>
              <p>The Wish driver another kuai lan one. Don't signal machiam he king of road. Won't hurt to try to cut behind TS's car and be patient right?</p>

              at first i kinda surprised by the general consensus here, that as long as someone behaves desperately then recklessly then thats ok to take own initiative without fear of fault. my and my friend's point of view is the Red Cab should have signaled readily, slowed and filtered in respectively but instead it took matters into its own hands and chose to implicate the burden of blame onto other drivers around it. change of lane shouldnt disrupt the flow of traffic in all lanes involving. but then again maybe i shouldnt be too surprise.

              Hah? Cannot be lah. Something must be wrong here. 
              
              You made a terrible mistake. 
              That taxi cannot be red. Red driver will never do this.

              <p>Do you want to send him to prison? Give him a death sentence? or got his license revoke, lost his job, then cannot find a new job, no money for family, wife and children leave him, then he commit suicide?</p>
              <p>What the big deal here about that taxi? or is it because it is a Taxi and that's why it is a big deal?</p>
              <p>A mature gentleman will not take this as an issue, he knows that such incident do happen, it is part of defensive driving.</p>
              <p>Only the ego and arrogance one are expecting all vehicle to behave to his personal liking, will not overtake him, will not cut into his lane..... etc. And seeking for a punishment once someone offended him, this is Fxxking UGLY.</p>
