              TD scenario:
              
              It is a warm and humid Sunday night around 11.00 pm.   
              2 cab stopped side-by-side at a 3 lane traffic junction, both are empty and 'yao'.  
              End-of-the-day shoppers should had mostly been sweep by other TD, but there could be some late pax for a flag down.
              Traffic light counting down on the other way ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... Red.
              The light infront of both cab turn green, both uncle floor the accelerator within mill-seconds of the light change, trying to be ahead for the possible pax.  
              Falling behind could mean that need to cruise empty and to find pax.
              
              Obvious, the inner lane cab would try to stay in the advantage position to grab any available pax.
              
              ... the rest ... haha ... let the imagination fly.
              
              
              So if many non-TD see TD are the usual suspect as reckless driver, why would they  want to drive like one too?   
              In this case do not give away even that RED TD has the intention to filter in.
              
              
              I agree that the best way to drive, regardless of TD or non-TD, is to best defensively.

              <p><br>no way man</p>
              <p>up north driving habits far far worse.</p>
              <p>motorbike boh cheng hu, cars dont give way, and a lot of road hoggers and plenty of dangerous driving. a lot of accidents. the last time I was up north, I passed a fatal accident (yet another) where 5/6 occupents killed. driver lost control and the SUV went straight into the bridge pillars. I was surprised there was even a survivor, when the vehicle was actually WEDGED between the pillars.</p>
              <p>another vivid one I saw was one where a proton wira fell into the longkang. the engine actually flew off. don't think anyone survived that also. that one was caused by the driver attempting to overtake on the small road with blind-spot, then he last minute saw oncoming traffic and swerve into longkang.</p>
              <p>and many of the traffic lights are like our trains....show 99 seconds but never move for minutes!</p>

              <p><br> no way man</p>
              <p>up north driving habits far far worse.</p>
              <p>motorbike boh cheng hu, cars dont give way, and a lot of road
              hoggers and plenty of dangerous driving. a lot of accidents. the
              last time I was up north, I passed a fatal accident (yet another)
              where 5/6 occupents killed. driver lost control and the SUV went
              straight into the bridge pillars. I was surprised there was even a
              survivor, when the vehicle was actually WEDGED between the
              pillars.</p>
              <p>another vivid one I saw was one where a proton wira fell into
              the longkang. the engine actually flew off. don't think anyone
              survived that also. that one was caused by the driver attempting to
              overtake on the small road with blind-spot, then he last minute saw
              oncoming traffic and swerve into longkang.</p>
              <p>and many of the traffic lights are like our trains....show
              99 seconds but never move for minutes!</p>

              <p>Very simple solution. Just give way. Put yourself in the shoes of this taxi driver. If your car length is halfway in front of the car. would u speed up and overtake or slowdown and let him pass then filter?</p>
              <p>If you slow down then filter, u would end up stopping at that lane and let numerous car to go before you can finally filter... If that happens... all those cars behind this taxi will say stupid why stop why cannot filter?</p>
              <p>If he slow down and let this car move before filtering, What makes you so sure that the car behind this car will let him filter too? What if he speed up and close the gap and not let this taxi filter in?</p>

              <p>Therefore road knowledge is important for both self and the other driver. You can know why the other driver is edgy if you know there is a turn ahead.</p>
              <p>But on the signaling part. Sometime ago there was complaints that Singapore drivers do not signal, they just drive without signaling.</p>
              <p>Things has improved slightly, they signal now, but signal for themselves.</p>
              <p>Yes, signal for themselves.</p>
              <p>They signal to cover themselves,  when asked did they signal they can answer, looking innocently, "Yes".  Signalling <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after</span> you have begun changing lane, and only for three or four flashes is not signalling your intention. It serves no other purpose. But this is what I notice is the norm for car drivers nowadays.</p>
              <p>Majority of TDs still signal their intention ahead. Those last minute signalling and turning is usually because of a slight emergency situation, that can understand. </p>
              <p>The trend of Singapore drivers on signalling has developed into the <em>chiong</em> and then signal. Maybe drivers can trust one another and start to believe the other driver is not a rascal.</p>
              <p>Beside this point, I notice there is now a slight improvement in giving way to others.</p>
