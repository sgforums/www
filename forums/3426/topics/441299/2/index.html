              <p>ok things happen like this... sometime ago 1 la... early morning
              peak hour... tink about 7:45am. Board Cab at Jurong west st 64.
              Destination bukit panjang ring road. i told driver go by PIE-Bukit
              batok road. So the jurong point junction alot of traffic light ma.
              Then this driver chu pattern already. Every green light along the
              road, he purposely step brake... slow down when i see the road
              infront of me... no nearby car for at least 10m.... then slow down
              until... reach traffic light... turn amber. Then he stopped. This
              went on for every traffic light until he went into PIE. Then i told
              him go co-operation road enter PIE he like nvr listen, he go jalan
              bahar exit there(near NTU i tink) then he enter expressway... drive
              to PIE then exit bukit batok road. Usually if go directly through
              cooperation road then pie then bukit batok road, reach bukit batok
              road jus nice $6 + $2plus peak hour charge. Then on bukit batok
              road... bloody the road so empty he drive so slow and traffic light
              green light he purposely slow down again... saw the speedo meter,
              was at 40km/h. After that near destination, ask him drive me to
              petrol station, to lemme withdraw cos i no cash. By the time
              everything done... bloody my cost $20+...$5 more than normal
              fare... trip is 15min longer than usual cab... so i got pissed
              off... paid him $15 and i walked off. What do fellow cab drivers
              tink?</p>

              <p>If u not happy his service, alight nearby bus stop take another cab, no charge. when u notice tat he purposely go slow, why must U tolerate to completed the journey then find fault. Thinking of later can pay less.</p>

              <p><br>Correct, some lady got some mental problem one, knn, all kinds of problem throw at TDs, from work to family problem, CB, TDs is to fetch you to your place, and you gudie him along, not your audience. Many pax think TD is the sole person to bring him or her to the destination, but by virtue, both the TD and the Pax must clap inorder to have a happy journey.</p>

              Drive taxi really a tough job huh guys ?
              
              So many stories ....
              
              A few months back , i was bashed by a taxi driver in our neighbour forum .... for not providing good service to customers . His attitude was customers paying us , we must provide good service . 
              
              I told him he still long way to go . . . long way to go .
              
              Then after he drove for 1-2 months , he found out , just like you people , he apologized to me .
              
              He then found out , Singaporeans don't deserve any good service at all .
