              <p>Fark lah, in the market of hirer and relief, there is no
              standards and regulations, some get $48, some $50 and so on, some
              need to wash, some need to help to paid parking, SMLJ also have. It
              is a free hirers and reliefs market out there, got one hirer ask
              for relief, I called him, what is he driving, he said "I drive
              Toyota Sonata", kenna like this also have, too long with toyota
              crown liao.</p>
              <p>Therefore it is up to individual to decided for themselves, as
              someone said, rental give and take $2 to $3 is ok, more important
              is the location, timming and the relationship, if gum and happy,
              take it.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Yep, I agree with you.</p>
              <p>My relief drives 5 days a week(mon to fri) and will pay half rental if unable to drive for these days only.</p>
              <p>For weekends, whenever he request to drive I just take half rental. I believe in being flexible, a little extra $ instead of baking my taxi under the hot S'pore sun and I need to sleep anyway<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p><br>Like this you sabo us, no wonder my hirer said why other put dettol, clean nice nice, you never clean and put dettol, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>You see, people like to compare, hirers sit around, comparing each other relief, and relief sit around comparing each other hirer, so you do good to your hirer, some hirer get to know and become not happy with his own relief. All this make the world go round and round.</p>
              <p>There is a term call Expectation of norm. When you engage to be a relief for a hirer, knows your stand, do not promise heaven or hell, make it simple, because once you start doing better for him, he takes it as the norm, but once this norm start to change, he takes it as rebellious. Just like one day, for example, you forget to dettol for him, he start to put it in his mind and suspect your sincerity.</p>
              <p>Like if I first wash at kiosk for my hirer, then one day, I washed myself, and hirer start to wonder why I never go kiosk and wash, no so clean, and cheating will come into his mind. Therefore, repetitive good can sometime taken as norm. And as norm, it must be done.</p>

              <p>Chief, It'll be nice if my relief can come out with the extra $25 on my off days just like I collect only half rent from him on his day offs...but I think its highly unrealistic to ask a relief to come out with the extra $25(not impossible though).</p>
              <p>Thing is, relief pays the hirer and hirer pays the Taxi company.</p>
              <p>Working days - pay $50, Off days - pay $25, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hirer Off days - pay $75</span>.</p>
              <p>Unless he ownself willing and suggested to also fork out half rent on my off days, its difficult for me to ask, paiseh to ask, to be precise.</p>
