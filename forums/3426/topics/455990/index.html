              <p>Hi all, just want to know what is the market practice for drive once a week.</p>
              <p>I currently drive once a week either on Saturday or Sunday as I have a current full time job.</p>
              <p>In driving CDG and pay $52 to the hirer when I drive from 7am to 6pm.</p>
              <p>Is this the market rate?</p>
              <p>As per verbal agreement with the hirer, I need not pay if I do not drive.</p>
              <p>As I sometimes need to do OT at my workplace, I have a few occasions, I did not drive on either weekends.</p>
              <p>As I feel Paiseh, I on my own pay some top up like $15 or $20 when I do not drive even though the initial agreement was I need not pay when I do not drive.</p>
              <p>I have a feeling that the hirer is not happy as sometimes he take the next day to reply to me through sms if I cannot drive the following week.</p>
              <p>But whenever I do a transfer of $52 for the weekend driving and do not mention that I cannnot drive the next week, he will immediate reply to my sms.</p>
              <p>Should I pay when I dun drive? Is $52 a reasonable amount for 7am to 6pm for either saturday or sunday?</p>
              <p>This kind of timing, I only earn around $70 to $100 for weekend. Normal bo?</p>
              <p>I am around 40 plus of age.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks in advance....</p>

              <p>$52 (full half rent plus less 1 hour) for a Sunday morning? You sure you're saying ok to this?</p>
              <p>Would you do it at this rate? The fact the hirer charge this can tell whther he ok or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For TS, throw la. Sunday or even saturday, CDG got plenty hirers trying to find relief. Of course, the thing as Poolman says about last min, that one a bit fucked up. So this thing must clear before agreement, or renegogiate. Worse case tell the hirer, if he finds your schedule too difficult, he can look for another who can confirm.</p>
              <p>You have a large choice of hirers, choose the one that suits you best.</p>
              <p>Then again as someone said, if you're gonna drive Sunday mornings only of all days, maybe it's better not to drive and rest, unless you really need the income. </p>

              <p>My thoughts on this as a CDG hirer....</p>
              <p>If you need to earn part time income, why fret over maybe a few dollars rental. For eg, extra $5 x 4 days a month is $20 only. It is not as though $5 x 30 days a month = $150 for full time TDs.</p>
              <p>If want discount on rental then must commit every weekend and pay half rental if cannot drive. </p>
              <p>It is a matter of who needs it more. The relief for income or the hirer for rest!</p>
              <p>Main thing is to find the cab that is the most convenient and serves your purpose most. Rental should be secondary I feel. </p>

              <p>Hi all. Thanks for all the replies and feedback.</p>
              <p>I try to reply to all. I drive from 7am to 6pm on alternate Saturday and Sunday for $52 rental as I have a full time job on either weekends.</p>
              <p>I drive to learn and earn abit just in case I kena retrench.</p>
              <p>I am responsible enough to always give my hirer at least one week in advance notice if cannot make it for next week.</p>
              <p>If last minute like on Friday, I cannot drive on saturday ot sunday. I auto mode will pay $26 to hirer.</p>
              <p>My expenses are high like all of you guys, so that why come out to learn and earn a bit though $70 to $100 is not much but better than nothing except got to see people's face when you not sure of the route but generally all are quite ok.</p>
              <p>After drive, than go eat and shop with family. Next day work regular job at 7am. </p>
              <p>Try to balance everything.</p>
              <p>I am sensitive cos hirer when pay him , sure reply.  But mention cannot drive next week and not top up. He take longer or like yesterday till today no reply even though top him up $20.</p>
              <p>That why than come here to ask the seniors here on the practice.</p>
              <p>Today my full time taxi fren ask me to top him up $20 if do not drive.</p>
              <p>I understand what he mean as no half rental come in ma.....</p>
              <p>Thanks again...</p>

              <p>Fark lah, in the market of hirer and relief, there is no standards and regulations, some get $48, some $50 and so on, some need to wash, some need to help to paid parking, SMLJ also have. It is a free hirers and reliefs market out there, got one hirer ask for relief, I called him, what is he driving, he said "I drive Toyota Sonata", kenna like this also have, too long with toyota crown liao.</p>
              <p>Therefore it is up to individual to decided for themselves, as someone said, rental give and take $2 to $3 is ok, more important is the location, timming and the relationship, if gum and happy, take it.</p>
