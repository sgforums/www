              <p><br>In this world, it is a dog eat dog one, and if you are in working class, yes, might be nice to see and look, but a mere admin staff who works and slog for 8 hrs, her paid is being slashed to pay the shareholders, her boss, her superior, her supervisor, her General manager, her Hr manager and so on, end up she gets pieces and bits, whether she is earning high income or lower one, she is exploited gao gao by the society above her. This is called modern slavery at its very best.</p>
              <p>So, people start to think, why should I be exploited by my supervisor, who only point here and there, my manager, who only talk here and there, my GM, who only walk here and there and my MD who dun even need to work.</p>
              <p>Then people start to take control of his or her own life, and most of them go into business, rent a place, start to buy and sell that even if it failed, no regret because it is own decision. Although may get exploited by landlord over rental prices, but that is only one exploitation.</p>
              <p>And when it come to taxi driving, people take it because it is an individual decision and thus, able to control one own life better, want bak bak can get bak bak, want advance call, can get it, and the  things that is exploiting them is non other than LTA and the taxi companies, so in a nutshell, it is still better off then a working class, tho nice to look and see, but not so nice to work and touch on it.</p>
