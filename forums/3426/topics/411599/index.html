              <p>STOMPer <strong>Jared </strong>was shocked to find that the insurance
              claims from a cabby have escalated to more than $80,000, for a minor
              accident two years ago.<br><br>The STOMPer was involved in an accident
              with a taxi. The cabby had got out of his vehicle "with a big smile on
              his face" and the STOMPer thought the incident was resolved when they
              agreed to claim against the STOMPer's insurance.<br><br>Two years later, he received a claim of more than $80,000 for personal injuries from the cabby.<br><br>Jared relates his story in an email:<br><br>"Most
              of us, the working executives are drivers. Every day there is an equal
              chance for every one of us to get involved in a car accident.
              Unfortunately for me, I was involved in a car accident with a taxi in
              July 2008. <br><br>"Along the slip road, the taxi in front of me
              stopped, I too stopped behind him. Seeing that there were no oncoming
              cars, he started to move off, I too stepped on the accelerator to move
              off. However, he decided to brake suddenly and I couldn’t stop my car
              in time.<br><br>"The cabby got down from his taxi with a big smile on
              his face and I was wondering why. I had no prior car accident
              experience to speak of. The cabby seems like a nice person, he checked
              on the safety of everyone first.<br><br>"But the first sentence I said however will not be too pleasing to anyone’s ear. 'Why did you stop?', I asked. <br><br>"After
              checking no one was injured, we agreed to claim against my insurance
              policy. As there was a passenger, we took some photos of each other’s
              vehicle. <br><br>"I thought it was just bad luck and I should let the insurance settle everything. <br><br>"Finally
              after two years, I received a claim from the taxi driver. He is
              claiming against my insurers for $81,240.91 for personal injuries. That
              does not include the repair fees for his taxi. <br><br>"Before this, I
              checked a couple of times and he mentioned he was not hurt. The most
              ridiculous part is he claimed that three of his teeth are fractured
              caused of the accident after a year. He claimed almost $10,000 to fix
              his teeth. However, in his previous medical report, nothing was mention
              about this until a year later. <br><br>"I hope to share my story with
              readers so that everyone can be aware of this and not fall prey to
              profiteers on insurance claims. Insurance is a protection against our
              liabilities and not a tool for profiteers to capitalise on it. <br><br>"I
              have attached some photos to show the seriousness of the accident and
              you will be wondering why the claims escalates to more than $81,000,
              and if it includes the car repair, it is almost $90,000. Now, who still
              dares to drive?"<br><br>Note: The licence plates were masked by the contributor.</p>

              <p>i wonder how come only claiming 80k bill for accident after 2 years?</p>
              <p>come on, no one finds this strange?</p>
              <p>It like strike million dollar toto but claim after a few years, why?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and insurance agencies are bastards anyways, take long time to investigate then try to find any and all excuses as to why cannot claim.</p>
              <p>if the taxi driver can claim then maybe he got contacts inside your insurance company. better switch, all insurance people are assholes and insurance companies are blood suckers</p>

              <p>Cabbies all hope their kids do not end up driving taxis. Congrats if your child makes it to university, but make very sure they study the right subjects. The most useful subjects are directly reflected in the cutoff grades for the local universities. I am copying it here for your reference. The most prized courses are at the top one-third, those in the bottom two-thirds are not as valuable but if your child can network well, still got chance. If your child gets into a course in the first one-third of the list, even if he or she is not the top student, I am pretty certain he or she will huat or at least huat a lot more than driving a cab. I believe some of the courses in the bottom two-thirds are just plain useless, with so many foreign talents out there willing to work for shit salaries. Our minister's children are all in those courses in the top one-third of the list, and zheng hu of course don't allow foreign talents to come in and anyhow compete in these areas at ridiculous prices. So be careful what course your child gets interested in.</p>

              <p><br>from your question, it is very clear that you are either an insurance agent or you have never deal with an insurance agent before</p>
              <p>let me list why insurance agent are assholes</p>
              <p>1 - when they call you up to tele-market their 'new' insurance/savings/investment plan to you, they do not understand the phrase "I am not interested". they need you to repeat that at least 5 times before they are willing to hang up. there should be a law againts pushy tele-marketing tactics and in USA there is but sucky sin-a-poor dont have.</p>
              <p>2 - they drive up the premiums on anything you buy from them, do you know that part of your monthly payments goes directly to them?</p>
              <p>3 - they like to sell you stuff, get alot of money then quit (cos even if they quit, they still get paid because all their previous customer is still making monthly payments). so now you have a situation that the customer is making monthly payments but have no one to support them  on their enquiries, if customer stop making the monthly payments, they forfeit whatever they had paid so it is a lose-lose situation. yes, if you complain enough, the insurance company may assign another agent to assist you but this 'agent' is either a newbie and you are his/her guinea pig or someone who is under performing as their best performing agents are busy getting new sales.</p>
              <p>why insurance companies are assholes</p>
              <p>1 - takes years to 'investigate' claims even for very clear cut cases</p>
              <p>2 - they have employees dedicated to finding fault with your claims, these employees performance bonus depends on the number/amount ($) of claims they can deny you.</p>
              <p>3 - you belong to a family with a history of diabetics/sufferer of heart diseases or cancer/smokers = high premiums for you</p>
              <p>3 - you missed out any medical details of your family = denied claim when anything happens</p>
              <p>4 - claims for experimental treatments will be denied even when trials are 100% successful.</p>
              <p>5 - when investments they sell go bust, they are sorry that their agents "may not have" (read - did not) explain the risks clearly to their customers</p>
              <p>6 - when investments they sell go bust, they are sorry that there is nothing they can do as their agents had quit and they cannot 'investigate' if their agent use pushy/strong arm/high pressure tactics for sales</p>
              <p> 7 - they deem that it is the customer's fault when any misunderstanding arise, even if it is due to their agents only being able to speak broken English/Tamil/broken Mandarin even though 100% of their target market do not speak these languages,</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I fully agree with PedoBear. Everything he said is absolutely true. When people try to sell me policies, I straight away zoom into specific claims and probabilites of it occurring and ask the agent why certain events are not in it because it is so common. To me, insurance companies are casinos disguised as sheep. When you buy an accident or illness policy, you are basically placing bets against the insurance company. They can dress up their policy all they like, but certain illnesses and accident types are specifically excluded, and claimable cases occur under very exact circumstances. So put it this way, if the insurance company is doing well, it is because most of their clients have lost their bets. Perhaps that few hundred dollars used to hedge against a detrimental event gives them comfort. So be it. Most clients lost money at the end of the day. Put it this way, if a bank cannot generate high returns on your savings account without any insurance liabilities, what makes u think the insurance company can generate even higher returns without resorting to even riskier investments to generate the necessary returns to cover claims? And if the investment arm of the insurance company can successfully generate those high returns, why would they want to bother with the insurance business unless there is a ready pool of people ready to part with their hard earned money to hedge against events that are very very unlikely to happen? Because if it happens with sufficient frequency, the insurance company will collapse for sure unless the premiums go up. Good game.</p></div>

That is what i did to Aviva, call them to terminate, after few weeks still no news, call up agent, agent questioned  recommend this and that and end up like kind of do not want to terminate or opts for change in policy. Then finally I make up my mind, go down to shenton way and tell them to cancel it once and fall out. Out came a check after 2 hours, I cashed it, take a nice cab ride home, help my cabby brothers during peak hour and cbd charges.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Life policies that do not have any riders like total permanent disability or critical illnesses still can keep. If got rider portion just go down to their office and remove it, but keep the life policy. You will get back a nice sum of money after say 20 years. If the premium is like $50/month, try to continue lor. If you terminate early, sure lose alot of money. Mistake was made years ago, so just suck it up for a few more years and terminate with some profit at least lor. But of course sometimes we get fed up, maciam pay and pay but get nothing back, and the the insurance company still want to find more ways to squeeze more money from u.</p></div>
