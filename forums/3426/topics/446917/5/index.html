              <p>U r wrong. The durian head in maxicab line ruined many fellow
              maxicabbies rice bowl. The damage is very significant. Every hotel
              in SIN already got a maxicab durian head. Those that dont already
              got trouble with the law before.</p>
              <p>U drive normal cab will never experience what i say. It is 2
              different worlds. I talk some more, more tidbits fall out.</p>
              <p>No need to get worked up. Those assholes getting busted will
              benefit many in maxicab biz. No impact on your bottom line at
              all.</p>
              <p>Some durian heads are honorable nice chaps. Others are very
              hungry for money. Profitting at other's expense is ok for u ?</p>
              <p>U can continue to respect your friendly durian head. Perhaps he
              was really nice to u. But it does not apply to all those in
              7-seaters. You never kena so you will never know what i talking

              <p>Unfortunately the way the rules are structured here, we are compelled to break some of them.</p>
              <p>For every rule LTA implements supposedly to benefit us, they introduce another 2 to punish us.</p>
              <p>If you were to question every single taxi driver in Singapore, I'm sure all of them would admit at 1 point or other to have broken at least 3 rules implemented by LTA.</p>
              <p>Can we discuss them here? Absolutely not.  LTA doesn't support us, it's basically there to punish us especially now when according to them, taxi driving is lucrative.</p>
              <p>If we were to publish whatever tactics, methods or experiences in breaking some of those rules, be they from limo driver or just ordinary TDs, you can be assured that LTA will come up with something to make life even more difficult.</p>
              <p>We can discuss many things here, but some topics are best communicated in person or in more secure forums.</p>
              <p>LTA officers and taxi companies definitely pour thorugh forums like this. Even if not for catching culprits or making rules, it can be also for their knowledge. We cannot stupidly make the mistake of being totally forthright here.</p>

              <p>Yes, fully agreed here. I came into this line, though reluctantly, to earn an honest living. The fact that the fullerton case was handled by the CPIB is self explanatory.</p>

              <p>The remaining durian heads, are mostly nice uncles. Respectful people. I do not wish to dig their business any deeper.</p>
              <p>BCL you driving transcab is definitely clueless. Such issues never crossed my mind in a sonata, crown or even a mercedes. Too busy sweeping lah. MDT got job take lah. Walkie nearby just take lar. After 10-11 hrs driving, I was too shack to think of anything.</p>
              <p>Maxicab bo siang hor. Different ball game altogether. This is where durian heads who got no morals and ethics can really inflict damage. Their profit is my loss. I am farking furious, but not with all, just some.</p>

              really cocky because they are highly skilled and talented, but
              sibei hao lian. Never die before. Many are waiting to see this
              bugger die cock stand. </p>
              <p>The remaining durian heads, are mostly nice uncles. Respectful
              people. I do not wish to dig their business any deeper.</p>
              <p>BCL you driving transcab is definitely clueless. Such issues
              never crossed my mind in a sonata, crown or even a mercedes. Too
              busy sweeping lah. MDT got job take lah. Walkie nearby just take
              lar. After 10-11 hrs driving, I was too shack to think of
              anything.</p>
              <p>Maxicab bo siang hor. Different ball game altogether. This is
              where durian heads who got no morals and ethics can really inflict
              damage. Their profit is my loss. I am farking furious, but not with
              all, just some.</p>

              Honestly my heart goes out to Poolman...
              
              Despite his effort and time to moderate this forum, a mistake which I don't even consider a mistake, he kana left and right.
              
              Being moderator is a thankless job and how many of you people can do something like poolman??? I strongly believe Poolman has the right to decide coz he is the moderator!
              
              If anyone think he can do a better job, go take over la....
              
              It easy to criticize but difficult to do a good job.
              
              I hope this incident will not dampen Poolman dedication to this forum.
              
              Jia you Poolman!!!

              Ok after some heated interesting debates , let's come to one conclusion .
              
              As a moderator , i have to read most of the ingredients before i throw all into the bin .
              
              Limousines thread can still be posted . It will never be banned . And now , not even the word discourage . In fact , we encourage more experience Limo dvrs to share with us info which most newer Limousine would love to learn .  
              
              As for those classified Limousines issues , pls bear in mind , the level of sensitivity . Which can be reveal ? which is not supposed to reveal ? because we are all in the public eye , or media are watching us . Many more people are watching us .
              
              Pls post in such a way , we are protecting the majority of the Limousine drivers , not just one or two . Or jeopardising their daily routine . 
              
              They have their ways of bringing food on their tables .
