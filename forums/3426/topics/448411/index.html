              <p>Whether you drive 1 day, 1 week, 1 month or 1 year, makes no difference.</p>
              <p>When your next shift start, go to the cab, take all your barang barang out, put the key inside, whereever  you think is best, ignition, dashboard, sideboard etc, open your driver's door, lock all doors, hold your driver's door and close it, the doors will be locked. </p>
              <p>Then later on, be it 1, 2 , 3 hours or before the end of your shift, sms him and tell you returned the key. End of story. No need to entertain his reply or calls.</p>
              <p>You drive CDG got many hirer. You are relief, you get no benefit, so the next hirer, make sure, you talk terms clearly witht he next one. Don't agree, find another, simple?</p>

              <p>Alvin, if you want to be a relief that's fair, both to you and your hirer (don't care what he wants or thinks, fair is fair, everyone can see), then my advise is:</p>
              <p>1) Discuss rent.  Should be at $50, unless brand new cab, the older it gets, the lesser the rent becomes. But $50 is a fair price for Sonata.</p>
              <p>2) Diesel - Always a problem. Newer vehicles consume less, older more. Day driving consumption should be more because of more start, stops, jam. Queueing also affects consumption. Agressive driving also has an effect. You should know your own pattern and later on your hirer's. My weekend hirer charge me, 1.11 for his new cab, but I offer 1.13 but he does washing. But of course, i will do basic wiping also. You can consider this.</p>
              <p>3) Washing - 1 party should do and it should be shared. But you can make some arrangements like I did for the Sonata. For my weekday Azera, we split the washing, and pump individually - 1st click plus 1-2 dollars more.</p>
              <p>4) Parking - if he stays far away, and you need to collect vehicle or take a cab there, parking is entirely his.</p>
              <p>5) Off days - $25 is quite normal, but can easily be countered by replacing days.</p>
              <p>6) Lateness- If not more than 30 mins, give advance notice, sms 2-3 hours earlier, so the other party can either accept or reject. Best is to return on time, but depends on circumstances.</p>
              <p>7) Quitting - No need for advance if the issue is caused by 1 party breaching the agreement, but if caused by external factors, like you got another job etc, then courtesy dictates anywhere from 2 -7 days notice.</p>
              <p>Well that's my view.</p>
