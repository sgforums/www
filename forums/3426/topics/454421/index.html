              <p>Smart brother!, I think you hv to agree with me that at any one time, there are many private luxury cars speeding down all expressway, sometime I also get horn or highlighted by them to give way, but why alway TD, lorries, pick up and private buses get caught??</p>
              <p>At any one time, there are 70,000 private cars on the road in day time, in 2000, there are only abt 37000 2.0cc and above car, but by 2011, there are 102,500 2.0cc and above OTR, 276% increase, that is why 2.0cc COE is now very high.</p>
              <p>Taxis, tho stand at 28,000, not all are on the road, some OMO will be sleeping or resting, so I guess about 20,000 on the road, 20,000 against 70,000 on the road, and the statistic show that 25% caught speeding are Taxis, 25% lorries, 15% pick up and buses, 25% are motorcycle and others, only 10% are private cars.</p>
              <p>70,000 against a backdrop of 20,000 on the road, and if you are really a TD on the road, you see so many speeding on lane 1, then why TD get caught more than private cars???</p>

But of course I am pissed with the government. All the cheapo shot take on regular drivers, catch ppl going @ 80 with camera... Cheap shot man! They are not doing their job enough keeping roads safe. More ppl are dying on the road because of shiit attitudes. But baleh baleh say speeding. WTF! The only thing they effective is catching drink driving. This one I support. </p></div>

              <p>Typically speaking, as many had said and known that the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, it is not the mere problem of they are taking much from us, but also the poor prefer to cheat on the poor. This is psychology at it very best, I bet you pick up pax, you also prefer someone of our kind, or when you want to gather or have a break with partner, you also pick people of your kind, some cabby prefer to pick maids, pinoy or indo or even malay paxs<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Same goes to TP, they are mere working class, need quotas to report, if catch no one, can be consider as idle, but to catch a luxury car, he knows the percentage of having to talk and explain and even go court is likelyhood, but to get a taxi, lorries, pick up, motorcycle is layman against layman, no issue, just tell them the offence, issue the ticket and move off, somemore can scold and warn them.</p>
