              <p>one problem with this china made cameras or maybe even the costly ones is they dont have a speed indicator , quite hard to prove to authorities about the speed.</p>
              <p>bro i have seen worse ones . i juz encountered a few weeks ago a citycab crown was going at approx 170 km/h , i cut him at clementi Ave 6 AYE , he damn beh song kept on chasing me , then i was already doing 130 km/h , i was quite surprised , crown leh! so i let him thru and went on to pursue him,</p>
              <p>guess what? i cant even chase him , once my speedo hit 160 km/h i let go of  my accelerator . haha. this one cannot report coz im also speeding :p</p>
              <p>i salute this guy for putting his life at risk in a Crown just so to prove his point :D</p>
              <p>Both cabs were empty at that time.</p>

              <p>if you stop the video at 0.05, you have a case. reckless driving to the motorcyclist.<br><br>otherwise, 0.05 onwards, you too did a few wrong things. just my thoughts.</p>

              <p>From my previous experience:</p>
              <p>Serious moving offences are:</p>
              <p>a) Careless driving</p>
              <p>b) Inconsiderate driving</p>
              <p>c) Dangerous driving</p>
              <p>d) Reckless driving</p>
              <p>Normally for dangerous or reckless, there needs to be an observation of vehicle for about 400m. In your video, this is at most inconsiderate driving at the highest or the lowest changing lanes without signalling. (depends if he appeals an the IO grants a request to reduce the charge). If you were a police officer, even without video the charge could and would stick. But as a civilian, it will depend on your statement, willingness to testify, the video and of course his version. It will involve a lot of time on your part, so that's what you need to consider. Most of ex-colleagues have retired from TP, but technically I believe the driver could be charged if there's a will on the part of the IO.</p>
              <p>For BCL's part, even a video or speed camera in your vehicle cannot be used in court as it not tested and certified. Previously only TP motor-cycles and highway patrol cars had them, the speed gun and now also the camera. Normal patrol cars could not book a driver for speeding but a chase or observation of more than 400m, could easily result in a charge of dangerous or reckless driving.  Those days when I pvte limo driver sometimes, when CIsco of Aetos police riders or cars, I wouldn't even care and continue to drive fast (but of course not until over 120 kmh) If they go at 100, I would go at 110. But now I'm not sure because TP nowadays like to taiko all their duties, so maybe Cisco or Aetos motor-cycles may have been tested and certified.</p>
              <p>The thing to notice is the 2 red lights on their bikes. All these bikes have 2 speedometers, 1 for their own speed and the other to record an offenders, when they click the button, the red lights come on, so take note when you see 2 red lights on a bike, could be a TP bike recording someone's speed. For overhead  bridge hand held cameras, those days can only record 1 particular lane, but now I heard they got a better one that can cover 3 lanes, very clear and of course with your speed.</p>
              <p>And TP riders also have the hand held cameras, but I think this one is for 1 vehicle at a time.</p>
              <p>1 tip though: If you want to go fast, always better to have a leader. Eg: you driving fast but there's a car going even faster than, that car will become the target car not yours normally, of course you can't be 2-300 meters behind him, like that TP will catch you la, easier what.  But for speed cameras, all can be captured, this is only for mobile squad chasing. Normally if you go over 15kmh, they might leave you alone, but speed camera must be careful, expressway I think over by 10-12kmh, you are quite safe, normal road speed camera don't play, under 10kmh at most.</p>

              <p>wow super long post but i agree cameras cannot be used to nail speedsters.</p>
              <p>Actually when all these MIC cameras came into the market a year plus ago , the first few people who bought like me , insg &amp; then Poolman and a few others . We bought with the mindset that it can be used as evidence in the event of an accident.</p>
              <p>Look what the camera is used for nowadays?</p>
              <p>1 fella used it to film the blue cabs flouting laws just so as to take revenge , another fella also use it coz he hate the blues</p>
              <p>then a lot of others use it to film others speeding .</p>
              <p>In time to come , cameras will be used to sabo one another . so much so for its effectivness</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have you seen drivers from lane 1 of expressway cut suddenly cut into the exit of the expressway in a split second at high speed? There are many of these idiots nowadays. I saw one fiat van in PIE right after Stevens rd exit toward Jurong. He speed from lane 1 overtaking a car at lane 2 to a lorry at lane 3 and nearly skidded on the left when he is on a sharp bent, the ground is still very wet due to some rain on Sunday. Then this joker still dare to speed all the way back to lane 1 and cut all along the road. I doubt what is the purpose of pasting that speed limit tag of 60/70km/h as a requirement on van, lorries and buses. LTA and TP bullshit.</div>

              <p>Well.... everybody loves to speed.... i did 60km/h above your previous post before<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">... racing with a Mit evo from BKE to SLE..... dun pray pray with merc <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">.  Nobody will look at their speed-o-meter, only concentrate out front....the heart will be pumping faster than your breathing.</p>
              <p>The Mit evo just have to filter to the 2nd lane... ( even their pickup is great )... but on long run... they will lose out... (as their factory-made speed are limited to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">just 180km/h</span></span></strong>). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
