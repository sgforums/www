              <p>But hor brother ....</p>
              <p>Maybe one can calculate the differences between the cheapest diesel from petrol kiosk with discounts in Singapore vs CDG diesel .</p>
              <p>multiply by the mileage ..... decide on those differences .</p>
              <p>If difference $3 ..... and u thought alot . Then stick with CDG .</p>

              <p>Hey thanks, but I stay in Bishan, so got 3 pumps nearby, but I like your suggestion too.</p>
              <p>The other day I saw 2 citycab at caltex newton pump full tank, but I dont like to kaypo, but whats the difference, does caltex offer something reasonable, I know will be more than CDG, but as you say $5-6 dollars, not need to drive for these 'vampires', worth considering.</p>
              <p>I am thinking of AMK Blk 444 got taxi rental, daily basis, any news on them, is there vehicles in 'reasonable condition' or what advice can you give me, if I want to drive say 4-5 days a week in the new year?</p>
              <p>I think now i drive for my hirer boh wah, maybe now fare hike, at least maybe earning can come back to 2 years ago, but no big deal. I drive everyday, take 1 day off sometimes 2, he take sunday. so far last year only dec 31, he give free rental, this year 3 day he keep, plus every midyear he go Malaysia 4 day, i drive whole day for him. Realy struggle because very hard for night driver to change pattern into day. The sun come out my body lembik already. So i wait see dec 31, he give free rent or not, plus Christmas  eve, chritsmas day and new year eve, i normally wont drive, but i also panchan, he also celebrate and never drive, so i still pay rent, but christmas i use the cab for transport.</p>
              <p>But I think no matter what next year surely cannot drive 6 days anymore, drive night shift no matter how much rest sometimes, your body becomes lembik and you only can drive somedays for 5-6 hours, even last Friday, I sleep alot to prepare for full swing, start late somemore at 10pm, but drive until 12.30am, my body just cannot seem to go on, so bo pian, must return cab. Sat I took off. Sunday start drive at 7.30am rest at 4.30 to 6.30pm then re-start but by 10.30pm, still body cannot respond. Too bad tell him, only pay 1/2 rent for fri nite and sunday whole, rest otang,(cleared by tuesday).</p>
              <p>So far otang some time 1/2 day or full day rent, but i clear within 2-3 days, max 4-5 days, he never say anything or show face. Show face I surely say thank you find someone else relief hor. If I only drive 4-5 days a week got no problem, it;s to help you for the 7 days, that make me sacrisfise and otang. So next year, definitely must put to him. Plus diesel yes I pay $1.13 but I drive night, seldom go and queue, you drive morning, start stop gear 1 gear 2 and go airport line up, I know my payment for diesel also covers your trip, but this I can give and take, even though I know you shake and shake the cab, max $6-7 only, so when I pay $39 for 300km, max you can pump is only $34-35. So when I drive more than 300km or less than 1/2 tank left, I will pump, the rest I let him pump ( I think comfort still give hirer some rebate for diesel, not sure, but I suspect), so if I drive 300km and pump only come $33-35, he LPPL must keep quiet, he make noise, I quit.</p>
              <p>But still, I think in the long run, I am suffering more and thats why I wanna change.</p>

              <p><br>Comfort selling at a lost? you must be joking, do you know the price of crude oil per barrel today? and diesel is the first product from it, in refinery, diesel is the first output follow by different grade of petrol, and the by products of it can be make into comestic, washing and cleaning stuffs, kerosene, thinner and many other stuff including plastic, PVC and so on. Even you steering wheel and front panel are make from oil by product.</p>
              <p>Today crude oil (not including bent grade) is trade at abt S$122 per drum, per drum equals 42 gallons which is equivalent to 160 litres, so crude oil price per litre will be about 0.8 cents, after refinery, it become about 40cents per litre, with taxation, comfort is selling at $1.31 per litres, you tell me, not earning? comfurk not only just supply to taxi, it supply to buses and all it transportation vehicle, and bear that in mind that comfort is a global entity, they can bargain because of a big global market they have, you cannot look at comfark locally, if you do that, you are just narrowing your view. In the stock market now, comfort delgro is a hot stock, and since announced fare changes, the stock is booming whereas other are suffering, not earning???</p>

              <p>according to my source( from supplier) </p>
              <p>the profit they make is $0.09 for every liter before all other cost expense overhead.</p>
              <p>so you go and calculate lah</p>

              <p>CumFuck is making profits in the millions even by selling diesel to their TDs at a discount.  How i knew ?  My ex (late) hirer was a trainer with CDG....</p>
              <p>Why Cumfuck did not venture into CNG, is partially if they do... the millions made in diesel transactions will be vaporized or minimized.</p>
