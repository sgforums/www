              Be it  tree pruning or road sweeping, i  am glad our country makes a huge effort to keep our roads clean, trees prunned regularly... unlike some countries, road r bumpy, rubbish , smelly everywhere, not smooth to drive on...
              
              so minor inconvinences are bearable...
              
              but sometimes they also must choose the correct timing to close the exits... ie no closure of nicholl highway exit fr KPE, havelock ext fr CTE on wed, fri, sat nites... troublesome to reroute...
              
              i rememeber last fri or sat midnite, there is a huge jam at CTE after balestier, close all lanes except 1 for road works.. no brainers...

              <p>And of course Singapore road is nice lah, do you know how much each vehicle has to pay for the road tax or not.</p>
              <p>Let take a 2.0cc petrol driven car, road tax already about 1.5k, present population of vehicle OTR is 1 million, you just take this as average, 1 million X $1,500.</p>

              <p>With an area of 710 square kilometres and a population of 4.8 million people, Singapore has one of the highest population densities in the world.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Yet, sharing this space with us are over 2000 recorded native plant species. In total, there are about two million trees planted along roadsides, in parks and protected nature areas. It is no wonder Singapore is known internationally as a Garden City.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>As a citizen of this Garden City, how well do we know our trees?</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Without them, the city would be a harsh landscape of concrete buildings. Trees serve to soften the surroundings, adding beauty and colour to the
              scenery. They also offer a welcome respite from the tropical heat and glare, while we are outdoors at work or at play.</p><p></p>

              just bcos we c trees on the expressways means we also must c trees dotting the expressways in future? Even though expressways r jams still do pruning every years? Y can't replace them with those maintainance free plants?
              
               When all these trees r remove n replace by plants that dun need watering or pruning, all motorist will know that any jams will not be cause by plants. Plants or greenery r good. But never shd be a reason to jam the expressways.

              <p>Actually our roads are now much worse than before.</p>
              <p>So many bumps, they just plaster and it becomes uneven still.</p>
              <p>Before LTA used to handle this with PWD, potholes and bumps would be cleared within 48 hours. That was the beauty of Singapore to Malaysia. Malaysia you see a pothole or bump, 1 year later still got. In Singapore today got, tommorrow disappear.</p>

              <p>Traffic won't slow so bad if drivers see all those warning signs! I really hate it when the sign says lane 1 got litter picking or tree pruning and those drivers still stay on lane 1. If past only one sign can excuse ah, but most of the time i see they past 3-4 HUGE LED signs, then 500m away, can see the huge truck with HUGE LED arrow blink blink, still last min then wanna change to lane 2, causing all other driver to slow down cos one idiot wanna change lane.</p>
              <p>The trees are there not only to make singapore look nice. It provides shade and prevents glare from sun, reduce dust, reduce noise pollution to surrounding homes, "cleans" the air.</p>

              <p>The trees are there not only to make singapore look nice. It
                  provides shade and prevents glare from sun, reduce dust, reduce
                  noise pollution to surrounding homes, "cleans" the air.</p>
              <p>Got one tourist last time ask me, how Singapore trees look so
                  nice, branch curve so evenly. I told them every few months people
                  prune it!</p>

              Ya, u so lucky. Everytime on the other side of the road when there is tree pruning. My ft paxs ask what causes the jam? After passing through the trouble spot slowly, i say tree pruning to make the expressways look nicer. The ang mo pax say, it look good when u r not in a jam.
