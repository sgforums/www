              <p>Congratulation for joining red engine.</p>
              <p>To survive in this industry you have to go through a school call " School of Hard Knock". Getting left right up down from pax and you will learn faster this way. The first 6 months is the most crucial period, you will go through lots of up and down but push on. Perserverance, diligent and hardwork is the keys to succeed in this industry. No shortcuts. Ask any lao gui in this forum I belive they will tell you the same thing.</p>
              <p>1) Perserverance - You must be willing to put up with all kind of nosense pax will gave you. Bear with it, take it light hearted. DO NOT take it personal or you will feel a drag going to work everyday.</p>
              <p>2) Diligent - Drive with diligent. Know the in and outs of the industry. Go read thru the past post / thread and know when, where, who, how to find pax. Army now is already 3G, taxi driver cannot stay in 1G or 2G. Must think differently.</p>
              <p>3) Hardwork - No shortcuts. To make $$$ you must work hard, and also work smart. Don't put your target too high as a beginner. Set like 50-60% what some lao gui make in this forum. Slowly increasing it when you get the hang of it.</p>
              <p>As for GPS, i do have one inside my car, but i use it mainly to serach for addresses, not so much for navi. GPS can be rather stupid. It doesn't factor in traffic conditions and traffics light.</p>
              <p>When I first started to drive, I trace out copies of HDB area map and put in a small B6 hardcase cover. It easier to visualize the whole of HDB area at one glance than to look through street directory, which is often break up in many pages. For town, very hard to draw , too big. You can break down the town into region, like CBD, Orchard, Orchard Outskirt etc and learn it bit by bit.</p>
              <p>CNG station, the toh tuck and mandai are 24 hrs. Serangoon north close when they dry out of gas. I don't have the current price, maybe pool can update.</p>
              <p>Petty cash wise depends on individual, i like to have 15 - $10 notes, 10-$5, 25-$2, coins i have 15-$1 coin, 15-$0.50, 25-$0.20, 25-$0.10</p>
              <p>You can join lakeview. They have a special price for new member. You can check with pool.</p>
              <p>Sorry lah, very long winded. Let me know if you need any help</p>

              <p>i think wat 888kel meant for radio system is the cd player not radio call system....</p>
              <p>u can go mustafa buy those head unit yourself &amp; ask someone to install for u</p>
              <p>or call class auto Mr Peh/May at 96166810.they are the co.engaged by transcab to do the carpentry work for the cng tank console</p>
              <p>most of our audio system are installed by them.give them a call 2days b4 collecting your wish &amp; you will see the unit already installed when u collect the taxi on the actual day,very efficent guy Mr Peh</p>
              <p>I spent $195 on a kenwood cd player,with a usb port for i-pod &amp; thumbdrive :) good deal</p>
              <p>but if you are keen on something more high end,go to their office at ubi to make your choice</p>

              <p>Dun listen to Sgcabby.........I agree with Ngkialeong888. Just go around to familiarize urself. Dun be afraid of unknown place. most pax will help. If not use ur street directory. U will find MOST pax are patient or at least understanding as long as u tell them before hand.</p>
              <p>When u drive around, note all the Taxi Stand. If u see many taxi queue there, it mean that place is good place to pick.</p>

              <p>I fully agree with likeyou, singaporean and ang mor generally are understanding, except a few bastard (sorry got to use such strong words). Communication is important between TD and pax. Don't know mean don't know, don't keh kian. Pax would rather TD tell him he's new and don't know the way rather than you go the wrong way and still insist you are right.</p>

              <p>How to deal with drunk person? Hmm..The best way is to avoid hahaha. Reason is simple, a drunkard don't talk reason. If you get a dead drunkard, good cos he won't gave you crazy remarks but make sure you ask him for address before he fall asleep. Half drunkard is the worst one, cos this type always think he is the god, he is right, he is never wrong. You will usually get hell from this type. Siam lah, try not to take.</p>
              <p>Vomit how, lan lan lor. If you want to go pub area pick up, always be prepare for this. But keep lots of plastic bag in the taxi, incase they merlion. You can go SKP buy 1 stack (nice folded) and neat. No need stuff here stuff there.</p>
              <p>Accident? Try not to get into one lah. But sway sway touch wood if u kena, remain calm. DO NOT admit you at fault. Write down particulars of all parties involve, name, ic no. hp number, car plate no., time. date, where, weather. Best if you take photo. Don't just take the accident parts of the car. Must also take surrounding, overview of the chain accident, lane of accident ( eg, any filter lane, double white line, zebra crossing, stop line, etc. I am currently trying out the in-car camera i brought from china. i will share with you guys after i tested it. I think its a good investment since we on the road most time. You know nowsaday accident happen is "purposely one" you know what i mean. With the camera, no horse run one. They can argue all they want, but picture tells a thousand words.</p>

              <p>Congratulation for joining red engine.</p>
              <p>To survive in this industry you have to go through a school call
              " School of Hard Knock". Getting left right up down from pax and
              you will learn faster this way. The first 6 months is the most
              crucial period, you will go through lots of up and down but push
              on. Perserverance, diligent and hardwork is the keys to succeed in
              this industry. No shortcuts. Ask any lao gui in this forum I belive
              they will tell you the same thing.</p>
              <p>1) Perserverance - You must be willing to put up with all kind
              of nosense pax will gave you. Bear with it, take it light hearted.
              DO NOT take it personal or you will feel a drag going to work
              everyday.</p>
              <p>2) Diligent - Drive with diligent. Know the in and outs of the
              industry. Go read thru the past post / thread and know when, where,
              who, how to find pax. Army now is already 3G, taxi driver cannot
              stay in 1G or 2G. Must think differently.</p>
              <p>3) Hardwork - No shortcuts. To make $$$ you must work hard, and
              also work smart. Don't put your target too high as a beginner. Set
              like 50-60% what some lao gui make in this forum. Slowly increasing
              it when you get the hang of it.</p>
              <p>As for GPS, i do have one inside my car, but i use it mainly to
              serach for addresses, not so much for navi. GPS can be rather
              stupid. It doesn't factor in traffic conditions and traffics
              light.</p>
              <p>When I first started to drive, I trace out copies of HDB area
              map and put in a small B6 hardcase cover. It easier to visualize
              the whole of HDB area at one glance than to look through street
              directory, which is often break up in many pages. For town, very
              hard to draw , too big. You can break down the town into region,
              like CBD, Orchard, Orchard Outskirt etc and learn it bit by
              bit.</p>
              <p>CNG station, the toh tuck and mandai are 24 hrs. Serangoon north
              close when they dry out of gas. I don't have the current price,
              maybe pool can update.</p>
              <p>Petty cash wise depends on individual, i like to have 15 - $10
              notes, 10-$5, 25-$2, coins i have 15-$1 coin, 15-$0.50, 25-$0.20,
              25-$0.10</p>
              <p>You can join lakeview. They have a special price for new member.
              You can check with pool.</p>
              <p>Sorry lah, very long winded. Let me know if you need any
              help</p>

              <p>A very sound advice from an experience driver indeed!</p>
              <p>Just add small points :</p>
              <p>* First few weeks (it's up to you how long you set your target), just pickany pax onsight and they will bring you to many diff parts of Singapore that you have never been to, then you can learn S'pore as a "big picture".</p>
              <p>* Forget about those SatNav. I always tell my pax, I don't need GPS coz I have the best GPS system at the back (and usually it takes them a while b4 they understand it and laugh :) ). It is OK to ask them the direction if you are not too sure. BUT, after they got down from the cab just spend a short time to glance at the map and "see" where you have driven.</p>
              <p>By the way, NKL is well known to be a hard working driver. It is OK if you cannot follow 100%  of what he write here. (Peace Bro NKL!)</p>

              <p>Eh Bro, your total float is much more than my total daily collection leh. :) No need so much lah.</p>
              <p>Just bring 5 - $10
              notes, 10-$2,  and coins (5-$1 coin, 10-$0.50, 20c and 10c) enough liao. If not enough then use plan B "I give you my number you call me tomorrow".  (Woops sorry this one is Komade's line.:) Plan B is "Here I give you my account number just transfer the amount to my account OK?". Best case: "NVM, you keep the cahnge lah", worst case: free delivery. LOL</p>
