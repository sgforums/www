              <p>nope bro, not pax bashing. yah, daily almost 100% pax are ok.
              nasty ones that i've met until now can count on the fingers of 1
              hand. just highlighting an inconsistency..there are substantially
              more posts on bad tds than good tds from pax. not that i expect
              compliments as a norm, just that it will be good if the pax offers
              a greeting or two, a kind word..not asking them to post online. as
              in a compliment to a waiter/waitress for good service. is all. not
              kp'ing. excellent pax i've also encountered many, but unlike tds
              (name,veh nos. all the pax can know easily), we can't post good pax
              experience by the simple fact that we don't know their names mah.
              as they say..it takes 2 hands to clap.</p>

              <p>yea we dont know their names but just the incident will do. i rem one member ngkialeong talked abt a pax giving him a big tip. thats great news! extremely motivating right?</p>

              <p>i will reply to that 3 pts.</p>
              <p>First, i THOUGHT i knew my boundaries. but i made a common mistake 
              that almost all new drivers will make. the difference is I spoke up, 
              they swept it under the carpet.</p>
              <p>Second, like most new drivers, I tried to accomodating. That was 
              the next common mistake. There are good passengers and there are OTHER 
              passengers. Trying to be accomodating, to talk to them, to tell them, 
              dont work all the time.</p>
              <p>Third, thanks for wishing me luck, i wish the best to all TDs 
              here as well and all the time. Thats why we are all here. Someone speaks
               up about their situation (could be good. could be not so good), 
              everyone learn. I am sure some new driver(s?) will learn from MY 
              mistakes i just shared.</p>

              <p>unfortunately, i am "cursed" with that perspective for the rest of my life. it gave me insights quickly, thats no problem, but the next mistake i made was sharing those insights, because they tend to provoke pple who might not share that view</p>

              <p>missed your 2nd half storyline, i learnt my lesson and i think any new driver will (can?) also learn from me.</p>
              <p>when we meet 'less than positive' passengers. the best counter i found out, from my school of hard knocks so far, is to</p>
              <p>1. act friendly</p>
              <p>2. act stupid</p>
              <p>3. act dumb (mute)</p>
              <p>4. whenever in doubt, always refer to 1, 2, 3 or if your kung fu is really good, try a multiple combo. cannot block one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that said, i respect pool for his ability to stay cool and calm, even tho a new driver like me yakking crap every now and then. that i really have nothing to say.</p>

              <p><br>It's attitude like yours that's causing so much problem btw passengers and taxi drivers... You assume so much and think badly and poorly of passenger. You must be one of those who show customer attitude if they never let u earn big bucks?? </p>

              <p>Hi Bros, Just a two-cent worth opinion from an old man but half-new TD (only 6 mths old OMO).</p>
              <p>In every trade, there are bound to be black sheep, but at the same time, we must not forget the nice and friendly ppl too.  In my 6 mths' stint as a OMO TD, I have my fair share of the so-called "ugly" paxs who would show no mercy at thrashing at the TD at the slightest thing.  However, I have also met wonderful paxs, who thanked for the trip driven, asked before eating in the taxi (mostly those on way to work, eat breakfast in hurry), those who thanked for helping them into cab, putting luggage into boot, and of course those who tipped generously (these are not confined to only angmohs or tourists).</p>
              <p>This is a hectic line, and if we should allow ourselves to be affected by some out of the blue kind of unhappy incident, our mood will be lousy and rest of driving time will not be too smooth either.  I always try to forget/delete any 'ugly' paxs once they have alighted, look forward to another pleasant trip with another pax.  End of the day is the fare I can collect for the day. </p>
              <p>Start the day with a whistle and end it with a song - my philosophy!  Hope u all don't find me lor soh, my ah pek style of staying happy with the job.</p>

              <p>i will reply to that 3 pts.</p>
              <p>First, i THOUGHT i knew my boundaries. but i made a common
              mistake that almost all new drivers will make. the difference is I
              spoke up, they swept it under the carpet.</p>
              <p>Second, like most new drivers, I tried to accomodating. That was
              the next common mistake. There are good passengers and there are
              OTHER passengers. Trying to be accomodating, to talk to them, to
              tell them, dont work all the time.</p>
              <p>Third, thanks for wishing me luck, i wish the best to all TDs
              here as well and all the time. Thats why we are all here. Someone
              speaks up about their situation (could be good. could be not so
              good), everyone learn. I am sure some new driver(s?) will learn
              from MY mistakes i just shared.</p>

              <p>ok try this method. </p>
              <p>next time a pax come on board . greet as usual. ask where are they going , ascertain the route they want and just drive.</p>
              <p>no need to talk much , when u talk a lot , u open up yourself to attacks by pax on why certain things are not done.</p>
              <p>just show a poker face, the best wud be if u have a guai lan face, thats better.</p>
              <p>talk only to the right grp of people , like tourists who will appreciate u &amp; at the and of the trip give u a small reward.</p>
