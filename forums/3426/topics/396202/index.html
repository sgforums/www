              <p>I can still remember that fat ugly girl with a twisted "You Owe Me" look who countered me this in my blur face, when during alighting I apologised to her I am sorry I didnt know there wasnt CBD surcharge at the crossroad when she flagged me down and came onboard.</p>
              <p>I recalled that time I was wondering why there are several cabs in front me that I was quite sure were available but didnt pick her up, and that she looked quite flustered then by the time I turned in.</p>
              <p>During the trip she even 'directed' me to cut extreme lanes, showed tantrum when I 'failed' to charge traffic and kept snorting everytime we slowed down or stopped at traffic...everything pointing towards "HURRY UP!". But that time was drizzling, peak hours and jam.</p>
              <p>When finishing payment (counting to the last cent) and nearly getting off, she even took time to glare at me, seemingly warning me if I dare to try to cheat her precious money...when I had sent her to her destination in what I considered to be a remarkable short time given the traffic conditions.</p>
              <p>In fact, looking back at this incident now, I should really thank this 'Lady", but every my passenger after her should hate her. Because after her case, I NEVER EVER EVER pick up anyone near CBD without a confirm surcharge anymore, $3, peak or midnite. I dont care if the pax could be bleeding or dying or getting hammered. Doesnt matter. No surcharge, No ride.</p>
              <p>I might be stupid once. I cant be stupid forever.</p>

              <p>Another case.</p>
              <p>Just dropped someone off and was checking blindspot before driving off, suddenly 3 dark asian women (no, definitely not lady like) adruptly came onboard, think they are Filipinos. But I thought the area was a no pick-up zone and at the back of the vehicle I thought I saw a man in coat writing into his note pad. I made a turn back, checked with that fellow, he assured me its ok he wont take it against me and then I separately assured the 3 'women' i would deduct $0.80 from the meter for that short episode.</p>
              <p>initially the 3 was yakking away loudly in their native language, but a short while later, one of the women started put her hand up with a handkerchief to cover her mouth, and tilted her head forward like in a vomitting position. she started making vomitting sounds and i quickly handed her friends a plastic bag and asked them to help her. Very soon later, that woman actually vomitted into the bag, in the car. Not only that smelled, so did the 3 of them actually!</p>
              <p>When came to alighting, the moment i pressed meter stopped, the one who vommitted was quick to point out to deduct $0.80 from the meter as I promised ok!...her OTHER hand still holding the plastic bag I gave her with her a vomit.</p>
              <p>I recalled the way they asked their expression was demanding, as if i was my fault, i owed them...All without any sign of any tinge of awkwardness.</p>
              <p>Again thanks to them I learned my lesson. I will NEVER EVER EVER offer any discount in future. No discussions. Whether its my fault or not.</p>

              <p>I have actually picked up a fair number of passengers just outside CBD area, like DFS Royal Plaza. Some of them really did not know that they are saving $3 by standing there, and also wondered why no taxis are coming. So I explained to them that they have to make a booking and best is to call Lakeview. Otherwise confirm no taxi one.</p>
              <p>Old people went shopping with family, we cannot expect them to walk to Lucky Plaza from DFS just to get a taxi.</p>

              <p>when i started , i read maps , i read places of interest , i did a lot of things so that i will not run into trouble with paxes.now with so many surcharges , the responsibility is upon u to know where are the boundaries.</p>

              <p>unfortunately, it's the same with pax..for many pax, 1bad apple td = all tds bad attitude. see all the complaints about tds online? i've yet to see 1 that compliments a td for good service etc. anti-taxi websites ada banyak! praise good tds website..nothing is the have (albeit there are a few compliments on st forum). this forum neber see b4 leh. recently here got a few which contributions are just to kpkb tds. this forum is for tds to share info, want to express your unhappiness about tds, goto the other forum for consumers. comparatively, more ang mohs will show appreciation than asians. i guess it's a culture thing as asians tend to be more reserved. conversely, they are also quick to kpkb if they feel u are trying to rip them off. locals, i've met a few which compliments good service. but in a minority. it's not the tips, a kind or appreciative word by the pax makes me feel good too, not only other higher-ranking humans. thank you very much. have a nice day. knn gotta work today. sigh</p>
