              <p>But in a sensible sense, do you think a person living
              in a private property that he bought at 300k and now worth 4
              millions, doing a 50 millions turnover business, driving 3 attask
              cars at his driveway would go and vote some other parties who may
              end all his fortune?? Lky alway said, "do not bite the hand that
              feed you".</p>
              <p>And then, come to think of a poor person like me, just make
              $50+$20 ang pow today on ferrying dead people, but hv to buy
              mooncake for mother in laws, might have to give wife some money
              today to go somewhere to eat dinner, buy household
              stuff and also ome stuff for prayer tomorrow,
              </p>
              <p> I am free, because my old hirer yesterday banged the
              front  of his cab onto a wall, (might hv to go sunset way look
              for transcab crown). ....Is going to vote for the current ruling
              party?</p>
              <p>I mean, people like me who go day by day got nothing to lose, if
              I take the ruling party, I still will be doing the same as what I
              am doing now, and it could get more worst, but if I take on
              opposition, it might change to good or bad, I dunno, but at least,
              there is a change, and where there is a change, there is hope.</p>
              <p>So do you think it is sensible to take the opposition base on my
              predicament of life here as many, I believe also having the same
              predicament.</p>

              <p>Picked up an angmo once, he and his friends were hit (In a cab) from behind - no real damge or injury but they all claimed - each got 3k. He was happy that the insurance sponsored a free trip to Phuket!</p>

              <p><br>I am no politician too, if I do, my party will be the Casket Party.</p>
              <p>But logic would tell you that Singapore is a natural resourceless country, it is therefore very fragile, even a small celery or onion, you hv to buy from market, what we are good at, it the human resources, the people like you and me. We got no oil, no tin, no rubber, ...but we got people to service the industrial, people like TD, people like hotels staff, banking services, financial services, ship services and so on to put us in the upfront of best services, we got good infrastructure and most importantly, peace and harmony. That attracted alots of business and peoples into our tiny little land.</p>
              <p>We are not going to say, WP is to rules sg, as we mature into (we are still a young nation) a better developed country, our vision diversified widely, we travelled more, see more thing and therefore we want a more vibrant parliamentary, even when we eat, we prefer more varieties, buffets..high tea..chiong. More taxis companies, more colorful taxis, more kind of schools, and that ultimately, as govt said, we must change and adapt, and we certainly wanted a better representatives of different parties in the parliament.</p>
              <p>The stage of Singapore growth in the 60s of seeking independent, which led to industrial strikes, political chaos and finally the last man standing is LKY, once stabalised, we go into industrial development, then from industrial to a knowledge economy, to a super knowledge economy that works on high end job, and that is also why we are facing a structural unemployment leading to many doing guards and TDs. Meaning that there are jobs, but we singaporeans are not skill or capable enough to undertake it. Jobs like bio scien techs, bankers, pharmaceutical jobs...</p>

              <p>Revolution occurs only when the poors are being side stepped completely, and the differences btw poor and rich are a mountain apart. One kind revolution can be the uprising of communism in China under Mao, the farmers are damn poor, and Mao, in understand the suffering of the peoples, is therefore able to cohort with communist Russia to support him in the uprising against the Kuo Ming party.</p>
              <p>The brainchild of LKY is very simple in preventing revolution.</p>
              <p>First, everyone must feel yao and have a job, once you feel yao and go a job to feed your yao, you do not mess around, you got no time to think of politics, you got not time to think of revolution</p>
              <p>2nd, prevent the disparity of the rich and poor in a social aspect, the rich, can be damn rich in their banks, but lives just beside the poor, the poors are able to access shopping centres airport, go oversea, can also go Ion prada shop, can also have their own club, can shop at supermarket, private houses and HDB are together or not far from each other, these alone prevent inequalities thinking, you can drive a merc, but I can call a taxi merc with driver some more. Inequality thinking is also a danger to revolution, so LKY eliminated it on the social aspect</p>
              <p>3rd, Everyone must be given a job, once you have a job, you thinking will be micro type, meaning only thinking of your job, like TD, you only think of MDT, pax, huat, OBK, rental, where got paxs, where got lobangs, CBD, and that slowly sway you away from political uprising thinking.</p>
