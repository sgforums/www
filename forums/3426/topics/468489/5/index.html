              <p>Migrating? I got no comments cos very emo one. I am talking
              about getting PR. The Singapore today and 20 yrs later will be very
              different. Give yourself an alternative.  You can live in
              either country freely. Sinkapore too ex., stay Australia. Dun like
              Australia, stay Singapore lor.  Simple what.  </p>
              <p>Singaporeans of the future must be prepared to uproot and find
              work overseas.  Some will settle there. Why? Because there
              will be many university graduates competing for jobs here. Unless
              they want to become TDs lah.  My time, 5% to 10% of NS boys
              are A levels. Today, that figure is 70%. 10 years later??</p>
              <p>Last time, riflemen all Hokkien Peng. Today, u got riflemen who
              are A level holders who will be studying Law at Cambridge
              University after NS.</p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Those
              FTs who come here get PR are smarter than a lot of Singaporeans.
              Don't be fixated with loyalty for country kind of thing and block
              out everything else. Those type of mentality only belongs to the
              North Koreans. Even China has changed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">And had my grandfather remained
              fiercely loyal to China, I would not be having a good life here

              <p>Ok lah..removed bold red oredi..But, the point is necessary. It succintly sums up the desire of many families who decide to emigrate. It is as relevant today as it was 70</p>
              <p>years ago.  Which is to seek a better life for their families.</p>
              <p>From talking to many people,  I sense that this desire is stronger today than it was 10 years ago. But, I am not critical of families who decide to emigrate as they have their own reasons. </p>
              <p>So, do you agree that getting a PR elsewhere is a good alternative?</p>

              <p>As for now ..... still finding informations and need to visit my friend in Perth , to know roughly what kind of business easy to start with , easy to access to Australia , with his partnership , if needed .</p>
              <p>I was told to start a badminton related equipment outlet in Perth , sourcing for the right coaches and organise coaching classes for the kids and schools for Asian , and have a eventual badminton halls of 3 courts of our own , cater for the increasing Asian esp Indonesians communities in Perth .</p>
              <p>At the same time , do retailing and services for badminton equipments for past time , biggest shareholder sleeping partner .......</p>
              <p>Badminton is a very least popular sport in Perth . Good chance to start off with the Asian , Indonesians and malaysians market .</p>

              <p>I am so sure i will find it tough  ....... many old folks is not coping well now , 17 years down the road , lagi no need say .</p>

              <p>Then when they came out after NS and education, already 23 to 24 ++, along came a foreign boss who holds a mumbai degree, taking a bare minimum of $5k as manager, provided with condos at tanjong rhu and most importantly, an employment pass to allow whole family arrival with his work level.</p>

              <p>The problem lies in between social visit and actual living.</p>
              <p>Social visit is like tourist, no string attached.</p>

              <p>Then visit them once or twice a year, slowly built in to get to know the place.</p>
              <p>Most people migrate to australia because they are educated there, some never even wanted to come back, not that here is no good, because they cannot take the fast and furious life here. Most would had adopted a laze life, which is typically, their culture.</p>
              <p>Moving in at mid life is no joke, and to start up, find a job, it also no joke, they got plenty of youngs there, of course, you said relatives or friends can help you, but it can turn out to be a burden to them with you around, then how?</p>
              <p>Mai lah, here still got your buddies, your LV, your favorite fish soup, coffee and cigarette, family, relatives and also a relaxing job, why make life miserable further, just drive and save, old liao, buy a second hand car go around with wife and see childrens works..see bowah, fark him, see CT, can also fark him..in aussie where can do like this..I guarantee once you gone for 3 months, you will miss all this.</p>

              <p>You see, human like you and me got a funny mentality of telling good of what we are, just like you, drive silver, said skoda damn good..this and that..same goes your relatives who are staying at Oz, they will tell you all the goods about Oz.</p>
              <p>Peoples from poor developing countries, whereby the country is not at peace, no job, full of illness, dirty, lots of begger, high corruption and so on coming into Singapore or australia or any developed countries is understandable, to them, is heaven. But coming from Singapore to Oz, is almost the same, just that they got bigger space and less people, more green than concrete, more cows than Singaporeans only.</p>
              <p>There was once I took a Oz living here for 23 years, he said something that bewildered me till today in disbelieve, he is a teacher here.</p>
              <p>He claim that aussie, especially near the coral reef, from brisbane down to sydney, melborne across into perth, that belt is of space had the most people dying of skin cancer or other related cancer, because, that belts of sphere have the least ozone layer on earth, and that is where the reef coral needed, direct sun radiation to survive.</p>

              <p>Ok lah..removed bold red oredi..But, the point is necessary. It
              succintly sums up the desire of many families who decide to
              emigrate. It is as relevant today as it was 70</p>
              <p>years ago.  Which is to seek a better life for their
              families.</p>
              <p>From talking to many people,  I sense that this desire is
              stronger today than it was 10 years ago. But, I am not critical of
              families who decide to emigrate as they have their own
              reasons. </p>
              <p>So, do you agree that getting a PR elsewhere is a good

              </blockquote>
              <p>Because Singapore don't allow dual citizenship, even how good is other country, one had to really sit down and think, "Give up Singapore citizenship?".......</p>
              <p>Even special case like my niece, who bear a child in US, although her child was granted US citizenship, but Singapore Authority never fail to inform her, once her child reach legal age tender, got to choose 1, either Sg or US, as her child is a male, what do you think he will choose?.........</p>
              <p>As for PR, aiyo, you see I never even bother to touch on this, why? Nowadays with $, a lot of wonders can be done.........</p>
              <p>My uncle every year attend NDP sing Majulla Singapura, but he is holding PR status for New Zealand, Phillipine and Canada.........</p>
              <p>My main point is "Giving up Citizenship" over here........like now chief had clarify, working hor, knn la........</p>
              <p>Why Merlion or Temasek Club been set up? Maybe if possible, Raffles Club will be there also.......</p>
              <p>Is for those PR, working type la, student la.....to have a place to gather and sing Majulla Singapore together mah, if someone given up citizenship still step in to those club, knn kiam gan only..........</p>
              <p>If the chief just simply talking about going oversea to look for business opportunity, than farking wasting all my time typing la........</p>
              <p>Like bowah had said, we know ourself what's our capability, want to be "ah Neh" in Australia, please go ahead.........</p>
              <p>How Australia treated Asian?........the day when the chief met the REAL ANG MOR, when their real ang mo wallop you until you nearly die or killed, than come and tell us again........</p>

              <p>I already got my driving license there, accomodation, only things left are hunting for a good school for my daughter and a job for me to work..... once these settled, I'm out of here.....</p>
              <p>Singapore, I see no future for me.... be a TD for life? If the gahment allow PR or FT to be TDs, good luck to us......</p>
              <p>Agreed migrating is not a just say and do thing, takes time and need planning.... may take a few years, but definitely will be much happier there than in sg......</p>

              <p>Once the govt lost their sense of direction in protecting the rights of citizens...can we really blame those who renounce their citizenship and country of birth?</p>
              <p>Humans in nature are mostly selfish...some more...some less...some show it openly...some pretend not to be selfish.</p>
              <p>Some can say country come first before self....lampah la mai pian ka ki la</p>
              <p>In the end its abt individual self interest.</p>

              <p>Staying at Marine Parade , under Mr Gok Chok Tong wards , i was very surprised they chose to move over to the Continent .</p>
              <p>mid 90's , many went over due to the dissatifactions of Singapore's policies and politics .</p>
              <p>they were one of them .</p>
              <p>That was the time why they move on .</p>
              <p>Now 2013 , it's not just politically , it was very much looking for quality life abroad , cheaper for their parents .</p>
