              founded this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is certainly

              you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new

              whining, and griping about Our Flag, Our Pledge, Our Christian beliefs,

              better the other side..</p>
              <p>most of the ppl who left, one of the main reason is for their
              next generation.. they say sg cmi.. yr son, would probably need to
              work above 65 years old here..</p>
