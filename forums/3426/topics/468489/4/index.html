              <p><br>There is definitely something wrong with you, your inner self is not stable, you alway look at others as greener, friends or relatives more brighter both in look and earning, or that your neighbour door is alway more beautiful then yours no matter how your change or decorate it. This is call inferiority complex mentality while presenting a superior complexity nature. And all this got to do with too much egos and pride at stake.</p>
              <p>Your inferiority is very complex, but you never want to show it to others because at the exterior, you want to show superiority, like you are the chief, but as you age, you somehow find your superiority deteriotriating, and those relatives or friends had found better pasture and life than you, a TD, so to speak, therefore, that inferior of feeling a sense of failure start to exist as time goes by.</p>
              <p>The antidote is therefore, be simple, dun think so much, just drive happily, meet us happily, go home happily, make family happily with your love, and you are still our great Chief without any string attached. Be kind to yourself, we, at such age, should not torture ourselve further, live, work, old and die, no one can escape this road.</p>

              <p>Definitely not Singapore, BUT not becuase of those reason Poolman mention. It's because we like to have a much slow pace life.</p>

               Lijiang!!!! Was there more than 10 years ago and I fell in love with it too!!! :)
              
              hmm.... interesting... I wouldn't know where I would like to retire.... 
              
              I once told a friend that I can finally fully understand my grandfather who passed away why he insisted going back to his homeland, China, to spend his last few years there.... he came to Singapore to work and though it became his home and where he raised his family, the memories of his own homeland will always be with him.....

              <p>Australia is riding on a gd fortune because of it trading with China, the chinese need those raw materials and food stuffs from australia to support their growing economy, so if you ask me if the aussie will welcome a china chinese or a singaporean chinese like our chief status.

              <p>Many many years laters (Maybe oso 18 Years), Likely your son will like them becuase of their children (Your Grand Children) and return back Singapore.</p>

              <p>Migrating? I got no comments cos very emo one. I am talking about getting PR. The Singapore today and 20 yrs later will be very different. Give yourself an alternative.  You can live in either country freely. Sinkapore too ex., stay Australia. Dun like Australia, stay Singapore lor.  Simple what.  </p>
              <p>Singaporeans of the future must be prepared to uproot and find work overseas.  Some will settle there. Why? Because there will be many university graduates competing for jobs here. Unless they want to become TDs lah.  My time, 5% to 10% of NS boys were A level holders. Today, that figure is 70%. 10 years later??</p>
              <p>Last time, riflemen all Hokkien Peng. Today, u got riflemen who are A level holders and who will be studying Law at Cambridge University after NS.</p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Those FTs who come here get PR are smarter than a lot of Singaporeans. Don't be fixated with loyalty for country kind of thing and block out everything else. This type of mentality only belongs to the North Koreans. Even China has changed.</span></p>
              <p>And had my grandfather remained fiercely loyal to China, I would not be having a good life here today.</p>
