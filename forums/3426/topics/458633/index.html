              <p>Not all return one, cos i asked them which vehicle i can take as replacement, since my Wish always prob, only a few there are people return, last i asked only 1 Wish 2.0, that one also taken already today. Most of the one in centre between workshops are Gear Box problem, those at the sides mostly waiting for parts, towards front near office mostly accidents.</p>
              <p>And many throw Wish change to Epica, now "New Epica waiting list" becoming like CDG LoL</p>

              <p>Actually i don't understand why TC driver queue, the other day i just whack in front of office, give my servicing log card to counter. One driver ask me, "oi cut queue ah!", i say i put here, let workshop people move it and call me when ready, outside no space liao. Then the other driver friend say, "hmmm, bo salah mah". Then i go back gate take bus to hougang, buy cigarettes and drink kopi, cos the stupid canteen at defu don't sell cigarettes!</p>
              <p>They cannot find my vehicle their problem, my downtime starts at the moment i give my card to counter.</p>
              <p>2nd time i went back, put car there let them move. I go office, ask them about my incentive problem, workshop call ask me what probelm, told them what needed to be fixed then I go Ubi buy things. Finish call me</p>
              <p>3rd time, i go give my card to counter, put my car outside at queue, i go walk around look at other wish, workshop call, say no need queue just bring to the mechanic..</p>
              <p>One driver follow queue, all follow, then become habit. I usually grab all my valueables, put inside bag, leave the car and let them call, unless i really got nothing to do. But i don't go home sleep, defu to jurong take bus, haven't reach home usually finish liao. So no point, unless they say take few days, already once they say few hours, i take bus haven't reach home they call say ok.</p>

              <p>Yup many convert to Epica, previous hirer of my cab also convert Epica. </p>
              <p>Not Diesel taxi ez to service, it's new car easier to service. Problems haven't come out yet. So just change oil, rotate tyre, some visual checks, when mileage up change transmission fluids, can go out liao.</p>
              <p>Manual transmission diesel like crown easier to service then auto. If i had a private car i would rather choose manual then auto. Auto transmission problem, even outside workshop most of them can't do, send back agent.</p>

              <p>Actually the admin staff got tell, cannot owe how many days rental. But normally people don't listen cos they explain super fast.</p>
              <p>If u deposit $1000 can only owe 5 days, $1500 can owe 8 days. Must complete 1 calendar month then can get incentive. Example if start on 7th July, for month of July never get cos not 1 calendar month. So 1st August till 31st August then get.</p>
              <p>1st month those never get like me is because i deposit $1000, they deduct $500 from the $665 rebate so left $115, that $115 they offset from rental. That also the girl got tell me, only i never understand at first.</p>
              <p>For me my daily rental paid thru giro so won't miss one, cos my bank always got cash.</p>
              <p>Those pay monthly they get $60 extra, meaning $665+$60 = $725, so end month when they pay 1 month rental they offset $725.</p>
              <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Daily rental $94.16</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Whole month: $94.16 x 31 = $2918.96</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Total Rebate : $665 + $60 = $725</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Total amt to be paid end month: $2918.96 - $725 = $2193.96</strong></p>
              <p>The incentive breakdown for Wish 1.8 As stated in the yellow file when u sign for car:</p>
              <p>Performance incentive: <strong>$250</strong> - Applicable to rental owing More than <strong>5 days but less than 7 Days.</strong></p>
              <p>Good Performace incentive: <strong>$400</strong> - Applicable to rental <strong>not owing more than 5 days</strong></p>
              <p>Road tax rebate: <strong>$15</strong></p>
              <p>So if u made $1500 deposit and miss 1-5 days rental:</p>
              <p>$250 + $400 + $15 = $665</p>
              <p>If u miss rental 6 - 7 days u get:</p>
              <p>$250 + $15 = $265</p>
              <p>If u miss rental above 7 days ie, 8 days u get</p>
              <p>$0</p>
              <p>Above 9 days rental missed TC can take legal actions against you.</p>
              <p>Maximum number of days can owe rental based on the amount of deposit paid, taken from the yellow file:</p>
              <p><strong>$300 deposit - Owe max 3 days rental</strong></p>
              <p><strong>$500 deposit - Owe max 5 days rental</strong></p>
              <p><strong>$1000 deposit - Owe max 7 days rental</strong></p>
              <p><strong>$1500 deposit - Owe max 9 days rental</strong></p>
              <p>If u made $1000 deposit like me then first full calendar month rebate they deduct $500 and credit into the security deposit, and balance offset from rental. </p>
