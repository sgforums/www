              <p>Midnite no need Taxis stand one lah, it is a stand down for most of the rules, so many zombies and party goers along Orchard, the Quays from robertson to boat, and all those selegie KTV, after the romanian ambassador case, all take cabs to go home. Just wave and board only.</p>
              <p>As for Zoo, you can alway take it as a special booking. And not alway you get so lucky. Why waste the luck. Most cabbies mind their own business, why go bother and complain about you.</p>

              <p>By the books: Q1, yes, must alight/pick pax at t/s when within 50 m (if i,m not wrong abt the dist). i think this regulation is so pax u ferrying cannot insist to alight elsewhere within the radius cos if there are waiting pax at t/s, its in the interest of everyone concerned. Except of course, when pax alighting has difficulty in movement. After all, hv t/s is to prevent disputes, right?</p>
              <p>Q2, yes, u shd. good karma (i feel) and fair to pax if t/s full of pax or to cabbies if long taxi queue.</p>
