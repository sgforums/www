              Just tell this type must be disposal lo. Gave them the rate and if accept take. If NO
              
              Then tell them go fly kite. 
              
              That.s what i did to my Pax.  Just half way told me many stop instead of what was
              
              Original destination., if they don't accept, I will stop at the original destination. They lan lan lan accept.
              
              Ever kena go Lta drink kopi for such complain . Bo tai ji. Cause I ask Lta taxi point to point
              
              Service is it or is personal driver.  And surprise Lta accept my explanation and tell me 
              
              they settle the case  with the the person who complaint.

              <p>Well, guess most of you guys got smartphone, make use of it, when you log on to portal or bids centre, there a app to send email to your DRO.</p>
              <p>So if you meet any unreasonable pax, and know that most likely, this farking pax is going to complain for sure, you first sd email to your DRO about the situation, so when the complain come in, your DRO is in a better position to answer, and most likely, you will be call upon because you proactively informed your company of the forthcoming issue.</p>
              <p>Last week, picked a pax going to sengkang, then on way, said can drop by at Upper seranggoon for her to pass something to her relatives, she is a foreigner, saree girl, meaning ah ney, look like wife of our ah ney FT.</p>
              <p>I told her nicely, sorry, miss, unable to detour, you should had told me earlier before boarding, then she said, on the way , why cannot, I said, now many taxis, just paid another $3.20 or 3.60 only mah, not so troublesome. She lan lan keep quiet and I sent her to SK.</p>

              <p>Dun ever be afraid to voice out ur concern. U set the rule of game... It's never the pax. If there's ever a need to charge an additional amt, be firm and demand for it.</p>
              <p>Dun behave until so desperado as if we really need tis trade for a living... Many times when foreign tourists took out their smartphone google map to check whether I had taken the longer route, I told them straight to their face...</p>
              <p>"many taxi uncles are much more well off then u n ur country men... We do not need to resort to such insignificant fare cheats"</p>
              <p>I kena numerous times to drink kopi Liao... It never bothered me and every time I feel a much more happy man becos justice is done. I dun mind wasting my precious time going down to CDG office just to get the facts right becos it benefits all other people in d same trade.</p>
              <p>Everything starts from u... If u scared this scared that and dare not voice out... Then better Kwai Kwai drive ur taxi and swallow ur gravience for many more "good" yrs to come.</p>
              <p>A lot of people feel taxi drivers r inferior... Some vent their anger over on us. No, we dun owe them a living and we need not be subjected to their abuse or threatening tactics. Stand up strong and fight back. Dun ever feel u r not contributing anything... Pls remember... 1 small step is a big leapt forward.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>Just like to find out from the conern of this post, is all about 2 prospectives:</p>
              <p>From taxi driver, we want profit (good one not the standard one)</p>
              <p>From passenger, we want to save cost.</p>
              <p>But did all the taxi driver ever wonder are we EVER once a pax that also need more than one 1 stop?</p>
              <p>For example, when courting time, we need to send our GF home (while late night) and ourselve home too. (Of course, we can also walk or take public transport la). But did we need to give extra for this?</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Thus, I believe all of us are guilty of it unless you all (before becoming taxi drivers) are already giving disposal or extra rate to the taxidriver while asking  for multi stops.</span></p>
              <p>Just felt a but strange that such posts can have so much ideas.</p>
              <p>Hope that all of us when we are a pax only take 1 stop only to avoid unnecessary conflict or concern.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents...(not 22cent)</p>
