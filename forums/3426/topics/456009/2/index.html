              there is no further useful or relevant response after my last post. that is not surprising. 
              
              actually what is revealing is this means this kind of shad, act blur practice is actually quite rather prevalent in this industry. so much so drivers knowingly aware about this and in one way help to sweep it under the carpet like by deliberate attempts to divert away from the main topic, to discredit or assasinate the party that speak up. they prefer not open up the dirty to see the daylight as much as possible. some sort of industry hush hush, self conservation. then theres very good chance some of the very drivers here do the same sht, maybe not all the time, just at one time or one way or another.
              
              after this many posts, when drivers dont willingly discuss the solutions that they know will work against them, it can only mean theres really a few workable solutions that can really work against them. next time when taking taxi, just record, ask for receipt, file complaint. just put it this way, give them, the drivers and their companies a run for their money, the way they give us ours :D
              
              will revisit every now and then, so i hope those who are upset will remain upset, i need your attention and efforts to help push this kind of matter. hope words get out

              Aiyo, TS. What replys you are expecting when u start this thread? Expecting TDs to apologise? Expecting TDs to offer solutions?
              
              If you encounter rouge TDs, please do us a favour n write to LTA. Let them do the enforcement (Fine or revoke TVDL). We TDs only have time to work hard n bring back money for our family..Majority of us lead an honest life. 
                 
              Open your eyes n see the real world. There will be some rotten eggs in every trade...  Read the newspaper n you will understand. 
                      
                      1. Doctor sold cough syrup illegally for profits
                      2. Lawyer run road with clients money meant for house purchase
                      3. Pastor that used church fund for his own purpose.
                      
              These people held profession of the highest regards.
              
              Just because u encounter 1 or 2 rouge TDs and now you wanna condemn us all??? So next time, please dun see a doctor when you are sick, dun go to a lawyer for legal matters, dun donate to charities...
                      
              Btw, i remembered 1 pax once told me this.. Singapore is probably the only country where u can trust the TD to bring  the kids without the adults accompanying to schools or childcare.. I fully agree with the pax.
