              worst is, they keep braking just before traffic lights. slow from 80-70 to 40, 30. even other cars overtake they still slow down...until lights turn yellow. then they relax their shoulders and brake to full stop. then when asked why need slow down even in middle night no cars or jam, the driver will say, no choice ma, traffic light must obey. if not happy, they will say they cannot do anything also, if want, just pay meter and get out and change another taxi lo.

              if both above are TDs, then really need to thank you very much.
              you are doing exactly what was said about those funny TDs. very good examples.
              they will do that, say this, blame everyone EXCEPT tackle the issue at hand in the face. 
              they spend more time and energy going in circles. dont know why they love that. maybe it can avoid the sensitive things they dont want or dont dare talk about. so they attack the person who raise hand to ask question, divert the attnetion then no need answer. a lot of TDs operate like this. thank you again for the good example. if this thread is edited or removed, then we will know how sensitive those things really are.

              <p>I also use to think like you. Previously my favourite remark about TD is: If you don't know how to get to a destination, 100% you will flag one who also don't know how to get there, and will take you on a merry go round.</p>
              <p>Now that I have an in-law that is a TD plus an upstairs neighbour, plus a former colleague, these are all ordinary folks like you and me, and does their work honestly. I began to see that most TD are honest people.</p>
              <p>Of course, there are the barracudas and sharks, you can feel them sizing you up from their eyes through the rear view mirror. These you have to be alert. For the rest just relax, they will take you the fastest and cheapest way they know. Sometimes their route may not be agreeable with what you have in mind, but there is no dishonesty. Anyway many places in Singapore can go by Route A or Route B, and they are almost the same.</p>

              <p>Fuck lah...go longer route for what? Waste our time only. How much can you earn for a sightseeing route? I start meter already $3.90 + 25% = $4.85. And you know must go how long then can get $4.85? $7.85 if inside CDB $8.08 if on call or $11.05 if on call inside CBD. So we will do our best to despatch pax ASAP so we can get the next pax. KNN now still got those old school thinking of going a big round to get a little more? Wake up your idea lah TS.</p>
              <p>Drive safe slow down and brake at traffic light also got complain. Drive fast to beat the traffic light also buay song. Then how? You think we like to slowly slowy ah? You know kanna 1 red light 45secs can only jump $0.22 but if going at average 60km/h 45sec can jump $0.44!!! So TD go do your math...A stationary taxi and a moving taxi which one earn more? And dun forget the faster you despatch a pax the fast you can get another pax.</p>
              <p>KNN dunno who's clone is that come in and stir....FUCK OFF LAH!!!!</p>

              i think so far theres only 1 and a half decent reply here. the rest is well, just like the lousy TDs, have might as well dont have better :)
              
              the 1 is from mancha.
              you are right most TDs are ok. but those odd ones you said are every now and then.
              they try to sound you out, or test you.
              
              the other half decent reply is from hammer. but after that its all downhill, just testerones talking. it make sense, TDs should earn more than picking up rather than rounding round, but not all TDs think that way from our experience.
              
              as for the traffic light, i think maybe i still was not clear enough. some of the TDs slow down AFTER the lights turn green! can from 80 to 30.. until he lights turn yellow AGAIN! then the driver happily brake to stop at Red. hmm?
              
              most of these funny things happen during peak or midnight times.
              and even tho i agreed this island not very big, most routes should be close,
              but i can say theres at least 2 routes we 2 times we went, its easily &gt;20-40% more than if we go our way. if its slightly under $20, the final can be $25-over $28. each time?
              
              thats the difference.
