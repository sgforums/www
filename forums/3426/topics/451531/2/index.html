            <div class='col-md body'><p>hi bro, best to start relief first.  i also got my lic recently after much thought and had decided to be relief driver to get myself more familarise with all the route and buildings first.  so not so much pressure on myself as i don't have to worry paying the full rental of the car; therefore less overhead and less burden.  moreover to drive long hour is also very tiring, almost got myself into accident by dozing off.  being omo you will strain yourself out, trust me it is not eay to find relief driver unless you want to drive perm night shift.  you can start be a super relief and decide later whether you would want to be a hirer.  good luck.</p></div>

              Wish 1.8 16-18kg range 180-220. But 1.8 use almost no petrol except
              starting engine. Maybe few dollars a month but 2.0 is running abt
              2-5% petrol so must top up 10-15 dollars a week.</p>

              <p>HH8888 da ge, my coursemate went to sign up with SMRT today. Was told if non bankkrupt personnel, $1K deposit, if bankrupted before $1.5K. my course mate paid $210 ($10 admin fee, $200 / $1000 deposit can get back 06 months) return your deposit into ur giro if no demerit points or complaint or accident. Plus return full course fee $285.00 as we take our TVDL from STA. Going full day course on coming 24th May and getting new Epica on early June 2012.</p>

              <p>Ah Khoon are with Epica .</p>
              <p>Newbies wish to enquire about TransCab , can actually ask them .</p>
              <p>These people stayed on because they are accident free and even with accident , they unlike myself , they paid normal rate .</p>
              <p>As for LV , it is very useful for OMO .</p>
              <p>Not taking jobs , but more than that .</p>
              <p>Like members will share : " member AP where can try ?"</p>
              <p>"member , Qantas which terminal ?"</p>

              <p>Imagine without LV infos , u stuck in the jam and caused you lose $10-$20 in income for that one hour .</p>
              <p>So what is that $30 member fee a month ?</p>
              <p>Of course overall LV can cost member about $100 in extra expenses each month .</p>
