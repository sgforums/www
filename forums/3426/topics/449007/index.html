              Many had tried different ways ..... still unsuccessful .
              
              Why ?
              
              Answer : Security .
              
              What kind of security ?
              
              Could be drug traffickings by anybody ? 
              
              Could be molest or even rape ?
              
              Could be robbery ?
              
              If u consider my 3 points above , would u share a car with anyone , or take a bus , mrt or taxi ?
              
              And the last consideration . . . . is it expensive to take a bus , taxi or mrt ? Where safety cannot be compromise ?
              
              Yes that's my answers .

              <p>Car pooling used to be quite popular in the late 70s and early 80s. Used to see advertisement in the papers back then.</p>
              <p>Technically if same company, I think it can be done but it's question of insurance. For members of public, you'll need insurance and LTA approval.</p>

              <p>what is the point of owning a car? Its the price to pay for convenience than why bother to inconvenient oneself just to own a car? i just dont get it..... Im sure most of these owners doing such car pooling job have a full time job on their own.</p>
              <p>And with COE and petrol maintaining at a high level for a long time to come do you really think all these cheapo car owners gonna last long on the road competing with taxis?</p>
