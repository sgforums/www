              <p>There is no need for too many additional fares. Just raise the flag down fee will do.</p>
              <p>Singapore taxi fares are among the cheapest around. Raising fares won't make it more difficult for them. Just see all the taxi queues around taxi stands.</p>

              <p>As much as I don't like TT (I didn't vote for him), all he is
              suggesting here is that those taxi drivers who want to drive till

              <p>My own Comfort cabbie dad (62 this year) has said that he would
              continue driving for as long as his health permits. He could have
              chosen to retire peacefully if he wants, but he sees it as a means
              of keeping himself occupied and being less dependent on me and my
              siblings.</p>

              <p>TT did not suggest anything, you have to get it right, he is just seconding what NTA proposed. The idea is from NTA peoples, not TT. </p>
              <p>As said earlier, if you ever drive a TD, for a TD at 75yo, instead of being productive in servicing the transportation of peoples in singapore, you may become a danger to both road users and yourself, and you will not be productive if you are just passing time. There are 40,000 full time cabbies, 2,000 are near or just above the 70yo mark.</p>
              <p>Usually you see long Q at orchard, CBD office areas and other places of interest, these show that not all the cabbies or their reliefs are on the road, so, there is deem to have shortage which is actually not the case, but because of the so call pass time cabbies are either sleeping or enjoying life with grandchildrens, drive 4 hrs and keep taxi for own use, then peoples start to complain no taxis, and LTA start to issue more taxis on the road leading to COE goes up and more jam, and more TDs.</p>
              <p>OTR if you cannot see well, hear well and react well, it just a matter of second before u hit a collision. TD is not a CEO or President job where you just sit there, attend meeting, being serve tea and cakes,  make executive decision and delegate your subordinates thru emails or instructions. It is both a mental and physical stress job, you see taxis ram into shophouses, 7 eleven, pubs, drain guards, peoples and so on. Therefore, as a TD ourselves, we knows that at 75yo, accept for a few, it is not viable to drive anymore. Even some private car owners who reached 75yo had give up driving. You expect a 75yo to chiong 8 hrs on the road??</p>

              <p>We as taxi drivers certainly is happy with what TT endorsed, but as someone said he is not a TD, and most of these NTA executives who suggested it are management/bosses, coupled with a few bootlicking grassroot leaders that have a yes man mentality would had agreed to whatever the boss suggested.</p>
              <p>And why do they suggest 75yo?? why not 78yo or 77yo?? the motive is clear, they need drivers to rent their taxis, as singaporean youngs are more afluent, Taxis driving with a pathetic 2 to 3k income is not going to entice them, so they need to oldies to carry on to pay rental and fuel fees to them. From here you can see that, instead of increasing fares prices to a 1st world taxis price like OZ or NY or Jap, so as to attract the younger ones who cannot really make it in their studying to have a decent living at 4 to 5k income, they choose to extend taxis driving age. The question is what happen 5 years later, are they going to extend to 80yo?? The solution is not about extending our age to your benefit of having rental income, the solution is to mark up the income of TDs so that it can be an attract career for the new young blood to join and build a decent family here.</p>
