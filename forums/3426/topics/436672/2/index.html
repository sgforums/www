              <p>I think if TJS wins, whether he got much to say as a president or not, the political situation of singapore would had changed, it will be a totally different scenarios, poltical is not mainly about the person, it is very much about the influences, the forces and strength within.</p>
              <p>If TJS is the president, oppostiion WP sitting in the parliament will be in a better situation to get themselve be heard and perhap, thing get done.</p>

              <p><br>Sure past time, unless their childrens never support them or they did not have any saving, then they hv to drive at least 8hrs, knn, with 2 to 3 childrens support them, each $500 per month, if it is me, i also just past time, drive Taxis bring grandchildrens go seaside play. Some of them go tour a few times per year, then will call me to relief them, but be their relief is good, cos they very chin chai one, everything also can, that is one good thing old hirer, they take life so easy. Like you say you are in AP, add another 2 hrs, will pay him accordingly, old hirers will said, take your time, slow slow, no need to pay me extra, dun rush, and no need to wash car...so good leh, but i usually will pay them extra, if not paiseh. But their taxi usually old crown.</p>
              <p>However, we got to be realistic, tho it is good for old hirers to past time, we need to be concious of the situation if all hirers who are getting older year by years, in future just drive to past time, issues which also happen today will surface more if old hirers drive to past time.</p>
              <p>example. Paxs complain of no taxis at peak location period leading to release of more new Taxis on the road, if you drive taxi to pass time, the purpose and productivity of the taxi goes down, it serve no purpose to the public other than for the self interest of the driver, these ultimately will lead to more New Taxi and drivers on the road which mean more competition for those who drive taxi to rise a young family.</p>

              <p>Yes, I do agreed that it up till 75 yr old.</p>
              <p>But shouldnt he add in more favour towards this group of taxi drivers?</p>
              <p>For eg. they will be given a certain kind of pension if they want to continue driving from 70 till 75.??? To help them not to overly stress out themselves?</p>
              <p>TT needs to think himself and his advisor should think out of box to help the pple. Not pap say this, he agree this. Say that, he agree that.</p>

              <p>To drive to 75yo is consider a bad life, I got tourist asking me, why some of your Drivers are in their 70s and still driving, I told them, we work till die, in fact, some TDs end up dead in the taxi due to Heart Attack or Stroke or whatever aging health problems. And the worst is, this current lots of 37 to 50yo age are biggest group in term of our population (FT/PR not included), these are the group produced during the baby booming period where all cannons fired, reach their targets. So imagine in 30-25 years time, you will see a big group of old peoples, and that is why the govt are currently trying very hard to extend the age of working and olso encourage citizens to embrace long life working and employability.</p>
              <p>The reason behind is that the govt do not want to hold the social responsibility of such a big group of old peoples in future, by working, one can support oneself.</p>
