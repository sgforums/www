              <p>Greetings.</p>
              <p>Im currently having my full time job (NUS) 8am-5pm. Leaving home at 6.30am to send kids to school (simei) and wife to werk (Stirling Rd) and reaching home by 7.30pm after fetching them back.</p>
              <p>im looking at becoming a hirer to supplement our low household income. or alternatively as a part time relief - first. If things are in favour.. eventually my target will be as Hirer, leaving behind the supposedly stable full time job..</p>

              <p>on the other hand.. if were to quit my full time job and suay suay kena road accident or suspended driving.. the taxi will have to be surrendered and there goes my driving and full time job.. </p>
              <p>so.. will it be possible to hold full time job as well as being a hirer - to get the best of both worlds?</p>

              <p>TS, sound like you have your own private car with all the ferrying.</p>
              <p>Driving taxi is not for everyone, or rather not everyone can make it.</p>
              <p>Do bear in mind that there is</p>
              <p>NO CPF</p>
              <p>NO medical leaves</p>
              <p>NO stable income</p>
              <p>In short, is it not as easy as you think.</p>
