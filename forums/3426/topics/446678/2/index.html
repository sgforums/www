I upset him before, but some people say, if a bad situation can be resolved between men, friendship may be the result.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Bu if u talk like his workshop standard kena sai, then finished liao.

              Every games got their rule and regulation, Taxi driving is not exceptional.
              
              For CDG, they certainly have a strict rule and regulation but are compensate with higher exposure and systematic services.
              
              They are strict because they are handling over 20,000 cabby, and thanks to those unethical and misbehave driver to bring CDG into today,becoming "unhumanity", treatment to the good and fair driver as well. They just couldn't get the Balance right.
              
              Visiting their office is a much more pleasant experience then stepping into Transcab. Your enquiry are more professionally attended.
              
              They put up sign in their public area to commit their payment on cashless mode. This enhance cabby confident to accept cashless mode. It is cabby themselves, who is poor in  personal financial management are reluctant.
              
              Cab Servicing, have not experience it, but i believe should me the same or similar to SMRT. Time taken might vary, at least there a comfort waiting area to rest and rejuvenate, properly with some hot drink too. (please correct me if i'm wrong)
              
              Lastly, the exposure. Might not always give you the best job, it certainly provide more then others. Use it wisely, with some passion and uniqueness, they are there to become your personal client.
              
              When we ended our path as a cabby, it is already narrow. Why further narrow it by closing our door to possibilities.
