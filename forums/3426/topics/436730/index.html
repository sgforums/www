              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Hi All</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I am currently now driving a blue comfort sonata since 11 Jul  2011, sharing it with my father. I drive the day shift, he drives the night shift. I am also currently waiting for my own cab to drive as OMO. Guess need to wait for at least one more month or so.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Little background of me. I am currently in the early thirties, married with 2 lovely kids. A four year old boy and a one year old baby ger.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">The main reason of joining as TD is to spend more time with my family and at the same time bringing in a decent pay home every month. In fact what I earn now as TD is way below my previous income. Why a drastic change? A question my friends have asked me without fail when they got to know that I had changed my job as a TD. I would then answer as follows. First my previous job required me to work non stop even up to wee hours, burnt weekends are a norm. One fine day when I reached home after a long day at work, my boy rushed to the door and hugged me tightly. He cried, really badly. I tried to comfort him and asked him why he cried. He said, Daddy why u always not at home, why u always failed to keep ur promises to bring me here, there, etc. Why I dun have a daddy that spend time with me.  I was shocked at words from a four year old boy. I stoned and hugged him tightly saying "Daddy is sorry, please forgive me".  That night I could not sleep. I reflected upon the incident for days. In my mind there was a question which kept repeating. "How many times I have disappointed my son." I had a deep discussion with my wife then.  Conclusion arrived that it was time to change to a new job. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Second my father knew that I wanted to change to a new job, he asked whether I would like to join him as a TD first while still keeping my options open on my next job. I have done my sums on my financial. Considering the income I likely to get as a TD and the savings I had with my wife, also managed to clear my mortgage and car loan, it should be sufficient to allow a comfortable life for me and family. I agreed. Therefore I took the test, got my TVL and started my journey as TD. </span></p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Routes</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">The first few days on the job were quite happening. Why leh? Got the adrenaline kicked in, always excited to find new paxs to send them to their destinations. Feel satisfied after every successful trip. Of course there were times making the same newbie mistakes. Went the wrong way, or unintentionally went via a longer route. I would quickly apologise. Luckily most of the paxs understand knowing that I just started as TD, they would just say never mind. As usual, to compensate for my mistakes I would discount on the fares or asked them to pay their usual fare. Now I more or less am quite comfortable on the road. More familiar with the routes, lesser time spent flipping through the street directory. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Also there were times when pax said a destination, mind totally went blank, could not connect the correct route to the destination. I would then pretend and ask their preferred route. Sometimes the route could be so easy that I would just laugh it off quietly in me and said why I never thought of it in the first place.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Calls / bookings</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Taking calls / bookings are common for me especially comfort are strong, taking the major market share. <span> </span>I simply love to take calls/bookings, extra income on top of fare. But hor some calls are really hard or should I say cannot take at all. For instance, I am in AMK Techplace II, a call comes in from serangoon garden. I will curse the MDT. How to take and reach in 5mins leh? Map distance is less that 1 km, but I need to drive one big round to reach. Either AMK ave 5 to yio chu kang and chiong 3 traffic lights to enter serangoon garden or drive to AMK ave 1 via CTE and shoot thru lorong chuan. By the time I reach, the pax will definitely face black black and knn me for taking so long to take. Another is at dover road, call come in from Mt Sinai. Got river in between, either need to drive pass it by Ghim moh, or Ulu pandan. These types of calls I will just forgo but hor sure kenna the stupid reject 1 job message from call center. 3 reject equal 1 hour suspension, sianz to the max. <span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">When I just started, I would even take calls/bookings from Taxi stands during non peak hours or by the road side. I would do my best and chiong to the pick up point asap. But poor me, clients often went MIA. Then I realised how naïve I were and how heartless the paxs could be. Seeing via my own eyes that pax flew me a huge airplane, and hopped on an empty cab that drove past the pick up point before I could reach. I was just across the road doing a U-turn. From then on I will just reject such calls. Of course there are rare paxes that made my day. They would reject the cabs that drove past them, wait patiently for my arrival. This type of pax I respect. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial; position: relative; top: -2pt;     ">There are also cases that I almost reaching the pick up point, booking cancelled. I would just curse my luck and continue driving. Interestingly there would be a ninja pax near the pick up point flagging. Initially I thought it was just coincidences but there was one incident that wake me up to the real world. One day I took a booking at hougang ave 1 block 125 road side, a pax call David. When I was reaching, booking cancelled. I had no choice but to drive on, Then a pax flagged me almost at the same location as the pick up point. <span> </span>Picked him up and soon along the journey he called someone on the phone and addressed himself as David. Haha caught you!!! I immediately took a quick glance at him at his eyes via the rear mirror and I saw the “guilty” or “xin xu” look. From then on, when I have a cancelled booking, I will never pick pax at or near the cancelled pick up location. I will drive past as a “Busy” cab. I have my pride. No tricks please.</span></p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">About Paxs</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Most of the paxs I encountered are nice. I always make a point to greet them when they board my cab. I believe a good start will ensure a pleasant trip. Some are appreciative to us for driving them safely, swiftly to their destination. They will usually give a little more than the fare as tip. I will happily accept it and say thank you with a smile. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">But there are some paxs which I hope I will not encounter. Some I encountered myself, some heard it from my father.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">1. Paxs on a foul mood will complain at the slightest thing. Worse slam the door after alighting. Encounter a few</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">2. Paxs that expect you to carry their stuffs, luggage into the boot. Actually I do not mind to carry it especially at the airport, but I will appreciate if the pax can help me too. Do not stand there or just hop on to the cab while I struggle to put the stuffs into the boot. Some luggages are really heavy. Encounter quite often especially Indians pax. Not being a racist here. Sorry.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">3. Paxs that shortchange you the fare. Only encounter once. I picked up these 3 teens near wood depot going to amk ave 10. Reach destination, fare was about 13 bucks, but they realised they had only 10 bucks with them. Kept saying sorry to me, I accept it since just a 3 dollars difference.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">There are some Paxs that think TD will always drive a longer distance to cheat their money. Actually I doubt most TD will do that. I will rather quickly complete the trip at the fastest time, so I can pick up another fare from other pax. That kind of extra $0.20 or $0.40 I rather not earn it. Every trade sure has their fair share of bad ones. There are incidents where lawyers and bankers that ran away with clients money. So all lawyers and bankers are bad?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Also some paxs always think that TDs are bad, reckless drivers? Every accident sure must involve TD. But while I drove on the road, I had seen my fair share of lousy drivers. There are plenty of drivers not just TD that cut lane abruptly, jammed their brake suddenly and even chiong red lights. It just tat cab is highly recognise thru their helmet of the car roof, so it just a generalize statement to typecast TD. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></span></p>

If you face black black then most likely will kanna from the pax. I know because when I drive is see mood one. If bad mood leh...then will have problem with the pax loh.

              Dear colafantasy,
              
              I read your posting and enjoyed it thoroughly. I share your sentiments although I think you are way too young to start driving a taxi. While I can see that you love your children very much and has accepted the tradeoffs between work and family time, I was wondering if you might be considering a regular job that still pays you less that your previous one but yet giving you time to be with your children. It's true that money is important, but you have made the correct step to spend more time with your children, especially during their formative years. The deep relationship you develop with your children while they are young is what counts. I have seen parents busy with careers while their children were small and then try to compensate the missing years with gifts when their children became teenagers. But gifts can never buy genuine relationships. Spend time with your children, bring them to parks, museums and such places. There still many places in Singapore where you do not need to spend much money on, I am sure you know of that. For example, my wife and I will go to the museums while packing our own lunch boxes.
              
              I am sure you will make a good father. The question I always ask my friends who are fathers is this: what kind of legacy do you want to leave behind for your children..

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>As a relief, i believe you hv more than enough time to be with your kids, kids alway need and wanted their parents to be around, when they growth up, the reverse is true, they would like more private time than to be with you.</p>
              <p>There are plenty of jobs that do not demand a 12hrs shift, as young as you are, my suggestion is that you take up a job, built a career out of it, TD in 20 years time is still a TD, no bonuses, no CPF, no medical, no leaves and no pay increase, fares increases alway go together with rental and diesel price increase, it always back to square one for TD.</p>
              <p>I believe that many who had taken TD since early 30s, but now in their 40s or 50s, would had some regret in not holding to a permanent working job, but nevertheless, they are stuck with it, or so call use to TD, there is not much room for them to return to the workforce. Be it a diploma holders, a O level, A level, or ITE, once over 40s, it is very hard for you to get a job and those above 50s, can sign on TD forever,</p>
              <p>You are right to love your kids and understand them, but you must also teach your kids to be independent, teach them about the true of this money minded society, to wash and do their own chores, able to take the hard knocks of life so that when they grew up, they are able to stand on their own.</p>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Actually I do not see myself working as TD for long. Transition period I guess. Perhaps when there is a good job opportunity comes knocking, i will jump ship lor. But as for now, I love every single minute as a TD. I love to see the fare meter jump, happily collect fare from pax at the end of every trip and finally count my takings at the end of the day. </span></p>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Actually beside sonata drivers, I do see TD from other companies driving recklessly too. Especially for those who want to be ahead of me in order to "snatch" the flagging pax 50m ahead. I think I also at fault too, cuz when I sweep the road for pax, I can be very slow at 40 to 60km/hr. Some old timers sure cannot take it and makan me to the max.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I also do not agree this statement saying TDs equal to reckless drivers. I do see other drivers on road zoom left right like F1 drivers or "initial d" type. Jam my brakes several times to avoid collision just because they change lanes suddenly.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I think people like to typecast TD as hooligans on the road. I came to a conclusion that it is because cab is highly recongnised by the "helmet" on the roof. When other drivers cut lanes abrupt, probably they will just curse that stupid "lexus, mercs, bmw, toyota etc" driver and forget the incident quickly. But once a cab cut into their lane dangerously, they will definitely "lock on" this incident in their mind and start to complain to friends, relatives, media, etc. I believe that are the effects of branding.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Err my style of driving is quite norm I guess. So far so good. I had my driving license since 2001, zero accident. NCD still at 50%. ***Touch wood*** lol</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I am more to the "scare die" type. I make a point to ensure traffic is clear before I switch lane or turn into main roads. Of cuz at times forget to turn on signal but that is when I am sure no car is next to me. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Oh ya forget to add on, I am new to some roads in singapore, never travel before. So at times drives till a point then realises must make a turn here/there. If not overshoot, pax will complain. So have no choice but to change lane that may inconvenience other drivers. Hope fellow drivers can bear with me for the time being.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Some comments by pax on my driving. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">1. Why I like to keep a huge distance from the front vehicle? I will just smile and reply telling them my reaction very slow one, will take awhile to act upon the situation. .</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">2. Why I like to drive only 90 to 100km/hr only at expressway where other cars are zooming past me? I just tell them it will be dangerous to drive too fast. So must drive within my comfort zone. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Safety of pax is my priority and at the same time need to safeguard mine too. At day, will fulfill my role as TD diligently, fetching Pax to their desired destination without incidents. At night will return home for my role as husband and father, fulfilling my promise to them returning home safely. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I also make a point to slap myself with too additional polices from Chartis / Comfort. Subscribed to the max plan. No one will want to get into accidents but you will never know what God has his plans for you.  </span></p>
