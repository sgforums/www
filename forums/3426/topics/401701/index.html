              <p>I return my smrt taxi on 5 May. They told me I will get back my security deposit within 3 months. Recently they send me a letter telling they have deducted $900 out of the $1000 deposit for the accident acccess because of an accident which happen on last July (which have been settle 100% NO fault on my side). Now they claim that because I left the company, they must deduct the $900 for 6 years so as to prevent the other party claiming against them. They gave me another option, if I want back my $900, to sign an undertaking letter that I will bear all consequences that arises within 6 years if other party counter-claim.</p>

              This is ridiculous lor! Will SMRT remember to refund after 6 years?
              
              I was taught by 1 liao qiao not to pay rental if i wanted to return. 
              
              Your case will certainly make me do that.

              <p>The dilemma TD face with Taxi Company.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, I think this case should be brought up to CASE (Consumer Assciation) and see what they say. But then, we need to be member.</p>
              <p>I think very soon, I will have the same problem as I am returning vehicle. I had 2 accident. One 100% I am right and one 50-50 which I have already paid $600.</p>
              <p>It is kind of strange. In SMRT terms, below are the rates for excess :</p>
              <p>100% right - $0 Excess</p>
              <p>50-50 case - $600</p>
              <p>100% lose - $1500 (600+900)</p>
              <p>Taxi destroyed - $4500</p>
              <p>So as far as I can see (given what NKL has shared), irregardless of the outcome of the results, Taxi driver loses when they have at least one accident happen to them during when they drive is SMRT. We have no one to voice out. SMRT Taxi Association cannot say much. 6 yrs of waiting and when they return us, there is no interest. At least when I put tha amount inside any bank in a personal account, I get some interest back.</p>
              <p>Let me go and check my contract and see whether there is such clause. Cause I do not remember anyone highlighted such thing to me when I sign up.</p>
              <p>Anyone that sign up with other taxi company, at least met with one type of accident and has since return vehicle. Do you have such problem?</p>

              <p>Let me retold my story:</p>
              <p>My relief got into an accident on March 2010, got bang from the back. My taxi only bumper dent in only (not the bumper, but the frame for the bumper and brake light very slight dent in). Go report at the SMRT accident report, I specifically show them only my bumper was dent. Waited 5 days for my taxi to be repair. Called them numerous time why they need to take so long to repair a bumper. Finally on day 5 I got a shock, they change a new bumper, a new sets of brake light, a new booth and a new set of advertisement. At whose expense? Doesn't take a professor to know who the bills goes to.</p>

              <p>Not very surprised by what they did. When trouble comes, they take the easiest route, and that is to make cabbies pay for it. Change everything new, or worse, cannibalise from an existing cab which is already decommissioned, and then make you "pay" for it. If I am not mistaken, Nissan no longer makes spare parts for cedrics. Not so sure about crowns though. So when they say parts are new, best is dont believe them.</p>

              <p> My favourite taxi uncle ever told me : " Some taxi company really good for nothing one ."</p>
              <p>He ever heard from someone , one Taxi Company A, from top to bottom , all eat $$$ one . Like those dealing with Company B bringing their staffs home  . One top director and one of the top taxi driver in charge , makan as much as $600,000 between them .</p>
              <p>This is one disgraceful act not exposed by the media , cos same what XXXXXding ma , under one what Sek XXXXing .</p>
              <p>If only CPIB and PWC goes thru their books , they are losing millions from this sort of undertable issues uncovered , rather than those cost of diesels and overheads .</p>

              <p>Bro Angku,</p>
              <p>Thanks for your help. Let do you and all your fellow classmate a favour by sounding a warning about SMRT stupidity. Help prevent any future cabbies from falling into their trap. They are nothing but a bunch of money suckers. Now its a good time to shame them cos of the SMRT train incident.</p>
              <p>Let get together all people who are victims to blow up the issues. I will be going to see my MP soon (Mr K Shanmugan) on this issue.</p>
