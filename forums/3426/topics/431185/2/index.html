              <p>It is good to take some experience driver advices here, however, take it as a guidelines, I too take some good advices here and enjoyed the jokes very much after a hard day work especially from ALN and Komade and many others, their posts are very much relevant in our trade which in one way or the other, you will find similar situation while driving.</p>
              <p>Then from these guidelines, do your own planning and the way you wanted to drive as you drive on. Most importantly, is enjoy your driving, alway go with a good spirit, there will be good and bad paxs and also poor and good intake days. As long as you are enjoying what you do, discipline, work hard, and take the smart advices here, with no doubt, you can be a good and happy driver.</p>
              <p>And then, more importantly, you need to find time to pamper yourself once awhile for your hardwork, be it enjoying outing with family, exercises or massage etc etc. Give yourself a pat.</p>
              <p>As for income, as you drive on, you eventually can estimate yourself and set target with a given tolerances, do not set a target that ask for heaven and hell, you will find you struggling with others and may, touch wood, get into an accident, or booked by LTA or TP, then that is too bad. I got frens who alway get book for speeding, red bus lanes, knock here and there until give up TD.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>i also agreed theres going to be big changes. they are now alerted to the complains and they must do something before the next elections. maybe thats why they rolling out the new satelite erp system so fast following. i think they are going to set in motion a series of changes to the transport industry one by one, they may even start with taxi first before bus and train, becos its high time for overhaul. illegal speeding, illegal parking/stopping, illegal uturns, accident causing, so many cannot list all. so its not a question of what, its more of a question of when..when hit 91kmph only means a straight fine :)</div>
