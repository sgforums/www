              <p><br>That's absolutely true, It is call the net profit. But we should take it as a business cost, or the so called operating cost of a business, same goes to any business, let say a chicken rice stall towkay, he had to take into consideration his rental, his price of ingredient, chickens and 1 or 2 employees wages, so by selling you $3, he could only take in $1 ++. The real business peoples are the one on top sitting on the big desk with nice sexy secretaries, big computers screen and a cosy private office, not us, in front of us are steering wheel, MDT, walkie and some galaxy or GPS or cam and the road. He is the one who set up this system, run it, and when its works, the rest is just money keep pouring in, he can go clubbing, golf, luxury spa, holiday for all he wants, but we, as the lower peoples and part of his created system will have to slave for him.</p>
              <p>Any companies that had a turnover of a million dollars, can register with the govt to charge Gst, can a taxi driver earn a million per year?? But a taxi companies can charge you that, because their turnover is millions, all thanks to our contribution.</p>
