              <p>
              </p><p>Last Friday, around 10pm, I picked an interesting New Zealander at Changi Airport. After loading his single haversack into the trunk of my taxi, we set off to his hostel at Thomson Road, with him seated at my side. He seems like a friendly chap with a constant smile on his face and being a chatty cabby myself, we began an interesting conversation on the journey.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He told me that he purposely came over to Singapore for a week of holiday after his business seminar in Australia. He felt extremely safe here, not like other South East Asian countries or the United States. He further revealed that whenever he takes taxis in New York, there is a 95% chance that the cabby is a new immigrant, who hardly speaks English but it’s a reverse here. Life is easy for N.Y. cabbies, he said, as they do not have to ply the streets for 6-8 hours a day and most of the time they sits around waiting for a call booking. Then, without his asking, I began to ran a brief commentary of the reality of taxi business and life of a cabby here for his understanding.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I told him that all taxi drivers here are Singaporeans, as taxi vocational license is be given to Singapore citizen only. I don’t know of any other jobs here that has this requirement, where foreigners are not allowed to take up this vocation. Even in strategically important agencies like Temasek Holding, which is responsible for investing billion of dollars of public money, it does not require Singapore citizenship for their Number 1 position. Therefore, either taxi driving is the most privileged job in Singapore or it’s the last resort for redundant Singaporean workers. Of course, the former is not true.</p>

              <p><br>There is a paradigm change in our industrial till now, let me give you a brief on our industrial evolution,</p>
              <p>1st we started as a low cost industrial with a high production rate, we make shoes, pens, papers, brushes, household item like plastic containers, shirt and trousers.</p>
              <p>Then by the 80s, we start to shift into manufacturing, electronic, marine, and many others than need more skills and on job training</p>
              <p>then by 90s, we are named as the 4 tigers of Asia in term of manufacturing and we move into a knowledge base economy, and that alone, causes alot of structural unemployment, meaning there are more high tech, skill and knowledge required job but many are not qualify to do it, and that is where most TDs like chief, me, and all those Rbs and JDI are born driving from crown to cedric</p>
              <p>then by 2000, we moved into a global economy, and that is where the flood was opened and people start to flow in mass into our country like water, and govt give us an image at the pretext of Foreigner are here to create job for Singaporean, the biggest joke and crook statement of the 21st century. However, the every obedient Singaporean took for it, and till now? we are feeling the heat of it and start to slowly tell them to go fark spider.</p>
              <p>With that in mind, taxi is still a last resort for even the youngs, because, the youngs today can really find no job or job that recognize a decent salary that had being depressed by foreigners.</p>
              <p>And if our young is to work for a foreigner boss, game over for him. Last time is yes, because we are not structurally prepared to take up a job, never want to train, never want to further study,</p>
              <p>But today, our youngs are educated, really to take up any job, but it is thru depression and the sick of these society create by our govt that drive many youngs to take up taxi driving out of agony.</p>
