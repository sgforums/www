              <p>More commuters are booking limousine 
                  services on rainy days and during peak hours, when the taxi crunch is at
                   its worst. But some operators of these limousine services say they are 
                  not in a big rush to meet such demand, because of the disruption and 
                  strain it can put on their fleet.</p>
              <p>Most of the 15 commuters interviewed by The Straits Times said they 
                  were willing to pay for a limousine ride when cabs are scarce. Mr Andy 
                  Williams, 34, said he and his wife took one when they had to get home 
                  from the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal after a holiday in Bintan.</p>
              <p>"The place was packed and we couldn't get a taxi at all," the sales 
                  director said. "We couldn't even phone for one." He paid a flat rate of 
                  $50 for the limousine, which was waiting at a designated counter of the 
                  terminal.</p>
              <p>"It wasn't quite worth it, but at the time I really wanted to get 
                  home," said the British citizen, who has lived in Singapore for four 
                  years.</p>

              <p>No need $5 , $3 enough to lure some looking for quick trip type there .</p>
              <p>The problems ..... authority created those loop holes for them to explore .</p>
              <p>Also when CDG implemented the taxi pricing , they only think , if no taxis , commuters can all ......</p>
              <p>They got think between $3.50 and $5 ( without needing to pay levy ) , which way the drivers will chose ?????</p>

              <p>It's all because CDG want commuters to call their hotlines from TMFT that is why there is no TMFT surcharge , and end up "who the fuck want to go in ?"</p>

              <p>As for Sentosa .... they no need put whole island $3 surcharge ....</p>
              <p>Just erect a few more taxi stand .... like one at Siloso Beach , one at Palawan Beach , and the current taxi stand at Beach Station , that will be good enough to kick those private buses out .</p>
              <p>And to be more precise , hotel taxi stand all with $3 surcharge , so hotel also will not lose out to the rest of the taxi stand .</p>

              <p>It's all because CDG want commuters to call their hotlines from
              TMFT that is why there is no TMFT surcharge , and end up "who the
              fuck want to go in ?"</p>
              <p>And if LTA loot a $3 TMFT surcharge inside , who will call
              comfort ? And comfort will lose that revenue from the levy .</p>
              <p>Then those limo explore those loopholes .</p>
              <p> Cos to chose a call of $3.50 ($0.40 levy ) and pick n go
              with $5 carrot , i will go for the $5 carrot .</p>
              <p>What call ???</p>

              <p>By just reading and not posting is fine with me........they might be shy to post.........</p>
              <p>But for a season forumer, not sharing and post on certain topic is ok.......but after which telling what you post is not positive, I find that I couldn't accept.........</p>
              <p>Anyway take it as I petty or what........if nobody wanted to share their experience in limo forum, why should I?...........</p>
