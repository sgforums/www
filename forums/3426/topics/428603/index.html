              <p>One question.... You never go for the MDT course, right?  If you had went for the course, you would have known that if you are getting problem having the credit card payment go through, then there is also the manual process where you fill in the charge slip and get the customer to sign.  A bit leh ceh, but then you get back the full amount.  As for Nets payment not going through, then there's no such thing as manual charge slip. Instead, you can offer to drive them to the nearest ATM to take cash.  There's a Esso very nearby to Bayshore.  It won't cost you more then $1 in diesel but you get your full payment plus this customer may not try the same trick in future.</p>
              <p>Advise you to contact Comfort to arrange for the MDT course soon.</p>

              <p>Ya , that area got a bit of a problem with cashless payment. Me no care, not my problem...it's your card problem or the stupid device problem... Have to go ATM at nearby and give cash la . Don't make life so easy for them . We not Charity to those condo ppl la. It should be the other way round.</p>
              <p>Remember : Make it difficult for those problematic ppl . If you do kind to them, they will try it again on the next poor driver.</p>
