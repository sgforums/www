              </p><p>There are many myths about Taxi Driver, from their earning, their attitude, their plying pattern... etc, all this topic always put us Taxi Driver in the limelight. And sometime make me feel like a super star.</p>
              <p>My friends like to ask me for the facts about taxi driving, why this......, why that.........., but i usually like to divert the issue to our dear government.</p>
              <p>The most common myths about us is........ we do make lots of money, that why we are picky.</p>
              <p>Is that a Fact ?....... it is a myth indeed. The fact is the opposite.</p>
              <p>Firstly, we are begin squeeze with high rental (cost) with some lame excuses.(you know it), to cover our break even expenses, we got to maximize our earning for every trip.</p>
              <p>We do follow our government policy to achieve our goal too, when there is a ERP charges for Taxi to enter into CBD ( that mean LTA discourage Taxi to enter that area to cause conjestion), we follow and that why commuter are having a hard time to get a Taxi in CBD esp. 6pm to 7pm when the ERP rate are at its peak.</p>
              <p>When there is extra $3 (surcharge) to encourage us to serve that area, we can queue for over an hour or more (in airport). That goes the same with the $3 CBD surcharge, it encourage us to serve the commuter there first. So those just outside the line of CBD, don't blame us, LTA do not have any encouragement for us to serve you yet.</p>
              <p>The fact about our earning, i can consider it as slightly higher that those low lncome earner, but there is nothing great to be better that the low income earner when our government set our "low income" to be.....really low. ( does not/have not appreciate with the inflation..... and their salary)</p>

              <p>This is where we need to seperate fact from fiction. Fiction occurs when the media announces that taxi fares must increase to help taxi drivers.</p>
              <p>Fact happens when taxi rental is increased for taxi drivers, to help taxi companies. Problem is, this is never published in the media. So general public thinks taxi drivers are getting richer and choosier.</p>
              <p>Taxi Drivers end up square one. Back to the same pattern.</p>
              <p>There is also the ongoing case of public complaining of lack of taxis (would like to know who and at what time) which is why some organisation is looking into the issue of making sure taxis are driven 24 hours a day (Hirer and Relief).</p>

              <p>Fact, but it's not complete</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Learn this lines from from the TV series (of course not SG one), those lawer like to question " Is this the truth"?  "Is it the complete truth"?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A fact that is not complete can lead to many other direction but the actual truth. Apparently, our media and "talent" knows this long before and are doing well in this area.</p>
              <p>We, Taxi Driver are always begin use to help "them" pushing thru their hidden agenda.</p>
              <p>We suffer form criticism, what bad attutide, not willing to serve, picky...etc. That's direct the general public to hate us. When actual agenda can be, they can easily increase our Cost which become their revenue eventually.</p>
              <p>Public do not give a damn care and think we deserve it, but little do they notice, who will eventually be paying for the increase?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We obtain sympathize when business are bad, when cost are too high. Public are then direct to Help Us, but little do they know who will actual suffer if help doesn't obtain, and who is the actual beneficial.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For once, i'm happy that Taxi Driver are somehow begin a "protected spices" by the powerful ones, but it is controlled at a level of not fallen into poverty but will never get RICH. </p>
              <p>In this area, they are getting the Balance Right, till now.</p>

              </p><p>Relief Driver</p>
              <p>Had been wondering who came out this great term "Relief", why not subtitute, partner or replacement....etc</p>
              <p>There is no words gonna be better then Relief, it really describe about Taxi Driving, the need for Taxi Driving.</p>
              <p>Be it a hirer looking for a relief, or be a relief...... it is really a Relief?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Newbies like OMO, a car all for himself. Can use the car for this...... for that, can work at own prefer timing, can work on the best hours....... etc, it always picture so good and it seem like heaven begin OMO, but indeed are leading to Hell.</p>
              <p>The stress, tension build up over time begin an OMO will soon discover that this picture doesn't really looks so good afterall.</p>
              <p>To cope with the extra rental plus fuel cost, it always sound easy, just 2 good hours will do. But that could be the only 2 good hours of the day.</p>
              <p>A shift of 12 hrs, is indeed over what our body can take. Going for another 2 hours, perhap, hopefully......... is like taking another 2 full spoon of rice in a already damn full stomach, on a daily basis.</p>
              <p>Half of the rental plus some fuel cost, that goes to about $60 per day. At $60 x 30 days (a month), that is $1800</p>
              <p>Some use this amount to fetch their children to school</p>
              <p>Some use this amount to send their parents for medical checkup</p>
              <p>Some use this amount for no others purpose but to park in the carpark and collecting fines. (yes, that's me)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Be money wise, there is a lot we can with $1800, i can even hire a private limo to let my children to travel to school in style.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Relief Youselves, get a Relief or be a Relief.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Learn this lines from from the TV series (of course not SG one),
              those lawer like to question " Is this the truth"?  "Is it the
              complete truth"?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A fact that is not complete can lead to many other direction but
              the actual truth. Apparently, our media and "talent" knows this
              long before and are doing well in this area.</p>
              <p>We, Taxi Driver are always begin use to help "them" pushing thru
              their hidden agenda.</p>
              <p>We suffer form criticism, what bad attutide, not willing to
              serve, picky...etc. That's direct the general public to hate us.
              When actual agenda can be, they can easily increase our Cost which
              become their revenue eventually.</p>
              <p>Public do not give a damn care and think we deserve it, but
              little do they notice, who will eventually be paying for the
              increase?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We obtain sympathize when business are bad, when cost are too
              high. Public are then direct to Help Us, but little do they know
              who will actual suffer if help doesn't obtain, and who is the
              actual beneficial.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For once, i'm happy that Taxi Driver are somehow begin a
              "protected spices" by the powerful ones, but it is controlled at a
              level of not fallen into poverty but will never get RICH. </p>
              <p>In this area, they are getting the Balance Right, till now.</p>

              <p>Profession is a job one's do for a living.</p>
              <p>Professional is a job one's done and gain respect from it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People like to get respected, same as Taxi Driver. Apparently, we did not get it. Most did our Profession without linking a Professional image to the public, care and concern to the public feeling.(i confess, i'm one of them)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What Professional image we can learn from those Lawer, Doctor or even Minister?</p>
              <p>Those Lawer will not openly tell people the dirty little trick they use, but we do. We tell the public how we conduct interview, on call trick.....etc.</p>
              <p>Those doctor will not openly tell people thieir hardship, the complaint they had, to seek sympathy, but we did. We tell the public how hard our work/life is, we tell / teach the public how to lodge a complaint against ourselves.</p>
              <p>Those Minister will never tell the Public they want to make money from us directly, but we did. We tell the public we want that extra $3, and we derserve it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These Professional knows, Dirty Tricks are to remain in Silent, Payee are not there to solve your problem, Do not educate people how to give you more problem (complaint), and nobody will agree that you require that extra $$$. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If Taxi Driver wants to gain respect from the public, there are more to learn from those Professional.</p>

              </p><p>Pax, Paxes...... where are you</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We talk about the unavailability of Taxi for decade...... with a s.....decades. And i believe we will be still talking about it for decade.... with a s....decades.</p>
              <p>This lure me into the trade thinking it's good money making here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do my streching, rubbing my fist and get ready for showtime. Who's knows........... it's the reverse...... where are the paxes?</p>
              <p>I use 80/20 rule, 80% of our time are in searching (sweeping), queueing for paxes and 20% of our time are then into business. Well, this is what business is about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During low period, my record is sweeping for 1 hour 23 mins, and got a pax for a $4.80 trip. (i follow regulation for not joing into queueing when there is more then designated waiting lots available in queue) </p>
              <p>Almost every traffic light change, there will be more then 1 (that's me) empty, hungry Taxi in search for pax. During waiting at traffic light change, there will be more then 1 empty, hungry Taxi passes by my intention routes.</p>
              <p>It require high level of accuracy, the pace of pax walking toward the road side and the pace my my vehicle moving, it take less then a second to hit nicely.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have to break the rule, queue at the Taxi Stand. It is very risky, might require to use more then my daily income to pay for a photography services.(worst is, i don't even get to see how posh i look in the vehicle)</p>
              <p>Queueing at Taxi Stand is slightly better, it is almost a guarantee pax within 15 mins. But is usually a feeder service  (80/20 rule apply). 15 mins of waiting, a 5 mins trip, 5 mins to return back and another 15 mins of waiting.........40 mins for $4.80. If god is blessing, still manage to do 3 trips........ i used up my blessing for $15 in an hour.</p>
              <p>That is reality during low period. It's ok, i still have my peak period, my 20%.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During peak, we enjoy additional 25% above meter. Filled my stomach, do my streching, rub my fist and ready, it's showtime.</p>

              <p>Taxi drivers are part of the people in singapore that had fallen thru the cracks of the society which was rated as the riches in term of GDP. Of course, there are many others who had fallen deeper than us, and for that matter, each and every one of us is struggling to climb up of the cracks, but then those on top will alway want to push you down, because if you come up, they might fall down, and is also why, TD is alway struggling and yao (hungry).</p>
              <p>The policies and changes will alway keep you busy, busy with rental, foods on the table, family, diesel, paxs, calls and many other factors in TD, and in political science, this is called Inducement. Once you are busy, you hardly got time to think of others thing, and certainly, never a revolting mind nor a rebellious one. And that kind of inducing gives those on the top more relaxing in controlling and governing you.</p>
              <p>We are the interim between the Taxis companies and the paxs, we face the music, get the boots, and certainly, get the danger of driving it, and yet, at the end of the day, we are the worst off of the three parties.</p>

              </p><p>Taxi Driving, Career ,Transit or Loitering</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Career, is a job one can built, bring oneself to another level for a better future. </p>
              <p>What can we build as a Taxi Driver?</p>
              <p>From a normal cabby to a limo cabby, from a limo cabby,built up clientee base to a Private Limo driver, from driver to boss........</p>
              <p>It is still a path one can consider. It's not the best option, but just another option.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Transit, is a cross over period in our career life.</p>
              <p>Taxi Driving is a good transit platform, it provide food to keep us going and freedom of time to search as well.</p>
              <p>Do not fall into the trap if one is taking this as a transit, chasing for money. It will exhaust your burning desire to success. That extra few hours is enough to put mind and body into a procrastination stage or even pull you away, further to your intented destination.</p>
              <p>By the time you realise, you are actually Loitering.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Loitering, is a stage when one is living aimlessly, from days... to years...... to even decades.</p>
              <p>Your life is fix, Your status is fix, Your history is fix</p>
              <p>Do not need a crystal ball, you can almost tell your future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no right or wrong here, there is only what we want.</p>

              <p><br>Today grads are unlike yesterday grads, entry for Uni and Poly is now so open and more easier to enter, worst worst, still can get a degree from SIM or some other private Uni, so many around, as for poly, no need to say, now is like my former technical school of yesterday..</p>
              <p>Therefore, there are alots of toms and dicks graduate who cannot fit into jobs that required top knowledge and profession, end up turning to driving cab, at least in hiding inside a cubicle of a taxis is better to get expose outside with a lower scale job</p>
