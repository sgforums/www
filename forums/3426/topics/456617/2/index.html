              . Using MOM standard  44hrs a week working hour 6 working days each week 1 day off per week
              before over time -----  we use 5hrs as breaking even point and 3hrs as earning
              = est $50-$60  per day monday to friday = est $250-$300 x 4week plus another 2 working days.  1 month salary only $1100-$1300( exclude amount to pay medisave
              other extra working to take as overtime to cover off day and sick leave
              
              As reported in the news/media , taxi driver income up to 3k plus,  do they ever report how we achieve that amount, how many hours is being put on the road, not getting a proper rest, risk oneself health and life to exchange for this 3k amount,
              i believe not just our trade, also some other trade or industries which people work with $800 - $1500 montly salary whose also have to put in extra time and effort to take home a higher amount home to cope with todays high cost of living.
              
              sometime i wonder what we are and not who we are. cos our minister can go out fight for foreign domestic work to have a day off each week and never i hear anyone voicing out to give taxi driver even a single day off in a month or a year
              
              simply public does not have a understanding ( except a few) what is the real life of the taxi driver like driving on the road) our accident rate quite high.  when accident happen involve taxi, everyone just blame taxi driver for the fault but never really understand the cause of it

              <p>Today, single at 30 and above can be a Taxi Driver, this should be revise. Revise to married with min 2 children. A contribution of 2 headcount to cover for themselves, close factory thereafter, and work real hard as a Taxi Driver to raise that 2 monkey.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once, there was a drunken girl, laying sideway at the back seat, wearing a short mini skirt......... with the curve of her body.......... the scene is so seducing. I can....... just wake her up, ask for direction and collect money then zoom off. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>

              <p>Brother...first and foremost, TD are consider self employ, some said small businessman, we are not cover under the employment act, you are not employed by your taxis company, you are actually a customer to the taxis company who rent from them and do your business on the road base on public laws and order, and as you rent from them, you need to follow some rental basic companies' regulation.</p>
              <p>The relation is you can get the cab, drove it, or throw it back and just walk off, but base on contractual, which you signed with eyes open, you have to oblige to any discrepancies and honor it, otherwise you get sued and terminated.</p>
              <p>You and me are the same as hawker selling mee or rice, rent the stall from town councils, apply for licence, paid licence fees, operate your sell foods, heckcare which day you want to take off or go holiday..as long as you paid you rent, powersupply bills, stay hygience, got business or not, is your problem.</p>
              <p>This type of business is call indirect business or consignment business, meaning before you make your pofit, they already get their profit in advance, kind of like prepaid card/cashcard business.</p>

              </p><p>Taxi, is a "Business"?</p>
              <p>I bracket the work "Business", because i did not found the characterlistic about Business in Taxi Driving.</p>
              <p>In business world, although there is a market price to follow, business owner got the freedom to list their PRICE. There is not punishment, penalise for selling higher or lower from the authority.</p>
              <p>In Taxi driving, our PRICE are determine by Taxi Company and endose by LTA. These parties will always put their objective first, then follow by the commuter and lastly at the expenses of Taxi Driver.</p>
              <p>Taxi Driver do not have any motivation to provide an excellent, niche, value added service. Because, there is no higher margin to work forward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In business, we could establish clientee base, a good clientee base would help towards the ease of running a business, future development. </p>
              <p>In Taxi Driving, what clientee base we will have? A $8 advance fees + meter...... there are plenty in CDG listing, many are lousy pick up location to a no connection destination. If such are good, there won't be no taker.</p>
              <p>Good pick up location, pax don't even need to place a booking.</p>
              <p>Good destination, is there much with our human flow pattern?</p>
              <p>There is no significant benefit to development a clientee base.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In business, people have a chance to built, from a one man operation to thousands of men working for the business.</p>
              <p>what is there to built in Taxi Driving when the next stage of development, owning the first vehicle had been prohibited.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No freedom of Price, No clientee base to built, no development to work forward. This is not a Business, it is similar to a dish washer job, a job with no advancement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only reason it is classified as a "Business" is, it can direct away from an employer and employee relation, which will be under the protection of employment act.</p>
              <p>So, it is reasonable to make Taxi Driving to work everyday, as there is everyday rental to fullfill.</p>
              <p>It is reasonable not to compensate from illness, no medical, no hospital leave....etc</p>
              <p>It is also reasonable to make a person provide his first 8 hours of work FREE. (for those omo)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are no responsibilities involve to the capitalise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If Taxing Driving still consider as a Business, it is properly the worst Business to invest.</p>
              <p>If it is a job, can it consider as a bad job?</p>
              <p></p>

              Taxi Driving in Singapore is a lot better than other place.
              
              I am a frequent traveller Taxi Driver 
              
              Last week read a news article in Taiwan
              
              Some Taxi Drivers in Taiwan are starting to do deliveries of goods
              
              Authorities found out and made a fuss 
              
              Out of curiousity, I asked one Taxi driver what is their average income
              
              NT40K to 60K 
              
              That is equavalent in SGD 1700 to 2553
              
              say their average is NT50K (SGD 2127)
              
              True Taxi Driving is not easy but income wise Sillyporeans Taxi Drivers are a lot better than elsewhere

              Sillyporeans TD likes to complain ???
              
              Let me tell you how pitiful those TD in HCMC, Vietnam.
              
              Do you know that they dun even has a place to sleep at night
              
              So where do they sleep ?
              
              In their taxi of course.
              
              Most TD are from provinces and they could not even afford rental in HCMC.
              
              Next question... where do they take their bath ?
              
              Taxi companies have alliance with some hotels ... to provide bathing facility for the TDs
              
              who is complaning now ???

              <p>Today, single at 30 and above can be a Taxi Driver, this should
              be revise. Revise to married with min 2 children. A contribution of
              2 headcount to cover for themselves, close factory thereafter, and
              work real hard as a Taxi Driver to raise that 2 monkey.</p>

              <p>Once, there was a drunken girl, laying sideway at the back seat,
              wearing a short mini skirt......... with the curve of her
              body.......... the scene is so seducing. I can....... just wake her
              up, ask for direction and collect money then zoom
              off. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>

              <p>Today, i'm more productive,drive less (some say lazy), more
              contented, $xx is ok (some say no ambition), more simple (some say
              no life)........</p>
              <p>But, i am a night shift driver that can wake up before
              9am.......... talk a little cock here...... and.......... here i
              come, JAV.</p>

              <p>In their taxi of course.</p>
              <p>Most TD are from provinces and they could not even afford rental
              in <span>HCMC</span>.</p>
              <p>Next question… where do they take their bath ?</p>

              bathing facility for the TDs</p>

              <p>decent, you talking from experience or what you heard from a Vietnam taxi driver?</p>
              <p>From what I heard, a Vietnam taxi driver can earn enough to support a family and even send his kids to university. Of course there are sacrifices like what you mentioned above.</p>
              <p>Singapore taxi driver is forced to buy expensive housing and does not have the option Vietnamese taxi drivers have. BTW, I have met Singapore taxi drivers who live in their taxis.</p>

              <p>I tried Taxi driving and clear the myth myself.</p>
              <p>TD do not earn lots of money.</p>
              <p>They are exposed to long hours of work on the road, meaning high risk motorist group,</p>
              <p>and also a health hazard occupation, leading to heart problem, high blood pressure due to road stress.</p>
              <p>What we earn is barely enough for living and the near medical expenses from long hours of driving. </p>
              <p>Who make the most money? the one that squeeze us of rental.</p>
