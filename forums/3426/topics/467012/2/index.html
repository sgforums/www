              <p><br>What buying car is beyong TDs? no lah, many TDs got private car ok, all tiam tiam smart smart act poor only.</p>
              <p>And for goodness sake, Taxis is bid under cat E since last august, not cat A hor.</p>
              <p>And since CAT E, open market COE got down by abt 30k, taxis will get their cab, if they buy 1.6CC and above, they lost out abit due to CAT B now is lower, but if those like i30 which is below 1.6, they gained because CAT A ismuch higher. Most taxis OMV and just hovering around 20k, so they may not have to pay the Additional FR. Which is 140 to 180% of OMV depend on the car OMV prices. Most taxi of today are kimchi make, hardly over 20k OMV, maybe K5 just above it abit only.</p>
              <p>At Feb, COE for Cat A was at 78k, typical siao sg people flocked l in at the last minutes before the the upfront 40 to 50% kick in, so dealers are sure to bid at 78k COE for them, after all, it the car buyer paying. So this round, you see a high COE for dealers to clear these cheapo lot who do not have the upfront 40 to 50% and certainly cannot afford limited 5 years loan period.</p>
              <p>Silver K5 was bought in at a high COE period, TC and SMRT epica was bought before the rise of COE to it highest. Therefore K5 commanded a higher rental fees, wrong move by silver, should had waited.</p>

              <p>Opps sorry, Bro Ang could be right, but certainly not Cat A COE that taxi is bidding, but on 3 months moving average of CAT A, however once it extract from Cat E, it also implied that CAT E will be affected once taxi co wants to expand their fleet. knn, cb LTA, peng here and there. Hehehe.</p>
              <p>Anyway, taxis is out of COE bidding, but if it need COEs it will take from CAT E Quotas.</p>
              <p>There are lots of 2004 to 2007 cars going to scrap in the coming years, and as this year proceed, LTA is cutting COE quotas slowly until maybe early next year, then maybe we can see a sharp fall in COEs coming early next year. For now, the first 3 bids, car market is adjusting itself to the new system, those with backlog need to clear will have to clear thru heavy biddings.</p>
              <p>Today high inflation is due to two factors, housing and car prices, if govt do not cool it or intervene it, then you see your kopi and char kway teow become more and more expensive even tho you do not own a car and got nothing to do with property, and that is unfair to majority.</p>
              <p>Once govt control/tighten properties loans and upfront payment</p>
              <p>, you will see a lots of force selling and car reprocessing, and they have to do it before the year 2016, otherwise, some of them maybe out of job after 2016.</p>

              <p>This 2013 budget report is a must go act and get real, 40% WCS, cleaner now must paid $1000 with progressive increment of $100 to $200 depend on his or her performances.</p>
              <p>By and large, by 2018, cleaners in Singapore may command a 3k paycheck thru progressive wage increment policy, and if TD is still earn 2 to 3k by then, I, lau Uncle, also no eye to see liao.</p>
              <p>Let take a closer look at Jap TD, let me put it in sing dollars, 10k per month, understandable, because it is the highest standard and expensive city in all asia cities.</p>
              <p>Singapore the nos 2 most expensive city, recently quoted in business times, but the TD is earning average 3k. And Jap tourist or expatriates which I picked up also told me, Singapore only food and transport is cheaper than tokyo, the rest is more expensive, or on equal footing.</p>
              <p>We should be on a right note, be getting at least half of a jap TD, that is 5k per month given the same amount of work we put in now and not increase our timming or mileage.</p>
              <p>So in another words, our earning is pathetically low, workers paid will raise tremedously in the coming, and as luxury goods like cars and housing come down, inflation will cool down, and that may closer the gap of a really earn and save as you work and live kind of country .</p>
              <p>But as for TD, your fares may go up, but fuel and rental also goes up, we may end up as the lowest earner</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>My concern is tat Cat A is a bread n butter category...more for "ordinary" folks. Even tho taxi cos don hv to bid...they pay coe price based on prevailing quota premium in cat a...So taxi rental or benefits can be affected. (whether cos will pass on savings from big drop in coe to tds in terms of more benefits is another issue). At the very least they hv less/no reason to increase rental...We shud be concerned.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Must also remember that this COE bidding is a not a typical one as it is adjusting to clear off those backlog.</p>
              <p>When you purchase a car from AD (auto dealer), you need to place maybe $500 to $5000 depend on the AD regulation, the AD will then bid for you for 3 months, each month there are 2 COE bidding process, so 3 months is 6X.</p>
              <p>If unsuccessful, they will return you back the deposit, but mostly, they will ask you to upper your price, how much they bid the COE is confidential. And COE is more or less controlled by the ADs, they are the big brother in bidding COEs.</p>
              <p>In January 2013, when CAT E was much higher than CAT A,  let said Mr XX decided on the AD price of a Altis at $140000, base on a 80k COE rebate, signed and locked in his agreement, so the AD bid for him,</p>
              <p>January, first and second bids, not successful, February, first and second bids, could be successful but dealer wanted to give to those who booked on Decemeber first, which is said to be clearing backlog.</p>
              <p>Then come March bidding, because of revising the pricing soon, they die die must bid high and get it, so this guy get his car but at a high price of what he locked in, but dealer is not scare of bidding at high price, because the car is at $140000 and after that, they revise to 98,000k which is today price.</p>
              <p>Last week was at Borneo motor kapoh a bit, it already give you a 98k pricing but not on the news, and upgrade automatically to Elite class, meaning more functions.</p>
              <p>So, if I sign and lock in today at 98000k, I might get my car in late april or may, but with a lower COE, could be base on 50 to 40k.</p>
              <p>So even if you bidded a 60k CAT E COE and decided to go and buy a car at prevailing Car prices without COE, the next COE bidding which is later this month might show a CAT A $50k only.</p>
              <p>It is because of clearing backlogs of CAT A cars booking before 26 Feb 2013, that COE for CAT A had gone up. CAT B and the rest could had aligned itself toward the market forces, but CAT A is one exception that will re calibre later and go below CAT A and E.</p>
              <p>Remember that now is at least 40% upfront and 5 years loan period only, most will be looking back at kimchi and sushi car again instead of Nazi car, which not only incur 50% upfront but also a high taxation of ARF.</p>
              <p>And all these must also take into consideration of reduction of COE by 0.5 per month till next year. Meaning, if 10000 cars scrap this year, there will be 10000 COEs available, but the govt will reduce it by 6% at the end of the year rather than last time increasing it that led to more COE and does cheaper</p>

              <p><br> What buying car is beyong TDs? no lah, many TDs got private car ok,
              all tiam tiam smart smart act poor only.</p>
              <p>And for goodness sake, Taxis is bid under cat E since last
              august, not cat A hor.</p>
              <p>And since CAT E, open market COE got down by abt 30k, taxis
              will get their cab, if they buy 1.6CC and above, they lost out
              abit due to CAT B now is lower, but if those like i30 which is
              below 1.6, they gained because CAT A ismuch higher. Most taxis OMV
              and just hovering around 20k, so they may not have to pay the
              Additional FR. Which is 140 to 180% of OMV depend on the car OMV
              prices. Most taxi of today are kimchi make, hardly over 20k OMV,
              maybe K5 just above it abit only.</p>
              <p>At Feb, COE for Cat A was at 78k, typical siao sg people flocked
              l in at the last minutes before the the upfront 40 to 50% kick
              in, so dealers are sure to bid at 78k COE for them, after all, it
              the car buyer paying. So this round, you see a high COE for dealers
              to clear these cheapo lot who do not have the upfront 40 to 50% and
              certainly cannot afford limited 5 years loan period.</p>
              <p>Silver K5 was bought in at a high COE period, TC and SMRT epica
              was bought before the rise of COE to it highest. Therefore K5
              commanded a higher rental fees, wrong move by silver, should had
              waited.</p>

              <p><br>The Govt will take the lowest not qualified Bid and then Plus $1, that is the COE, so that one who bid at 25000 will get heart pain, whereas anything above 25,001 will qualify and that is exactly the availiable quotas of 5.</p>
              <p>Let get into this current CAT A bidding, some may bids $1 and some may bidded 90k, but the quotas is only 336 that means only 336 people can get it, there are 1.180 peoples bidding for it, from individual to ADs.</p>
              <p>Final COE for Cat A. $74689, this show that the lowest bid was 74,688, so from here to whatever 90k or 100k bidding, these are the 336 people bidding on the higher end, be it 75k or 79k or 98k. Therefore COE is determined by counting the Quotas from the highest bid down and the last non qualified one, they will just add $1 so that he cannot get it.</p>
              <p>Even those who bidded successfully but end up did not take it or got no money or for whatever reason cannot make to pay for it, it will bring forward to the next bidding, meaning the next bidding will have a higher Quotas.</p>
              <p>So let say I get this COE, but I find that the car prices is too high, I know COE will drop, then I might hv to forgo 10k as penalty for not taking up the car (new car apply), but I wait for the next COE which may drop 30 to 40k, more worthy than I pay now.</p>
