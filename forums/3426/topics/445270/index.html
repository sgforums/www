So go to Singapore Land Tower and wait. Fucking hell LTA officer come and wave me off. This time I angry liao. Wind down window and shout at LTA officer. "I got CumFark booking lah, cannot wait here tell CumFark not to accept CBD peak hour booking!" So he pointed at the second last empty lot at the taxi stand and I wait lor. Then I called LTA and complained to them. Why the fuck got TP and LTA officer telling taxi to go off at taxi stand. Want to wave taxi off, please tell CumFark not to accept peak hour CBD bookings OK !!? LTA officer said he will note down the complain.</p></div>

              <p>Lucky got consolation prize of $42.50 for the trip. Wonder which farker told TP and LTA to patrol there. If LTA dun want to see taxi in CBD, please remove the farking taxi stand. But if got taxi stand, must allow taxi to wait if got booking. If they cannot tolerate too many taxi bookings, then they must find a solution.</p>
              <p>Its like the Orchard Road flood. Stamford Canal is not big enough, so must figure out something.</p>
              <p>Same for taxi. LTA want to approve 28K cabs OTR, then be prepared for the consequences. Otherwise cut down the cab population.</p>

              <p>Those fuckers want to enforce law must go all the way. Tell comfort not to allow bookings at taxi stops. LTA go airport boulevard n enforce their law. If really go all the way, Taxi business cannot be done. </p>
              <p>What wait before taxi stand together with private car? That was where TP came to chase people off including me. Why u think i so mad?</p>

              <p>1 George St was full house. China St never try because must make a bigger circle to pick up pax later. Anyway the road condition was not too bad. Free flow traffic. It was not jam or anything. I was not sure what the TP was trying to do. I came here for booking. Cab booking is permitted by LTA. LTA also knows that OC cabs need to do some waiting. If they want to chase me off, it means I committed an offense. And if their strict interpretation of the law meant cab booking is not feasible at collyer quay, then by all means tell Comfort to stop accepting advance or current bookings there, just like airport.</p>
              <p>But we all know, government work is like that. Chase taxi off, pax no cab, LTA kenna fucked. Dont chase taxi off, road jam, LTA also kenna fucked.</p>
              <p>I have no pity on them though. Since they chose this line of work, it means they have to expect their ass being rammed by the public, just like LTA and TP like to ram the ass of those who broke their laws and got caught.</p>
              <p>I wait there is no salah one. Traffic was pretty good. Taxi stand was PNG, no taxi queuing. I wait there for booking and got waved off, is something that should not happen. Its their mistake liao. Road jam, I can understand. But it was almost free flow but heavy traffic, so it makes me feel like the officers very eng.</p>
              <p>Imagine kenna Centrepoint advance booking and the taxi stand was full house and LTA officer standby behind. Eh tulan bey tulan? Cannot wait there? Make one big circle and later pax no show or say will be late, then how? These kind of peak hour CBD bookings are very risky right?</p>

              <p>I dunno what changed milennia's tower no waiting policy but i know capital tower changed coz comfort banned all their tenants from calling from fixed lines after many many complains by TD.</p>

"I got CumFark booking lah, cannot wait here tell CumFark not to accept CBD peak hour booking!" So he pointed at the second last empty lot at the taxi stand and I wait lor. Then I called LTA and complained to them. Why the fuck got TP and LTA officer telling taxi to go off at taxi stand.

Guess I get a luckier guy who give and take, flexible and reasonable. 8 minutes later, pax board, to airport. </p>
