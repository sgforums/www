              <p>Hah! I got a new rumour last week. When I was at Toh Tuck cng pumps, met a td who said he's changing his wish for a new epica because he stays in SengKang and cannot afford the long trips (3 times a day) to Toh Tuck for cng.</p>
              <p>He said Jasmine asked him ......what if.....convert his wish(2.0l) to petrol and charged only $65 rental.</p>
              <p>So what do you guys think of this rumour. If it's possible will you change your cng to petrol.</p>
              <p>I was just thinking it might be possible to do it if wish can also be converted to take 5 or 6 passengers with a surcharge. Think of 2000plus taxis on the road able to carry more than 4 passengers. Transcab call centre will be hot.</p>
              <p>Please input your thoughts......</p>

              <p>Yes, there are some pros but also a very obvious con to this. 5 -6 pax with surcharge, hopefully higher flag down rate is tempting, especially all going 1 or 2 place max.</p>
              <p>But if got 5-6 pax, all going 5-6 places, like that also jialat. Imagine start from town, go bukit merah, then commonwealth, followed by Ghim Moh, Jurong East and finally Jurong west extension and pay by Nets at the end. Trip will take nearly 45 min - 1 hr depending on conditions. Maybe collect $30 +, but stuck in ulu place, have to return to town again.</p>
              <p>Some ppl don't mind, but for myself, wah piang kena 4 place already lembik, now add 2 more, wah, I wave white flag.</p>
              <p>But I agree if they did this, it could be an interesting idea that could interest a portion of drivers.</p>

              <p>Yes, there are some pros but also a very obvious con to this. 5
              -6 pax with surcharge, hopefully higher flag down rate is tempting,
              especially all going 1 or 2 place max.</p>
              <p>But if got 5-6 pax, all going 5-6 places, like that also jialat.
              Imagine start from town, go bukit merah, then commonwealth,
              followed by Ghim Moh, Jurong East and finally Jurong west extension
              and pay by Nets at the end. Trip will take nearly 45 min - 1 hr
              depending on conditions. Maybe collect $30 +, but stuck in ulu
              place, have to return to town again.</p>
              <p>Some ppl don't mind, but for myself, wah piang kena 4 place
              already lembik, now add 2 more, wah, I wave white flag.</p>
              <p>But I agree if they did this, it could be an interesting idea
              that could interest a portion of drivers.</p>

              <p>This will be a 'burst blood vessel' situation for tds. I kena plenty of these when I was with cdg, all from call bookings so cannot reject. Must be the reason I got a mild stroke  so now drive omo and with trans, less stress. Day driving go any ulu places almost no problem, probability of finding pax easier.</p>
              <p>Hope to see a multiple destinations surcharge, anything more than 2 will have to add surcharge. LTA seems wanting to please the public but REALLY NEGLECT the tds. When 80,000 tds vote against them, maybe they will wake up.</p>

              <p>Not necessarily 7 seaters, maybe 5 like in HK. Flag down remains the same but only add surcharge with additional paxs.</p>

              <p>Maybe not all will be converted, they might convert only those when drivers opts to. Unless they can find a buyer for all their wishes, if not this cng problem remains.</p>

              <p>Our transport minister already announced he would like taxis to be operated in 2 shifts or round the clock. So maybe he is using Comfort to start the ball rolling, and soon all other companies will be 'forced' to.</p>

              <p><br>The original listed price for shell95 is $2.23. The display on the main billboard sign is the price already factor in with an automatic 5% discount applicable for all cars without any discountt card.</p>
              <p>The 16% discount is actually taken from $2.23 and not from $2.11 which works out to $1.87 after factoring the 16% discount.</p>
              <p>Shell isnt selling Octane 92 petrol anymore but SPC still does with a 15% discount all add in if paying by posb credit/debit cards.</p>
              <p>SPC 92 at $2.18 after discount is $1.85.</p>
              <p>But lower octance mileage as compare to shell i still haven check if its in par.</p>

              <p>Yes, $2.21 to 28 is the current 95 price, discount wise, all most petrol station varies only about 1 to 2%, Caltex offer 14% with OCBC card, another 3% rebate on bills. Exxon is also not far from it with it esso tiger card.</p>
