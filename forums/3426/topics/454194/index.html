              <p>Hello... together with most thinking Singaporeans, I am against 
              influx of foreigners. PRC pax take your taxi with the fear of you 
              cheating them all the time, What to do? In China many cheats and ppl are
               prone to being conned. Pinoys talk non stop. What to do? They are 
              having such a good time here coz they are being treated so well.</p>
              <p>BUT,
               The people that give you real problems are SINGAPOREANS! Those that 
              complain against u over trival matters, those that take videos of you 
              hoping to get high hit on stomp. Those that speak ill of you all the 
              time are Singaporeans. Come to think of it, FT pax are not too bad 
              compared to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>But as a Singaporean myself, I am 
              saddned to see my own country being sold away. One female malay pax 
              today told me she was so offended becoz some Pinoy mistook her as Pinoy 
              and hit on her and how she is reporting to a Pinoy manager. I said you 
              have yet to see the worst. It has only just begun. FTs will eventually 
              assume higher positions in Singapore. More sons of Singapore will be 
              undermined in Singapore. And soon the Singaporean sales girls will start
               giving Pinoys blowjobs.  I just witness a young local female banker 
              flirting with 2 Indian IT guys yesterday... And it was real. After the 2
               Indian nationals got off, she called her friend and started telling how
               impressively intelligent these 2 guys are.  Yet only 40% of 
              Singaporeans are worried.  So I conclude, I do like FT pax but am damn 
              sad about what's happening to my own country. If only they remained as 
              tourists.....</p>

              <p>Singaporeans have a right, it is their country. They can complain as much as you and I. Of course we also have a right to f those who are very fussy or trying to be funny.</p>
              <p>FTs have the same pax right as all, the right to a safe, shortest (if did not request for fastest) to their point of disembarkation. They don't have a right to throw their weight around and demand things.</p>

              <p>I do not agree it's Singaporeans who made those complaints .</p>

              <p>There's this woman teo Lee Fong who makes it her mission in life to direct every single complaint of taxi drivers to LTA.</p>
              <p>Here is her blog: http://sgtaxidrivers.blogspot.sg/</p>
              <p>Maybe next time you fart in your cab, she will ask your pax to complain to LTA.</p>
              <p>I'm sure LTA is in love with her, directing every single complaint to them, even non accident cases too. No wonder Traffic Police now very free.</p>

              <p>And we dont have people who come here, got no intention to improve the country,</p>
              <p>make moeny from the system,</p>
              <p>and when things gets tough, beat backside and bring money home.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Sad truth? our economy will cripple without them. The decision makers will cling one to their fat salaries even if it takes to cripple all Singaporeans. GDP growth remember? It's either we don't meet them and replace our leaders. But given a choice by them, replace you or them? look at it from corporate point of view. Bad times? Sell all your shares, chop the bottem people. Top execs will continue to draw 100 X of the average salary. Well for this case I AM talking about our ministers. Like it or not. Your government has decided to replace you and there is nothing you can do about it. Just watch Singapore rot. I am having pop corn while more juicy news keep popping up. Next to come up with will be some SG women scandal with millionaire Ah Tiong or Sir Tagalog. The time will come when you just have to drive whilst listening to FTs fingering our local women behind the back seat.</p></div>

              <p>And we dont have people who come here, got no intention to improve the country,</p>
              <p>make moeny from the system,</p>

              <p>However, today youngs who benefitted from our 1st and 2nd generation of hard work, are no more yao, so they got all the time to think, and being educated, they can see themselves with no future in a land of their own, and this could also be an exit for the ruling party.</p>
              <p>Nearly all youngsters I picked, when come to politics, they are now more well informed, well knowledged and also well against the current ruling party way of ruling.</p>
