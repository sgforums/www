              <p>Like I go relatives/friends gathering, be it wedding or someone birthday or BBQ, peoples said they are TD, still acceptable, bu when I say I drive casket van, many of these knnccb will look down on you, evade you and do not even bother to talk to you.</p>
              <p>So, those who want to drive Casket, be prepare that your social status in the society, like it or not, will be down down down lonely.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>
              <p>Many times meet relatives outside while driving casket, some siam me, some just manage to say hello, then quickly walk away, last time not like this, at least talk to you about this and that, even my childrens last time schooling also asked me, what to write in father occupation, casket's driver or just driver. I told them write jobless.</p>
              <p>Last time, my kids go sport or outside activities somewhere in singapore, I told them I am on my way from mandai or adjunied, can pick them up, they straight away say no no no, later my friends see me in casket van.</p>

              <p><br>Bowah, I dont think they look down on casket van drivers.</p>
              <p>I believe they are supersitious and want to avoid things associated with funeral.</p>
              <p>Like for example, when a funeral procession pass by, some parents will make their children turn away.</p>
              <p>Or if somebody has a family member that passed away, 'friends' will not go out with him for 100 days.</p>
              <p>I teach my kids to face it, and if need to, just chant, "Amithofou" to bless the one that left us.</p>
              <p>All these behaviours are just made up by the mind.</p>

              Since the GE , after PAP got 60.1% , and with those immigration issues as key debating topics , those foreigners also beware that those sentiments around Singapore .
              
              They now also keep quiet , i felt the differences .
              
              Like in Changi South , less FT taking taxis , most taking MRT , walk to MRT station .
              
              Now those FT also afraid of taxi drivers , cos whenever they take taxis , they somehow felt intimidated by some more aggressive spoken drivers .

              <p>FT or FW in Singapore is unlike 10 or 5 years ago, whereby they are cheap, young and ready to work. Somehow, as the years go by, they become as expensive and some even more expensive than Singaporeans, they came, learn the trade, see heavenly built singapore, they stayed, and as time goes by, they also become lazy, keng here and there, siam here and there, wanted to enjoy life here but work less.</p>
              <p>By and large, organisation are facing a huge wage cost in term of FT or FW, it is no more a cheap labour issue, their paid had been increasing, promoted and educated, all because of organisations in demand of them, fighting with each other with higher remuneration, so end up, a high cost.</p>
              <p>Then we come back to the objectives of employing foreigner, you employ them because you do not need to pay so high for a singaporean, you employ them also mainly of their youth and maybe, able to control them better due to them being bound by contract. But now, these long term foreigners had in a way, knows the in and out of singapore working style, they also want to demand higher paid, higher perks and higher position, and many of these are from 3rd world countries whereby their own country is now booming.</p>
              <p>So, at the end of the day, it might not be so feasible to employ foreigner anymore, couple with a squeeze in govt policy of lower quotas, perks for employing singaporeans, organisation is looking the other way, and that result in many foreigner going jobless and end up, leave this country and back to their home land.</p>
