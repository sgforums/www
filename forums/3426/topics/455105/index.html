              <p>Fully agree with JoeRaj.  Those higher social scale one (especially Indian from India) is always the worst lot. They think they are high and mighty and i understand they really look down on TD.  I m more happy to take the lower educated ones like construction workers, they are much more polite.</p>
              <p>Most of us knew the "policies" problem (like what mentioned by StriveOn &amp; bowah) but these policies maker will not understand the ground issues becos they will never face it themselves (or their kids).  </p>
              <p>I drove one Pax from Swenden, she commented S'pore is really a nice country to live in. The country has done very well.  <span style="color: #0000ff;">BUT her next comment was really a big Slap to the policies maker</span> - <span style="color: #ff00ff;">"Is a pity that a rich country like S'pore has so many old age people has to be cleaner at Hawker Centre &amp; Food court. She has never seen this in any other countries."   </span></p>

              <p>Fully agree with JoeRaj.  Those higher social scale one
              (especially Indian from India) is always the worst lot. They think
              they are high and mighty and i understand they really look down on
              TD.  I m more happy to take the lower educated ones like
              construction workers, they are much more polite.</p>
              <p>Most of us knew the "policies" problem (like what mentioned by
              StriveOn &amp; bowah) but these policies maker will not understand
              the ground issues becos they will never face it themselves (or
              their kids).  </p>
              <p>I drove one Pax from Swenden, she commented S'pore is really a
              nice country to live in. The country has done very well.
               <span style="color: #0000ff;">BUT her next comment was really
              a big Slap to the policies maker</span> - <span style="color: #ff00ff;">"Is a pity that a rich country like S'pore has so
              many old age people has to be cleaner at Hawker Centre &amp; Food

              <p>Like I go relatives/friends gathering, be it wedding or someone birthday or BBQ, peoples said they are TD, still acceptable, bu when I say I drive casket van, many of these knnccb will look down on you, evade you and do not even bother to talk to you.</p>
              <p>So, those who want to drive Casket, be prepare that your social status in the society, like it or not, will be down down down lonely.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>
              <p>Many times meet relatives outside while driving casket, some siam me, some just manage to say hello, then quickly walk away, last time not like this, at least talk to you about this and that, even my childrens last time schooling also asked me, what to write in father occupation, casket's driver or just driver. I told them write jobless.</p>
              <p>Last time, my kids go sport or outside activities somewhere in singapore, I told them I am on my way from mandai or adjunied, can pick them up, they straight away say no no no, later my friends see me in casket van.</p>

              <p>I think there isn't much problem with FT for most of us, just that some of them who are being serve in their own country like King and Queen and expect people here to serve to them like king and queen and in turn treat other like slave or their own land servants.</p>
              <p>There is this theory of evolution and adaptation, you evoluate when you work in other country, you also slowly adapt to them, not the other way round whereby you expect the people of that country to evoluate and adapt to your style. That should be put clear into all FTs mind. Mutual respect is the key to graciousness.</p>
              <p>For Singapore, at the end of the day, who can blame no one but ourselves, I asked one FT on why he come here, he said, he was invited by Singapore govt, and your govt represent you, so I am invited by you, and as guest here, should not your treat me like a guest. The key word here is INVITED, not that we wanted to come, you open your door, go my country and promote job, we came and see, you provide peace and harmony with good Sing dollars to earn, so I came, saw and conquerored.</p>
              <p>Then I asked him if he had wonder FT here had resulted in local depressive wages and less job opportunties, crowded public transport and no beds in hospitals. He told me that our govt told him, he is here to create job for singaporeans, help the economy so that singaporeans can get a better living, and since I am kind of helping you, you should serve me well.</p>
              <p>Then I said, created taxi job for me, oh thank you very much</p>
