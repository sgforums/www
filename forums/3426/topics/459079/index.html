              yes i agree, the back shouldn't be in the Q at all
              some time the staff purposely leave a chrysler alone in the slot and let the rest of the normal taxi  stay in the Q away .
              if not you will see those uncle just direct to the black after they tire telling pax this black is Limo starting how much and those are normal taxi.
              why of course most would not want to pay more for it.
              sometime i wonder why have black taxi, we have enough limo (merc) taxi liao

              <p>I heard from an AngMo pax that hotel limos also chagre 60-65 during F1 for short trips, it seems the hotels were the ones pushing guests to take the Limo, so I thinkt he Chrysler was doing the same thing which imo is very fair. F1 is just a handful of days where they can cari makan becoz some ppl will deffo take them.</p>
              <p>Let them live and btw I am very wary of pax giving remarks, they like to exaggerate.</p>
              <p>Lets look at the woman who said she waited 2 hours for a cab at paragon during the evening, do you really believe anyone will actually wait 2 hours for a cab? Except maybe New year's eve, that also wait not really desperate, enjoy some more until cabs become available. But wait 2 hours on a normal day? Pls la, this one bullshit, expect sympathy.</p>
              <p>Complain lah if the pax want to LTA, Singapore still got certain rules when it comes to investigation. 1 party can allege anything, but the other party has a right to reply, and demand proof, not just say 1 thing and case closed. Must have some form of proof.</p>
              <p>If i the Chrysler, I deny outright.</p>

              <p>How Limousine Counter work?......</p>
              <p>Only pax going through the counter, registered by the co-ordinator, than Limo cab can officially pick up pax and charge them with official rate..........</p>
              <p>Very simple layman term, not going to go through the whole process.......</p>
              <p>So if pax never go through counter <strong>(fyi,counter are not allow to tout)</strong>, meaning they wanted to engage their own taxi, whichever taxi engage by them <strong>MUST</strong> go by meter.......this rule wasn't set by me, I think all TD should know who set it........</p>
              <p>Never in the form of <strong>FLAT</strong> rate for street hired........whether is $65 or $10, TD should know and aware.......</p>
              <p>Even that 2 blackies is in the lino queue, without confirmation by co-ordinator, they are not <strong>ALLOW</strong> to quote prices to avoid being accused of touting.........</p>
