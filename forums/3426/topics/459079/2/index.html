              <p>I heard from an AngMo pax that hotel limos also chagre 60-65 during F1 for short trips, it seems the hotels were the ones pushing guests to take the Limo, so I thinkt he Chrysler was doing the same thing which imo is very fair. F1 is just a handful of days where they can cari makan becoz some ppl will deffo take them.</p>
              <p>Let them live and btw I am very wary of pax giving remarks, they like to exaggerate.</p>
              <p>Lets look at the woman who said she waited 2 hours for a cab at paragon during the evening, do you really believe anyone will actually wait 2 hours for a cab? Except maybe New year's eve, that also wait not really desperate, enjoy some more until cabs become available. But wait 2 hours on a normal day? Pls la, this one bullshit, expect sympathy.</p>
              <p>Complain lah if the pax want to LTA, Singapore still got certain rules when it comes to investigation. 1 party can allege anything, but the other party has a right to reply, and demand proof, not just say 1 thing and case closed. Must have some form of proof.</p>
              <p>If i the Chrysler, I deny outright.</p>

              <p>The paxs that i took i believe didnt exagerrate the matter.</p>
              <p>Every local knows that black flag down fare is the highest.</p>
              <p>The couple knowingly step into the black expecting to be charge by "Meter".</p>
              <p>Overall its the approached to the paxs whether that place is an official limo stand or not.</p>
              <p>As for complains to Lta whether got prove or not its another matter...maybe for the benefits of doubts Lta may let the driver off once or twice....but what if his taxi number keep popping out in Lta complainant data directory for the same type of complain over a length of time and from different paxs?  What do you think will be Lta approach to such drivers?</p>

              <p>How Limousine Counter work?......</p>
              <p>Only pax going through the counter, registered by the
              co-ordinator, than Limo cab can officially pick up pax and charge
              them with official rate..........</p>
              <p>Very simple layman term, not going to go through the whole
              process.......</p>
              <p>So if pax never go through counter <strong>(fyi,counter are
              not allow to tout)</strong>, meaning they wanted to engage their
              own taxi, whichever taxi engage by them
              <strong>MUST</strong> go by meter.......this rule wasn't set
              by me, I think all TD should know who set it........</p>
              <p>Never in the form of <strong>FLAT</strong> rate for street
              hired........whether is $65 or $10, TD should know and
              aware.......</p>
              <p>Even that 2 blackies is in the lino queue, without confirmation
              by co-ordinator, they are not <strong>ALLOW</strong> to quote
              prices to avoid being accused of touting.........</p>
              <p>Of course F1 mah........big event mah........beh catch one
              la......<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
