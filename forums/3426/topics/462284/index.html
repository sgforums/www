              How much can a TD earn in a month?
              This is my answer, if you don't believe, go be a TD.
              
              Working day-30days
              Off day-1day when the month got 31st.
              Working hours-10-16hours
              Lunch/dinner break-15mins each
              
              After deduct the $120rental and diesel $60
              You only make $6-$7/hour.
              $7x10hours=$70
              $7x16hours=$112
              Summon from lta,speeding offence,kanna 1, work free for 2days.
              With the current vehicles and traffic,no way you can drive with ease.
              Passenger safety is our top pority. 
              
              Lack of time with family members.
              No time to exercise.
              Lack of sleep. 
              
              
              Working everyday 10-16hours everyday for 30days for $2k-$3k/m.
              Go figure out yourself.
              Is it worth?

              <p>You must be naive to think posting td income is sensitive after all the news recently.</p>
              <p>Trade/income secret? It wasnt in the first place.</p>
              <p> Drive longer hrs earn more, shorter earn less 1k to 10k you decide.</p>
              <p> Most Tds and future Tds are at the tails end of our country economy.</p>
              <p>By the way IRAS cant force u to pay more medisave. They just table up your income and submit to CPF. Its under CPF.</p>
              <p>And any changes to medisave contribution will require a parliament sitting and legislation to be passed.</p>
              <p>So if you really buay song rally your buddies and kick this ruling govt aka PAP out the next GE</p>

              being a relief can have many many good choice of life style unlike some tds don't have
              
              being a relief is for a newbie to start the trade new and slowly master the trade without much stress and pressure

              <p>I chose to be hirer after get tdvl sign 6 month contract so can get immediate feel of how siong it would be. Don't recommend over 40s to do it cause it's 6 month zombie life.</p>
              <p>First month high, second month even higher, third month onwards below 3. Why? Cause your body will tell you go fly kite, there's only so much hours you can work before body go nuts. Even when you have a relief.</p>
              <p>Finally 6 months came and straightaway return cab.</p>
              <p>Now as a relief I can understand my hirer better and have little conflicts.</p>
              <p>But unfortunately both of us eat grass for next 2 weeks cos stupid smrt can't get our new cab ready. After seeing train breakdown and bus driver go on strike, can't be bothered to harass them anymore.</p>

              <p>Average Singaporean contribute CPF, but it is not officially their money, they got to pay interest, got to find excuse to hold it longer. </p>
              <p>Taxi Driver contribute by high rental, the amount is way over CPF contribution, and best is, it is offically their money, no need to pay out interest, no need to tell you how they spend the money.</p>
              <p>GST, how much GST can an average Singaporean contribute. At most 100% of their earning (spending). We contribute GST thru our rental plus our spending.</p>
              <p>And the amount on fuel............</p>
              <p>They do not need to touch us on Income Tax, indeed they knows we earn peanut</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>btw, disclose of income here had become no impact after the $7000 saga, we can be silent on this, but still not gonna to defeat the power of local media.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with BCL that you dun find other trades openly sharing their income openly, this trait is unique to cabbies. Whether its due to inflated egos or lack of confidence in oneself I'm not sure. If you're doing great, I genuinely feel happy for you but pls keep it to yourself. Your boasting will only add more misery to our trade. It's hard to mitigate the impact of the public whenever they read how fantastic cabbie earnings being posted. The public will only remember how well you boasted and disregard your OBK days.</div>

              <p>I agree with <span>BCL</span> that you dun find other
              trades openly sharing their income openly, this trait is unique to
              cabbies. Whether its due to inflated egos or lack of confidence in
              oneself I’m not sure. If you’re doing great, I genuinely feel happy
              for you but pls keep it to yourself. Your boasting will only add
              more misery to our trade. It’s hard to mitigate the impact of the
              public whenever they read how fantastic cabbie earnings being
              posted. The public will only remember how well you boasted and
              disregard your <span>OBK</span> days.</p>
