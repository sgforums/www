              <p>as for what i know and i agree with Rbs70, CDG dun terminate a person just becos of one complain, not just hear only. happen tat my friend received letter CDG want to terminate him, i went down with him to see the officer, cos my friend told me he did got a arguement with an angmo not long ago, then received the letter.when see the officer , vthe officer say yes the angmo complain blah blah, my friend say he was not in the wrong, cannot be just only one complain, they yet hv investigation straight terminate him, not fair to him. The officer say , mr so n so, cool down, then take a stack of file out and show it to my friend, tis is when , where , date and time of other complain, not tat he dun hv other complain, is just tat some of them is only minor complain they dun call him, and they will check the person who complain, also complain to all other driver the same reason,then there must be something wrong with tis person who complain. if a driver were complain by ten diffrent ppl who is unknow each other for the same reason, then they must be something wrong with the driver.  </p>
              <p>i cut short, at the end, i and my friend went up to see the  VP to appear and only got warning not terminated.</p>

              <p>Defination of customer is someone who pays for a product or service. I agree with your statement highlighted in red.</p>
              <p>Now are Taxi Drivers employed workers, customers or boss?</p>
              <p>Taxi drivers have fixed costs. We pay these costs to the company. Shouldn't we be considered their customers? But wait! if company can terminate customer, we cannot be customers after all. Must be our own boss.

              Comfort sacks Cabby for going after 2 russians fare-cheats 
              Confession of the Cabby:
              
              Not sure if any of u read my story in WanBao last fri,pg 10 about me running after 2 (russian?)girls who verbally abused n accused me of wrong route n took off without paying? Cut long story short, i managed to keep them till police arrived then they paid.I held back one of them by the arm at one point, they knew they cant outrun me.thats it, i NEVER employ any violence against them.We were just sitting around for next 20 min for police to come.
              They complained to COMFORT,i got the boot. No formal interview, no explanation required.??!
              
              Actually i went to WanBao to get it to ask Comfort, certain questions about Comforts handling of the case, n reason for my dismissal. While the report is well written , it did not achieve my objective of getting Comfort to explain their stand. So i hope i can do sth here.
              
              Contrary to the WanBao report, i am not asking for sympathy for my "pitiable" plight, i guess the reporter writes as he sees fit.
              My concern was how COMFORT SACKS ITS DRIVERS ARBITRARILY.It does not respect its own drivers. i told the reporter, " i dont need the job but doesnt mean others dont need the job."
              
              So, i asked the company repeatedly, ARE TAXI DRIVERS ALLOWED TO GO AFTER FARE CHEATS? The reply i got was for my dismissal was "we dont condone AGGRESSION". Whenever i probed what u mean by aggression, COMFORT says ' We are not obliged to explain anything to u."
              
              Taxi driving is not my main job, but a pastime for extra income.
              When i went after the "non-paying" pax, my concern is not just myself but the older uncles who cant do anything in these situations but *censored**censored**censored**censored* thumb.Despite my explanation, the company booted me anyway(obviously bec they have long queue for new drivers).
              
              So was i wrong to go after fare evaders, with a view to helping other drivers? Can COMFORT ANSWER MY QUESTION " CAN TAXI DRIVERS DO ANYTHING IF SOMEONE CHOOSES NOT TO PAY?" From my experience, Comfort is not protecting n respecting their 16000 n more(relief incl) drivers who have to slog 12 hrs on the road while they rake in the big bucks.

              this my advise to the new cdg drivers, especially those who have to leave cdg.
              
              driving for cdg must know what is cdg organisation is all about
              
              cdg have their set of rules for incident happen to their driver who are on the road
              
              the whole actually is quite simple, any cdg drivers who future face non paying pax, 
              
              the first action is to call up cdg, which line? (you go and ask cdg,) and inform them of the
              
              situation, let cdg decide what advise ( recorded conversation ) the type of action need to 
              
              take. should they ask you to let go, simple print out the receipt and claim from cdg
              
              go and learn from your company things you need to know while driving for cdg
              
              ask all possible question and ask for answer and write it down
              
              
              IF NOT THEN JUST BE A GOOD BOY AND DRIVE. or please switch company
