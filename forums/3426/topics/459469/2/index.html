              <p><br>To be honest, go thru proper system as lay out, NTWU is the transport Unions, MOM will not entertain union's members who got union, they should go thru NTWU, which is affliated to NTUC, the issue lies on 5 and 5.5 days work.</p>
              <p>To force the issue, member can ask NTWU to concilate with SMRT at MOM office, this is a pre emptive measure before going into court, if Mom is unable to make a decision or convince any party to give and take, then the next level will be the arbitration court, a court that only handle industrial dispute, the arguement member must give is base on 2 points</p>
              <p>1. A better balancing of lifestyle, (even SAF today are on 5 days per week)</p>
              <p>2. compensating the nos of working hrs on weekday to cover the 1/2 day on saturday</p>
              <p>Many companies in Singapore had in a way cut short their lunch hrs from 1 hr to 1/2 hrs, shipyard had cut off the breaktimes to provide a 5 days workweek for their employees,</p>
              <p>Bus company must therefore work on a win win situation. I work at yard as contractor, everyday there is a 15 minutes 10am and 3 pm break, when the management decided to go on 5 days, they exchange with the members/workers to forgo the breaks,</p>
              <p>However workers are allowed to drink at their worksite, this eliminated the time to walk to the canteen and the time to walk back and climb the ship, given the 5 days, workers are happy, company are also happy because there will be less stoppage, and if workers is need to work on saturday, it is consider OT, workers are therefore happy.</p>
              <p>It is therefore important for the tripartite partners to find a niche to gain a win win situation and not to write off drivers by giving remarks such as "you can resign"</p>

              <p><br>In places like shanghai or dalian or shenzhen..guangzhou where industrialisation are booming, most rural provinces people move into these cities to earn a livng, and most are consider as foreigners to the city peoples who had lived there, this also happen in India, mynamar, vietnam and so on.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, our foreigners are not from the provinces, because we are so small, therefore, we got an advantage and priviledge over other countries in taking and choosing what we like thru our immigration policy, for those country, although from external provinces but still same countrymen, no need passport of permit.</p>
              <p>But then, our govt are not taking this advantages of control, these end up with lots of foreign trashes and overcrowding.</p>
              <p>We are still capable of holding a 6millions population</p>

              <p>This news has been heard for 10 years already.</p>
              <p>We can wait another 10 years will still be news.</p>
              <p>let's look at the possibility at the PAP point of view.</p>
              <p>Taxi drivers make up 5% of the electorate, if you add their families votes, another 5-7%, total 12% of the votes.</p>
              <p>If they allow this - FT to drive taxis, they are almost certainly saying bye bye to 10% of votes.</p>
              <p>Given that they just scraped thru with under 60% of the votes in most wards, do you honestly think they will introduce this policy before the 2016 elections?</p>

              <p>Yeah very true, got many sites that hv ppl complain abt taxi drivers.</p>
              <p>You see the mentality (honestly I would adopt the same attitude too if I wasn't a driver), that a) when I want a cab - the cab must come. If the cab don't come - means TD are skivving or as mentioned earned so much already.</p>
              <p>Worse when flag, they don't stop, means also very good business. With the press reports and all the online rubbish, everyone things Tds are doing fine and earning big bucks.</p>
              <p>But as a driver, we all know why we have to avoid certain pax, certain trips and certain locations, and it has nothing to do with us earning tons. We do it to cari makan and what we have to, in order to survive as a TD.</p>
              <p>As you mentioned very correctly in an earlier post, all this whether pax get a cab, CBD zone, calls etc, all this not your concern. Your concern is to drive according to your ability and method and earn what you have to earn. The rest not really your business.</p>
              <p>And I agree fully.</p>
              <p>Not our job to solve the issues of shortage of taxis or whatever. The authorities and companies never think of us first when they implement policy. They think of themselves, to look good and impress Ministers (LTA), to make a profit (companies) and maybe then about pax. We are always last on the list.</p>
              <p>So why we bother so much is a mystery. We should just do what we have to as you said.</p>
              <p>But I think my earlier reply as to why we won't have FT TDs, is quite logical. PAP will never introduce policies that are vote losers, especially after losing so many votes the last time round.</p>

              <p>But of course when you have tasted the cherries most likely you would not go back, like me, think of geyland, then thinking translate into action finally end up in geyland, then have some fun, then next week again think, but will not go back to the same one, at least try others. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Not all like you, we cannot think of ourselves as compare to others, you might have your strength in whatever you are doing, but many others have their weakness that call for respect.</p>
              <p>TD is a honest job, but definitely a tough one, newbies that came in can be from all kind of life, from ex banker to casket driver like me, there is alway a story behind every TDs on the road.</p>
              <p>For most, once stepped in, they want to show success, so drive here and there, day and night, they want to show to their family that it can be much more better than their old CPF jobs, and with ego and pride mixed, they strive on, at least give it a try for 1 to 2 years, after that, some get stuck in it, some decided that TD is not their trade, so they move out and move on.</p>
              <p>And to many who get stuck in it, it could be getting use to it, on the other hand, also people like me, casket to delivery drivers, TD income is much better in a sense and the most important is there is no asshole sitting on top of you commanding you by giving you stupid order and making you like a fool, controlling you with string like you are just a puppet.</p>
              <p>Therefore, it depend on which background or how conditioned are you, peoples will weight the balance to decide, I got friend who give up TD, go shipyard works 2 month, fell down, and now paralysed, so if he had keep driving, it might be better.</p>
              <p>So, perhap, you are like me, but I still do relief for others, as helping them in a way. We do not need to depend on TD, still can go JB, you go shopping, I go spa, its is this flexibility that makes our life better. But we then need to know where we come from, as a former or current TD, we need to be more encouraging for those who are still OTR earning a decent living.</p>
