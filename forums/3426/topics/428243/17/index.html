              <p>cut and paste from a comment from TR</p>
              <div id="q-385938">
              <p>Msg below is being circulated in the internet. 
              Somehow this was not brought up as an issue in the election campaign by 
              any of the opposition parties. If not mistaken, $9.6 billions have been 
              put aside for this purpose and approved by Parliament then. Singaporeans
               seem to have poor memory and that is why the MIW have cleverly crafted 
              this act to ensure that they and their families are well taken care of 
              even they are being kicked out of Parliament. Hopefully the act will be 
              repealed one day when the fat cats are ousted out.</p>
              <p>DO MINISTERS RECEIVE 50% OF THEIR LAST-DRAWN PAY FOR LIFE?</p>
              <p>You
               friend is wrong about 50%.  It is actually as high as 2/3rds.  The 
              Parliamentary Pensions Act provides that “office holders” (which means 
              “Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Speaker, Senior Minister, 
              Minister, Senior Minister of State, Minister of State, Mayor, Senior 
              Parliamentary Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary or Political 
              Secretary”).  If you closed your eyes and threw a stone in Parliament 
              House during a Parliamentary sitting – assuming if, and it is a big if, 
              that everyone attends (which is never the case.  Parliamentary sittings 
              are lucky if 50% of MPs attend!) you will hit at least 1 or perhaps 2 
              with the stone ricocheting PAP chaps entitled to pensions.</p>
              <p>Anyhow,
               back to your question.  The Act has a formula for payment of the amount
               of pension.  You start with a numerator of 8 (meaning 8 years of 
              service as office holder) and add 1 for every year of service after 
              that.  You divide this number by a fixed denominator of 27, and you stop
               when the number hits 2/3rds, which means that anyone who has 18 years 
              service will hi! t maximum pension.  The amount that is due to him FOR 
              LIFE is found at section 4:<br> 4(2) The annual amount of pension payable to an office-holding Member shall be —<br> (a) in respect of every completed year of reckonable service in any office, or where he has served in<br> more than one office in each office, at the rate of one-twenty-seventh (1/27) of his annual salary in that<br> office; and</p>
              <p>(b) in respect of any remaining uncompleted year of reckonable service in any office, or where he has<br> served in more than one office in each office, at the rate of one-three-hundred and twenty-fourth (1/324)<br> part of his annual salary for each completed month of reckonable service in that office.<br> (2A) The annual pension payable to any office-holding Member under subsection (2) shall not exceed two-thirds<br> of the highest annual salary of any office held by him.</p>
              <p>(3) Subject to sections 13 and 15, a pension granted under this section shall continue for the life of the person to<br> whom it is payable but shall not be payable in respect of any period during which he is again an office-holding<br> Member; at the end of that period the pension shall again be payable and shall be re-computed with the addition<br> of that period to the period of his former reckonable service as an office-holding Member.</p>
              <p>(4) Fo! r the purposes of subsections (2) and (2A), “annual salary”, in relation to any office, means the annual<br> equivalent of the highest monthly rate of salary (excluding any non-pensionable allowances) received by an<br> office-holding Member during any period of reckonable service as a holder of that office.</p>
              <p>Astonishing,
               isn’t it that the pension is payable based on the “Highest annual 
              salary of any office held by him” and “highest monthly rate of salary”. 
               So, it doesn’t matter that the MP was a low ranking parliamentary 
              secretary for 17 years, and then became a multi-million $ minister for 1
               year.  His pension will be based on 2/3rds of his salary as a minister,
               as that is his highest annual salary of any office held by him. So, it 
              also doesn’t matter that there are occasional reductions in salary 
              during recessions, since their pension is based on their highest annual 
              salary.</p>
              <p>On this basis, SM / PM / MM will get 2/3rd x $3 million 
              for the rest of their lives. I understand that if they are eligible for 
              pension and they are still serving, they get both salary plus pension 
              concurrently.  (see section 5).</p>
              <p>Or did I forget to tell you that pensions are exempt from income tax?  This is stated in the Income Tax Act!</p>
              <p>It
               gets better.  The Act says that the pension can be commutated.  This 
              means that it is paid in 1 lump sum instead of monthly payments for 
              life.  The lump sum is equivalent to 175.14 months of pension, i.e. 14.6
               years of pension.  It doesn’t matter that the minister asks for it 
              because he has terminal cancer and has 3 months to live.  He will get 
              14.6 years of pension paid to him in 1 go, and it will be tax free.  If 
              MM’s pension is base! d on 2.5 million (conservative estimate), his 
              commutated pension is $36.5 million.  Can buy a GCB with it, without any
               bank loan!</p>
              <p>This is a real scandal.  I was horrified when Goh Chok
               Tong proposed recently that ministers serve 8 years only, and new ones 
              come in.  It means that the pool of multi-million dollar pension earners
               will get bigger and bigger!  It will add to the financial burden of 
              future generations of Singaporeans having to pay for the pensions of 
              people who have already been paid too much during their terms of office.</p>
              <p>Who
               in the private sector is entitled to pension? And yet the ministers, 
              etc are collecting tax free pensions on top of their world’s highest 
              salaries.  Now you know why George Yeo is fighting so hard to keep his 
              job as minister.</p>
              <p>Incidentally, all Admin Service officers, Sr 
              Police &amp; Military Officers and High Court Judges are still entitled 
              to pensions in the same manner.  No one else in the Civil Service gets 
              pensions.</p>
