              <p>well, </p>
              <p>I only ferried my own clientele (used to pick from the street, just like a normal passenger).</p>
              <p> As limousine cabby, I normally passed out namecards once i sensed that there is a potential for future businesses, in regards to whether it is an AP transfer or car jockey transfer (which is also advertised behind my namecards). <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
              <p>Even Group page Car Jockey's transfer carry risks of pax complaining their personal items missing (in their vehicles) on the next day.... or their sports rims got scratched (by the road kerb) as we may not be too familiar with bigger cars.</p>
              <p>My advice is... do it at your own risk... the money may be good..... but not as good as HOURLY DISPOSAL. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
