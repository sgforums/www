              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>Earlier today, I was involved in a very very minor accident involving a transcab cabby. Basically i was attempting to parallel park into a lot in serangoon road. I did not check behind me and reversed very slowly into the red taxi behind me. we pulled to the side and exchanged information. He had passengers in his cab however I was completely alone. He took down my name, ic, hp and car plate number. I took down his name hp license number etc. He suggested not going to insurance since its a very minor accident. Problem is it was raining and it completely slipped my mind to take pictures.</p>
              <p>Just wanna know how can i safeguard myself. I am willing to pay for the damages. However, I want the work to be done in my workshop. What should my next step be? Can he refuse to take the cab to my workshop and insist on his workshop?</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance for all the help guys</p>

              <p>Tell him abt yr intent lor.. if ok, then go together la. Most taxi uncles dun 'kotok' cheat on repair cost becos the taxi is ultimately dun belongs to them.  you need to negotiate with him lor. If he insist his wksp, maybe there's a reason as the wksp may expert in repairing taxis..</p>

              <p>If the repair is $1000, might as well claim insurance, you think the TD want it?? Please have some trust in we the TD, we are not rich and certainly not wanting to cheat people like our govt did once a while. The TD had been kind enough to ask you settle within both so as to incur less lost, both in money and time. If you go claim insurance, good luck to your No claim bonus which is about $400 to $500, for 2 years, will be a $1000 extra you hv to paid for your car insurance.</p>
