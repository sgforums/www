              <p>In this industry a 'fair deal' is an agreement that both parties are happy</p>
              <p>Some examples :</p>
              <p>Day shift usually don't pump diesel, reason being handover is very rush, the Q at the diesel kiosk is very long, many uncles at the washing bay, so count by mileage</p>
              <p>Night shift is the one that pumps diesel and wash car</p>
              <p>Base on my experience, the fifth generation sonata abt 2 ~3 years old, see pic below, can go 9 ~ 10 km per litre of diesel</p>
              <p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Hyundai_Sonata_--_07-13-2009.jpg/250px-Hyundai_Sonata_--_07-13-2009.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="166"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those face lift versions which are less than 1 year old, see pic below, can go 10 ~ 11km per litre of diesel</p>
              <p>  <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/09_Hyundai_Sonata_GLS_.jpg/220px-09_Hyundai_Sonata_GLS_.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>But the above is only a guide, it all depends on how heavy you right foot is and also are you cruiser or taxi stander, city or expressway traveller</p>

              <p><br>What terms &amp; conditions u want ? It's a fair deal .</p>
              <p>Just that 5pm to 5am would be ideal , it's <span style="color: #ff0000;">FAIR </span>to rasie $0.13 to cope with the increase .</p>

              <p>Agree with reliefdriver4u that diesel consumption is dependent on driving style and</p>
              <p>habits. I'd say that $0.13 per km. is on the high side with today's diesel price. But then,</p>
              <p>u benefitted with not having to pump diesel at the end of your shift.</p>
              <p>         If u feel shortchanged, you could request that both take turns to pump for a week</p>
              <p>each. That way, it evens out any lop-sided advantage that one may have over the other.</p>
              <p>But that only if yr hirer is the negotiable type. Incurring his wrath or suspicion must be</p>
              <p>avoided.</p>

              <p>Dear all Sifu,</p>
              <p>I am new at this forum here.</p>
              <p>Currently I am driving the SMART cab on a daily rental scheme. Read from this site that Trans cab has super relief scheme.</p>
              <p>I dun really drive a lot cos I am having a full time job. Therefore, one month I can only drive up to 4 days the most.</p>
              <p>I am thinking of signing up for the super relief scheme if Trans cab does have. Because I am living in Hougang Ave 8 (nearer to Defu) rather than going to pick up the SMART cab at Tampines and return at the same place.</p>
              <p>Any advice ???</p>
              <p>Thanks a lot.....</p>

              <p>Maybe I should ask him to go for such arrangement...i would just charge him 11 cents per 1km with today's pricing of $1.05/litre from comfort. But i shy to suggest leh...sighzz...</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>Can i check what is the market practice of how many days in advance should i let my relief knows if I decided that I do not want him to drive for me anymore as I seem to see a better match in terms of timing in the database today.</p>
              <p>Another question, last Sat morning my relief went for preventive maintainence for about 2hrs +...so end of his shift he decided to pay me $20 lesser and saying that comfort would reimburse me about $10+, is this the practice?</p>
              <p>In the end,comfort only reimbursed me $9+ which is less than half of $20! Am I being calculating or is my relief taking advantage of me? After all, I am only early 30s with little or almost no taxi driving experience whereas he is mid 40s.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, give and take, be a good hirer, afterall, we are all brothers in arm, I alway believe in good relationship without suspicious, you had already talk out the term and both agreed on it, if you think he cheat you or he think you cheat him, forget it, end the relationship better, TD should be free from working politics, be a happy cabby.</p>

              <p><br>Some but not all,  peoples become TD because of sick of the corporate politic world, whereby you back stab me, he tell boss, she sabo me and never ending story, some like me, simply hates to work with stupid superiors, who point here and there only get few thousand paid, so become a TD.  And if you get a relief and keep on having suspicious of him cheating you and that, it is the same as working condition, then, might as well go back to work in a corporate world where you get many perks, from bonuses to Medical and insurance care, with many annual leaves too.</p>
              <p>Over the years, since I came out of those daily rental taxi at kiosk due to my financial problem, I have from there till now, only 1 hirer whom we have a very good relationship, and he is a muslim too, during Hari Raya, my family visited him and he gives money packet to my kids and on CNY, he visit me and I also recipocate that as usual, his daughter marry, I also help out to drive his taxi for free on that day. All these are so call give and take in life, once the trust set in, we are like brother, so from those mannual taxi to auto, he alway get me to be his relief.  If you can built such relationship and not to mingle on small issue, you can be a good hirer that people are more than willing to be your relief.</p>
