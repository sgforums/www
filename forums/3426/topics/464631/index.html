              <p>Some of you may have seen in the tone of my replies, more criticism or 'arrowing' at certain people.</p>
              <p>Poolman, Hammer2 and Ct2220 have been the recent ones.</p>
              <p>I don't do it as a personal vendetta against these guys or whoever. The reason is I am 'very pro taxi driver' basically. I tend to treat  all tDs whatever company or vehicle all as my colleagues or as in the same boat.</p>
              <p>Of course in the same boat, there are some that do better than others, some who are not very nice, some just downright bad.</p>
              <p>I don't see it as my duty to weed them out or to do anything at all. I am not a Buddhist but I do subscribe to the Buddhist thinking of karma, eventually whatever wrong you do, will come back to haunt you in the same form or in another form.</p>
              <p>If I see another Td, I will smile or raise hand if he shows a hapy face. I will give way, to another taxi driver, where possible. I don't potong jalan, but sometimes subconciously I may, sometimes we don't check mirror, sometimes I am pre-occupied, and may miss him.</p>
              <p>So I always try to ignore the antics of some. Of course sometimes, some kwai lan, I also hot, I will f him.  But normally I dont get upset if a driver suddenly brake or slow to pick up a fare on the road as long there was sufficient distance for me to stop. I can bear with that little inconvienience. I am confident of finding my own pax.</p>
              <p>Poolman has been quite a useful person to Tds, sharing and giving tips and I take my hat off to him. I certainly don't have his patience or time to do what he has done.</p>
              <p>I criticise him because I think he sometimes forgets the perception he creates with certain comments.</p>
              <p>I got nothing with the LV band either. I think LV serves a niche market and its members need to stand by each other. I got nothing against pro LV comments, but what I will caution and criticise if the things they do, put all taxi drivers in bad light especially to the wrong prying eyes.</p>
              <p>People like Ct2220 are very hardworking, Khoon too, and they deserve every cent they earn, but I don't want them to post something (in good heart) that causes alarm like when he posted receipts. So I criticise.</p>
              <p>Hammer2 is a nice person, if you know him, I have only communicated via PM not personally, but can tell he's easy to get along and is prepared to receive as much he gives. Only his temper needs to calmed down a notch or two.</p>
              <p>He can condemn you but you can condemn him, he accepts that. But I do sense that some can't, they feel angry when you disagree or criticise their comments.</p>
              <p>As for the other mod, he's fair and tries to be fair to everybody as is always willing to share advise.</p>
              <p>Others like RBs too very cincai, he say a, you say b and he'll come with c, but eveything can also. It's all in good fun.</p>
              <p>So if you see me grumble, it's because I want more understanding of tds, even the not so good ones. Of course you can grumble about me.</p>
              <p>Finally the thing about bus lanes, I normally also dont entertain especially morning shift (this 1 dont play, the red ones very dangerous) but sometimes at night like the last few days, not feeling 100% just wanna cover rent and a bit of extra, anyhow whack, see bus-stop 9, 10 pm no LTA or police, people flag, aiya just take faster collect fare, faster go home, so that's why I didn't take kindly to hammers post.</p>
              <p>What if that driver was me, or say my cousin, brother in law or close friend? How would I feel, say he really sick, just wanna grab and go home faster, and then for nothing kena arrow not by authority but a fellow TD?</p>
              <p>Sure not happy right, not fair right? Sick also drive to pay rent, in the end, who win, company win get rent, govt win get fine, and td? Lose not once but double!</p>
              <p>So please sometimes close your eyes to such things, like what the Godfather 'Don Corleone' once said when he was asked to 'hide a parcel (containing guns)'. He was asked by the other chap who came to collect it, Did you look inside? Don Corleone said ' I don't concern myself with things that don't concern me'</p>
              <p>Now that's good advise!</p>

              bro, i do agree what you have written
                      
              just like one the sentences which you say which also i mentioned
                      
              the fellow could be my friend. this could be true
                      
              i will quote an incident
                      
              which was something i have post last year
                      
              one of my kaki (citycab) and a silvercab involved in an accident at gateway, it was a
                      
              50-50 as it was side by side
                      
              case and both decide to report to each own taxi company but after when i check the taxi 
                      
              number of the silvercab and realise also my friend and request both to meet me
                      
              at the end both taxi send to outside workshop for quote and repair (total about 580)
                      
              and this save both from having to pay excess money which amount to 2140

              as a moderator, it was not easy as i would say especially when comes to decide whether
              
              to lock it or not
              
              some thread i lock but reopen by poolman
              
              some thread i thought was ok but was lock by poolman
              
              but all this locking or unlocking of thread i never queries poolman at all, 
              
              i don't think there is a need to ask him, only for less than 5 thread  which look 50-50
              
              i ever ask him
              
              but when i volunteer to be a moderator, i ever mentioned 2 things
              
              1. any thread member have any doubt and would like to request it to be lock and PM me
              
              2. any thread lock by me the thread starter/readers not happy can also PM me to check why
              
              but so far no body have done that, so i see no point after such a long time then TS(not u)
              
              complain about thread being lock or delete
              
              than suddenly the locking/delete of the 22cents which i did take action to lock but why 
              
              don't ask me there and then? how long was it since i have lock it.
              
              frankly speaking, i am also LV member but right here ,  i dare to say even poolman post
              
              was ever being edit by me, don't believe me  make a search at this forum
              
              this is just a forum, people come and go
              
              happy stay, not happy go
              
              see a new thread , like it add comment, don't like it , add comment or just leave it
              
              e.g hammer thread on cryler, i put my comment that's all, don't need to further argue
              
              as i already say what i want to say, but of course i and still looking at it and see any 
              
              need to lock it. why  cos i hate arguement, especially non stop or like no ending

              <p>Well brother JR, let be more relax and cool in cyberspace, if you want to post in cyberspace in anywhere, you tends to get critics and comments, that will be confirmed and chopped, and if u take it, let be it, if not, then ban it.</p>
              <p>And you can meet up with all kinds of people, that is for sure. Its universal.</p>
              <p>As I said before, it is souless, anyway, your that  fifty dollar is still in your wallet safe and sound rite? So, cool it.</p>
              <p>And since you have quote the godfather advise, you should had known it is of no concern to anyone of us, and when it is no concern, why grumble or unhappy over it.</p>
              <p> And you put that karma will eventually take over, buddhist or not buddhist aside. So, let the karma materialise, and there is another words that chinese like to say, people do, heaven see.</p>
              <p>So, allow me to quote you another grandfather saying...dirty harry Clint Eastwood</p>
              <p> "Well, everyone has the right to different opinons, just like everyone has a different asshole shape"</p>
              <p>Hope you take it nice and easy from here</p>

              <p>If you are the 1st taxi in queue at airport, and had been queuing for more than 45mins. Out of no where, 1 cab on busy drove passed and stopped at the pick up one and took a pax and left u stranded there waiting, what is your reaction?</p>
