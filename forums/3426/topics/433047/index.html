              <p> DISGUSTING Fella!</p>
              <p>ON JUNE 12, at about 10am, my husband and I booked a CityCab (SH8013T) to the airport. Halfway through the ride, the cabby decided to clean out his ear and nose.</p>
              <p>With his right hand on the steering wheel, his left was busy doing the "cleaning". This went on for some 10 minutes, with him flicking the dirt on the floorboard, in front of his seat. Then he ran his fingers all over his head, probably to "clean out" the dandruff on his scalp too.</p>
              <p>Cleaning one's body dirt should be done in the privacy of one's home or in the toilet, not in public and in full view of the passenger. The trip left us feeling unpleasant and nauseated.</p>
              <p>Luckily, I managed to scramble the exact fare to pay him as I did not wish to receive any change from his hands.</p>
              <p>This is not a lone incident. Many a time, at traffic lights, I have seen cabbies using a tweezer to pull out stubble on their chins and cheeks, with passengers in the cab.</p>
              <p>The taxi companies should remember that cabbies represent not just the companies but also Singapore. Do they care only about renting out cabs and collecting rentals?</p>
              <p>Perhaps they should publish a handbook for cabbies with simple illustrations on social etiquette, and the dos and don'ts when dealing with members of the public and tourists.</p>
