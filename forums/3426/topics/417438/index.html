              <p>Those who say they take home 35 a day are taking a swipe at u basically.</p>
              <p>Lets not argue so much , put out a poll and see which TD brother here supports your stand ( whatever that is )</p>
              <p>With me obviously against it , lets hear from the rest.</p>
              <p>To the rest of the bros , give us your opinion . If all of them support u , sure i will keep quiet and probably just leave this forum.</p>

              <p>Not everyone makes $3145 a mth. Your account is very one sided and it applies probably to your own or your friend's experience.</p>
              <p>Your rebate of $665 does not apply to non transcab drivers. So how can u say tat every tan , kow &amp; beng is making that amt? I for one dont smell $3145 .So does that mean i should bear the brunt of any scrutiny just because u go around the island talking abt $3145?</p>
              <p>As for the top secret , there is so much limitations that u are bounded by . If they on top decide on it , u and me also lan lan.</p>
              <p>If u say u earn $3145 yourself , then fine , congrats to u but u are implying that everyone makes that amt? how very wrong of u imo</p>
