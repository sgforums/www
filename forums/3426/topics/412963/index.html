              If you appeal just 1 summon, Normally for speeding, they don't give chance
              
              but if you got 2 summons, say 1 is speeding and 1 is beat red light
              and appeal together, likely they will waive the cheaper one
                  
              Speeding Fines: Exceeding 1 - 20km/h $130 + 4 demerit points. 
                  
              Exceeding 21 - 30km/h $150 + 6 demerit points

              I got a friend who says he 18yrs drive taxi never kenna any summon before ... Here's how
                  
              1. At expressway never go more than 10km/hr above speed limit
              eg if 90km/h is the speed limit, max he go is 99km/hr
                  
              2. If pax say want fast, he reply he cannot go fast if want fast pls alight take another cab
                  
              Actually all this speeding is all in our mind we may think that pax always want fast and we must speed to complete faster, which is not the case
                  
              I ever kenna turbo spoilt, on one of the peak hr morning (the indication is engine lite, lite up) and suay suay kenna accepted a call, when travelling cannot go above 60km/hr on a flat road the speed is like between 40km/hr to 60km/hr, when reach destination, pax never say anything so just pay.
                  
              I stick around city in the day too many car so cannot speed either, so afternoon decide to go loyang service, hope to catch one street pax to east side
                  
              Heng or suay i dunno got an indian national going Changi airport but with huge luggage until my boot cannot close
              Want fast cos late for flight, i say i try, but in my heart thinking how to speed ? turbo spoilt leh ...
              so i tell them too dangerous to speed too many luggage, may drop out if go too fast. so was travelling like 50km/hr on flat road, 40km/hr on upslope and not more than 80km/hr on downslope in the PIE, pax keep saying faster faster, i say ok ok and floor the accerator to create sound only, but no speed one, haha
                  
              when reach pax oso never say anything or scold, just pay up and go ...
                  
              So from now on do not go beyond 10km/hr above the speed limit and you will be fine
              
              Next time you see sonata travelling very slowing on the expressway, very likely is turbo spoilt

              <p><strong>From 1 November 2010, Land Transport Authority (LTA) will take over 
              the following five functions from the Traffic Police (TP).</strong></p>
              <p>Enforcement and administration of illegal parking offences, Issuing permits 
              for carrying of loads on vehicles, Issuing permits/ authorisations for use of 
              excluded vehicles on expressways, Closing roads for repair and reconstruction, 
              and Gazetting of speed limit for roads will be handled by LTA.</p>
              <p>Mr Colin Lim, LTA’s Acting Group Director for Vehicle and Transit Licensing 
              said, “LTA and TP have jointly reviewed the Road Traffic Act to enhance our 
              functions in ensuring smooth flowing traffic and road safety.</p>
              <p>Through this review, we have identified five functions that are more in-line 
              with LTA’s strategic thrust to manage road usage and hence agreed for them to be 
              transferred to LTA.</p>
              <p>Officers from LTA and TP have been working closely to ensure a smooth 
              transition. LTA will maintain the existing service and enforcement 
              standards.”</p>
              <p>Commander of Traffic Police, Assistant Commissioner of Police Cheang Keng 
              Keong, said, “The transfer will allow Traffic Police to better focus on our core 
              functions such as enforcement against unsafe driving behaviour and inculcating 
              safe driving habits in motorists.”</p>
              <p><strong>Enforcement of illegal parking</strong></p>
              <p>Upon taking over the enforcement of illegal parking, LTA will deploy traffic 
              wardens, auxiliary police officers and its own uniformed enforcement officers to 
              carry out the function.</p>
              <p>LTA’s enforcement procedures will be similar to those of the TP.</p>
              <p>There will be no change to the penalties for illegal parking offences.</p>
              <p>Members of the public can call LTA’s hotline 1800-CALL LTA (2255 582) on 
              illegal parking matters from 1 November 2010.</p>
              <p><strong>Issuing permits for carrying of loads on vehicles</strong></p>
              <p>LTA will take over the issuing of permits for oversized1  vehicles to travel 
              on the roads. Vehicle owners/ drivers can make use of LTA’s on-line portal, 
              LTA.PROMPT, to submit their applications. The details of the application process 
              will be made available to the relevant stakeholders closer to the date of 
              takeover.</p>
              <p><strong>Issuing permits/ authorisations for use of excluded vehicles on 
              expressways</strong></p>
              <p>Excluded vehicles, such as ready-mix concrete trucks and tractors are 
              generally not allowed on the expressways unless they are used for the purpose of 
              carrying out maintenance, repair and cleaning on the expressways.</p>
              <p>The vehicle owners will need to apply for a permit before they are allowed to 
              travel on expressways when such needs arise. These vehicle owners need to apply 
              for the permit with LTA instead of TP from 1 November 2010.</p>
              <p>Vehicle owners/ drivers can submit their applications to LTA via fax at 6553 
              5399, or email them to <a href="mailto:excluded_veh@lta.gov.sg">excluded_veh@lta.gov.sg</a>.</p>
              <p>The existing penalty will be retained.</p>
              <p><strong>Closing roads for repair and reconstruction</strong></p>
              <p>The provision to close roads/ lanes is to facilitate construction or road 
              repair works. With this transfer, the LTA will be empowered to close roads and 
              lanes to facilitate road works. Any person who intends to carry out construction 
              works on the road shall notify LTA.</p>
              <p><strong>Gazetting road speed limits</strong></p>
              <p>At present, road speed limits are administratively gazetted by the Ministry 
              of Home Affairs after the LTA has determined the appropriate speed limits.</p>
              <p>To streamline the process, the Ministry of Transport will gazette the road 
              speed limits set by LTA from 1 November 2010.</p>
              <p>(TP will continue their enforcement action against speeding offences.)</p>
              <p>very difficult...lah.</p>

              <p>to share, i use this road often.</p>
              <p>sometimes, the officer will stay in the middle of bridge, but aiming @ AMK directions, not those going towards farrer.</p>
              <p>sometimes, they have two officers, one at extreme ends of the bridge so u can really spot them. U only know when you can see one white police van parking near the entrance to tcs, after shell station (going towards farrer), or some "kind" drivers flashing.</p>
              <p>I do flash some drivers after I pass the bridge but I do believe it is an offense to flash, if I am not wrong.. could someone clarify..</p>

              <p><br>I agree, they give have all means to take back the money!  I ever had one experience, not yet TD still, was riding bike, along Tampines St 12, going to TPE, TP stop me, check my license, insurance, road tax etc, all I have.. Then he ask me "You know why I stop you?"  I said I don't.  Then he say, my bike in front got P Plate, and behind don't have.. Honestly, I am aware, coz the P plate behind drop already, but didn't bother to go get a new one coz I like left a month to 1 year of getting bike license, now kana caught, really LL.  Kana fine $120!  I remember that time I just got the $100+ from the GST package or something and they took it back within a few days!  But my question is, when he stop me, he is in front of me, how can he see I don't have a P plate behind my bike??</p>
