              <p>Hmmm, I'm a little puzzled by this dishonesty thing. He asked her to pay any amount, she paid $6, how pray tell is this dishonest? She offered to pay the amount without coercion.</p>
              <p>Pretend not to on meter? Very subjective. Btw it's very hard to have a $4 fare these days especially if during peak periods. Start meter already over $4, plus if take white cab it's $5.</p>
              <p>Lavender MRT to PA, still must go up Syed Alwi junction if on the other side, fare will around $5+.</p>
              <p>Live and let live lah. This could well be a genuine case and doesn't look dishonest at all to me. Plus, your wife didn't have to walk and pespire.</p>

              <p>How far can a TD be dishonest?? Moreover, for a layman like us, money given extra consider appreciation and tips, a dollar or 2 maybe big to us, but to think of it, cannot even buy a bowl of kuay teow mee today.</p>
              <p>Once I told my wife, if take taxi, talk to the TD, they are very boring, talking help to make their day better, but dun end up get court by them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">, most are tiko + taiko type, by telling them that you are fellow taxi driver's wife, hope they can give discount, but be careful, if take blue, cannot say husband drive Red, and if took Red, dun say your husband drive blue, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> it could end up with more fares</p>

              <p>I think brother foolsh,as a TD yourself, should take it as a pinch of salt,</p>
              <p>TD is a multi tasking job, he or she has to know the road, look out for traffic, TP, peoples, MDT, take calls, collect money, change money, take cards, and also have to greet and at time, entertain pax, be it good or bad pax, then have to do the banking, care for the vehicle like washing, top up diesel, report any problem, look out for vehicle problem.</p>
              <p>Then they also have to be good in time management, when to stop, change shift, when is the peak, what is the time now, sometime I drive until i also dunno what is the time or my granfather name, then forget to press city surcharge after 5, keep thinking only 6, got once ap also forget to press surcharge because of tireness.</p>
              <p>Then like everyone else, we are also human, we also got emotion, family problem, personel problem, relatives, gf, wife, partner, problem, like a hirer going holiday, he will keep thinking of how to get a relief and so on.</p>
              <p>Now let take a restaurant, the boss rent a place like we rent out a cab, but he overlook everything, he make sure someone is attending to the customers, someone is preparing the foods, someone is preparing the drink, someone is at the cashier only doing collecting, someone doing the cleaning and he himself do the banking. Translate it into a TD, he is the cashier, at the same time, attend to customers, prepare the journey, prepare to serve the pax, do his own cleaning, go do banking himself.</p>
              <p>So definitely, at time, the mind goes blank, even if experienced one may go blank, sometime pax said a road so familar but knn just cannot remember it, or suddenly go blank and forget to press here and there</p>

              <p>This I totally agree with JoeRaj. How can TS as a TD say such things? A bit buay gan to slam your trade fellows like this. Don't on meter as a tactic? You siao meh? You ask the most experience TD here to try they also dare not. Pax turn back bite you say tats your problem you also Lan Lan. For $2?!?!? Foolish_2000 you are no different from those pax that claim you detour the extra 10 meters to cheat them. Nothing personal against you but your words a bit unacceptable. Your wife offered $6 to a TD and you pass such malicious critisism to the TD.</p>

But pax are obliged only to pay what is shown on the meter fare. Rest is up to his discretion. call lta, police or taxi company also no one will help td one.

              <p>Song Bo.   I have so many time honestly forget to on meter due to various circumstances like talking to pax or day dreaming about toto, and Pax pay me more.  I never request them to pay more and told them to pay me what they desire, but they insist i take that amount.</p>
