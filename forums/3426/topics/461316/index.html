              <p>TS , u might not know .....</p>
              <p>Many still driving a Crown and Cedric not because of rental issues ....</p>
              <p>Many more .</p>
              <p>Mainly Automatic vehicle is very fast ... some oldies cannot tahan the pace , heart attack . They prefer something slow and easy like Cedric and Crown .</p>
              <p>Some felt they need to drive a lower flag down fare sort of taxis , to avoid rejections . Cheap taxi will get more business mindset .</p>
              <p>My friend is like that one .... </p>
              <p>And some oldies , they really dun want to start to learn how to drive an auto car .</p>
              <p>U'll never teach old dogs any new tricks .</p>
              <p>That is why Premier bought some i30 ..... to replace the ageing Crown , instead of replacing them with another automatic taxis .</p>
              <p>Heard TransCab also bringing some manual car like i30 ..... to accommodate those old driver's requests . </p>

              <p>Age is not an excuse to road hog , it all boils down to the character of the driver. Driving habits are nurtured over the years.</p>
              <p>Young that time u lut , old also will lut</p>
              <p>Young that time considerate and think of other road users , old also the same.</p>

              <p>I think whatever it is, thanks all for yr caring and understanding for ah peks like me.</p>
              <p>As we age, hormone tends to change to abit weird, 3 things usually happen to poor ah pek like me,</p>
              <p>1st, no money</p>
              <p>2nd, poor eyesight</p>
              <p>3rd, poor lan chiao.</p>
              <p>So, you see the psychological change, a man at 50s, 60s or 70s, should be retired, but our ever need of money and self support is critical in a society that base more on meritocracy than social needs and welfare. Meaning you have to work inorder to survive till the end of your life.</p>
              <p>And as a man at such age, money should be secondary, but most ah peks like me, still struggling to make a decent living and money is still very much primary.</p>
              <p>With poorer eyesight, we get tired easily, see women become staring, and then see those sexy girl, like, but lan chiao no power liao, so you think frustrated or not, take sex drug, later heart problem and all kinds of side effect.</p>
              <p>So end up lan lan take our time to drive cheap rental taxis lor, got pax, take, no pax, Q, after 6 to 8 hrs, go back, have a bottle, buy a paper, rest at home, post here and there.</p>

              <p>And just to add some salt, we all must grow old, no one can escape, so if you do not respect an old man way of driving, at least respect his age, and all those I spelled out above, should put you in a better mind of how an old man like me is living and thinking.</p>

              <p><br>When I drive crown, I also careless who or who, want to knock my rear, go ahead, old car liao, lots of spare parts at sin ming and loyang. My hirer hit the front left light on to a side wall, go loyang, accident department just take one and change, $20 only, no need claim insurance,  rear brake light broken, free change, even steering, wheels, gear..all have. And there is only 500 active on the road with few thousands sunbathing in the open carparks. Take your pick.</p>
              <p>But like it or not, crowns will be history in about 2 years time, that is what I heard (tia Kong) from cdg mei ni</p>

              <p>Crown hogging at right lane, or any other models of car doing so, we had to look at the bigger pictures.............</p><p>
              
              </p><p>This day, center lane in any kind of road in Sg is crowded with lorry, van, buses, trailers, heavy vehicles, even mobile crane..............</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Even the sign board stated........Heavy Vehicle, Please keep left........don't seem like working............</p><p>
              
              </p><p>If you stay at center lane, you will be driving like a snail..........than zoom in, zoom out also very tiring..........that's why you see many slow vehicles hogging on the right lane............</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Ever see TP zooming pass on right lane with blinker on...........all the heavy vehicles Kwai Kwai move to the left............after losing sight of the TP............all 1 by 1 move to center lane again..............</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Did ask some of my friends who are driving heavy vehicles, why you all behave like that?..............</p><p>
              
              </p><p>In fact, their heavy vehicles is powerful, but due to the 70km/hr speed limit, so aka aka, drive at 80-90km/hr............than deadline for delivery, projects........etc, also prompt them to speed up.............</p><p>
              
              </p><p>So put this into the whole pictures..........most time powerful car also must tailgate behind a crown at right lane even tough he is traveling at 100km/hr............</p><p></p>
