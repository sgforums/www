              <p>This story is very common now. Just go to the coffe shop, or even your block ground floor. Look for a man that looks educated and start talking to him. SAME STORY.</p>
              <p>I supported the ruling party until 2 elections ago (about 8 years ago) when I realised that they are out of touch and not too concerned about our problems. </p>
              <p>I likened Singapore to a very prosperous company, but the workers are paid miserably. The Management (Ruling party) filled the pockets while the workers (citizens) struggle day to day.</p>
              <p>So what if you a World Class (High GDP) company when the workers (citizens) are trying to make ends meet.</p>
              <p>I went through the same shit as this guy, but I took to Taxi Driving because it is an interesting profession that meets my needs. Because the number one reason why I was robbed off my job in the corporate world (due to FT) will not happen in TD profession.</p>
              <p>At least not for now......</p>

              <p>PMEs are also called the sandwich group, mostly in their 20s to late 30s, these group are the first Y gen if you are talking about local PME. Being sandwiched because they came in an era of high cost of houses, cars and many other items that is essential to them.</p>
              <p>The top 20% are well off, no policies changes is going to affect them much, most are earning 60k and above per month, individually or combine income. The lower 20%, people like me, in the lowest 10% are happy go lucky type, eat koptiam can already, 3 in 1 also can do, wear cheap clothing and flip flop unless companies provide uniform like my casket company. The govt do help in a way by given rebate and bursary, but the cost of living is still high for the lower group.</p>
              <p>The sandwich group, which is the mid 60 percent are the worst, they want high class living and yet cannot get much subsidize, unlike lower class, they go for branded and posh resturant, travel in SIA, tour europe, japan but for some, never even know where is Duxton road and Rangoon road in singapore. Then must hv the latest Iphone, drink at $20 per bottle tiger, ipad, galaxy and condo and so on.  And that is where they get taxed the most, spent the most and end up even with a 10k paycheck, they still hei hei chuan.</p>
              <p>Money is not about how much you earn, it is about how much you saved.</p>
