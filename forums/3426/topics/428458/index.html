              <p>bro, perhaps it could be those already sank root in Sg.  I have being driven in a blue sonata before with a heavy prc accent but he is already citizens for more than 5 years. Another taxi driver and i knew him was previously from H.K. and living here for 20 years and he still speak like hongkey.  Not surprising and i don't mind that as they are already localize and their children sank roots here.</p>
              <p>However, i think the possibilities of what might happen in USA and Australia with "FT taxi driver" may happen here in the near future.</p>
              <p>Taxi companies also want to exploit more profits.  </p>
              <p>What is our those shitty NTA members and their so called leader doing?</p>
              <p>Fxxk la...NOW is the time to VOTE WISELY.</p>
              <p>otherwise no chance to Voice UP in Parliament.</p>

              <p>For example, like my office. My team used to have about 70% local staff. New project comes in, need more headcount. My management employed 15 Filipinos staff but non Singaporean. Weird right?</p>
              <p>Govt, please don't tell me my job even local Singaporean shun it, don't want to apply? BTW, it is an IT company.  This is a clear example foreigners are fighting jobs with the local here.</p>
              <p>So, when retrenchment comes, who will be the one get retrench? Local or FT? Maybe this is what Singapore are facing now or the coming future.</p>

              <p>Long ago, there was a PhD China Doctor driving taxi, no big deal lah. I got once a middle age guy asked me if I am a PRC, I told him I am not, then I asked him, why you asked. He said, if you are PRC, I am not taking your taxi, it is not that I hate PRC, it is because I hate the govt bring them in, so I boycott them, my last job was in  a electronic firm as a lead leader, get retrenched, then they get PRC in. He also said that he hated them to the bone. Then he asked me to reconfirm if I am a PRC in disguise, I told him no, double confirm no, worrying that he can end up beating me, so I spoke Malay to him to confirm, he felt so happy and relieved.</p>
              <p>My view is that, without our knowning,  foreigners had caused some mental problem into our Singaporeans, out there on the street, many are suffering from deep depression because of foreigners, and this could turn violence toward foreigners, govt think of making money, but they fail to realise the society impact on the ground which is getting worst by the days. Especially pples in their middle age, they can hardly get a job that can breed a decent family, unless they wish to take up those $800 foreign workers paid, then there are plenty, but $800 can survive for a typical 4 rooms family of two school going childrens, definitely not enough. Is the govt dumb or what???</p>

              No, I am not a TD. This is  an open forum.  You also said you heard it from a pax. It would be different if as a TD you heard it from another TD. 
              
              It is not good to start a chain reaction from a vague hint.

              <p>This happened since late 90s liao......foreigners coming in to do jobs which singaporeans can do, jobs which we dun shun. When retrenchment comes, singaporeans with cpf contributions and higher pay go first.</p>
              <p>Today you are young in your 20s and 30s, earning a good pay, nice house and nice car. When you reach your 40s and then retrenched, you can't get your last drawn pay because a foreigner sitting in your position is cheaper, your life can change in that instant. You have to sell your car, sell your house etc. Nothing is permanent in singapore now.</p>
