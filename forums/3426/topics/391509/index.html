              <p>FT Ah ney for me means those constructions, shipyards, blue collar factory Ah Ney.  They are pretty humble and i love to fetch those pax.</p>
              <p>Those Puki Tiang FT "Fair skin Ah Ney" or another version FT "white collar" Ah Ney from the middle and north are "Fxxking" bad lot.    </p>
              <p>Last week i have a pax who is local sg Ah Ney complaining about those FT "White collar" Ah Ney.  And She told me many local Ney cannot tahan those bunches and say that even those FT despise them and local SG.   Ha....ha...she also remind me to kick them out of my taxi....End of journey she give me a big "tips"keep the change.</p>
              <p>Another bunches i like are those bangla - no big deal in which routes i take..... and even though they know their routes they will tell me to take whichever i prefer. </p>
              <p>Same as Thais and Pinoy --- they are happy lots. Pinoy like musics and they usually sing along in your car...if you have musics that suits them.</p>

              - bras basah rd - raffles boulavard.
              
              He said i should take kim seng rd - havelock rd - follow the rd straight to fullerton - raffles boulavard. (i also don't know where)
              
              After dropping him, i put to "busy" mode.
              
              i go test the rd he mention, and is kim seng rd - havelock rd - pickering st - church st - robinson rd - raffles boulavard.
              
              lesson learned.

              Bro Cash, when you do u-turn, ppl always got the idea that you go wrong way unless you tell them in advance that you need to U-Turn
              
              for this destination my favourite route is 
              
              kim seng rd - havelock rd - eu tong sen st - high st - st andrew road- beach road- bras basah road - raffles boulavard.
              
              Short and sweet but traffic lights always not in my favour, but never kenna anything from ang mo, jipun or korea leh ...

              <p>Talking about ang moh, I got this encounter on the first day of work.</p>
              <p>I was at the end of pasir panjang rd (the west coast highway end), near the 7eleven, when I saw an old ang moh with a very young dark skinned asian girl came down from one of the pub/ restaurants. He is 50+ and the girl was maybe around 17-18. I tought what a lucky bast*rd. :)</p>
              <p>Later on I found out from the girl that the guy was her daddy (means her mom's husband) and she is a student from KL, on holiday here.</p>
              <p>The guy open the door, look at me for a good 5 seconds then said " Please send my girl to Wilby Rd". The name ring a bell, but i was trying hard to recall where it was, then I remembered Boss Pool ever mention Wilby Rd in this forum when talking about shortcut to 6th ave or Old holland Rd, etc.  First thing registered on my mind where to go? Asked the girl but she was not sure about the area also. Just when I started driving, i noticed "South Buona Vista Rd" sign, then I guessed from South maybe got connection to North Buona Vista, and so on, so I turned left and tried. When driving further I became more and more unsure (and i have not mastered to use the GPS yet)  and the road became windy and sort of deserted, finally see Buona Vista!. Pasir Pjg - South Buona Vista- North Buona Vista - Holland Rd - 6th Ave - Bukit Timah- Wilby Rd. There $6++</p>
              <p>I should have taken the Pasir Panjang - Alexandra - Queesnway - Farrer - Bukit Timah - Wilby, and may earn three time as much, and blame it on the GPS!!   Damn, I hate my brain for being too smart. :)</p>
              <p>Got more stories to share, will tell later. now have to pick up my kid. See you guys soon!</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Started by
                          joining the queue at AMK office area, got there about 6 cabs in front of me.
                          Waited abt 3 mins but only move up one cab, then I get scared loose, so I left
                          the que thinking of picking up road side pax at an MNC office nearby. Pass
                          through there, not a single pax waiting, then slowly cruise down AMK until saw
                          another queue at Lor Chuan. Up to then I spent nearly 20mins empty and was
                          starting to feel that driving cab is not easy as I thought.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Join the
                          queue for about 5mins+ and one gentleman get on my cab “Uncle Lucky
                           Plaza please”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Bingo, not
                          bad my first pax ask me to go in CBD, drove him in and he paid by Charge card.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At LP got 2
                          philippino ladies got in and ask to drive to boat quay, another CBD! From CBD
                          one girl ask me to drive her to Red Dot house on Maxwell. From Maxwell cruise
                          down along Robinson but saw the taxi stands full of cabs, so tried 1 Raffles
                          Quay instead. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">While
                          waiting on the queue at 1RQ, I read the notes again and noticed that CBD
                          surcharge is not auto, must key in manually!!??!!$$%% WTF,<span>  </span>I didn’t charge the first two CBD pax (LP and
                          BQ) and lost $6 income!!???!!$$!! Ah, new lesson learned.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A jap pax
                          got in asked to drive to 28Scotts. I thought nmv lah, a bit out of CBD just
                          learn to see all those flagging along Scotts as transparent and get to LP queue
                          again. Reached 28 scotts, got a young pretty jap lady waiting for me at the
                          lobby (ha ha I wished, but she was waiting for a taxi lah). She got in and
                          asked me to drive to Paragon taxi stand, not bad, got pax and at same time save
                          on ERP. Dropped her off at taxi drop off and joined the CentrePoint queue. A
                          young Indonesian girl got in and asked me to drive her to, guess what, Red
                          House Maxwell rd again. What’s happening at Red House?? :)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Drop her
                          off there and join the taxi stand along Robinson. Got a black French guy got in
                          and asked me to drive him home to Anchorage.
                          By then already 8pm, drive into CBD and que at 1RQ again.</span></p>

                          scheming bastard, but I prefer to build up a rapport with him, as we are going
                          for a long term partnership mah. (For the record, he still insisted and at the
                          end I deduct $5 off the rental just for token)<span>   </span></span></p>
