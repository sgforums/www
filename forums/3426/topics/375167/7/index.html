              <p>So,what about those hirers with comfort and their new sonata rolling out  recently and now still  a pools on the waiting list, they also do their math. What.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> As mentioned those are only a small group jump ship, over to the red can never be all, right.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me figure up, as the vendor alway told buy two get one free promotion sales, are we not paying the three total amount of the mechandise, simple mathematic, the vendor only collected the two and one from his or her own pocket given free to you. If like that soon the vendor will close their door,  cause he is stupid given his money blindly, why? another example Year end sales another groups of cunning vendors...less 80% warehouse sales all must go those banner frequent on display at roadside at anywhere where potential location you can see. So like that me also understand, what is the game... marked up the selling price and gave the discount still they make 80% is just a gimmick to attact sales those sotong consumers. Or the actual mechandise through the year is only 20% the cost and they are making 80% so as to clear stock they given huge discount to us, just to collect their capital. Which is which.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> So if the rental of the taxi is $100 less $23.86 for 30 days rental you pay swee swee. So could it be the real rental per day is $76.14.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are that figure  you get free every month mentioned not from our own pocket. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only Santa Clause is distributing free sweets to childrens during this Christmas season is true and rear. Not those vendors game.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I, just guessing could be wrong.</p>

              <p>Botak , 12.35am , what we earn from there , it's all bonus . We have already earn like $100 to $110 deduct everything for me by 12am . Starting from 4pm ot 5pm , or between .</p>
              <p>It really doesn't matter already , whether or not we get extra $20 or $30 or even $100 .</p>
              <p>Cos we know in our own pocket , we already have that cold hard $100 .</p>
              <p>Unlike day shift ..... they have different patterns of driving .</p>
              <p>For night shifts , we already adopted a certain formula .... that allows us to earn a specific salary by a certain time .</p>
              <p>Those amount cannot escape one , also cannot bullshit too much .</p>
              <p>Mon to Thursday , almost will be same , Friday slightly more . Saturday also slightly below Friday night , more than Mon-Fri .</p>
              <p>That is why i always emphasis , be consistent .</p>
              <p>Keep on finding the right combo , to make yourself a consistent player on the field .</p>
              <p>Don't tell me luck .</p>
              <p>U tell me hardwork , u tell me tactics , u tell me strategies , it's right stuffs !</p>
              <p>Luck can never beat consistency !!</p>
              <p>I can be consistency everyday , but i cannot be lucky everyday .</p>
              <p>Only one fella know whether am i a consistency fella , ALN .</p>
              <p>He had now learn a bit of my philosophy of being consistent , less depending on luck .</p>
              <p>At least , now he know when to go Chevron , when to go IBP , when to go AMK St 65 , when to go Kranji , when to go Airport .</p>
              <p>He now started to create his own luck .</p>

              <p><br>SMRT ?</p>
              <p>Wow , now they press really hard for new drivers ?</p>
              <p>Hard Sales ?</p>
              <p>Botak , when take license , say Thank You so much , and good bye to SMRT .</p>
              <p>Patrick and Teo was our former SMRT hirer , both don't think SMRT is the right taxi company to set your foot on the taxi's path .</p>
              <p>When u get license ... take step by step .</p>
              <p>Depending on whether u want to try out as relief like ALN , Komade , Tio Call Liao or me .... i think we 4 are a happy lot . I am serious . Less stress , less burden , less responsibilities .</p>
              <p>Then when u grow up to be a more matured driver , then u consider whether to go one level up as Hirer .</p>
              <p>Now because TransCab launching waves of waves of New 2.0 Wish on the road , nobody can forecast what the impact will be .</p>
              <p>Good or bad ? nobody can foreseen .</p>
              <p>if u sign the contract on the dotted line , if u cannot make it , due to the current and new fleet , u will have difficulty jumping out of those mess .</p>
              <p>But when u are a relief like me , we are still control of our own fate . Cos we are free from all sort of contract obligations .</p>
              <p>It's easier to play around , we are in control .</p>

              <p>Why we pay $105 for sonata. We know  all about  that $715 bonus of that red rhino.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This kind of games why are there still many peoples like us PT relief still go for Comfort cause there are plenty of cabs... City or Comfort in any heartlands there are many hirers around, easily you can engage one... Try red rhino can we easily get an answer or hirers calling you. That why? expensive there is a price you need to pay. Who care about the $45 for crown or sonata $53 half a shift. Today you can drive crown 2moro you can drive a sonata, not happy you can change and wait for the next available, there are many for you to choice. </p>

              <p>What kind of benefit you get...do they got islandwide diesel kiosks or workshop, even a windscreen wiper or puncture tyre or any light- bulbs,  we can go to any  workshops islandwide from comfort.

              <p>I compare apple to apple , orange to orange .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>yes you are right...taxi company  some may come with attraction, like money bonus, some may still at 88 cents a litre that kind of attraction. But there are six taxi companies  in sg...why? those others four companies are not mentioned at all are they not under the fruit like apple and orange, Why? still there is players over there... never see them going burst... hehehe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Taxi hirers are not stupid either...just an example, as like the two IR as what the sand boss said being first may not matter, he told the reporters quote " Look at me, Do I look stupid? Do you think we put five and the half billion dollars here because we, didn't check the market...? Trust me, there will be more high rollers than you can shake a stick at."</p>
              <p>I think it's meaningful...i agreed...matter of time, will see what endup...yo.</p>

              <p>Another quote from the IR boss..."Let them open first and we'll see what mistakes they make and we will correct them so we'll make fewer mistakes,"</p>

              <p>I, think this is also a very good point...do and we will see what those 1000 or 2000 said later. This is only a matter of time. New ideal need time to prove. I,  mean those incentive....better to safe than sorry, for me go holiday... sure i, go for SQ if it available, price is not a main issue...we are talking about..long term. partnership.</p>
