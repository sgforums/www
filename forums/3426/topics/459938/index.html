              <p>ok, fair enough...... i took a fix object to clarify who is moving</p>
              <p>when accident, i will usually give chance, claim as mininum as possible</p>
              <p>for this case, the front car will get maxinum from me, no chance given the moment when he is trying to put the fault on me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>again, i want to highlight this, when we on the road, indeed in the society, things will happen, there no way we can expect others to change for you.</p>
              <p>There is only changing ourselves, to prevent, to protect, our personal interest.</p>
              <p>And this is an ADULT MINDSET.</p>

              <p>Ya, can see he move backwards towards you. Probably gearshift in neutral.</p>
              <p>How to prevent? I guess only way is to keep yr distance and horn earlier.</p>
              <p>It seems the blackvue cam in the other thread <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/3426/topics/459844">http://sgforums.com/forums/3426/topics/459844</a> has got an auto-set parking mode to capture such incidents.</p>
              <p>If got damage that can be seen, claim him and rest at home. If he never make report, he sure kena more teruk....</p>

              <p>if you can proof your innocence, and the front driver like what you mention........ you got to teach him a lesson, to be a man to admit and pay for his mistake.</p>

              <p>Keep safe distance; especially when stopping at slope. If front car rolls back, there is reaction time for front car to realise and stop in time or back car to horn loud loud.</p>
              <p>If engine is switched off, it means you are parked. Cameras are also off unless you set to motion detection. If someone reverses into you when parked, you have to prove you were parked in a proper place and manner. Use your handphone to snap extra photos to suppot your case.</p>

              <p>Good thing for you! your car is solid, so no visible damage. What if the driver hit a bike?</p>
              <p>All drivers, not only taxi drivers can make this mistake. But if you are in the wrong, admit and apologise and learn from your mistake.</p>
