              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Recently I kissed a taxi at the traffic light. It was a very light kiss with no visible scratches or anything on the cab. But there was a previous black mark which was not caused by my car. The driver took my number down and was very nice. He said he will call me if got anything. I asked for his number but he did not want to give me saying he will call me. But after 3 days, I receive a call from my insurance company instead saying that the taxi is claiming my insurance. But the bang was so light that even his passengers could not even be bothered to get out of the taxi. </p>
              <p>In such case, what can I do? </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>He told me we were blocking the traffic but it was at night and the junction had no cars. He said he will call me then I said okay. Throughout he sounded nice. Few days later which is today<span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  "> was from the insurance company already.</span></p>
              <p><span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  ">It was green light. I thought he was gonna move. I release my brake then I realize he still haven't move! It was my bad. But it was a really really minor one. There was almost or I don't even see a dent or scratch on his bumper. It's the SMRT older cab with the plastic bumper kind. Is the usual claim going to be hefty? </span></p>
              <p><span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);  ">Actually its not my car also and the car owner who is my friend's mom is really really pissed. And at that point of time I was alone I didn't know what to do. I didn't tell my friend's mom until the insurance called up today because it wasn't noticeable and I thought she wouldn't find out. :x</span></p>
              <p>I called up SMRT hotline they said I can settle with the driver privately, but the driver didn't call me and went straight to file a claim. </p>
              <p>Would appreciate any kind of advise. Thanks!</p>

                      or even better stop getting "kissed" from behind with a sudden brake.
                  
                  
                  you think it's a coincidence that taxi drivers and motorcyclist are considered the most dangerous vehicles on the road?
              
              
              I was flagging a cab once when another cab from the far side of the road speed up and cut in diagonally infront of the cab I was flagging.

              try taking a cab yourself and ask other cabbies if they've heard any of their colleagues try stuff like this.

              <p>Maybe you are new to the world of driving. Read the insurance manual on what to do when there is an accident.</p>
              <p>It does not matter whether the other party says OK or not. Get particulars, take pictures. If no give particulars, ask one more time to confirm he does not want to give particulars (so that you can tell the court you ask him one more time). Make report to Insurance company to cover your backside.</p>
              <p>If want to settle out of court, you need to get a written, sign note to say there will be no action taken. Both parties sign. Sometimes the amount of compensation is also stated in this note.</p>
              <p>It is obvious you did not do all this, and if the Insurance company wash hands, you may have to bear the full compensation to the other party.</p>
              <p>The only thing you can do is quickly go and find out from the Insurance company, what are your options. They may, or may not be able to help you in some ways.</p>

              <p>From what I understand, TS technically have committed 'hit and run' since no report was made to insurance coy and in such cases, usually he have to bear all responsibilities, including claims and any TP offence, if any. </p>
