These are people that we know have never even owned a passport."<br><br>Silver Horizon is neither a charity nor a commercial company.<br><br>The Singapore National Co-operative Federation (SNCF) has defined it as a social enterprise, based on self and mutual help, formed by members to serve members.<br><br>Dolly Goh, the SNCF's CEO, said such social good is becoming an increasingly popular business model.<br><br>"Within these two years, we have seen a 150 per cent increase in submission of business plans among the young. The trends of cooperatives formation follow the social needs of Singapore - the ageing population, the low income, the senior citizens and people with special needs."<br><br>Ms Goh said to start a cooperative, at least 10 members are needed as well as drafting a five-year business plan and by-laws.<br><br>"It is not difficult to start up a cooperative because SNCF will assist you. We teach you how to do your cash flow, your P&amp;L and also help to walk you through what it takes to start up a business."<br><br>There are now 85 cooperatives in Singapore, which have touched the lives of 1.7 million people.<br><br>And for those who endeavour to start an enterprise with a difference, a cooperative could be a model worth pursuing.<br><br></span></em></span></span></p></div>

              <p>Earlier industrialisation, the worker started the PIEU and SILO cooperative to help factory workers to buy cheaper essential items, essential item are basic necessities in our life, like rice, sugar, coffee, salt, oil, veges, fish, washing stuff and can foods, a few worker chief, mostly from union, started to buy stuff in bulk and therefore can sell at a cheaper price to the worker, and as year goes by, all these chiefs become millionaires till today NTUC cooperative fairprice.</p>
              <p>If Taxi is to start cooperative, it should start to help cabbies, the lower income, and the old, someone must be the chief, and order must be place from overseas or locally to get foods and stuffs in bulk, there need to be a warehouse to hold all these, delivery pick up and also shops all over singapore for these people to get easier access, it can be done if proper system and management are put in place.</p>
