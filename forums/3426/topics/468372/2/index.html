              <p>most diesel engines best efficiency run at 92 ~ 96 oC</p>
              <p>its not so much of the air but the cooling of the engine and fuel as diesel expands 1%  at every about 12 oC.</p>
              <p>there are about 3 ~ 5 times fuel supplied to the pump then required consumption. the suplus fuel is to cool the fuel sysytem.</p>

              <p><br>My chief, engine is not just about fuel usage, of course good fuel will enhance the performance of the engine due to their extensive research and cost in making it.</p>
              <p>Engine also hv to look at the engine oil, the wear and tear replacement, timming, exhaust system, cooling system , fuel system and more importantly the operator using it, which is the driver. If the driver drive like shit, even a roll royce engine also become generator for 7th month ghost festival dinner.</p>

              <p>Let me give u an example,</p>
              <p>The piston rings are worn (make of hard material), the liner (cylinder make of cast iron) is oversized, in between the clearance is 1.0mm, so every cylinders will have fuel escape in between the rings and liner (cylinder) wall, and that is call fuel wastage.</p>
              <p>So, no matter how you clean or put better diesel or change engine oil also no use, you will find the same problem happening, high consumption of fuel, yet no power because of the leakage.</p>
              <p>And then the mechanic removed the piston (upper engine removed), he never measure the cylinder, replace new piston rings, about 3 to 4 rings for one piston depend to type of engine, put it back, however, there is still a leakage due to liner (cylinder worn), and that new rings can only reduce the leakage maybe by 0.5mm, and still leaking, still you find high consumption, tho not as much as before.</p>
              <p>What mechanic should do is measure the liner (cylinder bore), mannual hone it, replace the piston ring with the next available oversize one so as to reduce the clearance to 0.05mm, that is 5 micron.</p>
              <p>And then you see a high performances with less fuel consumption</p>

              <p>But does our ah tiong and ahmad mechanic do all these?? they think of sing dollars more than the engine, to be a true engineer, you need to love engine and get the satisfaction of it when it start to run smooth and powerful again, just like TD durian job will satisfy any TD.</p>
              <p>And now you know why some mechanic are so good, they never talk about price, they never want to be wearing clean shirt and nice shining shoes, once you walk in only, they will ask what is the problem, on engine, heard sound..until you ask how much, then he will discuss about it, these are good mechanics because they love engine, love to touch and make them good.</p>
              <p>If you go in a car repair shop and the first talk from the mechanic is about money, you can move to the next shop, however sad to say, good mechanics are at it extinct, like good engineers, most nowaday care more of their pocket ( which is right) then their profession.</p>

              <p>there is no clearance between the rings n the liners . the rings gaps are the thermal expansion. using thumb rule for the gap is 0.1mm for every 25mm.</p>
              <p>1 way to reuse liners is to hone them (zig zag fine lines on liners) wen wear is within acceptable limit . leakage maybe from valves n power loss from incorrect injection timing.</p>
              <p>0.05 mm is 50 microns</p>
