              In fact this Peter is more sotong than sotong.in tonite shin ming sow his handsome face inside the MUSSY taxi,I will not take his cab when arrive.can he concentrate driving w so much things on the sash board and also hanging to block his view.
              
              maybe he try to get a free adverstiment &amp; exposure of himself on the papers from ST ,to all chinese papers.

              at the moment (as reported in chinese papers) pertaining to Peter's complaints,taxi company can only blacklist the no show pax on call.
              
              Pax no problem one.just use another HP.problem solved for them.
              question is how many HP nr or residental tel nr can the taxi company blacklist ?

              <p>I don’t suffer fools gladly so I generally keep conversations with people like Mr Peter Lim and his ilk to a minimum.</p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p>But my advice to taxi drivers in general and Mr Lim in particular is this:</p>
              <p>Stop your whining.</p>
              <p>IF YOU CAN’T STAND THE HEAT, GET THE HELL OUT OF THE KITCHEN!!!</p>
              <p>Don’t forget taxi drivers are service providers, and dealing with passengers of all kinds comes with the job.</p>
              <p>Even idiots who failed PSLE know that “the customer is always right.”</p>
              <p>Last I checked, nobody has put a gun to your head to force you to drive a cab. So get over it.</p>

              <p>5 min is my standard waiting time. Maybe got allowance 2-5 mins, also under special circumstances.</p>
              <p>To play safe I never take calls that start at 545, 550 or 555am. This one all standard, pax will come at 6 am. They know 6 am very hard to find cab, so they ask 5-10min earlier, knowing most drivers come all the way, will wait.</p>
              <p>No call never die. How you think our predecessors survive? You think they cared so much about calls.</p>

              <p>I just take whatever that suit me, never bother about time and all these charges, even 6 am picking people at CQ and BQ also take, you call these pple wait till 6am then take or 550am then call as cheapo, I do call them cheapo, but I take it as human nature, if it is us, we might do the same, everyone wants to pay less and get more, no one will be sensible to pay more and get less.</p>

              <p><br>The farking problem is, 5.30 call, you reach 5.25, you see one taxi went out with paxs, knn, as smart as you are,  you sense a no show on the way, you call out, unsuccessful, you call pax direct, finally he pick up, pax tell you sorry, he is in hurry, apologised, you knn fed up, what can you do?, lan lan hang up.</p>
              <p> Infront, one ang mo couple waved at you going to AP.</p>
              <p>On the road, many other cabs, if you do not take, that is it, durian gone infront of you, you called call centre to tell them pax no show, call centre tell you must call out and then press no show, but call out unsuccessful, and you cannot afford to wait another minute, because if you are going to pick up the front couple, you are still on call, end up the couples took another taxi.</p>
              <p>From here you see that one no show can really mess up our driving mod, cdg MDT, fark lah.</p>
