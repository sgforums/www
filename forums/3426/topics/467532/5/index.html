              <p>Oei..... I OMO for almost 4 months liao leh...... Still alive leh....... </p>
              <p>But I choose to learn it the hard way..... Sign on Silver...... Virtually no calls one..... just sweep..... </p>
              <p>4 months on.... I am more or less OK, income consistent..... pple say OBK day, but my income still maintain the same........</p>
              <p>Today is OBK day, I started at 6pm, lots of taxis but no pax in the evening, then I remembered someone told me, now end of the month.... So quickly change strategy, hunt for tourist instead.... go tourist spot, town, airport, casino..... end up, in 8 hours, hit target, keep car...... Called Ahlim around 11pm, he already at home watching youtube videos.....knn, sibeh slack......</p>
              <p>TS, I also quite polite to pax, but when meet with nasty or bad pax, u have to show them who's boss.....</p>
              <p>My trick is ask pax location and direction at the start of journey, tell them sorry, I am not sure of the location, if you know the way, please guide me, if not can I use GPS? So far pax can understand and are ok....</p>
              <p>You have to try and relax and enjoy the driving. If you everyday before even walk to the car feel stress and worried, you will end up having a bad day. </p>

              <p>Yes...I am small size and some passengers commented that I look too nice and too polite to be a cabby :( but it help with the tips...I think I got the can makan face and my road knowledge is very limited. I don't even know how to get the Geylang?!??! I rarely go out when I am not a cabby.</p>
              <p>Road sweeping this couple of days, I learn quite a number of new road and routes..I am still afraid to take call. I have yet to take any calls. I am worried that I might not make it to the pickup point in time.</p>
              <p>Most passengers are ok and most are respectful. Just that my 1st day really bump into all the NONO pax.</p>
              <p>Pior to being a cabby, I have always thought it was a easy job but alas...I cannot help but emphasis that newbie should NEVER start out OMO now.</p>
              <p>I spend some time at petrol kiosk talking to laojiao...learn some trick from them.</p>
              <p>Today, coming out of Fullerton Hotel, I did not lock my door..as I am going to exit from Fullerton Sq...group of indian tourist just jumped into my cab. LTA enforcement officer were there and took a couple of pics :( I also don't know why..Fullerton Sq is not on the list of no pickup road.</p>

              <p><br>TD is not a job that you need to have a cut of it to be, it is a job of not much choice in the open market that one become a TD, a job that demand In first, Talk later concept.</p>
              <p>What make one a TD is alway base on one history of his or her personal career, very unlikely you will find a cabby with taxi driving as his only job since 30yo, it is alway from different background of life that takes one to walk the road of becoming a TD.</p>
              <p>Nobody is cut to be a TD, most are make or conditoned by the social, political and economy aspects to be one.</p>
              <p>For me, TS is simply immature to anything, not only taxi driving</p>

              <p><br>No leh ..... i've got more friends than before i drove a cab . Good quality friends .</p>
              <p>While working for someone else , those friends cannot make it one , inferior quality , cmi one ..... follow that working path , for me , it's a dark zone .</p>
              <p>I got more respect from people after i drove a cab .</p>
              <p>I am a better person after i drove a cab .</p>
              <p>I am slightly richer driving a cab than working for someone else .</p>
              <p>I never had bills problems driving a cab , i had tonnes of them before i drove a cab .</p>
              <p>And that is important ........ i know many in Sgp have got tonnes of bills need to wait for pay day to pay , we need that meh ?</p>
              <p>My knowledge is richer after i drove a cab , i am open to more opportunities than i have before i drove a cab .</p>
              <p>That sort of knowledge and if got opprtunities , no money can buy one .</p>
