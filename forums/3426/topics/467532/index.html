              <p>Good first experience.</p>
              <p>Now you know this kind of cb pattern, nothing honourable about them when they don't even tell you meter not on. End of trip they say need go atm withdraw, will you believe?</p>
              <p>Its ok forget on meter, it will happen. For the first week. After that you better develop habit of eye go meter every now and then.</p>
              <p>But you garang, choose peak hour start.</p>
              <p>First time I took pax at 3 plus afternoon. Tot can get short first trip from senoko area.</p>
              <p>End up go Tampines....</p>

              <p>Sonata is meant for light footer drivers, many TD always can't get use to it at the start because they drove Crown donkey years liao, which need to accelerate harder.......</p>
              <p>All type of vehicle is the same, sure got blind spot, not just sonata alone, adjust your seat properly, try to look at rear mirror more often, not to look at chio bu sitting behind hor, I rely on rear mirror a lot, get those wide angle mirror, si beh good.......</p>
              <p>Those side mirror are meant for parking purposes, to check rear tyre, if your seating position is not right, put 10 side mirror will still tio blind spot.........</p>
              <p>Than SSDC instructors teach us must turn our head to check blind spot mah........</p>
              <p>For me, 3 years driving sonata, smlj accidents also happen before, due to CDG call volume, knn, this vehicle piak calls si beh good, no horse to run........</p>
              <p>Anyway, good luck to TS, virgin drive is like that 1 la, either forget this or forget that, want to become TD, must really see open, take those negative comments as farking lor........</p>

              <p>I got my first fare evasion yesterday..this guy took my cab and when reached his destination told me he has no $ to pay me..I did not lose much so just told him to get off.</p>

              <p>I told her I am a new driver, I do not know the best way to Geylang and if she could show me her best route. She start raging and raging so I told her I can send her to somewhere else FOC to get another cab or I can use my GPS...she refused and grungingly directed me.</p>
              <p>On the cab, she called her friend to complain in her broken english (before that, she asked me if I could speak English). OTW, since she is talking on the phone and I do not want to go the wrong way, I keyed in Geylang in my GPS at the traffic light.

              <p>I think it is not right for customer to throw fare at our face, tho new, you hv to stand by your dignity and intergrity, it is good to tell pax that you are new and do not know the road, option is he or she guide you or that allow you to use your GPS, do it on the spot before pressing the meter, if she start scolding, logically tell her that you have not start the meter. If she is not happy, can get off.</p>
              <p>Many I know do keying at traffic lights and on the way, this I would say is very dangerous, once a pax on board, the mind goes into window core 5 start up,</p>
              <p>core 1, the pax, core 2, the meter, core 3 the GPS, Core 4, the road, core 5, the place,</p>
              <p> When these start to boot at the same time, you go blur,  understand that it is very taxing, </p>
              <p>Suggestion is think each at a time, first, the pax, greet and ask them the destination, tell them you are new and need to do this and that, once agreed, on meter, then after GPS or be guided, then move out, the road condition, then follow by the place (destination) coming into your mind.</p>
              <p>Guided by pax is good if pax knows the way, if pax is also those blur blur type which they have the right to be, then you may also get into wrong way and get scolded, because some pax dun tell you to keep right or left</p>

              <p>Pax scolding if reasonably is fine, but to insult and throw this and that is a violation of our intergrity. New or old, we have to hold our dignity and not get abuse and taken as a punching bags for some of this cheapo pax.</p>
              <p>Last week, one ang mo pick up at peninsular, destinaton Tanjong rhu, lim peh take the usual victoria toward ophir and use the ECP into fort, told him about it, he said ok ok but busy with his ipad, then jammed at bugis, he start scold this and that, why not use marina, why not use beach road, into nickol...and so on. Only one word struck my brain chord, he said, you try to CHEAT me and bring me into a jam.</p>
              <p>Limpeh jam brake at middle of bugis pedestrian crossing, go down and open front bonnet said, taxi got problem, please get out. He said fark this and that, I just on both signal lights, go one side buy kopi liao, want to get out or not is his problem.</p>
