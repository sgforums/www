              <p>Yes..I have not enough sleep.</p>
              <p>Was very discouraged after the lady threw the money in my face.
              I have done nothing to deserve..while I may not know the route
              well, I did put up with her insult and scolding all thru the
              ride..I even gave her a big discount.</p>
              <p>I did not drive yesterday..I threw the rental to recharge myself
              and gather my thought.</p>
              <p>I might have been too nice. I am shy by nature and
              non-confrontation..this will have to change..</p>
              <p>I have served people from the high society but Taxi pax are a
              difference bleed..they really don't treat us as human..</p>
              <p>I wanted to be a nice taxi driver...treat my pax as I treat my

              <p>Bro being Nice is okay ... But also must see Pax ...Some KNNBCCB type return the favour. IMO TD sometimes must be Thicked Skinned ( macham Armour to protect U)</p>
              <p>If Pax not happy bo pian just move on ( u'll probable never see the pax again)</p>
              <p>After driving a while u'll learn to read the pax flaging you and you will know what to expect.</p>
              <p>Take it as a learning curve and as Khoon mentioned you can not drive alone...</p>
