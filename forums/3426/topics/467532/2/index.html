              <p>Thank you Sifus for the advises...</p>
              <p>I will be going down to pick up the round mirror later.</p>
              <p>There are some very nice customers and REALLY nasty one. I gave
              quite a lot of discount and got quite a bit of tips as well.</p>
              <p>I got my first fare evasion yesterday..this guy took my cab and
              when reached his destination told me he has no $ to pay me..I did
              not lose much so just told him to get off.</p>
              <p>But the worst is this..I have the busy sign on and wanted to go
              home and rest. Saw this lady flagging fantically so out of
              compassion, stopped for her..I say hello, she threw me a black face
              and just shouted out Geylang.</p>
              <p>I told her I am a new driver, I do not know the best way to
              Geylang and if she could show me her best route. She start raging
              and raging so I told her I can send her to somewhere else FOC to
              get another cab or I can use my GPS...she refused and grungingly
              directed me.</p>
              <p>On the cab, she called her friend to complain in her broken
              english (before that, she asked me if I could speak English). OTW,
              since she is talking on the phone and I do not want to go the wrong
              way, I keyed in Geylang in my GPS at the traffic light. She started
              screaming again, don't play with computer..can you concentrate on
              the road.</p>
              <p>When reached the destination, she threw the fare in my face
              :(</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today..take a rest...program GPS..print out notes on major
              places..just throw rental...take a drive with SO (when she off I
              off) around...</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Everyday you free at home browse the streetdirectory map. Review the routes you take. Take a look at the HDB estate and try to find out the pattern. Every estate got a pattern one. For ex Woodlands, a big town, very easy to navigate around. Put causeway point in the middle. Marsiling MRT side all older estate if pax says Woodlands St XX confirm that side less St 8X which is opposite RP. Admiralty MRT side newer estate all have Drive XX. Also very easy. For example Drive 71, 72, 73 all is off Ave 7. Drive 14, 16 off Ave 1. Like that loh. Most town if is St 31 then is Blk 3XX this one is confirm one. SK also easy Rivervale 1XX Compassvale 2XX Anchorvale 3XX Fernvale 4XX...slowly learn one estate at at time in no time you will master all the HDB estate.</p>

              <p>What ever it is, let put respect one side, TD is a job to ferry people from A to B, or C to D, that's all, once you accomplished the journey, take the fares, say thank you and bye bye. Respect on the other hands need to be earn, and it must be a reciprocating ones, if one do not respect your existence, why should you respect him or her.</p>
              <p>If pax takes TD as part of an accesories of a Taxis, then we will take pax as a goods to be deliver and not as human. There is no need for strong mentality or attitudes, those are for extremely stress people who earn a pay much higher than us, with a pathetic 2 to 3k per month, knn, need to be strong meh??

              <p>Skoda is one of the worst selling car in singapore market, and if you ask any 2nd hand dealer, they will tell you that his or her skoda can hardly sell even when all other cars are sold.</p>
              <p>It 2.0 Turbo is same par with VW Polo and jetta which is only 1.4 TSI. And I believe Premier next so called limo will be a VW</p>

              <p><br>Well, there is still time to throw key back without any obligation, I got a friend who half day only, give up liao.</p>
              <p>Therefore, not everyone can take up a TD jobs, some took it hard one because of no other choices left, some too youngs to understand that working is better and choose to drive taxis because of freedom and relaxing timing with own time own target, and in long run, lost all discipline in a corporate world which ultimately rendered them unable to return to the workforce.</p>
              <p>It is good that you find it hard now then later, as I have alway encourage people, tho as a TD myself and wanted more youngs in this trade before FT set in, if got better opportunity, throw key.</p>
