              <p>thats where the golden qns, "Do you have a preferred route" comes into use. Anyway the trainer will always stress all the routes at training is purely for reference, the main purpose it to make us remember the landmarks around the key areas</p>

              <p>There is another rule you must learn, which I believe is the same for any job.</p>
              <p>That rule: Discretion, or as Malay say: pakai akal. When and how you use it, depends on circumstances.</p>
              <p>Not everything learnt on paper is practical, similarly not everything learnt on paper is useless.</p>
              <p>There is a reason you are taught certain things, be it routes, landmarks, rules and regulations. And it's definitely not a bad thing to follow them, but as with all things you must do what's practical at the material time.</p>
              <p>An example: We are taught to cross roads at pedestrians crossings (within 50m), and only when the green man comes on and not at the flickering, unless already half-way through. (At least that's what they taught me in school).  This is a good rule, but is it always practical?</p>
              <p>You want to catch a bus at a bus-stop opposite to where you're standing, but you are 40 metres away from a crossing? What do you do in a practical sense?</p>
              <p>Whatever answer you give, will also be able to answer the question you have posed at the beginning.</p>

              <p>Agree, as the pax is the one that will be paying not STA. Cos in real life there is really a lot of ways to some solution and thus it applies to TD too. </p>
              <p>Passenger will alway be the best reference to their route but not 100 percentage cos sometimes TD (esp the lao jiao one) knows even more better route than them.</p>
              <p>Thus, in the end, the most importantly is to ensure safety and delivery our good service to them will be our basic task. Whether shortcut or not, passenger will be first to decide and TD to follow if understand or else ask as they will guide you most of the time..</p>

              <p>Paxes always want cheaper route , shorter route , fastest route , correct ?</p>
              <p>But where got such thing 100% that way in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Explained to them , cheaper doesn't mean shorter or faster .</p>

              <p>Shorter + Faster maybe yes , but involve ERP ? Can they accept ?</p>

              sometimes u take the side road which is shorter,they question u why not take highway which is faster(becos no traffic lights).
              
              then at times when take highways ,they ask why take highways which is longer(but  that is faster they are not aware becos free of traffic lights)
              
              THEN AT TIMES U TAKE THE ROUTE MOST PAX TAKE,THEY SHOUTED WHY NOT HIGHWAYS OR THE ORTHER ROUTE.
              
              BEST IS PAX ON BOARD TELL TD WHICH ROUTE VIA CERTAIN ROADS,SO NO HEATED ARGUMENTS LATER.

              <p>remember, you may know something taking a different route than normal . pax may not know, so of course first thing in mind is ask you why, so you either explain to them for them to understand and appreciate.</p>
              <p>but like i say, always have clear understanding on the route taking pax to at the start of the journey, so any misunderstanding can be avoid</p>
