              <p class="style3">Since the set up of the telemarketing centre at SAVH, many visually handicapped telemarketers have been trained and were given another avenue for employment, to lead more independent lives.</p>
              <p class="style3">The telemarketers are employed by companies to market various products ranging from printing services, insurance to selling cleaning services. They also receive on-going training at the call centre. Training workshops are organized on a regular basis to refresh their skills.</p>
              <p>The centre is equip with accessibilty features that is different from the other call centers in Singapore. Each station is specially equipped with assistive technology to assist the telemarketers in their daily tasks. For example, each computer is fitted with screen reader software and a voice synthesizer to enable the visually handicapped telemarketer to type in their reports at the end of the day, to be faxed or emailed to their respective employers. All the telemarketers are required to have computer skills in Microsoft Word, Excel, Email and Internet skills.</p>
              <p><span class="style3">Our telemarketers work from 8 am to 5pm.

              <p>come on lar. Its already very difficult to find a job in Singapore even without disabilities. Unless you are young, beautiful or handsome. Dont believe me? Just try applying for a job yourself. I am reasonably certain most if not all of the jobs posted at <a href="http://www.careers.gov.sg">http://www.careers.gov.sg</a> are kelong one. The one who posted jobs there already know who they intend to hire and from which department. Same for <a href="http://www.gebiz.gov.sg">http://www.gebiz.gov.sg</a> almost all the tenders posted here are kelong one. The person who posted this customized the tender with a particular supplier in mind. It is all a wayang, to show the public that singapore got many jobs and business opportunities on offer. Actually hor, there is almost none. You may think ok lor. I try a $1000 job since so difficult. Chances are, they will also reject you because they are targetting young people again. If you are old enough to drive a taxi, you are already too old for even a $1000 job, thats if can accept this pay. Once again, if u dont believe me, just try lor. Between an uncle and a youngster, who u think they will hire, even if the pay is $1000/month?</p>
              <p>So please dont be so cruel to disabled people. Because life here for the normal folks is already very hard.</p>

              <p>Hi all bros here tkns for the advice. Actually I even went for the seminar tt SAVH held few months ago. I was greatly impress with the technology their director develop esp for the visually hanicapped. I firmly believe that these ppl are in fact far more better workers then we normal ppl like wat Poolman &amp; F1 say bcos they appreciate the job then most ho ka ho jiu ppl. The only hitch is that they are more suitable to do outbound job - meaning making calls (eg telemarketing) as they do not require to see much as the numbers to call can be programmed into the system and they just nid to press a button. But for my company, we are not doing telemarketing, we are an inbound call centre- meaning we take calls then do whatever is necessary like transferring to another line or dispatching the case to engineers. So it is not possible to tk in these ppl.  At these present point in time I am nt even able to tk in those wif mobile disability. Bt in the future I hope we can. So bros &amp; sis here. do help me to ask ard. Thanks again <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>To Pedo:  do not treat tis as welfare cos these ppl are making an honest living like us too. we are blessed with a healthy body so let's try our best to help those less blessed. I assure you they can do the job better then some of us with all senses intact. </p>

              <p>The middle age folks can make a similar amount as a cleaner, or at McDonalds or at NTUC (also got CPF mah). Most of the middle age folks whom u might be interested in probably do not like meeting or talking to people much. Targeting youths is also difficult, since the good talkers will certainly do sales jobs with potentially more pay. I suggest u drop the racial preference, as in dont even mention it, to widen your pool.</p>
