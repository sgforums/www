              <p>Thurs nite when I sent a local lady to ION from Springbloom condo (end of serangoon ave 3 near to Lor Chuan), when I turned left to Lor Chuan at the junction, she asked: "where are you going? no body turn this way, its that way (pointing behind). I replied: "ok. I will U-turn and go yr way. I thot this way lead to CTE faster at this hour." she insist: "no body go that way." So I went by AMK ave 3 way to CTE instead. </p>
              <p>check my map and cfm that its a longer way. We usually use this way only in morning rush hour becos the exit at CTE is very slow.</p>
              <p>When I drove pass CTE Lor Chuan junc, I pointed and show her:" just now my way will come out from here... which is faster and shorter."</p>
              <p>She silent..</p>
              <p>reaching ION, $12.10. She gave me $12 and "Receipt!". I replied pls pay the full fare before I give any receipt. She angry: "just now you turn wrong way what.."</p>
              <p>"I didn't" replied me and shoe her my handphone map. "10 cents more pls."</p>
              <p>She gave the 10 cents, took the receipt and said: "I will write an e-mail to yr co."</p>
              <p>I smiled at her...</p>
              <p>She must be pissed off with my idiot face. Never know this old man like that one.</p>

              <p>another few tactics &amp; deterrence which I invented myself are:</p>
              <p>1) by placing a sticker at my MDT..."It is an offence to abuse taxi driver or deny fare."</p>
              <p>2) I also placed a long wooden stick at the right side of my seat. Part of it jutting out at the rear so that pax sitting at the reat can see..</p>
              <p>3) I also always ask those single male pax to sit at the left hand rear seat instead of sitting behind me.</p>
              <p>4) hidden cam</p>

If they want to be her just tell them to pay up. Normally I dun wait for police to come, if drunk pax dun pay, I drive to nearest police station. If pax not enough money, tell them to leave their identity or get someone to bring money down. Solve the problem using common sense.
