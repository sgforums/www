              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">$3,000 salary on offer but still no takers for dishwashing jobs</span><br> Dishwashing jobs are tougher than it seems.<br> The Straits Times - September 13, 2012 <br> By: Maria Almenoar And Aaron Low<br> <br> PHOTO: SPH<br> THE job pays a monthly salary of $3,000 but those who take up dishwashing quit soon after they discover how tough it can be.<br> <br> This is the observation of Sakae Sushi chief Douglas Foo, who said his 
              restaurant chain's advertisement on social-networking site Facebook for 
              dishwashers, with the pay highlighted, is not a marketing gimmick.<br> <br> The company has about 30 dishwashers who earn this sum. <span style="color: #ff0000;">They work nine 
              hours a day, six days a week. Their monthly wage is what Sakae Sushi 
              also pays managers and supervisors.</span><br> <br> Although <span style="color: #ff0000;">they are given medical benefits and annual leave</span>, Mr Foo admits
               that there is little chance of promotion for dishwashers, as each 
              outlet requires only one or two such staff.<br> <br> "Yes, the salary is high but look, it's a tough job. You stand on your 
              feet, work weekends and it's dirty and wet. Our crew earn less but they 
              get a chance to move up or move out. Most dishwashers don't," he noted.<br> <br> Mr Foo said he is looking for Singaporeans and permanent residents. "If 
              we can hire a local guy, why not? I'd rather we do this than rely on a 
              foreigner."<br> <br> At $3,000 a month, dishwashers at Sakae Sushi - who first wash dishes by
               hand before stacking them into mechanical washers - earn about three 
              times what their counterparts elsewhere get.<br></p>

              <p><br>I believe it will be all within the framework of the employment act minimum requirement of medical benefit and leaves etc etc, furthermore, there will also be a CPF contribution which employers have to pay another 16% of his salary into CPF.

              <p>There could also be profit sharing bonuses, not bad, and if he rest on sunday, can take up 1/2 shift relief on sunday to earn a few extra, perhap then, at the end of the day, he could take home 3++K net.</p>

              <p>I think we shouldn't be surprise by such paid, because we had been depressed with a pathetic pay and in long run, this sound so good to us, and btw, this is still very much lesser than working in the west.</p>
              <p>And to round it up, this pay really send a message down to all employers, like telling them hey, if you are pay 800 for a dishwasher, something is wrong. It is about time, that we, as Singaporeans get paid better for our work done, it is really nonsensical to pay people less than 2k in today context.</p>

              <p>On the contrary, I agree with you entirely.</p>
              <p>Look right up to 2007-2008, I had no real objections with the influx of FT.</p>
              <p>Every country that grows economically has needed the FT to supplement their work force, to create jobs, to bosst the economy etc etc.</p>
              <p>But what many 1st world countries have done is manage it properly and allow in FT in sectors in the workforce that requires them. Every such country has laid down ground rules for employers going that route to hire foreigners in areas where the local workforce cannot manage it on its' own. No such country has used this policy to replace or remove local workers in jobs that have been the bread and butter for its' citizens.</p>
              <p>I have written on this many times, so no need to go into it in detail again. But just let me give you a snapshot of my argument.</p>
              <p>In the late 90s, finding a temporary job would give a salary of around $4-5 an hour. The market dictates this. By 2003-2004, this has gone up with rising costs to around $6-7 an hour.</p>
              <p>Like someone wrote, I have also dabbled in dishwashing. Yes, I know what the job scope and requirements are. It's not easy, the hours fixed and you cannot easily take leave etc. I also had a contract with 2-3 restaurants (Chinese) to supply workers. Those days not so easy to find locals, because the timing sucks, you come in at 10am or 1030 and work til 2 or 3 pm, break and restart at 6pm until 11pm. </p>
              <p>Yet I was still able to pay my workers a starting salary of $1000 (depending on how busy the restaurants were) and increased it to $1200 and some cases $1500.  And these workers were Indian nationals, yet I paid them the market rates, not some cheap wages like $700-$800., even though when converted it was still a good salary for them.</p>
              <p>Then what happened in 2004 onwards? The govt opened the floodgates and started to allow companies to bring in workers across the board. What happened next?</p>
              <p>Salaries across the board went down. Try finding a temp job that pays you $7 an hour, it's very vey tough. Salaries have gone back down to $4-$5 just like the 90s.</p>
              <p>Drivers used to earn $1500 and upwards right up to 2004. Try finding one now, that allows you to work 5-6 days and overtime (1.5 rate), you can clock $1800 and above. If a driver can find a job at $1200 now, it's considered very good. But you have to work 6 days, maybe more than 9 hours and overtime on your off day then only can see $1500.</p>
              <p>Is this a sector that needs foreign workers?</p>
              <p>I am all for FT in hotels (guest services), hospitals (nurses), maybe production, but not in every sector. They bring down wages and push out locals from much needed jobs. I have driven in the 90s, when the population was much lesser, yet taxi drivers then could still survive without the influx of foreigners. Why? because locals had good paying jobs, and they could easily afford to take a cab to work.</p>
              <p>Those days before driving, I can't remember how many times, I took a bus, everywhere go, I take a cab. Why because the salary made it possible.</p>
              <p>So today locals take cabs less, because they can't afford it. If they could they would. After all who wants to take a bus/train journey after a tiring day at work or when going out, when you can afford a cab, much quicker, in comfort and not having to share with numerous people.</p>
              <p>Taxi driving will always have pax, in a good economy, even without foreigners.</p>

              <p>its true that we need FT, due to our ageing and low birth rates, but then the sytem imploded that every jobs now, will compete with locals for jobs.</p>
              <p>the government should query and look into those companies that hire FT, to prove that they are unable to hire locals. fair enough, if they put up advertisement and still cant hire locals, but to open up every jobs to FT and compete with our unemployed, underemployed and fresh grads will cause the locals unhappiness.</p>
              <p>supposing you are a fresh grad and cant look for a job because FT is also competing with you for the job with lower pay than you. how can a fresh grad compete with a FT with a low pay of 1.6-1.8k?</p>
