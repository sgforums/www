              <p>I'm afraid it's not so simple if the case goes to court or if insurance or other party contests. If no contest, the other party and insurance admit liability, well and good.</p>
              <p>But in court, no such thing as 100% right. Even if you have right of way, and a cyclist suddenly comes from the kerb into your path and you hit, also unlikely, the court will let you off scot free. You might be found 10%, 20% or more % liable. What speed were you travelling, what happen before the incident, so many thinsg can come into play.</p>
              <p>In this case, although unlikely, the woman may say that she was already ahead of the cab but hammer purposely accelerated and then braked to make it look that way.  Don't forget TP only does arm-chair investigations most of the time, they got no time to delve deeper, issue summons and let the insurance fight it out. Still cannot agree, go to court and settle. And going to court is never clear cut.</p>
              <p>If you can avoid an accident, you must, when you can but purposely don't want to, you are putting yourself at risk, 1 way or the other. Of course if really couldn't stop, then no choice, that's why it's called an accident, not an act done on purpose.</p>

              <p><br>If camera is not approved by Cdg, hammer will get another problem, illegal modification of vehicle.</p>
              <p>As per JR, I agreed with him, now you see, now you dun, things are different in court, each will want fight for their own interest, who want to loose money?? if can save here and there, why not, just a matter of speech and deny, the rules can change.</p>
              <p>What ever happen, day in day out we see so much of this cases, cut in, cut out, sudden brake infront, sudden turning without signal, cut from 3 lanes, and whatever you can find OTR. As a taxi driver, I do admit I make some dangerous mistake out of no intention, just last nite, filtering out on the right, see no upcoming vehicle, moved out, but suddenly there was a car who U turned which I missed, jam the brake and get fingered, but lucky never hit. Lesson learned and drive on.</p>

              <p>Few years ago, I had a motorbike accident, I was riding my honda or a clear saturday afternoon, traffic light was green, I went on, suddenly a car turn left from the junction without looking for incoming traffic, knocked my bike, I flung about 10 meter away, get bruises on my palm and arms, lucky for legs, only my jean was torn, without it, it could be my skin against the road.</p>
              <p>The guy drive a honda civic, apologised to me, helped me up and called the ambalance and police, we exchanged ID, took pictures with Hp, my bike was towed away, I called my insurance, they noted and I was given 3 days medical leaves. A week later, TP called me up at Ubi for statement and legal proceeding,</p>
              <p>When I went into the office, the TP officer talk very nice to me, asked me if I am ok, I thought it was a normal proceeding of making a short statement, the shock I get was, I was charged for beating the red light and causing dangerous to other due to my action, my insurance co is withholding all repair till further notice, I hv the right to get witness and lawyer to fight for it.</p>
              <p>I told the office, that guy apologised to me, he said he was wrong, he acknowledge in front of the police that it his mistake, he turned without a look out for coming traffic, I am a victim of his negligence driving. The office said, he and his lawyer statement given was, it was a red light with green arrow for turning, you will driving at a fast speed, and luckily he brake in time, if not you could be in more serious condition.</p>
              <p>So, you see the change of statement?</p>
