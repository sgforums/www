              <p>Once, I happen to pick up  a NTS indian at MBS who gambled overnite, he won $16,000. Called me Mama, sat in front, then ask to go mustafa, want to buy electronic stuff, from iphones to ipads to keep, cos he said he may lose all the cash again, asked me to wait for him 1/2 hr, later send him back to Jurong. I tell him, leave permit or bag behind, he grab two 50 dollars from a plastic bag, pass it to me. After 45minutes, still never turn up, I move off with the hundred dollar, that was quite sometime ago. He is about 20+, wonder if that indian drown at Bedok reservoir got anything to do with him.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, I also met with singapore aunty at MBS having lost until left $15 and ask to go Eunos crescent, peak period. Uncle $15, eunos can or not?</p>
              <p>I agree that we may see 100 or 50 as big sum, but to some, it just peanut, especially those british using pounds, and what is 100 sing dollar today, Sunday go out with family also not enough.</p>
