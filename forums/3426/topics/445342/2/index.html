              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Very sad but true, Comfort today is not what it was in the 80s
              or 90s. Too many young fucks joined them in management level, or
              those who retire from civil service. They only look at their
              corporate image and come up with plenty of ideas to maximise
              Comfort profits. The welfare or success of their drivers is
              secondary, if their plans also when implemented benefits the
              drivers, then they crow and give all kinds of positive statements
              in the press. If the plans only benefit them, they just act blur,
              the staff who implement take all the credit and come up with all
              sorts of facts and figures to back up their claim.</p>
              <p>Yes, I accept in a service oriented industry, the customer has
              to be given the best options and also to make it cost effective for
              the customer. But it's a fallacy to assume the customer is always a
              reigning King. The customer can only be a King like the Agong,
              given certain rights, expectations and benefits, but only up to a
              point and never at your own staff's expense. In this case we are
              the staff (or representatives) of Comfort.  Comfort must first
              treat and motivate it's reps with respect and dignity, because
              failure to do so will never benefit the customer.</p>
              <p>I sometimes feel a bit sorry for the paying public, they (a
              majority) just want to pay for a simple service ferrying them from
              Point A to B. But because organisations like these and the rule
              makers go about making life difficult for drivers with rules more
              in tuned to a military service than customer service, drivers are
              forced to become selfish to ensure they have enough to provide for
              themselves and their families first, before considering the plight
              of the customer. In short drivers are forced to choose the easier
              but selfish way, or be selfless, bear an unnecesarry burden and
              make life difficult for their themselves and their family.</p>
              <p>Their whole call booking system mirrors this exactly, be it
              current, advance or pick-ups. Their vision is to capture as much of
              the the call booking market as possible, thus ensuring with
              quantity, profit is likely to increase. To do it, they implement
              ideas like I-phone booking and others, so the public is led to
              believe that Comfort is the best choice of it's fleet size and easy
              to use system.</p>
              <p>But drivers are left in limbo, playing a guessing or lottery
              game, with only peanuts on offer. Thus drivers have to react
              negatively and not place trust in their system. This negativity in
              the end will affect the customer, who won't get a cab, must wait
              and pay more.</p>
              <p>Of course they are still many Comfort drivers (especially the
              new) who think that Comfort remains the best, and cares for their
              interests, or some who just naively assume so and just cincai take
              whatever is on offer, even if it's disadvantageous to them. Based
              on these people, the Comfort office smart-alecks will derive the
              facts and figures to show their system works. Unfortunately the
              reality on the ground is quite different, but they refuse to see it
              or brush it aside, blaming it on a minority of errant/poor/lazy/bad
              drivers.</p>
              <p>Until these core of pro-Comfort drivers dwindles, then there's
              no reason for Comfort to actually bother changing some systems in
              favour of drivers. Unfortunately also, for every old or experienced
              driver who leaves Comfort or acts firstly for themselves, there's a
              new batch of recruits signing up after being 'persuaded', impressed
              and even 'conned' by their PR, which aggressively pursue new
              graduands of the TDVL.</p>
              <p>(Sorry for the longish post, on holiday mah after quitting from
              my hirer)</p>

              <p>If you wish to learn some excellent examples of taiko trips, just look at the CDG email list, its like an instruction manual. All these advance bookings are the type that cabbies avoid, unless your cab is there and they flag u from roadside.</p>
              <p>So new bird drivers please take a good look, memorise and analyze why.</p>

              <p>Taiko or not, I think taxi is suppose to be a taxi plying on the road, once awhile take a call within 3 to 7 minutes reach, or an advance with an hour or so, those regular pick up should not be in taxi line, we should leave it to other transport people to earn a living, I do not understand why Taxi companies running a taxi business can accept regular jobs, which i feel abit out of their business context.</p>
              <p>Now, if let said all cabbies takes on regular job in the morning rush hours, what will happen on the road??</p>

              <p>Seriously blame it on big mouths outside and online , yea yea taxi ho hua , very good . Create long Qs of demand.</p>
              <p>During the low period , CDG everything can chum siong . Rental can owe 2 weeks and just get courtesy call.</p>
              <p>Enforcement? what enforcement? never heard before until recently.</p>
              <p>I heard if u call CSA and F them up also liable to get warning letter.</p>
              <p>Who create all this? Taxi drivers themselves , dont blame the Taxi cos .</p>
              <p>When you set up a stall selling wan tan mee and the Q is so so long , what do u do? your reply will be ' ai tan mai? pua tiam zheng? correct? 1 customer less never mind , still got many many.</p>
              <p>All thanks to the heroes who go up to papers and talk , come here and talk , go online and blow.</p>
              <p>The best treatment from taxi cos will be when demand is very low , u get treated like VIP.</p>
              <p>I can only say the actions of some has resulted in all taxi drivers being treated like DIRT now.</p>

              <p><br>Debtor is an accounting term, if you do not pay up, it will become bad debts, so if many do not pay up and run off, end of the day, the company will have to write off as bad debts written off with a reason. You cannot write off a hirer (a person) but you can write off bad debt in accounting.</p>
              <p>In the context of a on going concern in any business, money not yet collected is consider a liability in the balance sheet, to get a good balance in their monthly accounting report, they place it as debtor liability that include not only hirers but all other business that have yet to pay up.</p>
