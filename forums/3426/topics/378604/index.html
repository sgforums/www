              Hello all, i am on a personal task to find out the latest taxi information from the major taxi companies so if you have any questions, feel welcomed to raise them here and i'll try to cover them over the next 2weeks. 
              
              The FAQs are to be done slanting towards the cabbies' needs and as a guideline, i'll be covering the most up-to-date issues on rental/benefits from Comfort/Citycab,Transcab and Silvercab. I might cover the rest of the coys later. Help me help us because i just passed my TDVL and i am sure there are stuff which i wouldn't know better unless i am an old bird.
              
              
              P/S: Please try to keep your comments within topic and don't hijack. Forum etiquette mah..

              <p>i mean defensive driving and other types of service-related training..</p>
              <p>i know it's a hard life being a cabbie, but there are a few things which really need improving...</p>
              <p>i know there are a lot of good cabbies out there, and i've been a fare in quite a few.. but there are those who frankly scare me witless...</p>
              <p>i've been in one who took me from Tuas Checkpoint to Clementi Ave 6 in about 10 minutes.. he was going at or over 160km/h at a few points on the AYE.. i'm not kidding... i peeked at the speedometer when i wasn't too petrified to look elsewhere...</p>
              <p>there are way too many who seem to think that everyone must give way to them and cut through traffic dangerously... i've been in one where he cut through 3 lanes on the PIE just like that.. and without indicators or anything.. and was horned at by people who almost hit him... he seemed oblivious to it...</p>
              <p>anyway, those, i hope are the exceptions to the rule.</p>
              <p>as for service-related, cabbies who smoke should not let their cabs smell like a stale ashtray.. a lot of them smoke with their windows down when they are cruising for passengers.. using spray air fresheners only make the air in the cab worse.. the passengers feel nauseated...</p>
              <p>and talking about nausea, is there a way to stop cabbies from stepping, releasing, stepping, releasing, causing the cab to lurch again and again.. this makes passengers feel very sick..</p>
              <p>i think maybe cabbies need to be reminded of these things.. maybe some occasional training will help improve the driving, safety and service levels?</p>

              but ok what u said is about driving.... hmm.... i haven experienced one that drive at 160km/h leh.... 120km/h got lah.... actually u can ask cabby to slow down if you mind... but actually those who drive fast are those more skilled in driving.... it is how they want to drive.... how to teach?
              
              
              for cleanliness, again it is the attitude of cabbies.... not what you teach them..... flag newer cabs loh..... haha

              <p>i still remember because kena stay in office to make sure the "millenium bug" didn't destroy the servers...</p>
              <p>after i submitted all the reports and was stood down, it was around 4am on 1/1/2000.. the streets were empty...</p>
              <p>i guess the cabbie just kept his foot on the accelerator and the cab kept accelerating.. being a straight road, he didn't have to slow down...</p>
              <p>btw.. the step-let go-step-let go.. also kena in the new Hyundai taxis.. and those are automatic transmission vehicles... i guess it's the driver.. which is why i suggested driver training.. sometimes the drivers don't even know they are doing that until you tell them..</p>
              <p>i've told a few and they actually said they didn't know they were doing that.. i guess after many years of driving, it became subconscious.. when they knew their driving improved immediately...</p>
              <p>the cigarette smoke one, hard to combat.. i asked one before.. he said he didn't smoke but the one in the shift before him does.. and he said he wasn't happy about it either and told the guy but the other guy doesn't care..</p>
              <p>but the most scary remains the dangerous driving by a lot of cabbies.. those who think that the road belongs to them when they cut and turn without signalling, or just basically drive dangerously...</p>
              <p>maybe the taxi companies can do some training and cabbies don't just dismiss it... ultimately, being safe not only benefits the passengers, their own safety is also improved..</p>

              Hi, i have some info straight from Transcab hotline.. maybe not exactly new stuff but just thought others would find them useful as a guide.
              
              You could simply call them and give them your particulars so they may put you on their reliefs' list for hirers. 
              
              For relief, its a deposit of $1000 payable by 4 instalments of $250 per month.
              
              For hirer, the deposit is a one-time payment of $1500. 
              
              Though the lady on the phone said that there would not be any ready new vehicles for hirers since the company is still awaiting shipments of their new Toyota Wish. Probably be ready in another 2 or 3mths' time. Its 2.0L version so i think its the facelift version.  For used vehicles, it usually takes less than 2weeks. So any used Wish? i dont know i never ask leh.
              
              Referal fee i also never ask cos she sounds alil pek chek oredi..
