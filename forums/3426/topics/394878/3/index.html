              <p>Absolutely agree!</p>
              <p>Dentistry, Product Design also not bad.</p>
              <p>All the general degrees are useless one! Even look for civil service job also worthless against FT master degrees.</p>
              <p>Best is still to be own boss or flexi. And only taxi driving provides a certain degree of guaranteed income in this sense. Others very iffy.</p>

              <p>Bros here, get degree for what (if u have, its a plus, if u dun have. It not a minus). Do you know studying too much will clog your brain. My way of driving taxi to success :</p>
              <p>1) Drive taxi part time, relief to have a taste of TD life. If suitable for you, then move on. Not all people are made for taxi driving.</p>
              <p>2) Next, drive taxi full time, OMO or relief, depending on your needs, cover your expenses and save $$$$. Must saved $$$ in your bank. Dun smoke too much, dun drink, dun go library. I would recommend relief. No point u drive OMO and ended no time for yourself. You can be a hirer, but get a relief.</p>
              <p>3) Attending crash course in TD in this forum. Ask and ask and ask. Learn and learn and learn. If u dun want to learn, u will never make it as a TD.</p>
              <p>4) Use spare time to look out for lobang to earn residual income, anything from part time business, stock, forex trading, mlm, internet stuff....even or gui tao hehehe</p>
              <p>5) Built up your residual income and when your residual income is comparable to TD, start to drive less taxi, slowly letting go, eg from omo to relief, to super relief.....</p>
              <p>6) When residual income very stable, drive for fun, cos u will miss TD friends from this forum if u dun drive.</p>
              <p>FYI, Residual income mean incomes that continues to generate even when you don't spend the time working on it. Eg, Insurance agent, mlm, real estate rental....etc.</p>
              <p>How many person can drive taxi for lifetime? I always see driving taxi as a stepping stone to financial freedom, not as a career. Residual income is a life-term insurance. One day u go to heaven (touch wood), your families will be taken care of. Not when u driving taxi for lifetime, who will take care of your families.</p>
              <p>For those newbie looking to drive taxi, especially to druss66. TD is not the end of tunnel, it's the beginning of a new life. To see lights at the end of tunnel depends alot on you. You can choose to see light or u can choose to remain in the darkness of tunnel.</p>
              <p>I love driving along KPE, I always love to see lights at the end of tunnel.</p>

              even when you don't spend the time working on it. Eg, Insurance
              agent, mlm, real estate rental....etc.</p>
              <p>How many person can drive taxi for lifetime? I always see
              driving taxi as a stepping stone to financial freedom, not as a
              career. Residual income is a life-term insurance. One day u go to
              heaven (touch wood), your families will be taken care of. Not when
              u driving taxi for lifetime, who will take care of your
              families.</p>
              <p>For those newbie looking to drive taxi, especially to druss66.
              TD is not the end of tunnel, it's the beginning of a new life. To
              see lights at the end of tunnel depends alot on you. You can choose
              to see light or u can choose to remain in the darkness of
              tunnel.</p>
              <p>I love driving along KPE, I always love to see lights at the end
              of tunnel.</p>

              <p>Come on lah, you think NTU and NUS very easy to get in. So many people are left out of the race simply because they are not good enough. Where are your children going to go when the can read and write better than you.</p>
              <p>With taxi driver income it is very unlikely that you would be able to put your children though foreign college regimes. So please be thankful and don't trash other's people's dream of making it into local u just because you made it and is driving taxi. Let's just say I am thankful there is ITE, Poly and University programs in place.</p>
              <p>One more thing, if you have study so much and is so good at it, I would expect you to be helping the world to be a better place at a greater magnitute than satisfying customer with one trip at a time. You are different, you have proven yourself in the academic field where so many have failed. You ought to be better.</p>

              <p>Kalimango, I come from garment sector. All the promotions and awards in government and military service are mostly kelong one. It is not so much your capability but whether you gave your boss a good blowjob.</p>
              <p>I am not surviving on my taxi income. It is a supplement. My children can chose to study hard and go uni, or they can chose to drop out of school and be an entrepeneur.

              <p>What is important is that my kids understand the importance of communication, how to treat people kindly, respectfully and to always be willing to learn. This will lead them to success regardless of their academic ability. If they have this spirit and they got the brains for it, I believe they can also excel in their studies and get many many certs.

              <p>ya lor now during ICT they even got anonymous questionaire asking such questions as :</p>
              <p>1. do u think Singapore can be defended in the event of a war?</p>
              <p>2. are u prepared to defend Singapore in the event of a war?</p>
              <p>Obviously I circled NO to both. Yes I love Singapore and I will be very angry if my HDB flat gets bombed. But then as much as I love Singapore, the answer to both questions is still NO. Perhaps MINDEF should tell us the SOP for evacuation of VIPs like President, MM, SM and PM in the event of a war. Will they pick up their very own SAR21 and fight?</p>
              <p>Actually we already have history to guide us. What did they do during Jap occupation? haha....</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I'm thinking very hard of switching my job to become a taxi
              driver cos I'm really sick and tired of the corporate world with
              all its stress and backstabbing. Need to have a job that is my OTOT
              one, retrenchment-free, and less mental stress.</p>
              <p>At the moment, I work 12-14 hours weekdays, and 6-8 hours
              weekends. No time for family, friends, or even myself. My mental
              and physical health also taking a beating because of this.</p>
              <p>I don't need to earn 4 - 4.5k that I'm making now. Just need to
              make about 3 - 3.5k without CPF is fine for me cos I only have one
              child to support and my wife oso working.</p>
              <p>But there're 2 problems:</p>
              <p>1. Still on company contract for two more years</p>
              <p>2. I don't have a driving licence</p>
              <p>I know that my immediate action should be to get a Class 3 asap,
              then wait for a year until my company contract expires, so that I
              can become a OMO hirer.</p>
              <p>Questions:</p>
              <p>1. Can I apply for the VTL licence while I'm still working under
              contract?</p>
              <p>2. How long before the VTL licence expires? Renewable
              yearly?</p>
              <p>3. Which taxi company has the best benefits (in terms of
              maintenance, insurance)?</p>
              <p>4. Which model is the best for Diesel engine? Sonata?</p>
              <p>5. Can I expect an income of 2.8 - 3.4 k if I were to drive OMO
              12 hrs a day, Mon - Sat, breaking up my shifts to include both peak
              hours and the 3-5pm slot?</p>
              <p>6. Installing a GPS system is additional cost or is it included
              in the daily rental?</p>
              <p>Sorry for being so 'Chang Qi' but I really wanna know from the
              frontline soldiers than reading 'politically correct' versions on
              the company public webpages.</p>
              <p>Many thanks for your patience and hope to hear some responses.
              Hope to join the ranks in 2 years' time!</p>

              <p>Druss66, i hope not to see u in TD in 2 years time. </p>
              <p>You should be prepare for Plan B, Plan C all the way to Plan Z. Be ready to execute Plan B anytime even though you are still in contract.</p>
              <p>Get your Driver license first and think about TD later. Spend more efforts learn how to politikal around.  This is life surviving skills one need to polish no matter where you are.</p>
              <p>Politicking doesn't means bad and it happen everyday even in coffeeshop, hawker centers.</p>
              <p>From your Point # 1 to # 6 questions, it looks like you are too meticulate in doing things.</p>

              <p>The rest of the courses in NUS and NTU are really worthless. All
              the students who profess their love for let's say arts, business,
              social sciences and the physical sciences are innocent
              youths. In reality, they are needed to keep the education
              economy going. The uni professors need a crowd of slaves to
              attend their boring lectures, pass their exams and work like rats
              in their laboratories.</p>
              <p>One day when these students graduate and find out the cost
              of a HDB, they will wonder if they should have just worked those 3
              or 4 years instead of wasting time in a local uni.</p>
              <p>They will also start finding out that the garment is hiring
              foreigners with Masters degrees doing the same jobs for less
              pay.</p>
              <p>By the time they wake up, its too late. No enough money for
              honey, no enough money for a resale HDB (new HDB must married
              first mah) and still must stay with parents till 40. Lagi
              worse, go library also no money for the foreign books. HAHA..</p>
