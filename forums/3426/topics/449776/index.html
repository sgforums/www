              Just  to share an incident happened this morn. I took a call at punggol ard 6.55am. Reached the pick up point within 3 mins. Waited for 3 mins, call center called saying pax had keyed in wrong add and it was  actually a few blocks away. Quickly made a turn and drove to e "correct" pick up pt. An uncle in his 60s already there waiting. Quickly alighted and loaded the luggage into boot. Then Pax said he need to go up again to bring down another piece of luggage. So I had no choice but to wait thinking it should be very fast. A very bad mistake indeed. Made me wait for 10mins before he came down again. I damn pissed off but still keep my cool by keeping quiet. He said again wife was coming down ask me to wait awhile more. I buay tahan and then started to on e meter. Wait for another 5mins wife came down. Guess what! Wife went up again. I said to him. How long u expect me to wait? If u dun need a cab now, please dun be so kiasu and booked so early. The uncle simply replied "mei guan xi" aka no problem. U could on e meter and wait. By  then I lost my cool liao. Of course to you is "mei guan xi". For me time is money, you are not the only customer. I said so loud till nearby passerby stopped and listened. Finally after waited for another 5mins, wife then came down again. IIn total I have waited for a total of 20+mins before driving off. Normally as a service provider, I dun mind waiting for awhile. I treat it as part and parcel of my job as a TD. But too make me wait for 20mins during peak hour is way way too much. Felt damn stupid for my mistake. I should not "on" e meter during e wait at e very first place. Should have unload e luggage and drive off. Put pax as " no show". Must be heartless next time.
                                  
                            Time to Wake up TD (me)!!!! Wake up Pax!!!!!

                  Simple answer. Time and money!
                  
                  Just for a friendly discussion. For a 20mins drive during peak hour can easily fetch a fare of about $20 to $25. But just on e meter and not moving for 20mins, think will get a petty sum. 33cts for every 45secs. damn Bo hua lor
                  
                  For this incident I only "on" e meter after waiting 10mins for e Pax.

              <p>Just to share an incident happened this morn. I took a call at
              punggol ard 6.55am. Reached the pick up point within 3 mins. Waited
              for 3 mins, call center called saying pax had keyed in wrong add
              and it was actually a few blocks away. Quickly made a turn and
              drove to e “correct” pick up pt. An uncle in his 60s already there
              waiting. Quickly alighted and loaded the luggage into boot. Then
              Pax said he need to go up again to bring down another piece of
              luggage. So I had no choice but to wait thinking it should be very
              fast. A very bad mistake indeed. Made me wait for 10mins before he
              came down again. I damn pissed off but still keep my cool by
              keeping quiet. He said again wife was coming down ask me to wait
              awhile more. I buay tahan and then started to on e meter. Wait for
              another 5mins wife came down. Guess what! Wife went up again. I
              said to him. How long u expect me to wait? If u dun need a cab now,
              please dun be so kiasu and booked so early. The uncle simply
              replied “mei guan xi” aka no problem. U could on e meter and wait.
              By then I lost my cool liao. Of course to you is “mei guan xi”. For
              me time is money, you are not the only customer. I said so loud
              till nearby passerby stopped and listened. Finally after waited for
              another 5mins, wife then came down again. IIn total I have waited
              for a total of 20+mins before driving off. Normally as a service
              provider, I dun mind waiting for awhile. I treat it as part and
              parcel of my job as a TD. But too make me wait for 20mins during
              peak hour is way way too much. Felt damn stupid for my mistake. I
              should not “on” e meter during e wait at e very first place. Should
              have unload e luggage and drive off. Put pax as ” no show”. Must be
              heartless next time.</p>

              <p>Mistake lah, you should tell pax you will on the meter once he ask you to wait.</p>
              <p>If he doesn't agree, tell him to book another cab since he's not ready and press "No Show" then FO for another booking.</p>

              <p><br> Simple answer. Time and money! Just for a friendly discussion. For
              a 20mins drive during peak hour can easily fetch a fare of about
              $20 to $25. But just on e meter and not moving for 20mins, think
              will get a petty sum. 33cts for every 45secs. damn Bo hua lor For
              this incident I only "on" e meter after waiting 10mins for e
              Pax.</p>
