              <p>You guys got read the ap info board before deciding which terminal to go?  It seems to be getting very unaccurate (or maybe all the while like this).  Yesterday 1840 or so send someone to ap, shows T3 only have 5 taxis with 1 incoming flight, happily go to T3, then found out first line queue was already full with double taxi queue. </p>
              <p>Few days ago, slightly before midnight reach AP, it shows all Terminals zero incoming flights.  Join queue at T2, check changi airport website, there are a couple of flights that just landed..</p>
              <p>And it always says:" Taxis needed at T2, T3 etc." even when there are more than 100 taxis queuing at the terminals.</p>

              <p>For night shifter like me , 5pm to 8pm , strictly no airport for me .</p>
              <p>Unless got information like Pick N Go type .</p>
              <p>If not i run very fast .</p>
              <p>Even now , after 8pm , if i good mood , i'll have only one target - Terminal 2 .</p>
              <p>Also unless got information from LV members that Terminal 3 Pick N Go or things like that .</p>
              <p>Terminal One ? I never go Terminal One regardless of any information .</p>
              <p>Never like T1 .</p>
              <p>I never use those signboard as a guideline , smart phone infos can be better .</p>
              <p>I still think experience counts .</p>
              <p>Now if i've got a choice , i'll try not to go AP to pick up .</p>
              <p>My analysis , fuel surcharge implementated across most airlines , esp SQ ( Singapore Airline ) , i guess it has got less travellers ?</p>
              <p>That is why i dun go Terminal 3 .</p>
              <p>Why Terminal 2 ?</p>
              <p>Terminal 2 has got the most region flights in .</p>
              <p>From KL , Brunei , Silk Air ? Chennai , etc .... flights that has got thoe almost full type .</p>
              <p>KL &gt; Singapore usually Full House .</p>
              <p>MAS KL &gt; Singapore also full house one .</p>

              <p>Yes, the sign board is misleading and just wanted to lure you into the Q.</p>
              <p>T2 is the only one that can see the real situation of the arrival hall taxi stand before you go into the Q. of cse T1 &amp; 3 also can but 'lay-chay'.</p>
              <p>Best time to pick &amp; Go is between 4.30 to 4.45pm and before 11.30pm when this is the time all the taxis went 'missing'.</p>

              I think the board is assuming TDs act on the info provided accordingly. This is to spread out the no of taxis amongst all terminal bldg.<p></p>
                  
                 <br> Anyway today drive home on PIE got one red wish on the centre lane hogging from Bedok Reservoir flyover to Woodsville. Flash flash him 6 times but still so relax go left lane drive at 75. Only overtook an SBS bus at Paya Lebar flyover. Thought all night cabs with fare fly like 140? Hahaha

              <p>Bros, depend lah, i still believe in 30/70 rules, 30 on smart, smart meaming skillful in driving, the rest 70 more on heng or bo heng. From AP to bedok and holland village is lots of different leh. Just like this afternoon abt 4+pm, one aunty with market stuffs pax at Joo chiat TS, front 2 cabs do not want to take, apply hide and seek delay tactic, me go in, hv to wait until they get the right pax then move out, I took the aunty, she complain why TD waved her off before even said the destination, I replied, I dunno, but in my mind, those cabs must hv siam her, maybe only near destination and yet hv to carry so many stuffs. To my surprise, she was a filipino, going to lucky plaza, reach there 5 plus already, then pick up two guys going to my shift end destination...its pure luck men. But I olso got many bad luck.</p>
