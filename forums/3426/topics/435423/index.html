            <div class='col-md body'>there are a number of sonata hirers coshare with 2 reliefs, each one 8hour average, maybe even lesser if exclude pump and closing? if dont piaa then how to huat? sonatas these days they do whatever they like on the road. if they think you LL have to makan whatever they throw at you, they will do it. more and more of them sudden cut lane, hard brake stop in middle road or surprise turn corners, without signals without signs...the funny thing is the only time they signal and flash high beam is when they want you to get out of their way or when they think you cut into their lane even from far far..they think with their turbo they can try any sort of hunky punky and get away with it, even if the behind driver not happy, what they do about it?? how to catch up and takan back?? the only time i see them behave more 'guai' is when they see a more equal vehicle like silver arrow, mercedes or another sonata. comes near to them. in other words, they dont respect all other taxi that they dont see as equal. and their company sort of encourage that mindset because as long as no customer complain (since they dont see them play pattern), the driver is 'safe' and 'obedient'.</div>

              <p><br>Rubbish ! Every month i seen many serious accidents , hahahahahaha .</p>
              <p>Not only 7th Month .</p>
              <p>As long as u drive with some defensive driving skills , should be okay .</p>
              <p>I assure you that if u have enough rest , drive with full concentrations , your risk of getting into accident is lowered by at least 50% .</p>
              <p>Defensive driving another 50% .</p>
              <p>Enough rest 50% .</p>
              <p>As good as 0% accident risk .</p>
              <p>Unless blur cock "kiss" your backside .</p>
              <p>That is blessing .</p>
              <p>But hor , being defensive driving , i dun see how people can "kiss" your ass !</p>

              the reason i ask this, is because just two days ago, i saw this private car A in front like trying to block a cab behind and keep brake and move a bit and brake again..the cab cannot tahan already so press down engine up to move into right lane behind another private car B there. suddenly that private car A kick forward and swing into that same right lane but right in front of private car B! car B brake like crazy, but its immediate too close already no room at all, so cannot avoid, end up rub into car A rear left bumper. but can see not big problem, just minor dents and paint scratches.
              
              BUT the cab behind car B very xiong..because he was just accelerating picking up to switch into right lane right behind car B who ebrake..that cab completely bulldoze into car B rear. the whole rear end of car B smash in. the cab front bumper and engine bonnet open flower. i think the front components also crash in.
              
              the irony thing is, car A driver act very gan jiong. immediately jump out and start big hand waving angrily at both car B and the cab, like very buay song, machiam he was the victim. car B driver came out gong gong, but also turn black face towards the cab driver who did not come out i think.
