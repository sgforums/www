              <p>Any advise where can I go at tis timing frm 10am to 4pm? Places i normally like to go if I am in town is MBS and ICA..</p>

              <p>Initially is like that one. Drive long hours to learn. But it will get easier. This was wad I do,</p>
              <p>1) As you drive, observe where all the official taxi stands are found. Also keep a look out on places where u find long taxi queue on certain places with no taxi stand.<br>2) Do not be afraid in unfamiliar ground. When in taxi queue or having a break, just flip through the street directory just to get a rough idea on where the main streets are.<br>3) Always ask yourself some simple questions like :</p>
              <p>- During lunch time, where u think the crowd will be in the area. For eg, if u at Jurong East. International Business Park is a good place to hunt. <br>- Or peak hour, Ask yourself, where are the offices found. If not go for the nearest hospital (eg If in Hougang or Sengkang - u can try IMH or Serangoon Nt Ave 5 area)</p>
              <p>4) Remember all the surcharges well.</p>
              <p>For a start, just do this will do. Just keep on driving. After 1-3 months u will notice you only need to drive shorter hours to earn more money.</p>
              <p>When you are more experienced, then you can start to plan a rough schedule. For eg, by 5pm you want to go near city, then go to the places where you know the chances to fetch pple to city is greater. It may not be always accurate, but you will notice you can steer urself to a particular area some of the time.</p>

Anyway 10am-4pm quite ok mah, i think it is easily to find paxs than in the morning peak. Comb the neighbourhoods, go shopping malls do shuttle service, hit the office and industrial area during lunch, and take advantage of the changing shift time since you are a OMO.</p></div>

              <p>Hi, I am also a newbie to driving taxi, just started about 2 weeks ago as relief. For me, I still learning the road, so I will just drive and pick, pax go where, i go where, even if on call, i also do not know where to pickup, so off the on call system altogether.</p>
              <p>Sometime, I also forget to press the CBD surcharge also let go, and got twice forget to press the hired meter, reach destination also $3...hahaha..luckily paxs agree to pay as according to his earlier journey price. More important, I find that being cool and courteous is very important in taxi servicing trade, you notice that being courteous, peoples tends to reciprocate back the same way, even ah beng and ah lian also find it nice and that makes you driving happy. Human relationship is therefore critical in Taxi driving, cos you meet all kind of peoples from all walk of life, learn to speak into their tune, so many paxs lead me all the way.</p>
              <p>Got one ang mo gives me $50 at MBS, i got no change left, so he digged his pocket and got a $10, which is ok to me, so he drop off, but his $50 is still in my hand, i chased after him and give back his $50, if not I would had pocketed $60, he was so grateful and wanted to offer me a drink, how can, all jammed up and honking at my cab liao.</p>
              <p>However, the different is, I am driving on weekends, so many peoples on the road, go toilet also no time. Now I understand why taxi driver got health problem.</p>
              <p>As per some old bird here, take care of health is more important.</p>

              <p>Hi, I am also a newbie to driving taxi, just started about 2
              weeks ago as relief. For me, I still learning the road, so I will
              just drive and pick, pax go where, i go where, even if on call, i
              also do not know where to pickup, so off the on call system
              altogether.</p>
              <p>Sometime, I also forget to press the CBD surcharge also let go,
              and got twice forget to press the hired meter, reach destination
              also $3...hahaha..luckily paxs agree to pay as according to his
              earlier journey price. More important, I find that being cool
              and courteous is very important in taxi servicing trade,
              you notice that being courteous, peoples tends to reciprocate
              back the same way, even ah beng and ah lian also find it
              nice and that makes you driving happy. Human relationship
              is therefore critical in Taxi driving, cos you meet all kind of
              peoples from all walk of life, learn to speak into their tune,
              so many paxs lead me all the way.</p>
              <p>Got one ang mo gives me $50 at MBS, i got no change left, so he
              digged his pocket and got a $10, which is ok to me, so he drop off,
              but his $50 is still in my hand, i chased after him and give back
              his $50, if not I would had pocketed $60, he was so grateful and
              wanted to offer me a drink, how can, all jammed up and honking at
              my cab liao.</p>
              <p>However, the different is, I am driving on weekends, so many
              peoples on the road, go toilet also no time. Now I understand why
              taxi driver got health problem.</p>
              <p>As per some old bird here, take care of health is more
              important.</p>

              <p><br>Hahaha, bro, me also old liao, but working on as a newbie in this industry, when i first started, after for 4 hours, i take pandol liao. Headache, go round and round the west side until blur blur.  I also go home and sleep, so, not all newbirds are so desparate, guess only those young newbies are desparate. Well, every jobs start like this, very active and hardworking, but after learning the trade, sian liao. Havin said that, as long as you are happy of what you are doing, its fine.</p>
              <p>Online is good, you get to learn, share and gather infos. Afterall, you have been driving all day, just enjoy yourself, online with a cup of tea. </p>

              <p><br>Haha, dear bros,  no need 6 or 3 months lah, 2 weeks already kenna scolding left right and centre from Paxs liao.</p>
              <p>Some paxs are really very nasty, some got very high ego and think they are big boss. But then, I still have to cool down, hold my temper for the sake of earning a living and life goes on.</p>
              <p>In fact, in working life, there is also lots of temper flying around with lots of office politics, taxis are different in a way is that no matter how the paxs react, at the end of the journey, we do not see them anymore. In working life, the people you don't like are with you 360 days or years. And most of them are bosses which we find no way out in argueing with them. They pull rank only, we shut up liao. But taxi is different, the relationship is between a client and a service provider, it is only a few minutes to an hour of interaction, after that, life goes on. </p>
