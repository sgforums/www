              <p>Some paxs are really very nasty, some got very high ego and
                  think they are big boss. But then, I still have to cool down,
                  hold my temper for the sake of earning a living and life goes
                  on.</p>
              <p>In fact, in working life, there is also lots of temper
                  flying around with lots of office politics, taxis are different in
                  a way is that no matter how the paxs react, at the end of the
                  journey, we do not see them anymore. In working life, the people
                  you don't like are with you 360 days or years. And most of them are
                  bosses which we find no way out in argueing with them. They pull
                  rank only, we shut up liao. But taxi is different, the relationship
                  is between a client and a service provider, it is only a few
                  minutes to an hour of interaction, after that, life goes

              <p>Bro, just to share since I am a newbie who started with Merc limo cab. Juz completed my 42nd day of driving.</p>
              <p>Maybe you can try rest for an hr in the afternoon by taking a short nap. This will definitely better than drinking Redbull or NaughterG!</p>
              <p>Next, dun be afraid to take current calls. Its just 2 km around you. (becareful when you take calls fm Mt Pleasant animal hosp! can be reached only fm PIE west bound)use the map or get a GPS for yrself. If u r not familiar with the loc, spent a min to chk the loc, get yr orientation right before u chiong there. This is what I do often. Initially, I was very 'kan chiong' when I took calls, now I feel more confident and took an ave of 6-8 current calls a day.</p>
              <p>whether driving into new places or taking very unfamiliar calls, if you dun do now, then when? After making some mistake, go home log in to directory or onemap, to review yr route or compare which route is shorter or faster.. this will help you in future trips.</p>
              <p>good luck.</p>

              <p>Haha,But did not learn the correct thing. Took advance call for peak hour really kill me. kenna suspend again for 3 days. this one taught me not to take advance call for peak hour.sigh. Fortunately, after 1 month of driving, i had only met one nasty pax. the rest all ok. Because before any pax sit on my cab, the first golden question is Do you know the way?Can direct me?If he also not sure, then the next question is Dun mind i use my GPS and most of them gladly agree. haha.</p>
