                      Bro,
                             If you are driving with CDG a.k.a comfort.   First thing to do is relax. Make sure your printer is working. Tell pax, "sure, no problem. Give me a second.
                      
                      1) Press K1 on your meter until the receipt starts printing from your printer.
                      2) Upon completion of printing, Press OP on your meter (start your meter), wait about 3secs and stop your meter.
                      3) With the printed receipt in hand, proceed to edit the amount accordingly.
                      4) The printed receipt will have all the details of the trip like time start, km run and booking fee etc.
                      5) Show the receipt to the pax and tell the pax the amount due.
                      
                      With the printed receipt you obtain by pressing K1. You not only know the amount to edit. But more importantly, you have a "black and white" to show to the pax. It sure prevents any dispute.
                      
                      Take it easy bro.

              <p>You had to let go of a $35 fare because of this loophole. This is sad.</p>
              <p>And this has happened to you 8 times in 4 months! And for Pax who CALL! for Taxis too! More will happen if you did not bring this up.</p>
              <p>We have been trained to ask pax their preferred route. Very good training.</p>
              <p>My 2cents worth advise for Blue drivers. Ask Pax their preferred mode of payment before switching on the meter. Have it recordered somewhere.</p>

              <p><br> Bro, If you are driving with CDG a.k.a comfort. First thing to do
              is relax. Make sure your printer is working. Tell pax, "sure, no
              problem. Give me a second. 1) Press K1 on your meter until the
              receipt starts printing from your printer. 2) Upon completion of
              printing, Press OP on your meter (start your meter), wait about
              3secs and stop your meter. 3) With the printed receipt in hand,
              proceed to edit the amount accordingly. 4) The printed receipt will
              have all the details of the trip like time start, km run and
              booking fee etc. 5) Show the receipt to the pax and tell the pax
              the amount due. With the printed receipt you obtain by pressing K1.
              You not only know the amount to edit. But more importantly, you
              have a "black and white" to show to the pax. It sure prevents any
              dispute. Take it easy bro.</p>

              <p>Thank you for your advice bro.</p>
              <p>No Newbie can follow your advise expecially! If the printer does not work. This is a loophole which must be corrected.</p>
              <p>Blues have the best MDTs' in Singapore. But if it allows Pax to cheat TDs', there is a problem with the MDT and Bluey must respond. Don't just collect rental and send TDs' for further MDT training.</p>
