              <p> Just  half an hour finished my lunch and got up with a cigarett. Than started my trip, outside the carpark one ang mo flagged me. How can that be so coincident,  he is waiting for me, Just in Time and there is no other taxi around, this is pure luck, I think. </p>
              <p>Sir... where too, Tuas Raffle Marina. wow long ones, so just aye and straigh to there. seventeen dollars.</p>
              <p> Never got a chance to this Marina, so kapo kapo parked the taxi at the carpark and went to the main hall, look see look see, and visited their toilet. </p>
              <p>Just for about fifteen minutes, than went back to the taxi and started my journey. Wow, another flipino couples just showing hand signal to me that they wanted taxi, than where to. Wisma Atrium, so heng meh. whole trip twenty one dollars.</p>
              <p>From Wisma Atrium, another korean couples, we will like to go Jurong Bird park.</p>

              <p>not that simple lah. oso must know which queue better. daytime good places to queue always full house + spill over. many times want to join oso cannot. ex. morning bayshore, afternoon novena sq., many more in cbd.</p>
              <p>yah, newspaper is a must-have. for me newpaper n st.</p>
              <p>me adopt flexible strategy, not queue all the time. for me if joined queues frequently, my collection for that day sure low. my cruising "luck" better. 15mins max. but on bad days, after kena empty for 30/40mins, i'll spend the rest of my time queueing. target oso set lower then. morning peak hours..only queue if ended in east side and only if 7-8am. east side fav queue..bayshore road taxi stand..where else? long queue but sure move.</p>
              <p>poolie, day time want to join ica queue not easy, too many oredy, mostly until the bus stop. sometimes cisco waiting.</p>

              <p>No incorrect, day shift not a must as mention Q formula. Basically you must know how to tackle and where to run your schedule and location at which time. Those Q as like in hospitals, hotels, shopping centres etc you named it they are there.  So for me since you guy love to Q i love to round cause currently diesel still cheap a litres still .88 cts.  Just an example best Q taxi drivers love... plaza sing, far east, lucky plaza, paragon, taka,ion, wisma, mount E. there are many taxis there. like this kind... if i am at that areas. me go to area where they think no chances and hopeless locations. basically Q is actually not a good ideal for day shift. JUst an example...a little ulu like ulu pandan or ferrer or up to bukit timah and out of ochard road my chance will be better than Q at the taxi stand like those russian roullete game for your turn.  </p>

              <p>Just one example this morning as at amk, near mrt taxi Q... 456 taxis and private cars that whole place congested. No wonder nowaday white mice love this place.  So me go straight down toward bishan direction, one pax waiting there along the road. Showed hand signal,this must be better choice than  those Q those sandwich in- between at the taxi stand.</p>
              <p> Uncle Jurong West, so where to head...BKE KJE Corporation good choice. upon reaching, uncle stop me at the minimart at that block, than continue and pickup my friend to Bukit Batok, at peak hours sure $20 and above. So as at Bukit Gombak near the driving school another pax flagged, this time to CBD sure another $20 above, after CBD must i Q...no. from Hong Leong go one round the building and back to the  new ramp  up toward river valley condo belt, another ang mo with luggage as at Aspen Height destination Changi Airport another $20 above. As what KTCK peak hours is precious, so Q is not a must, if i will be in that MRT Q can that slot contibuted my rental and my fuel of the day. But sorry not everyday as like today, but basically Q doesn't help much in day shift as mention. Those kind are those lazy ones.</p>

For me I started at 7am this are another advantage point for me, worked a little bit harder cause those season hirers take break me go chiong, there is a  saying when the (cat not in the mouse play) tactic, this slot are those hospital appointment of some government agency or embassy pax or some left over office paxs or shopping staffs that is all about, this kind no need to Q must be hardworking round heartlands. For this two or three hours completed, than this is our time to take rest. Let those season hirers do their round.

For me today, nothing to worry... who they are, just try and see and be more alert and with skill to identify those potential paxs as along.My collection still as good as those more years running before me, this are data collected from everydays washing bay...but no airport Q or any others Q.

              Now that you've mentioned it, i do recall, on several occasions, taxi drivers who like to radio or call their kakis and discuss what and where to eat after the peak hours. And some appear very laid-back, sitting at the kopitiam for god knows how many hours..i can see them in the morning, and i can still see them after my work.
