              <p>Maybe due to 35% peak hour surcharge , commuters complaint at all ? Nope , they take a bus or MRT instead . They LL one , no choice . Taxi expensive .</p>

              <p>Rental hike , are they prepare to regroup and recruit another batch of drivers ?</p>
              <p>No likely to have rental hike , now many on contract , they signed on the dotted lines with current rental , CDG want their drivers to sent them to court ? Like Prime ?</p>

              <p>This is my experience last night that I posted in another forum. Thought I'll share here since it's relevant...</p>

              <p>Same case as yours, but not as lucky as you... Read on.<br><br>I was 
              driving tonight night shift.  Being a Sunday night, there are lesser 
              cabs on the road and hence, more difficulty in getting taxi or calling 
              for one.<br><br>I was cruising along Geylang Road and just passed Lorong
               28 when Ping! call came in and pick up location is Shell Station along 
              Guillemard Road.  Normally, I don't take calls where pickup location is 
              along the main road.  But, it being a Sunday and no surcharges, taking 
              calls is about the only way to increase our income.  Hence, I pressed 3 
              min and proceeded to the pickup location.  When I came to the end of 
              Lorong 24, I already saw the couple across the road.  I high-beamed them
               twice and the girl (whose name appeared on my MDT) pointed to her 
              boyfriend that the cab they called for is just across the street.<br><br>I
               proceeded to turn into Guillemard Road and was waiting to do an U turn 
              at the Lorong 28 junction when Pong! call cancellation came in.<br><br>#$@%!!!
               They fxxxing asshole knew that I'm already in the vicinity and am proceeding to
               pick them up.  Would they die from waiting another 30 secs max.  Even 
              with the additional 30 secs waiting, I'm still within the 3 mins that I 
              pressed on the MDT.  I proceeded to call the girl as I always make it a 
              point to key the callers' number into my hp while proceeding to pick my 
              call customers.  As expected, the fxxxing biatch don't dare to pick up 
              the phone.  (By the way, YES! I do have my own list of assholes who 
              called and cancelled their bookings.)<br><br>I understand that if I want
               to take bookings, must be able to tahan call cancellation.  But, in 
              this case, she already saw me and knew that I'm just max. 30 secs away 
              from arriving and yet, she still proceed to take another cab.  Why? Just
               to save the $2.50 call charge.  fxxxing cheapo SXXXXXXXXXX!</p>

Normally, I don't take calls where pickup location is along the main road. But, it being a Sunday and no surcharges, taking calls is about the only way to increase our income. Hence, I pressed 3 min and proceeded to the pickup location. When I came to the end of Lorong 24, I already saw the couple across the road. I high-beamed them twice and the girl (whose name appeared on my MDT) pointed to her boyfriend that the cab they called for is just across the street.<br><br>I proceeded to turn into Guillemard Road and was waiting to do an U turn at the Lorong 28 junction when Pong! call cancellation came in.<br><br>#$@%!!! They fxxxing asshole knew that I'm already in the vicinity and am proceeding to pick them up. Would they die from waiting another 30 secs max. Even with the additional 30 secs waiting, I'm still within the 3 mins that I pressed on the MDT. I proceeded to call the girl as I always make it a point to key the callers' number into my hp while proceeding to pick my call customers. As expected, the fxxxing biatch don't dare to pick up the phone. (By the way, YES! I do have my own list of assholes who called and cancelled their bookings.)<br><br>I understand that if I want to take bookings, must be able to tahan call cancellation. But, in this case, she already saw me and knew that I'm just max. 30 secs away from arriving and yet, she still proceed to take another cab. Why? Just to save the $2.50 call charge. fxxxing cheapo SXXXXXXXXXX!</p>

              <p>hmm i'm just wondering if cabbies would do the same if they were in their shoes. Matter of fact is....no one owes no one a living. And it is such in the culture of commuters taking cabs, there are always assholes (as you would call them) who do call cancellations. When cabbies purposely shun certain taxi queues so that they can earn that extra surcharge, money's ultimately still the main reason.</p>
              <p>No offence but i often see commuters being labeled as cheapos here.....f the commuters la.....go take MRT, take bus la etc.....everyone's just trying to maximise their dollar.....the same way cabbies do their best aiming for surcharges.</p>
              <p>Threads like this giving such negative comments on the very people whom you depend for a living, just doesn't sound right.</p>
              <p>I believe the taxi business is such...with your so called scums and cheapos and that's the way it shall be for as long as you drive a taxi.</p>

              <p><br>True, we also do not owe her a living, but people are connected, either she do not know that her comments is no good for us or she purposely want to make her point thru, which we, do not accept it. Both are earning a living in the soil of singapore, she got stress, we also got stress, most people on the street alway think TD is very switch off and only for those useless and lazy bum, and that is what govt use to tell them, if you got no skill and nothing, go drive taxi, that gives the public a very bad image on TD, even if we want to give a good service, by such comment, we really got no mood to service a lady as a lady anymore.</p>
