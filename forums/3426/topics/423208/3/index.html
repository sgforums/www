              Both are earning a living in the soil of singapore, she got stress,
              we also got stress, most people on the street alway think TD is
              very switch off and only for those useless and lazy bum, and that
              is what govt use to tell them, if you got no skill and nothing, go
              drive taxi, that gives the public a very bad image on TD, even if
              we want to give a good service, by such comment, we really got no
              mood to service a lady as a lady anymore.</p>

              <p>Fair enough. I agree she's purposely blunt. It's not easy to be TD when many passengers take them for granted. On the other hand, this is the way it is. Just look at insurance agents, they also provide a service right. They make appointments with customers, peole don't turn up...waste petrol. They buy the client lunch but did not purchase any policy. It's all part of the job and they are always positive about the job. Every rejection gets them closer to the next sale.</p>
              <p>Just that in this taxi forum.....i see so much negativity. F this pax la....f that pax la....that one is a bitch, another's an asshole lol.</p>

               cabs parked by the roadside, apparently waiting for a call booking

              <p>Look...if i were a TD, I would do the same too. The system is there for us to make use of....and who's to say cabbies should walk the moral high ground and just go out there to pick customers up.</p>
              <p>I'm sure cabbies know it's the fault of LTA and their crap policies. Then again, the system is also such that people can make call cancellations. Who's to blame anyone for maximising their dollar?</p>
