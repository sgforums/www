              <p>Let me share a story .</p>
              <p>I was lucky .</p>
              <p>My late father was diagnosed with cancer a few years back .</p>
              <p>before he diagnosed with cancer , CPF sent him a letter , to encourage him to sign up Medishield , deducting about $400 a year from his medisave .</p>
              <p>Since my father has got so much to spare , why not ? He signed up .</p>
              <p>After a few months he signed up , he was disgnosed with cancer .</p>
              <p>Can you imagine the cost of those surgeries , medicine , hospitalisations needed if i need to fork out cash ?</p>
              <p>It's a cool $28,000 plus .</p>
              <p>We were worried , very worried .</p>
              <p>My family even sat down to discuss how to share those burden among us .</p>
              <p>But in the end ?</p>
              <p>All those medical fee was bore by Medisave and most important Medishields !</p>
              <p>This Medishields saved our ass , really !</p>
              <p>My brother handled all related issues , i never heard from anyone that we pay massive cash for my father .</p>
              <p>Why am i telling you this ?</p>
              <p>I like to recommend you guys to sign up Medishield as fast as possible .</p>
              <p>Try your best to sign up one .</p>
              <p>All premium is standard one .</p>
              <p>Insured by Great Eastern .</p>
              <p>Nothing more than $500 per year , all deducted from your Medisave .</p>
              <p>How important ?</p>
              <p>It is very important .</p>

              <p>Some told me it is automatic , but i did signed up a form to authorise them to deduct amount from my medisave .</p>
              <p>And i think i will visit CPF to confirm about my status about Medishield .</p>
              <p>I think i received a letter from CPF at the age of 40 .</p>
              <p>This policy is cater for citizens above 40 .</p>
              <p>If u are 40 and above , and are not sure about your status , make a point to ask from CPF or check online if u have password for Singpass .</p>

              <p>All TD bro. Pool mentioned Medisave, Medishield bla bla....is very important.</p>
              <p>You better buy Solid Medical Insurance package for yourself and family when you are healthy.  Because after you encounter some major problem you will probably rejected.</p>
              <p>Medisave? not enough.....peanuts and will wipe out account in one big instant case.</p>
              <p>Medishield --- now you can buy from GE, AXA and bla bla black sheep co.  However, Medishield is still not enough as you need to do co-payment of 10% from Cash or Medisave. Example if your Surgery and hospitalization cost $100,000 - then 10% of it have to be pay by yourself.</p>
              <p>You can pay Medishield premium from your Medisave account.  Don't let this account sit idle in the CPF.</p>
              <p>There are some other extension and comprehensive policy like from GE  that is called "Total Shield" and you can only buy it in addition to their so called "Supreme Health".</p>
              <p>I am not promoting any insurance co, but it is a reality nowaday if you have no money to pay for Surgery or Hospitalization. Medisave is just not enough.</p>
              <p>Our Gov is following the Health System in the West and US.</p>
              <p>You have to got a mentality of getting insured for and hope not to get sick.</p>
              <p>Unlike you buy and bet on Toto or 4D to strike.  Why not spend this $ and hope not to Strike.</p>
