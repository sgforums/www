              All the answers in the road directory
              
              Before taking these modules, familiar yourself with the directory
              
              know the location of the content page for hospital, church , school etc
              
              dun waste time trying to locate the page
              
              understand that the entrance of the building is normally the road name for the building
              
              can study the popular routes hangout by the instructors

                  (Passing rate 24/30)</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Took my exams for Module-3... 4
                  times already &amp; still always fail. always not enough time. my
                  best score was 38/50. the most f-up thing is, they never
                  ask the same questions, the most is maybe 5-6 questions
                  is the same from the previous exams.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">1st time i took the exams, never
                  ask about taxi stand no. at so &amp; so street. i failed because it
                  was not familiar on the strategy to answer the MCQ's &amp; i took
                  too long to answer. 2nd time, ask around 2 questions about
                  taxi stand no ... 3rd time time i took the exams, ask about 8
                  questions about taxi stand nos. 4th time i took the exams, ask not
                  ONLY taxi stand no, ask PUDO &amp; taxi stop nos. WTF is LTA
                  trying to do??!! if they don't ask any taxi stand, PUDO &amp;
                  stop questions, i can finish the exam in time &amp; most
                  probably pass the goddamn exam. but the 4th exam is the worst.
                  really cannot tahan, sibey jia-lat. time to answer 50 questions
                  with taxi stand questions within 60 mins is really
                  insufficient.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">to be realistic, which customer
                  will ever ask a taxi driver: "can u fetch me to taxi stand no.
                  A12?" (hey, LTA exam setter!! - r u stupid or retarded or
                  what??!!)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">taking the exams is really based
                  on luck. if u r lucky, u pass... if not, u fail. i'm getting really
                  pissed off about this. for instance, even if u memorize 20-25
                  of the questions (embassies, schools, town councils, NPP, etc),
                  they frikkin' don't appear at all. it will be totally different
                  from the previous exam. same goes for taxi stand nos.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Module 4 - if u don't regularly
                  drive on the road... U WILL DEFINITELY FAIL.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">so, for those who don't drive
                  regularly &amp; u passed your module 4... can u please give me any
                  advice? i consistantly score only 17-18/30. i'm getting
                  more &amp; more dejected.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">thank you in advance.</span></p>

              <p>Have just passed mine today, so thought can share with you the experience.</p>
              <p>Basically for the ENTIRE test, it is not based on luck. It is based on SPEED.</p>
              <p>Simply put, for module 3, you only have 1 min 12 sec for EVERY single question. For module 4, 2 mins each question. So you have to challenge yourself to answer the qeustion within this time frame. How? By simply racing yourself aginst the clock, you have to think and make decision fast, if you can't answer it, mark it for review and go on to the next qn. Answer as many of the 50 qns you can, as my instructor said, the very difficult one, just let it go... This would help you increase your chance of passing greatly. My fellow classmates today couldn't finish the all questions, some left 5 unanswered.</p>
              <p>Another way to find what you want fast is to use coloured rulers in the index pages, how? Treat me kopi, I'll show you how. Remember that on the first page is the contents page for the index, forget which page Private Housing is on, flip to the first page and find! It will save you precious seconds for every question!</p>
              <p>I have some worksheets you can practise on for module 3 and 4, but best not to put up public here, however I can meet you and pass to you.</p>
              <p>For module 4, did you watch the DVDs given? Watching the DVD and plot it against the 40 routes papers given, you will see a lot of landmarks. Some people will say the DVDs are useless, but watch it and plot against the paper route given, you will find it easier to remember the routes.</p>
              <p>Familiarize your Orchard area, City area maps, places like Shenton Way area, Suntec area, Chinatown area. This are areas with many roads and they like to kill you there, cos you will spend a lot of time trying to look for a bloody building or taxi stand.</p>
              <p>For the 30 routes, which route to go if you are given 3 different routes? Take the route with the most ERP gantries. Dun believe me, try the route from airport to four seasons hotel. You will see what I mean, there are other alternative that DO NOT NEED to pass through ERP.</p>
              <p> Hope this helps....</p>

              <p>ECP exit Marina Place / Marina Station Road etc</p>
