              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority is imposing tighter licence requirements on operators to improve taxi services.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>In particular, there will be new measures to ensure call booking services are more reliable and efficient.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Some commuters have 
              complained that drivers use the "on-call" sign to refuse flag-down 
              passengers, especially just before surcharges kick in.<br><br>To 
              minimise abuse, within two years, the sign will be centrally-controlled,
               and switched on only when the driver accepts a call booking.<br><br>Measures have also been put in to improve booking reliability.<br><br>From
               October, operators have to meet higher standards, in terms of the 
              answer rate for call bookings, the percentage of calls successfully 
              matched with taxis, and the time taken for the cab to arrive.<br><br>And
               soon, all cabs will have to be equipped to handle call bookings, where 
              previously this wasn't mandatory under current operator licence 
              requirements.<br><br>And to ensure operators have the critical mass to 
              provide adequate service, the Land Transport Authority has doubled the 
              minimum fleet size, from 400 to 800.<br><br>Out of the seven existing 
              operators, Prime and Smart cabs are the smallest, with 700 cabs each. 
              They have to meet the minimum when they renew their operator's licence. <br><br>For
               Prime, that's 2017. But for Smart cabs, it's next year. Smart said 
              ramping up the fleet size is not its main worry. Its concern is that 
              fluctuating car premiums will make it harder to set monthly rents that 
              are market-competitive.<br><br>Its managing Director, Johnny Harjanto 
              said: "Suppose a car costs me S$40,000 and COE costs S$60,000 now. Based
               on the total of S$100,000, I set a monthly rent of say, S$100. What if a
               few months down the road, COEs drop and my competitor buys the car 
              cheaper? They can set a lower rent, but when that happens what can I 
              do?"<br><br>Smaller operators tend to perform badly in quality reviews.<br><br>For
               instance, in the December Quality of Service review published by LTA, 
              Smart failed in three out of five service categories, including being 
              unable to cater to 70 per cent of call bookings. It also failed in both 
              safety requirements. Prime cabs also fared badly in terms of meeting 
              call bookings.<br><br>Observers said they could consider integrating some of their operations.<br><br>"Not
               necessarily in terms of real business management, but to form a common 
              call centre so they can share their taxi fleet between the different 
              companies. Also from the passengers' point of view, they are given 
              another, more practical choice," said Associate Professor Lee Der Horng,
               from the Department of Civil Engineering at NUS.<br><br>Authorities are also studying how to utilise taxis better.<br><br>In the last five years, the number of taxis grew by 20 per cent, but total distance travelled remained the same.<br><br>Transport
               Minister Lui Tuck Yew, said: "I have asked LTA to study the feasibility
               of regulating taxi companies to have a certain minimum availability for
               their fleets, particularly during peak hours when availability is 
              crucial." <br><br>LTA is also studying how to increase the number of dual-shift cabs on the roads.<br><br>The study is expected to be completed later this year.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>

              It is so STUPID for LTA to say TD can manipulate the on call feature .It shows they(LTA) do not know their job well to regulate the taxi in Spore.
              
              
              For the record straight &amp; for BENEFITS FOR ALL.
              
              On Call,Prime time surcharge(25% &amp; 50%) can not cheat pax ,only location(pick up) point surcharge of $3 can cheat pax.
              
              
              Even Airport surcharge of $3 &amp; $5 can not cheat pax.

              td may have urgent matters to attend as time is v tight for him ,need to rush or on v high tide need to relief big &amp; small.
              td is also a human being like u &amp; me ,pls do not be too harsh to them,u are just one of his many bosses in a day of driving,one boss more or less does not make him miserable,but controlling himself not to relieve by picking u will later cost him more on medical fees.

              <p>with so many commuter misuse the call system,  what to do? who ask for it?</p>
              <p>many book and put aeroplane, that's why you see the LED switch to on call, why because it is pax that make it, call even they were not at the location or call to play safe  especially during hot hours. take away this call system , make pax pay when they go show after booking. than you will see less on call taxi.</p>
              <p>The whole problem is the system, not tds, 99% tds won't play that especially when majority on call is by system and not human as you can always call CDG and check, their meter has got no way to press "on call"</p>
              <p>So get your facts right first before pointing finger at tds</p>

              <p>This is by far a very thoughtless comment. Taxi drivers also need a break, you think everyday drive on the road many hours straight very fun is it. Whether 'busy' or 'change shift' sign, is not up to us to tell them not to. In other words, TDs are not here to wait on you. So, it's not a problem.</p>
              <p>Then, you say implement heavy fines for conducting 'interview'. Come on la, put yourself in TD's shoes. If you driving around Sembawang area at 2:30pm, end shift at 3pm and have to handover vehicle to another driver at Woodlands, would you take a passenger who is heading to Pasir Ris?

              <p>This is by far a very thoughtless comment. Taxi drivers also need a break, you think everyday drive on the road many hours straight very fun is it. Whether 'busy' or 'change shift' sign, is not up to us to tell them not to. In other words, TDs are not here to wait on you. So, it's not a problem.</p>

              <p>with so many commuter misuse the call system,  what to do?
              who ask for it?</p>
              <p>many book and put aeroplane, that's why you see the LED switch
              to on call, why because it is pax that make it, call even they were
              not at the location or call to play safe  especially during
              hot hours. take away this call system , make pax pay when they go
              show after booking. than you will see less on call taxi.</p>
              <p>The whole problem is the system, not tds, 99% tds won't play
              that especially when majority on call is by system and not human as
              you can always call CDG and check, their meter has got no way to
              press "on call"</p>
              <p>So get your facts right first before pointing finger at tds</p>
