                                      but total distance travelled remained the same.<br> <br> Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew, said: "I have asked LTA to study
                                      the feasibility of regulating taxi companies to have a certain
                                      minimum availability for their fleets, particularly during peak

                                      on the roads.<br> <br> The study is expected to be completed later this year.</span></span></p>

              <p>Previously, Epica can also manually off the roof light. There is a switch. But now, it doesn't work anymore. Once engine on, roof light on, cannot off. They must have done something during my last servicing.</p>

              <p>Because you have not been active enough, everyday drive and work hard till forget about it, tap on them, go to their website, find your chairman or so called leader in your taxi companies, talk to them, they are suppose to do the work or help to give you the application form.</p>
              <p>For me, I joined from outside, meaning at NTUC fairpirce outlet, those who earn $10 for one member recruited, then depend on which trade you registered in, my casket driving trade got no union, so I put taxis driving, few weeks later, NTA send me a letter that I come under their membership. Like electronic under electronic union UWEEI, construction under building unions, and so on...taxi under NTA..teacher under teacher unions, ..you can also be a General member of NTUC, like those aunties or retirees or young kids, these people join to enjoy the social benefits.</p>

              <p>All taxis companies got unions in them, they also got unions notice board, go ask where is it, each companies got their own association, like Stu, ctoa etc etc,...I think about a year or 2 ago, all join force to form NTA, so if you are a member of ctoa, it is affliated to NTA, and NTA is affliated to NTUC, and NTUC is a symbolic partner of PAP.</p>
              <p>You alway hear Govt pouring out millions if not billions to help the lower income, people like me, earning below 3k, more due to idling than working. or per capital less than $750, meaning if I earn 5k per month, but because of 2 old parents, one housewife, 3 kids plus me, equal 7, 5k divided by 7, each get only $710, this is call per capital. So, I am under the poor cat in singapore, with that, the govt give money thru NTUC and CC to the workers or drivers, so tap on it.</p>
              <p>When you join something, must know what you are joining, what are the benefits, many join insurance also do not know much about the covering, then hit one case, agents said this not covered, oh brain tumor ar,..that one not covered, so end up get conned.</p>
              <p>On the hand, learn to spend prudently, buy what is suppose to buy and what is not suppose, I still using lux soap, nokia first gen phone, and wash my casket uniform with washing soap, cos it last very long. Spent wisely</p>
