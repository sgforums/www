              hello all i just started not long i have a couple of questions hope the experts can help:
              
              No. 1:  Do the taxi stands at some places/areas belong to or fall under certain taxi coys? because i was turning into 313 taxi stand queue, suddenly a sonanata cut in from the left side used for alighting people and stop park in front me.  when i got out to talk to the driver, the driver just pointed to his coy brand and signaled me to refer to a square board or something at the start of the taxi queue. i walked back to see, really there is a small white sign put Comfort/Citycab name at the top, in front of other taxi coys names that are smaller print and listed separately further underneath. The first passenger came along and saw that front cab, got in and left.
              
              No 2: I was at Giant Tampines and parked 2nd behind another sonanata. A family was still loading plastic bags into that first cab. Then I looked into rear view mirror and saw a second sonanata came up parked behind me, and also saw a couple walking out with full trolley from Giant exit behind that 3rd cab. Suddenly that 3rd cab driver jumped out opened up his boot, and helped push the couple trolley to his car and started helping load their plastic bags into his boot. I thought something strange so I sounded a light horn. The couple and that 3rd cab driver just looked up a bit, that cab driver raised both hands like he dont know anything, then continued helping that couple load. After loading finish, the couple pushed the trolley aside, got into that 3rd cab and drove away, leaving me at taxi stand still. 
              
              Did I miss anything?

              <p>Case 1 - Unless that cab is oncall, he is jumping Q &amp; smokes newbie like you.</p>
              <p>Case 2 - Some pax don't/cannot take other companies cab except the Blue &amp; Yellow one. So if you drive other colour cab, suck thumb lor even if you are in the front of a Q.</p>
              <p>Btw, sonata got only 1 "na". Even if you tulan them also no need to spell as soNANAta leh.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Insg is correct. The blue yellow cab treats pax very well, and is very nice on their wallet. Eg if u got the POSB everyday credit card, can get 1% off your taxi fare. So it is possible that for case 2, the passengers wanted to take a blue yellow cab only, so just too bad for you. But case 1 is a confirmed queue jumping phui cabby with a bag of tricks for pax and cabbies alike.</p></div>

              <p>Rules are set by peoples, and peoples are born to make mistakes, some of this Taxis stand and Q spots are just crazy design, you need to be flexible in yr day in and day out driving, if there alots of paxs at the stand, and not much taxi, you seek the pax inside yr taxi to understand that you want to do a connection and make a living, most will agree and be happy to let you drop them with just a few step of extra walking, unless it is raining and that drop off is the only place got shelter, then no choice.</p>
              <p>Same goes to places of interest like MBS or even hotels, when they got lots of paxs, the rules of the game change, in fact, they want to you drop yr pax on the way to the pick up stand and block the drop off zone to prevent you to buzz off. Be flexible, it is not a traffic offence or something, knn, hotel boys can be strict and naughty at time, order us to Q proper behind the line, move off when no pax, and ask us not to block this and that, then when hotel full of guests wanting to take cab, they can even go out the road to ask you to come in, where you park or move also nevermind. We need to be flexible and nimble, work along with the condition, dun tell me u go around the AP taxi Q road when it is a png time?</p>
