              flat) isnt an investment its just a roof over your head.</p>
              <p>And if properties in oppositions ward is gonna be dirt cheap
              like you are so afraid it will happen. I am sure many foreign

              <p>Of course you right simple reasoning, because you got a simple mind.</p>
              <p>Tomorrow no PAP govt, all the multi-national companies will pull out, changi airport will close down, the civil servants all stop working is it? Ang Mo all run away?</p>
              <p>No bus services, no mrt everything sink ah?</p>
              <p>Please la, don't tax that small brain of yours too much.</p>
              <p>Yes PAP did a good job, but fark la, this is is a city state, no matter who was in charge, we would reach developed status, but some idiots believe all the bull shit the get from the PAP.</p>
              <p>And don't forget who created the current mess with FTs, not the opposition, not the people but your briliant PAP stop at 2 policy, never think that in 20 years time, the whole country will come to a standstill, so now trying to pay people have more children and bring in FT.</p>
              <p>If you cant see the shit in a policy like this, no need to explain anything further, because your small mind cant take it.</p>
              <p>Property prices go down, go down ki lan, who raised the property prices, this is public housing supposed to help people have a home for the future not a debt for life.</p>
              <p>In other countries big or small, rich or poor, govt is there to serve and protect, here it's people to serve and obey the govt and every fuck all policy.</p>
              <p>Singapore will sink without the PAP, yeah believe this shit la.</p>
              <p>Never mind let your children and grandchildren die with debt, as long a few can make money dealing in property and business, fuck care the rest.</p>

              <p>Our country got no natural resouces. Our only resource is people like you and me. Its an economy driven by people from the time Raffles founded singapore until when PAP was in power until now.</p>
              <p>Our economy is driven by the people not the govt.</p>
              <p>Stop having the illusion that our country was an engineered economy under PAP.</p>
              <p>The PAP merely inherited the success of what the british had done for the last 140 years and not a so called sleepy fishing village as they always like to proclaimed</p>
