              <p>But then, there are many India new citizens who are here as FTalents, end up become foreign trashes, many had see the the limelight of singapore only, once step in, the cost of living can hit them hard, and when these former indian nationals can hardly work, unless the boss is an indian, they end up, lost their jobs.</p>
              <p>As a foreign trash buying a HDB is no joke, unless those who are millionaires Foreigner, but these millionaires only prefer to be PR not citizenship. And unlike those indian workers who are provided with housing, transport, work, return air tickets, these trashes have to dig their way out. End up, they find themselves suffering like a mid or lower class Singaporeans</p>
              <p>Furthermore, places like india and china are well know for political revolts and demanding, therefore, I do not see these Trashes end up only supporting PAP all the way.</p>

              <p>There are 3 issues that govern what PAP had still fail to do, or that they had done some changes, but the result did not materialise or still on the way.</p>
              <p>1. Housing prices, for years since Mah, the horse face, had said, House is still affordable to Singaporeans till now, prices is still going up. And just to let you know that govt had tried 6 rounds of cooling measure, but still up, recently, because of this by or bi election, PAP govt intro a hardcore cooling measure, so question is, why did not do it earlier? Now you do it, we have to wait for the result in a few month to year time.</p>
              <p>2. Foreign policy, till now, these cut and that levy increase had not really deter foreigner from coming in, still there are inflow, and in fact, just last year, they extended unskill workers Work permit to last for 10 years instead of just 6 years, and for those skill from 15 to 18 years. Is this the way to go in reducing foreigners?? is your levy high enought to deter employers from employing cheap foreigners and push aside locals unless locals is willing to accept low wages?</p>
              <p>3. The cost of living, recently announced inflation for the whole of last year stand at 4.8% and it will continue to be high, by compounding it, 3 years of 5% is equivalent to 15% increment in price of goods and services...have our taxi fare increased that much, have workers salary increased that much??</p>

              <p>Let me be clear on myself that I am not a fan of politics, not PAP or WP or whatever foam and orgy party.</p>
              <p>But as a Layman, which i believe most of us are, if St Michael Palmer did not have that affair, what happen?? are sure govt is going to cool down the housing, give higher $$ to new born?</p>
              <p>And the policy change by PAP in what you see now even before the election, is ready trying to solve all the above 3 problems, if without the election? without palmer affair, we might be still goes on day by day, p n g, call and take, Q and wait.</p>
              <p>Then we have to judge for ourselves, take a vision if WP won,  what and how will it impact our PAP governing?</p>

              I won't be surprised. In the last election the WP candidate gained herself about 40% over per cent and this time round she will gain more. Plus that, RP and SDA would gain some per centage in that by election and leave PAP candidate with little margin to gain that 50% over per cent to get that majority votes from Punggol East residents. I'm just wondering, is there such a thing in Singapore as a coalition ruling in the by election should PAP candidate failed to achieve 50% vote in this by election thing.

              <p>Our election system is First past the post.</p>
              <p>3 candidate and above. the candidate with the most percentage win the electoral seat.</p>
              <p>Motions and bills can only be pass in parliament if 2/3 of MPs voted for it.</p>
              <p>Political party need to win 50% of parliament seats to form ruling govt.</p>
              <p>If no parties win the majority to form the govt. Than its call a "Hung Parliament"</p>
              <p>Negotiation with various parties will than begin to try to form a coalition govt.</p>

              <p><br>It is not that I do not hear or read Dr Chee's manifesto and lecturing on politic of Singapore, but I find it very dry, that is my comment and opinon.</p>
              <p>And for your info, I do not read any local papers, just the global nets information and some oversea journals.</p>
              <p>For me, academy PhDs are usually straitjacket guys, and that also apply to some of our scholars in the PAP.  As patriotic as they are to the country and so wanting to serve, they lack the skrew and cunning of a true blue politician. It is not about something that you see not right and go all the way to make it right, and think that you are the righteous of all rights.</p>
              <p>Of course I know he is patriotic, wanting to serve, help the people, but like any PhD guys, mostly are bull headed, and that is also why Doctorate guys are seldom make head of a country or top businessmen. You simply have to change strategy when things cannot work out, not bang all the way and assume that you are in the right course with your stubborn PhD mentality, the refusal to change and adapt lead to your misunderstanding of the ground and therefore your popularity.</p>
              <p>Politics do not ask for sympathy, nor does it ask for illusionist, any down to earth person who understand the ground and able to change, to move and to evade for the better and adaption along with the ground is a good politican, otherwise, TCSS lecture and shouting at enemy is not going to work, and in fact, get worst.</p>

              <p>In another 10 years, that is another 10 years to worry, who will wins tomorrow election is going to affect what will happen in the next 10 years, so why worry about 10 years later? Let look nearer, and that is just tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Smrt PRC drivers strike,. first in singapore since 1986, and the first industrial action since the begining of the 2000. Just 12 years into foreign dependent, foreigners goes on strike. Hopefully now that the govt see Singaporeans as the most guai guai citizen and best worker who never think of strike.</p>
              <p>And now you are saying immigrant childrens who are going to be Singaporean is going to vote for PAP in near future? you better think twice, the mentality and genes of foreigners against govt is 100 times worst than us, you might get more strikes, more riots and certainly more violent politics that new PAP MPs  or Ministers have never seen before like the SMRT Strike. This is just the begining and warning is sounded.</p>
