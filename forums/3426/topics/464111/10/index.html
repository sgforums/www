              <p>U know everything from day 1 is it? Who the fark are u to demand he stop driving just because he dunno Ritz Charlton?</p>
              <p>give him a break man! he just a newbie, sometimes abit over enthusiatic.</p>
              <p>Or are u guys treating him like that cos he is pro PAP? Grow up man! still so childish!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hey Guan, if there is something that u really need to learn, it's to keep your mouth shut! Too high profile will invite all the unwanted attention.</p>
              <p>U think making your stand of pro PAP works in this taxi forum? u just make yourself a target punching bag for these "enlightened" ones, and a silly one at that.</p>
              <p>So what WP wins? so what more seats lost in next election? so what PAP lose power? Nothing is permanent apart for the impermanence. As an example, what's the point of nagging and naggind to yr child about the danger of going near fire or hot water pot. Let them get burnt once is anytime better than yr consistent nagging.</p>
              <p>Let them feel that such a small country, any one leading also can have the same result. Whoever can think of that? really pig brained. oops! sorry, pig brain supposed to be good nourishment for the brain. No brainer more appropriate in this case.</p>
              <p>To these ppl, those not anti PAP all stupid, they all so smart, so what's the point of arguement here? save all yr brain cellls la.</p>
              <p>Writing long post and fighting your stand here needs energy u know? might as well use yr energy to take more calls. So what is u win here? any price? I've learned not to waste my time here liao. rather play with my chicken..</p>

              As for those polices created by those policy makers , we cannot do anything , so let put it one side , no point debating here , although we knew it will be soon , very soon , that those policies will be a downfall for them eventually .
              
              Just a matter of time .

              <p>To all the PAP supporters in here who thinks the party is so wonderful and cares for you, please explain to me 2 policies that have effects until today:</p>
              <p>1) the stop at 2 policy</p>
              <p>2) Graduates mother's policy</p>
              <p>And pray tell who were the ones that made this policy (besides LKY), they are still around today, Wong Kan Seng, GCT, Mah Bow Tan, LHL.</p>
              <p>Yes, they did some very good things for Singapore, I wont deny that, but whatever they did, you think they think about you, TDs and all the other blue collar workers, all those doing lower paid jobs first?</p>
              <p>Who their policies have to benefit first? All the so call elites, the rich, their RC members, high flying civil servants - the polcies are for them first, then whatever balance, if you can benefit then good for you. If not, then just follow us, we will sort this out later ok.</p>
              <p>Until today they won't tell you how much it cost to built a block of HDB flats. And they claim to have the best brains, the best brains never think that the population will age? Why built flats without lifts at every floor? Your father mother until 90 years can climb stairs is it? Upgrading you have to pay also.</p>
              <p>Built MRT, never consider wear and tear, break-downs?</p>
              <p>So go ahead all the good people here who thinks the PAP really loves you, yes they do, but hello, please remember love also got favourites ah, they love you, but you got to wait your turn ah. They need to love certain people first and then come and love you.</p>
              <p>Even if it means that loving foreigners. Foreigners who become citizens and have families have priority over newly married with no children, when buying HDB.</p>
              <p>So tell your sons and daughters, please be patient and wait your turn, take a queue number. If you wanna cut queue by all means, go to Ah Guan he got some nice private property to sell you.</p>
              <p>Or maybe you go and sweet talk Hammer2, if he good mood he let you stay his family condo.</p>
              <p>If not shut up and follow your leader. If not you have to repent.</p>

              <p>1 other thing abt Sg politics, never argue with bookies.</p>
              <p>I dunno where they get their sources, but always choon. Last election tip is Opposition under 7 - 1 GRC 1 SMC and maybe 1 more SMC (should have been Potong Pasir).</p>
              <p>Hougang by election - WP win with 60%</p>
              <p>This by election take WP win by 1200 votes win 8.</p>
              <p>And if go back further, I remember 2001 and 2006, opp win - over 2.5 win full lose less, under win 7.5</p>

              <p>Hey, u just a big farking bully!</p>
              <p>U know everything is it? Cannot dunno Ritz Carlton?</p>
              <p>U know everything from day 1 is it? Who the fark are u to demand
              he stop driving just because he dunno Ritz Charlton?</p>
              <p>give him a break man! he just a newbie, sometimes abit over
              enthusiatic.</p>
              <p>Or are u guys treating him like that cos he is pro PAP? Grow up
              man! still so childish!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hey Guan, if there is something that u really need to learn,
              it's to keep your mouth shut! Too high profile will invite all the
              unwanted attention.</p>
              <p>U think making your stand of pro PAP works in this taxi forum? u
              just make yourself a target punching bag for these "enlightened"
              ones, and a silly one at that.</p>
              <p>So what WP wins? so what more seats lost in next election? so
              what PAP lose power? Nothing is permanent apart for the
              impermanence. As an example, what's the point of nagging and
              naggind to yr child about the danger of going near fire or hot
              water pot. Let them get burnt once is anytime better than yr
              consistent nagging.</p>
              <p>Let them feel that such a small country, any one leading also
              can have the same result. Whoever can think of that? really pig
              brained. oops! sorry, pig brain supposed to be good nourishment for
              the brain. No brainer more appropriate in this case.</p>
              <p>To these ppl, those not anti PAP all stupid, they all so smart,
              so what's the point of arguement here? save all yr brain cellls
              la.</p>
              <p>Writing long post and fighting your stand here needs energy u
              know? might as well use yr energy to take more calls. So what is u
              win here? any price? I've learned not to waste my time here liao.
              rather play with my chicken..</p>
