              license. The instructor did not tell you to give way if there is a
              faster vehicle coming from behind? Or you did not check your mirror
              so you did not know the Kia coming from behind?</p>

              <p>I feel the majority of no road hogging attitude on this thread.
              But let's put in a fair word. More than 50% of right lane users in
              SG bo chap one. So the fact is we are really the minority.</p>
              <p>You can convince a few drivers, but doesn't change the shitty
              driving experience in SG. To be honest I am a culprit of agressive
              overtaking. Sometimes the whole highway empty, then each car block
              one lane, no room to overtake at all. temper builds each second I
              have to wait. I will overtake aggressively. But one time this bitch
              started horning at me and flash high beam at me (see char bor
              driver= temper x 1.5 times), I slam my fucking brakes until all
              wheels lock up.</p>
              <p>Not that I encourage aggressive behaviour but tulan time means
              tulan. Can't help it one.</p>

              <p>The typical right rule of thumb for singapore driving is</p>
              <p>For a 3 lanes expressway, lane 1, 90-100..lane 2, 80-90 and
              lane 3, 70-80.</p>
              <p>For all other normal road lane lane 1 60-70, lane 2, 50-60.</p>
              <p>So if you are travelling at 80 on a lane 1 expressway, zhi tong
              abit lah, even china zhi Tong bus also can travel at 70 on lane 3,
              you sped up or else go join the zhi Tong bus at lane 3.</p>
              <p>For normal road, due to traffic light, and lots of obstacle, it
              is up to your skill, in fact, if you notice, accident happen more
              on expressway than in normal road, because at expressway, the
              concentration is less, and those driving long hrs may doze off, as
              compare to normal road, you are alway more alert. Alert for traffic

              <p>TS, it is drivers like u<span> that contribute to
              jams daily!! Travelling at the speed limit doesn't give u the right

              <p>Actually no need to keep left after overtaking lah. If says lane 2 cars only doing 80-90km/h on a highway you can go at 100km/h lane 1 no problem. But if got car coming behind faster then you then must siam liao. Even I doing 120km/h I also siam another car which I think is going at 140km/h min. And that car is a Transcab Sampan!!! The driver really got balls!!! That time is 10pm CTE towards SLE I go 120km/h already balls shrink a bit cos moderate traffic. Must salute the Sampan uncle....with pax somemore....Lol</p>

              <p>bro, mayb u misunderstand as with them what i m trying to say.</p>
              <p>the coupe's overtaking was reckless, thats the truth.</p>
              <p>if every1 tulan and do this stunt, alot car go scrap yard.</p>
              <p>me driving within speed limit doesn't mean i don't give way to emergency vehicles.</p>
              <p>when i see 1, whether on on siren or not, i give way.</p>
              <p>i seem so many these so call speedster don't even give way to these vehicles.</p>
              <p>to them, any vehicles below their speed limit is hogging.</p>
              <p>but if there is a tp, who do u think he will catch?</p>
              <p>the car driving 70-80 on a 70 ed or someone speeding at 100 on a 70 road?</p>
              <p>chances is the speedster.</p>
              <p>y, cos its more dangerous.</p>
              <p>thats y if i see some1 slower than my speed on the right lane, i usually overtake.</p>
              <p>i don't expect the car to give way cos, they got their rights.</p>
              <p>since we want go faster, we should do it in a safe way.</p>
