              <p>I feel the majority of no road hogging attitude on this thread. But let's put in a fair word. More than 50% of right lane users in SG bo chap one. So the fact is we are really the minority.</p>
              <p>You can convince a few drivers, but doesn't change the shitty driving experience in SG. To be honest I am a culprit of agressive overtaking. Sometimes the whole highway empty, then each car block one lane, no room to overtake at all. temper builds each second I have to wait. I will overtake aggressively. But one time this bitch started horning at me and flash high beam at me (see char bor driver= temper x 1.5 times), I slam my fucking brakes until all wheels lock up.</p>
              <p>Not that I encourage aggressive behaviour but tulan time means tulan. Can't help it one.</p>

              <p>Just practicing the correct defensive driving and whether u hogger or aggressive driver, you are answering to yourself.</p>

              <p>The typical right rule of thumb for singapore driving is</p>
              <p>For a 3 lanes expressway, lane 1, 90-100..lane 2, 80-90 and lane 3, 70-80.</p>
              <p>For all other normal road lane lane 1 60-70, lane 2, 50-60.</p>
              <p>So if you are travelling at 80 on a lane 1 expressway, zhi tong abit lah, even china zhi Tong bus also can travel at 70 on lane 3, you sped up or else go join the zhi Tong bus at lane 3.</p>
              <p>For normal road, due to traffic light, and lots of obstacle, it is up to your skill, in fact, if you notice, accident happen more on expressway than in normal road, because at expressway, the concentration is less, and those driving long hrs may doze off, as compare to normal road, you are alway more alert. Alert for traffic light change, pedestrians, cyclist and chio bus</p>

              <p>Highway code (Basic Theory in Driving) states that keep left unless overtaking. Overtaking can be done only on the right, can overtake on left only when vehicles in front turning right.</p>
              <p>On Malaysian highway it is an offence to overtake on the left, that's why fast oncoming cars will honk and high beam at slow movers moving at "I'm travelling at the speed limit so I'm not wrong drivers" on the right lane. The right lane is called also the overtaking lane.</p>
              <p>One road hogger can cause a long 'dragon' forming kilometeres behind him. Imagine an ambulance rushing his relative to hospital caught in this dragon he created thus making it lose precious time in reaching medical help. All actions have cause and effect, a simple act of road hogging (ignorant of the highway code basics) can potentially cause someone's tragedy.</p>
              <p>The slogan on the EMAS flashes "Think of your love ones, drive safely." should be changed to "Don't be the cause of fellow motorists tragedies."</p>

              <p>Sometime look for addresses in those knn housing estate or private houses, I also road hog, but once you learn to admit that you road hog, wave and apologise to other, it will make everyone a better day.</p>
              <p>Just acknowledge that you road hogged other, move out or sped up, no harm done. The frustration part is people do not want to acknowledge and still very stubborn about their right, that is where the problem come in.</p>
              <p>Yes, people knock your back, you can claim your rights rightfully, but what is the use, end up, you get to rest with less income and more paperwork, people just claim insurance and most of them got substitute car to drive with their comprehensive insurance packages.</p>
              <p>I ever see one honda Intergra purposely whack hard into a new sabaru for road hogging. knn, his temper must be boiling that time.</p>

              <p>It's wonderful what a simple wave of the hand to signal your gratitude can do.Motorists shoud be doing this more often, wave when others give way to you, wave when you are in the wrong, courtesy goes a long way in calming tempers on the road. </p>
              <p>I had written to the TP suggesting they advertised snippets of highway codes and it's penalty on public transport to re-educate and remind motorists.</p>
              <p>Had a lady driver told me that she do not know not signalling her intention when turning is an offence amounting to a fine. Next time she said she will signal because she might be fined. Imagine what selfishness, do the right thing so would not be fined and not because of safety to other motorists. But alas no fish, prawn also can.</p>

              <p>Yes, by waving and show sigh of thumb up, thank you can make all drivers a better day, and when you get acknowledged back with waving, it just show the understanding and appreciation. I bet all TDs including me will alway appreciate some good sign given to us on the road.</p>
              <p>Because vehicle is unlike human coming face to face, people can said, excuse me, or I am sorry in public to each other, but for vehicles, the communicating channel is usually the honks and headlights, and this is alway taken as a aggressive gesture in a certain way. Therefore, by waving, it can help to deviate the misunderstanding.</p>
