              <p>The road is not a expressway. It is a two lane <strong>road.</strong> Viaducts are not expressways too. Speed limits are set for safety reasons, not for the purpose of making you unhappy. A clear road ahead is no excuse for speeding above the speed limit.</p>
              <p>The red coupe overtook from the left lane and should have remained in that lane and sped on since the road is clear.</p>
              <p>There are some of erroneous thinking on our roads.</p>
              <p>1. On expressyways Lane 1 is for fast driving. No, it is for overtaking. But the this rule is useles, because Singapore is ultra congested and cannot afford to sacrifice one lane</p>
              <p>2. Signal and switch lane. Wrong. Signal, and check if it is possible to change lane. If possible change, if cannot wait for an opportinity. Not signal and swerve, thinking behind vehicle must brake and let you, even at 90kmph.</p>
              <p>3. Safe stopping distance, after got driving licence, to hell with it.</p>

              <p>Well, IMHO if u fear being summon if u go abv speed limits. U can always practise give way :) is that not in yr dictionary my dear sir? Accident?? Wow....

              <p>Again u're thinking too much by asking wat makes me think speedsters will give way. It's not abt wat others do, u mean u consider so much abt wat others do before u make a simple decision to give way?? So by default u assume others will not give way I suppose, hence yr decision of not giving way.</p>
              <p>As for the other statements abt the coup, it's between the two of u. My point here is simple, dun be a road hog. Period. </p>

              <p>1. Lane 1 is for overtaking. After overtaking, go back to lane 2. Don't hog lane 1. Singapore is congested. I agree. But lane 1 is already sacrificed for overtaking. Problem starts when drivers think that travelling at the speed limit on lane 1 is ok. It is not Ok. It is road hogging.</p>
              <p>Speed limit is for safety. If speed limit is 90 kmh, travelling at this speed on lane 3 or 2 is ok. If there is a vehicle travelling at 80kmph on lane 2 and you feel is obstructing you, check rear mirror, signal and switch to lane 1 safely. Then you can overtake this vehicle above speed limit. After overtaking, check mirror, signal and move back to lane 2. I believe all this is covered in Highway Code. Looks like many drivers forgot this.</p>
              <p>2. Agree with this too.</p>

              <p>Ah tan, I don't blame you. I think many of us are guilty of this, both scenarios - a) as a road hogger, b) even when not intending to hog, get frustrated by unreasonable high beam flashers and closely following, c) doing what the coupe to a hogger to teach him a lesson.</p>
              <p>I admit I have done all 3 and accept all of which are wrong, but that's the thing about driving, after such incidents we can reflect on what's right ot wrong. </p>
              <p>Make no mistake, I am not here to judge you or your actions. But like I said at the start from what the video showed I think you are also in the wrong for hogging, even unintentionally and of course that guy is also wrong, even if he was frustrated (fairly or unfairly by your actions).</p>
              <p>So if you go the TP route, you might also get warned, although i seriously doubt they can summon you. For a summon to stand, there must be a witness and evidence. And the witness if a law enforcement officer means the case will surely stand, For members of the public, it depends on other factors - evidence and realibility of that evidence (just because got camera doesn't mean will succeed). Don't compare to the Rochor accident, that video will stand no matter what - that is a national case and the prosecution will fight all the way (if the Ferrari driver lived). </p>
              <p>For normal cases, I doubt TP will summon each and everyone of the videos sent in, like that they will be swamped and encourage vigilantism (something our police doesn't encourage). So I don't think they will summon the coupe partly because of your action, but they cannot summon you as there is no evidence to show your offence, just presumption.</p>
              <p>Let this incident make you reflect, maybe next time you will be more conscious of drivers behind you, but I also disagree with other users saying must keep left unless overtaking all the time. If you are driving with flow (everyone is going at the same speed and traffic flow is smooth, why must keep left?) Like that all our roads will jam. If you are driving say at 100kmh on expressway on lane 1, lane 2 a car driving at the same speed and behind another car a the same speed, and say a faster comes behind you, how to keep left, when there is no chance? So you have to keep left in this case when it becoems practical for you, the car behind you can high beam all he wants, what are you supposed to do? Disappear?</p>
              <p>Let's face it the Law here is to whack you, why then is the speed limit 60kmh on normal roads, 80-90 on expressways? Because at 60kmh, you can stop in 1 car length, highways are calibrated at the lower scale 90kmh instead of the more normal driving speed of 100-110kmh (like in Malaysia).</p>
              <p>In this vein just because you drive at 90kmh on the right most lane, doesn't mean you should just heck care about faster cars behind you. All depends on circumstances.</p>
              <p>Like I said if we can follow our Malaysian friends and accept these 2 basic rules, whoever in front gets to go first even over right of way (unless there is danger to allow this) and always let a faster car overtake, If we can accept and encourage this, i think we can become better drivers.</p>

              <p>Ah tan, I don't blame you. I think many of us are guilty of
              this, both scenarios - a) as a road hogger, b) even when not
              intending to hog, get frustrated by unreasonable high beam flashers
              and closely following, c) doing what the coupe to a hogger to teach
              him a lesson.</p>
              <p>I admit I have done all 3 and accept all of which are wrong, but
              that's the thing about driving, after such incidents we can reflect
              on what's right ot wrong. </p>
              <p>Make no mistake, I am not here to judge you or your actions. But
              like I said at the start from what the video showed I think you are
              also in the wrong for hogging, even unintentionally and of course
              that guy is also wrong, even if he was frustrated (fairly or
              unfairly by your actions).</p>
              <p>So if you go the TP route, you might also get warned, although i
              seriously doubt they can summon you. For a summon to stand, there
              must be a witness and evidence. And the witness if a law
              enforcement officer means the case will surely stand, For members
              of the public, it depends on other factors - evidence and
              realibility of that evidence (just because got camera doesn't mean
              will succeed). Don't compare to the Rochor accident, that video
              will stand no matter what - that is a national case and the
              prosecution will fight all the way (if the Ferrari driver
              lived). </p>
              <p>For normal cases, I doubt TP will summon each and everyone of
              the videos sent in, like that they will be swamped and encourage
              vigilantism (something our police doesn't encourage). So I don't
              think they will summon the coupe partly because of your action, but
              they cannot summon you as there is no evidence to show your
              offence, just presumption.</p>
              <p>Let this incident make you reflect, maybe next time you will be
              more conscious of drivers behind you, but I also disagree with
              other users saying must keep left unless overtaking all the time.
              If you are driving with flow (everyone is going at the same speed
              and traffic flow is smooth, why must keep left?) Like that all our
              roads will jam. If you are driving say at 100kmh on expressway on
              lane 1, lane 2 a car driving at the same speed and behind another
              car a the same speed, and say a faster comes behind you, how to
              keep left, when there is no chance? So you have to keep left in
              this case when it becoems practical for you, the car behind you can
              high beam all he wants, what are you supposed to do? Disappear?</p>
              <p>Let's face it the Law here is to whack you, why then is the
              speed limit 60kmh on normal roads, 80-90 on expressways? Because at
              60kmh, you can stop in 1 car length, highways are calibrated at the
              lower scale 90kmh instead of the more normal driving speed of
              100-110kmh (like in Malaysia).</p>
              <p>In this vein just because you drive at 90kmh on the right most
              lane, doesn't mean you should just heck care about faster cars
              behind you. All depends on circumstances.</p>
              <p>Like I said if we can follow our Malaysian friends and accept
              these 2 basic rules, whoever in front gets to go first even over
              right of way (unless there is danger to allow this) and always let
              a faster car overtake, If we can accept and encourage this, i think
              we can become better drivers.</p>

              <p>joe, like what u said, everyone had done it...whether they admit or not is another think.</p>
              <p>believe it or not, tp the most give me warning letter for speeding and not rd hogging.</p>
              <p>and like what i had said before, y expect people to give way (unless e-vehicles).</p>
              <p>they paid their rd tax too.</p>
              <p>thats y when i see slower vehicles, i just overtake them.</p>
              <p>no point tailgate, highbeam, horning.</p>
              <p>it will only cause more tempers.</p>

              <p>Don't you think a faster driver is also a road hog, when he

              <p>so am i right to say that if one thinks the vehicle infront is slow, just overtake safely.</p>
              <p>no point to tailgate, highbeam, horning to get them to give way.</p>
              <p>what the use of getting flustered when it can b solved so easily.</p>
              <p>i like this <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>'The one who thinks others should get out of his way, is

              <p>I thought even MRT escalator in Singapore also pratice
              this,<strong>keep left rule</strong>.In many countries (like Japan,

              escalator to leave one side (left or right) for people to pass by,
              so that people who want to move forward can use one side and those

              <p>If you drive on a one lane road below speed limit, it is not

                  is speeding.</p>
              <p>If you drive on a two or three lane road, the outermost lane
                  (Lane 1) is for overtaking only. You can drive below the speed
                  limit, or at the speed limit, on Lane 2 or Lane 3. No road hogging
                  here. If you drive above the speed limit on Lane 2 or 3, it is
                  speeding.</p>
              <p>If you drive above the speed limit on Lane 1 to overtake a

                  limit, it is road hogging + speeding.</p>
              <p>Lane 1 is for overtaking only. Even if speed limit is 90kmh and
                  you are travelling at 100kmh or more on Lane 1, is considered road
                  hogging or to make it more clear, Lane 1 obstruction.</p>
              <p>Move to lane 2 to avoid obstructing other drivers driving way

              <p>pls raise yr hand, how many people had drive drive at speed or slightly above speed limit on lane 1 &amp; with at least 3-4 vehicles behind get booked by passing tp for rd hogging?</p>
