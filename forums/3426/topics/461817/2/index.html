              <p>Great , now they wanna dictate wat time and wat mileage to clock to us. Isnt Td driving suppose to be Free N easy?</p>
              <p>If they wanna dictate , they should be giving out more benefits like the more u run , the lesser rental u pay rather than that lousy TDVL discount.</p>

              think you will be forced to find a relief. thats why the Adviser Ang Hin Kee say matching service will be provided.
              
              they also wants to cut down those using cabs for own business. Personally, I will also be affected cos I drive less due to health problems.eventhough I am not OMO ah pek.
              My relief is  also semi-retired. Problem comes when people get sick and cannot hit target...

              there actually not much worry on the latest implementation they are going to have
                  
              250km for a geniue tds with both shift or omo not a difficult task
                  
              look like target those who take and use as personal transport, only question is currently
                  
              how many are there who ply very little but use more for other purpose.
                  
              if thus group of so call tds are gone due to new ruling and the vehicle is actually really
                  
              on the road, what is the impact to the existing tds collection?
                  
              since we know there is many waiting list of drivers wanting to become tds.
                  
              does the downloading of meter which is done regular tell any sign of the numbers of 
                  
              drivers who use more for personal rather making a living as tds?
                  
              we shall wait and see.

              another issue we need to be concern is the droping and picking up pax in CBD areas,
                       
              what is the next step to do, still Q at taxi stand or start looking for pax on the street just as
                       
              we did outside the CBD? will most pax ditch taxi stands in CBD? H hours start calling
                       
              from roadside to book a taxi and how tds are going to response on this road side booking
                       
              as now mostly reject call booking (no peanatly) which is at road side as it has the highest
                       
              chances being put aeroplane by pax. LTA still eat too much xxx xxxxx soup, donâ€™t they
                       
              think carefully before implementing something old( not new cos used to be like that)
                       
              no Q means pax will fight, no Q mean taxi will never reach taxi stand to pick unless there
                       
              is pax to drop off, no taxi go to taxi stand mean pax will still complain no tax( plus erp deter taxi going into CBD)
                       
              woh, so many to things going to happen , then later start another round of changes again
                       
              we shall see

              <p>to offset the cost, got to WORK for 4-5 hours if lucky, if not lucky, as long as 10 hours also have, and is a daily basis, rain or shine.</p>
              <p>there is no free ride, or even easy ride, transport in Singapore never come cheap for any types, there is effort and money to pay.</p>

              <p>No need to get excited over such a stupid rule.</p>
              <p>On paper it's looks very nice that exactly what civil servants wanna show their bosses.</p>
              <p>In practise, it really makes no difference except maybe those who use taxis as a personal vehicle. Then again the percentage of these users are very small.</p>
              <p>For normal hirers who drive omo, also 250km is not difficult to reach. Most already do so.</p>
              <p>For those with releif don't say, 250 is nothing. Even 1 of my hirers who drives relax, say from 10 am to 6 pm before handing to me, he clocks under 200km most days. For me lagi idle, 5-7 hours on wekdays definitely under 200km, say 175km or so, he does roughly the same, so 250km is easily reached.</p>
              <p>For peak hours, maybe that's a slight problem, but it's not really our concern. We drive when we want to, if CDG and other companies want compliance then they gotta start showing some real carrots not peanuts.</p>
              <p>What they gonna do? Force us to drive? Like that many hirers will have to return vehicle, if they wanna penalise us, in the end they will end up with more relief than hirers, or more vehicles in the yard.</p>
              <p>Very simple, say I (or any other drivers) got not enough rest, cannot get up for 6am start, only wake up at 8.30am? What they gonna do? Terminate a hirer or relief?</p>
              <p>For me, I rarely start at 6pm anyway, maybe around 7 until 1 or 2 am? What they gonna do? Warning letter?</p>
              <p>They give me warning letter for this, I guarantee you, I will write to Lim Swee Say (NTUC chief). </p>
              <p>Anyway if I do drive the peak periods (also other drivers) can LTA guarantee we get passengers all the way? What guarantee can they give that I won't be running empty searching for pax, whether in or out of CBD. Got no passenger how, who's gonna compensate me for driving the extra hours, tiring myself more, using more fuel etc?</p>
              <p>But the only problem is some stupid drivers or hirers, kiasi will go all out to try and achieve this stupid targets. That will make CDG especially more yaya papaya.</p>
              <p>If majority of drivers just carry on as normal and fuck care this stupid rule, drive their normal routine, then the ones breaking sweat will be the companies, because they will have  a problem renewing their fleet.</p>
              <p>Just imagine if CDG cannot renew 500 vehicles in 1 year because they fail to meet the target, same goes with other companies (with less % of vehicles), what you think will happen?</p>
              <p>A) Lta will scrap this rule or make some exceptions (because failing to renew will mean lesser cabs on the road and the taxi crunch will end up worse)</p>
              <p>B) CDG and others will be very very nice to hirers and even relief, like back in 2006 or 2007, everything also can kao tim. All sorts of patterns, like weekend hiring of vehicle for around $270, they even had a weekday one, I remember getting a call, rent from Mon to Thurs at special rate. Yes, CDG did all this, without fail, every month I would get a call inviting me back to driving.</p>

              <p>I dunno if Poolman, Angwk, Komade, Bowah, Hammer2 and the other seniors here agree, but this stupid rule is actually a very good one for drivers, if drivers unite and have the same thinking.</p>
              <p>That is: This is not our problem, this is a company problem. The company must give very good incentives to 'persuade' us to drive and help them achieve these targets set by LTA for them.</p>
              <p>The key words here are 'persuade' and 'help them', not 'force us to drive' or 'penalise for not helping them'.</p>
              <p>If drivers (especially hirers) just carry on as per normal, doing their best to earn for themselves and their family, and let the company worry about this. Don't go drive extra or during peak just because of this, drive only because they want to or need to, then CDG and companies will be forced to offer attractive incentives - lower rental, fuel discounts etc.</p>
              <p>And drivers must not just accept whatever peanuts tossed their way, like monkeys grabbing them. Say CDG give out lucky draw prizes (discounts or cash) every week, like they did for NETs initially and a monthly draw (free rental to a lucky hirer). This is all peanuts and should be ignored.</p>
              <p>If TDs stand their ground, they will end up in a better position because of this rule, because more or less, driving 250km or peak is what they normally do anyway. But by standing their ground, they will force companies to reward them for doing what they normally do. If they do extra, then there must be something to show for it.</p>

              <p>This rule compliance is like a game of poker or a staring contest. As long as drivers don't fold and call their bluff or don't blink, they will win.</p>
              <p>Dare the company to sack or terminate drivers who cannot meet this targets, how many can they afford to terminate?</p>
              <p>How many hirers can they force to become reliefs, if the hirers cannot meet the targets? How many will want to become hirers then? How many vehicles must be returned?</p>
              <p>Supposing cannot get good reliefs how? They want hirers to start at 6 am and then also be around from 6pm to midnight? How to sleep and get proper rest, if no relief can be found?</p>
              <p>Even reliefs can force companies to give them incentives for being releifs regularly. No benefits, why should a relief drive every day or night?</p>
              <p>Come on drivers use a little brains and force companies to make things better. Follow blindly, you will suffer and the companies will be the ones laughing all the way to the bank.</p>
