              <p>Skype, Youtube, Google, Facebook are all successful companies. Their success came about because ang mo got different mindset. They dont 'kow tou' to the establishment.

              <p>In the same way, I really do not believe CDG or TH will be able to come out with something similar to 'goCatch'. Actually it is not a matter of can or not. It is a matter of them not willing to do it. If they wanted to do it, it was done ages ago. So let us observe local cabbies use goCatch. Give it a year or two, once we reach a critical mass of regular goCatch cabbies, and passengers find the service dependable, it will spread by word of mouth with increasing speed. In the end, our local media may be forced to publish it when it gains wide acceptance.</p>
              <p>Even our government is using Facebook. Why Temasek Holdings or other entities dont come out with their version of  Singapore 'Facebook'? No way lar. These kind of social media stuff, the ang mo are best at it. We just join in the fun. Thats all.</p>
              <p>Singtel came out with many apps on Apple Store, but they are mostly thrash. No standard one. Maybe 1 in 10 is useful.</p>

              <p>No need to wait lar. There are many 30-40 year old cabbies. We dont need all 28K cabbies to be high tech. Just a small percentage who can show their dedication to this new tool called goCatch. It is good enough.</p>
              <p>Just like Lakeview, 100-200 members is good enough to run the show. No need 1000 members. So same thing for the app, all we need is 100 dedicated drivers who enjoy using this app. Its enough already. By the time this generation pass away, we will have other tools to connect pax to cabby.</p>

              <p>Hi f1taxidriver,</p>
              <p>I found this thread because it is sending so many visitors to our website - thank you!!</p>
              <p>We have been making some improvements to goCatch so that it works better in Singapore, with the latest version, the jobs should now be more relevant for individual drivers as we have improved the algorithm for broadcasting them.</p>
              <p>There also seems to be a lot more passengers using goCatch in Singapore too. more &amp; more jobs going through every day.</p>
              <p>We will be doing future bookings soon and the Android driver version will come soon too - hopefully by May.</p>
              <p>We would love to hear feedback or help with any support issues at support@gocatchapp.com</p>
              <p>A common thing we find is that drivers do not enter shifts correctly. To receive jobs when you are not inside goCatch, you need to be AVAILABLE and in a shift.</p>

              <p><br>Developing a web isnt expensive, if you know the progamming language. For Mac its different from normal web based cos u need an apple computer to develop apps for iphone or ipads.</p>
              <p>Cost factor for submmiting your apps to apple store is only $99usd to be paid to apple. Even if the apps is listed as free you can still earn from ads fee if your apps is a hit in the apps store market.</p>

              <p><br>To increase the popularity of your app in singapore you or your company will  need a sustainable budget for marketing and ads in singapore(facebook preferably). In my opinion, if more local commuters in singapore subscribes/install  your app, its a matter of time this app will also be popular in the taxi drivers community</p>
