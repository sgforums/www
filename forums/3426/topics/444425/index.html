              <p>The MDT system was installed into taxis when the smartphone was not around. Not sure when MDTs were first available. Was it around 2007, or after 2002?</p>
              <p>Anyway this app has several advantages. Ignore it if u will. Because I know many lao jiao cabbies won't change their working methods regardless. Just like I tell u limo taxi can earn more than normal cab, many lao jiao cabbies dun fark care. Just like Bo Call Liao insists on a certain dress code, what can Cumfuck do? He dun want to wear nice means no wear nice. Haha....  Poolman has got his own methods of securing his taxi business too. In fact many cabbies got their own methods. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Still this type of app has many advantages. It compliments the MDT system. It can do things the traditional MDT cannot. Just read on.</p>
              <p>1. As a passenger, this app is able to show u instantly where all available cabbies are. During peak period, Cumfuck phone line is very busy, almost impossible to get them. Even their iPhone app also can be useless because during peak period, no cabs means no cabs.</p>
              <p>2. This app is free. It is literally your mobile MDT. Carry it home, carry it to shopping complex. Pax can still locate and contact u directly if u chose to be "Available". Can always change to "Unavailable" or BUSY.</p>
              <p>3. Pax location is shown clearly on the MAP, they key in the pickup point and destination directly. So no worries about PRC call operators who fail. And no worries about calls without destinations. Remember pax call you directly. Very fast one. They can see u. U can see them. There is no jam phone lines to worry about.</p>
              <p>4. U tell pax directly your booking charge. It is a direct booking system. What $2.3 or $3.3 ? You decide if you want to charge $3.3, $8, $10 or $18 + meter. The pax decides if they accept.</p>
              <p>5. Pax can see your location on the map. You can indicate what vehicle u drive. Can be private limo, chrysler, taxi limousine or normal taxi. Can also put your hp no.</p>
              <p>6. For private limos, this app works anywhere in the world. Pax can locate a cab in Malaysia, Australia, India. Try it, you can find cabs around the world. Not just Singapore. Say you are in Malaysia and got a Malaysian SIM card with data plan, pax can locate and call u directly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>End of day, still up to cabbies and pax. It is like the PC. Last time PCs are very big. The computer must be on the desktop. Nowadays, your iPhone or Android is your PC. Carry it in your hands. Last time GPS must be attached to the taxi, nowadays the GPS satellite receiver is in your iPhone or Android. Things change slowly. This app is a new concept. It has potential. Cumfuck invested millions into their call centre and taxi MDT. Now we have this new FREE MDT. I think the potential is there. It is up to people to make use of it. Remember FREE hor. No need to pay hor. These few days if OBK can try hor.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Having said so much, we still need Cumfuck MDT. There is one very important reason. Cumfuck call ops must not die. IT MUST NOT. This app is good in many ways but only Cumfuck can collaborate with PTC to raise the fucking fare. This app cannot do it.</p>
              <p>So smartphone apps are just an extra tool. It must remain so. If it takes over, me and many cabbies will be in trouble down the road. Because this app is just that. Nothing more. They cannot lobby higher booking fees and change your taxi meter rates.</p>

              <p>I know almost all limo cabbies own at least one smartphone. Normal cabbies less so. Those in the normal cab business for &gt; 10 years, almost guaranteed still using a normal handphone. Even if got smartphone, its for gambling lah. Fully agreed.</p>
              <p>Normal cabbies who transition to private limos, I can guarantee u they sure own a smartphone, and use it for more than just soccer and 4D. Its the nature of things.</p>
              <p>Those driving private limos since day one are a different category. They may or may not use a smartphone. Just an Ahmad. Drive around as per order.</p>

              <p>I know almost all limo cabbies own at least one smartphone.
              Normal cabbies less so. Those in the normal cab business for &gt;
              10 years, almost guaranteed still using a normal handphone. Even if
              got smartphone, its for gambling lah. Fully agreed.</p>
              <p>Normal cabbies who transition to private limos, I can guarantee
              u they sure own a smartphone, and use it for more than just soccer
              and 4D. Its the nature of things.</p>
              <p>Those driving private limos since day one are a different

              <p>Sorry to hear that. I got the iPhone version and it was so easy to use. From the website <a href="http://www.gocatchapp.com.au/">http://www.gocatchapp.com.au/</a>, it says Android cabbies need to pre-register by emailing support@gocatchapp.com. iPhone cabbies have it easier because you can register and change the details directly in the iPhone app.</p>
              <p>I used a second iPhone in passenger mode and could see at least 10 cabbies using this app in Singapore. There are cabbies in India and Australia using the same app too.</p>
              <p>For the iPhone app, I suggest the following way to key in the data:</p>
              <p>ID: Use your taxi license plate. No need to key in NRIC. This information will not be displayed on the map.</p>
              <p>Name: no need to key in your real name. Just key in something like 'Mercedes E220' or 'Estima' or 'i30' because it will be shown on the map.</p>
              <p>License plate: Do not key in your license plate here. Just key in something more useful like your handphone number, because it will be shown on the map.</p>
              <p>This is based on my usage of the app as a pax. There is no need to know the TD name or car plate, what I want is to see what type of car, and the hp number. If I decide I want to book the cab, I can call the cabby directly, negotiate the price, and ask for his/her name and car plate.</p>

              <p>For limo drivers, u should ask "drive CDG dun take call, drive private limo lor...." and the answer is yes. Many are moving in this direction because limo rentals are becoming unreasonable.</p>
