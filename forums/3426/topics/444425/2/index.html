              <p>Actually if everyone of 5.08m commuters use this app , i be more happy .</p>
              <p>But sadly so , nothing can scared off commuters , any price Comfort can set , Majority of commuters still call 1111 line when they need a cab .</p>
              <p>What 25% peak ? 35% peak ?</p>
              <p>In their handphone , only got one number .</p>

              <p>U know what is the best ?</p>
              <p>A pure application for local use .</p>
              <p>And endorse by the three telcos .</p>
              <p>Give name cards to commuters to cause awareness .</p>
              <p>Or advertise at buses , MRT , at taxi stand , or newspaper or mass media .</p>
              <p>Both commuters and drivers aware of such apps .</p>
              <p>I mean all taxi drivers aware of such app , and all pass those messages by mouth to fellow drivers .</p>
              <p>It's the best .</p>
              <p>Just a forum , no point lar .</p>
              <p>Sinming and Wanbao also will not advertise if they do not have any interest .</p>
              <p>If all 28,000 cabbies have got this apps , and 5.08m citizens aware of it . CDG Cablink will be a white elephant at Sin Ming in 3 years .</p>
              <p>It's a long haul to caused awarenss .</p>

              <p>No lah not anyhow quote price. Quote based on the type of booking. If they say they need now, quote 2.3 or 3.3 + meter + cbd if applicable. I have been running my own limo booking website for a while now and have been dealing with passengers directly for some time. My durians mostly no levy. 50cts means 50cts net. I dun rely on the MDT as much these days. I bid Cumfuck only when the job is super kelong type. </p>
              <p>But yeah this app got promise but commuters still not aware. I will do my little part to encourage my pax to try it out. Breaking into the taxi call biz using a new tool is not going to be easy unless u r Cumfuck.</p>
              <p>To all brothers who tried it out, a big thank u. Remember it benefits u directly.</p>
              <p>As for pax being able to see us and therefore try to siam booking, I suggest u dun worry. Your location update is not even close to real time. All they saw was your approximate location. Anyway if pax saw that after 8pm most cabbies r inside CBD, isnt it good that they now know the correct place to flag a cab? Trust me this app if adopted by many cabbies will become our tool to teach commuters how and where to grab a cab.</p>

              <p>It will take some time for this goCatch app to take off. There are quite a few cabbies who turn it on when they are working. Once we reach a critical mass of cabbies who use this app on the road, it will only be a matter of time before passengers notice and start using it. They need to be able to see 50-100 cabs on the map before this happens. Right now we have less than 20 cabs at any time.</p>
              <p>I am not sure why STOMP dun work. What I do know is that STOMP pick and chose what they want to publish. There is no reason for STOMP to make this app popular because when that happens, our taxi company call business will suffer. Taxi companies have a KPI (key perfomance index) to comply with, such as the number successful call bookings. This app is written by someone else in another country. The closest app that is made by a local is the "Taxi Booking" app by Mr Tan Kin Lian, who contested for the last Presidency. However, I chose to highlight the goCatch app instead because it allows you to view the locations of all cabs on google map. The design is just more elegant and refined.</p>
              <p>If this app starts catching on, I am quite sure our local media will just act blur as if it does not exist. Personally I hope it takes off. Give Cumfuck a big slap one day. They forgot it was their cabbies who gave them the success today. To drive down salaries, they import foreign 'talents' to work in their call centre instead of increasing the salaries to make the job more attractive to locals. If this app succeeds, we take back the call business to the individual cabbies. The cabby did all the driving, risked no shows and had to please passengers in a foul mood. Why the fuck should the call centre be taking such a big chunk of the booking fee? Cumfuck corporate jobs are really not worth it or bo hua. And they still insist on collecting levies that amount to about $10.</p>
