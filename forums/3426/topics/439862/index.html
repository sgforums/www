              <p>this is where the unfairness comes in. the ccb lta can give demerit points &amp; fines or even revoke the TDVL to TD when TD abuses pax regardless of who started the fight first. but if it's the pax who abuse the TD, we dun have any channel to seek redress. so TD have to protect themselves.</p>
              <p>even when pax dun pay the fare (or dun pay the full amount), police can only "advise" the pax only, no action will be taken even after a report was lodged at the police post.</p>
              <p>i reported an incident at a police post sometime back, the police officer in fact "advise" me not to lodge the report. at last he reluctantly key in the statement i gave him &amp; said it's for record only (meaning no action will be taken). i lost $5 in this incident.</p>

              <p>you have to take note between complaint of service and abuse. you do not need to take abuse. so what is your company stand on abusing customers? let them be?</p>

              As much as a pax i would want to be, i would also try to avoid confrontation situation with the TD whom will be driving the vehicle.
              
              Think ...
              
              Why upset someone while both your and his life on a vehicle moving at speed faster than cow cart?
              
              As a pax, I just want to get to destination and get on with my life.
              
              This is the same thought of TD.
              
              Just how many of such nasty pax you will meet in a day of driving?
