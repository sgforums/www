              <p>A cabby was sentenced to a day's jail and fined $2,500 on 
              Tuesday for punching another on grave and sudden provocation. Ang Hak 
              Huat, 54, had admitted to hurting Mr Tan Jim Hua, 57, on his hand, face 
              and back at a taxi stand outside Tanah Merah MRT Station on Dec 14, 
              2011.</p>
              <p>The court heard that Ang was queuing behind the victim who was 
              waiting for passengers at the taxi stand when four passengers came and 
              boarded Ang's taxi. Ang sounded his horn and asked the victim to move 
              forwards but the victim told him that he could reverse his taxi and 
              drive off.</p>
              <p>When Ang's taxi was alongside the victim's, he wound down his window 
              and said it was the passengers who had boarded his taxi. Mr Tan hurled 
              vulgarities at Ang and his passengers.</p>
              <p>Both drivers got out of their vehicles. When the victim flashed his 
              fists at Ang, Ang punched him on his hands, face and back. They scuffled
               with each other and had to be separated by passers-by. Ang has 
              compensated $1,000 to the victim, who suffered fractures on the right 
              wrist and left little finger. But the doctor said it was not possible to
               conclude how he sustained the finger fracture.</p>

              <p>another cabby get 12 months jail</p>
              <p><span class="content-area-content"><span class="story_body">
              </span></span></p><p>A taxi 
              driver who caused grievous hurt to an acquaintance was jailed for 12 
              months and ordered to be given three strokes of the cane on Tuesday. Lim
               Boon Inn, 41, pleaded guilty to punching Mr Siah Teng Hock, 40, on the 
              head and left ribcage which resulted in a broken rib at a coffeeshop at 
              Block 555 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 on June 16 last year.</p>
              <p>A district court heard that the victim and his friends were drinking 
              alcohol at the outdoor seating area of the coffeeshop while Lim and his 
              brother were also drinking at an adjacent table.</p>
              <p>Later Lim stood up and started scolding the Mr Siah who then stood 
              up. Lim then challenged Mr Siah to proceed to the back to settle their 
              differences but he refused. Lim then walked over to the victim and 
              smashed a beer bottle on the victim's head.</p>
              <p>Mr Siah bled heavily and slumped on the ground. Lim's brother 
              separated him from the victim. When the victim picked himself up and 
              staggered into the coffeeshop to clean his wound, Lim threw a punch on 
              the victim's head from behind. The punch sent the victim sprawling. Lim 
              then punched the victim on the left ribcage. The brother then separated 
              the duo. Mr Siah was warded in hospital overnight and given a week's 
              hospitalisation leave. A second charge of causing hurt with a beer 
              bottle was considered. He could have been jailed for up to 10 years and 
              liable to fine or to caning for causing grievous hurt.</p>

              <p>I will also not entertain, tell the pax they either take the taxi infront or have to wait until he goes off, unless behind no other taxi waiting, maybe I might reverse.</p>
              <p>Anyway this Ang very lucky they couldn't prove how the fracture was sustained. if the doctor could clearly identify it, then he will be looking at a far more serious jail term especially in lieu of caning since he's over 50.</p>

              <p>another cabby get 12 months jail</p>
              <p><span>A taxi driver who caused grievous hurt to an
              acquaintance was jailed for 12 months and ordered to be given three
              strokes of the cane on Tuesday. Lim Boon Inn, 41, pleaded guilty to
              punching Mr Siah Teng Hock, 40, on the head and left ribcage which
              resulted in a broken rib at a coffeeshop at Block 555 Ang Mo Kio
              Avenue 10 on June 16 last year.</span></p>
              <p>A district court heard that the victim and his friends were
              drinking alcohol at the outdoor seating area of the coffeeshop
              while Lim and his brother were also drinking at an adjacent
              table.</p>
              <p>Later Lim stood up and started scolding the Mr Siah who then
              stood up. Lim then challenged Mr Siah to proceed to the back to
              settle their differences but he refused. Lim then walked over to
              the victim and smashed a beer bottle on the victim's head.</p>
              <p>Mr Siah bled heavily and slumped on the ground. Lim's brother
              separated him from the victim. When the victim picked himself up
              and staggered into the coffeeshop to clean his wound, Lim threw a
              punch on the victim's head from behind. The punch sent the victim
              sprawling. Lim then punched the victim on the left ribcage. The
              brother then separated the duo. Mr Siah was warded in hospital
              overnight and given a week's hospitalisation leave. A second charge
              of causing hurt with a beer bottle was considered. He could have
              been jailed for up to 10 years and liable to fine or to caning for
              causing grievous hurt.</p>

              <p>This 1 is VCGH - causing grievious hurt (under the law involves some fracture, permanent disfiguration of the face and soe other factors). VCGH deffo got jail and usually caning.</p>
              <p>The 1st case is only VCH - usually a fine case, unless you assault a taxi driver or public bus driver, which means a jail term. Here it involved 2 taxi drivers, that's why I think a lengthy jail term was spared, plus the fracture couldnt be confirmed by the doctor, so only a token 1 day jail term.</p>

              <p>This 1 we not sure, because we don't know if LTA took follow up action. I suspect Mr Ang almost certainly got his license revoked and possibly Mr Tan as well.</p>
              <p>The court will not order revocation of TDVL, that one is a procedural matter for the LTA to decide, not under the Court's jurisdiction. Courts only order revocation of driving licenses in certain traffic offences, not vocational licenses altho a judge may recommend it to the prosecutor for follow up (which they rarely do)</p>
