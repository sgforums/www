              <p>Ya lor, Comfort and Hotel happily sharing the profit and the TD get the shit. TD its high time we stand up together to fight for our rights. Stop letting taxi company uses us as a money making tools.</p>
              <p>I fully agree with Derrick Ng2001, with all those cashless payment coming in, TD where to find money to pay rental. No wonder people are using excuses not to use their cashless machine.</p>

              <p>NKL, as a CDG cabby, we have a UOB saving account which link to the GIRO services for crediting the cashless transactions' taxi fare to our account the next business day.

              <p>GIRO is good for ppl who has spare cash.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do know some cabbies who has at least 6 mths worth of rental in their GIRO account.</p>
              <p>Also some who need to rush to bank in their cab rental at the last mins.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why so many ppl queue at post office to pay their telco and utilities bills instead of using GIRO ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, they can stretch their dollars till due date or pay a portion of it.  If still tight, wait for the pink notice and pay 50 cents more. No need to borrow to make ends meet..</p>

I answered him that block number is a few blocks away from where he was. I said it's most likely is a "areoplane" case liao.</p>
              <p>That uncle *&amp;^*$&amp;%%# and said he being a nice person did not ask the pax to leave some $ behind. He said he picked up that pax from Aljunied Ave 2 o/s a fast food outlet by the name ... mmm...

              <p>You tell these to pax, they will say "uncle, I steady one, won't vomit one".</p>
              <p>I once kena a NS boy vomitted in my veh. Sibeh dulan, make a u-turn and go to petrol kiosk for washing. Tell that boy to pay for the washing. He NS boy leh, not enough $. In the end, he paid $18, which is the meter fare. I paid $13 for the washing &amp; cleaning the interior, another $2 for the abang to clean "nicely".</p>
              <p>After the washing, the NS boy disappeared. I went along the route he was supposed to go and found him sleeping at a bus stop. Wake him up and sent him home.</p>
              <p>Lecture him don't drink if he cannot take. He said his peers jio, don't drink cannot.</p>
              <p>In the end, a $18 trip left only $3 for. So I tell myself, try not to pick pax at these drinking place if possible. That fucking place was o/s 1 Fullerton.</p>

              <p>Quit long time liao after going into a tree at the corner near park mall. That day speed with my kakis and after the corner,find myself facing a bunch of tree which has fallen on the road blocking two lane.my kakis' car on the third lane,cannot swing out to escape the tree, so go into it. Lucky no big branches inside.Go in from the front, come out from the back. Side mirror fly in.From then on, realise no matter how good a driver you are,or how good you mod your car,you cannot control the road condition. So now dun dare liao.haha.</p>
