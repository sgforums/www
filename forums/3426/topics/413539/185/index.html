              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore could be in recession in H2 - government</span></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE, Oct 18 - Singapore could see a technical recession in the second half of 2010 as the global economic recovery remains subdued and planned drug plant shutdowns could hurt the manufacturing sector, the government said on Monday.</p>
              <p>The government also said it was closely monitoring local property prices to ensure no bubble was formed.</p>
              <p>The economy remains on track to achieve the growth forecast of 13-15 percent for the full 2010 year, Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry S Iswaran said in parliament.</p>
              <p>"A 'technical recession' -- which analysts define as two consecutive periods of negative quarter-on-quarter growth -- could happen in the second half of the year," he said.</p>
              <p>"If this happened, it would largely be a reflection of the sharp swings in the biomedical manufacturing cluster."</p>
              <p>In the July-September period, the economy fell 19.8 percent from the previous quarter on a seasonally adjusted annualised rate, the largest contraction since the data was first collated in 1975. [ID: nSGC003776]</p>
              <p>However, continued growth in global demand for electronic products will lend support to the electronics and precision engineering clusters and a surge of visitor arrivals to Singapore will continue to bolster tourism-related sectors, Iswaran said.</p>
              <p>Minister for National Development Mah Bow Tan told parliament the government was monitoring the property market closely and would "act fast to pre-empt problems".</p>
              <p>in August, Singapore announced restrictions on people buying second homes as part of new measures to cool its red-hot residential market, joining Hong Kong and China in taking steps to keep a lid on housing prices. [ID:nSGE67T016]</p>
              <p>Mah said the measures had dented resale transactions in September from August , but he could not say whether the government would need to introduce more measures in the future. (Reporting by Nopporn Wong-Anan; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)</p>

              <p> Two year ago i also spended not more than three thosand dollars to Japan in kagoshima</p>
              <p>Today after two years  the same amount we did it again  and not forgetting frre and easy no middleman (tour agencies)...so what inflation got to do.</p>
              <p>See the hotels rates, see the food prices still the same two year ago, portion still the same. that bowl of ramen still the same old price.</p>
              <p>So what wrong with those efffect and affect the surrounding factors, we will be affected.</p>
              <p> Alway they are cautioning us. be prepare this,  be prepare that.</p>
              <p>Are we still  not here a piece, so dun listen to what The National speech on TV.</p>
              <p>What are they talking, they only know what they are talking on their own.</p>
              <p>Who care they give you this they gave you that, with or without, we still go to Japan. for sure.</p>
              <p>Like me and my kakis, any wrong to us.</p>
              <p>only bullshit,</p>
              <p>What so good about us as a taxi drivers, with those speech they deilvered.</p>
              <p>Do you benefits.</p>

              <p>wasting time learning and listening...lah.</p>
              <p>Dun listen anymore from them. useless.</p>
              <p>stay tune, more interesting ideasl i got from Japan.</p>
              <p>One example.</p>
              <p>finished you food in the foodcourt, we pay extra cost for the cleaners to clear for you.</p>
              <p>see what the cleaners do. in food court and anywhere in Singapore.</p>
              <p>see our foodcourt, like those backyard so untidy and horrible, they told this is an identity of Singapore Foodcourt.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The hills are alive alright, but it ain't the sound of music.   Kyushu, Japan's southern most island (other than Okinawa), is still actively volcanic.  In fact, Sakurajima-san has covered the large port city of Kagoshima with a coat of ash on more than one occasion.  But the rewards of volcanic soil are lush green forests and grasslands, which makes Kyushu seem like a tropical paradise.  It's not what the average person thinks of when he thinks of Japan.</span></p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">We came to Fukuoka (also known as Hakata) by Shinkansen, about nine hours from Tokyo on the Hikari (the express train).  We, however, had stopped at a few places on the way, so it wasn't such a shock for us to notice the difference.   Where Tokyo feels like an open-all-night, all-you-can eat city, Fukuoka is more of a my-hometown, let's-take-it-slow town.  In the middle of summer, the food stalls were rolled out on the roadside, where you could get fresh Kyushu seafood or a big bowl of ramen.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">This page is called "Kyushu" because our hosts (Jayne's family, of course) were so gracious to us, that we actually did an East-West cross island tour of Kyushu in the four days we stayed with them.  That included Nagasaki and Arita in the west, and Beppu in the east.  They invited us back to do the North-South tour next; we plan to take them up on their offer this summer.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Nagasaki was the first port opened for trading with Europeans, the Dutch, in the 14th century.  With the Dutch came Christianity, and before long, Christianity had caught on pretty well and was spreading over to Korea, which is only a two hour boat ride from Kyushu.  However, Japan was still very much a feudal society at this time, and when Tokugawa came to power and decided to unite Japan, he did not invite the Dutch to the party.  So he ungraciously threw them out of Japan, and those left behind (mostly missionaries) were murdered, along with thousands of Japanese converts.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Nagasaki today is an interesting mix of Japan and Dutch culture, the Dutch mostly seen in the architecture, and art, not the society.  Nagasaki, like Yokohama, has a thriving Chinatown as well.  We didn't spend too much time there; just enough to eat dim sum in Chinatown and visit the Atomic bomb memorial (a huge statue of a man sitting in a strange position.  Supposedly symbolic of something or another, but too difficult for most people to explain.)</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">There were many other places we visited in Kyushu.  On the east coast is Beppu, a "resort" town of sorts for Japanese who love their onsen (hot springs).  Beppu is a highly volcanic area, so there are literally hundreds of hot springs around this city.  Many of them are sulphuric, so basically the town smells like rotten eggs everywhere you go.  If that's you're idea of a vacation resort, then please enjoy Beppu.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">We also went through a drive through safari, the kind where the animals roam free and you stay in your car.  Interesting, until you read the stories about the genius people who roll down their windows to pet the animals and end up being eaten by tigers.  We had no such incident, but the signs did warn us that tigers sometimes chase down cars and bite the tires.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lastly, we went to a little town that basically was a large shrine.   Dazaifu is the name of the place, and like all shrines, there were some beautiful buildings and cute little shops around it.  Apparently, some kind of festival is held there in the Spring, but I never found out exactly what it was.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In Fukuoka, we came just before a big parade, and the floats they were building for this parade were on display on all the street corners of the city.   And what floats they were, many of them standing over 20 feet tall.  It was explained to me that two floats would be built; the one on display was simply for display purposes, and a smaller version of the same float would be built and carried down the street for the parade (they do not drive their floats down the street like we do in the US; a couple dozen strong men carry them on their backs).</span></p>
