              i have never had any bad encounters with PRCs in singapore and neither do any of my working friends.  do they really behave the way you people say?  it is probably an isolated incident.  just like any taxi driver could have a bad encounter with a singaporean.
              
              or is the TS overly sensitive just because the person involved is a PRC?
              
              i am inclined to think some singaporeans are just angry with PRCs and cant wait to bash them.  its all because of their anger towards PAP and its immigration policy.
              
              i dont see strong negative reaction about the lexus driver in the taxi incident.  yet people get so worked up over the ferrari case.  why?

              <p><br> i have never had any bad encounters with PRCs in singapore and
              neither do any of my working friends. do they really behave the way
              you people say? it is probably an isolated incident. just like any
              taxi driver could have a bad encounter with a singaporean. or is
              the TS overly sensitive just because the person involved is a PRC?
              i am inclined to think some singaporeans are just angry with PRCs
              and cant wait to bash them. its all because of their anger towards
              PAP and its immigration policy. i dont see strong negative reaction
              about the lexus driver in the taxi incident. yet people get so
              worked up over the ferrari case. why? all because he is a PRC.</p>

              is it wrong for a chinese to speak to another chinese in mandarin?
              
              if a local chinese uncle or auntie takes a cab does he speak to you in english?  if a malay or indian takes a cab does he speaks to the malay or indian taxi driver in english?  surely they use their own  language.
              
              its because you have no pride in your own language (i assume you are a chinese.  if not i apologize for making this assumption) thats why you are angry.
              
              i dont understand why singaporean chinese are so proud they can speak english when they cant even speak their own language.

              <p>Mandarin is mandarin, but there are beijin accent, guandong accent, wuhan accent, and so on,</p>
              <p>We are proud not just because we can speak malay, english and chinese, most dialect and some of us can speak japanese too, we are proud because we TDs earn a honest living, we dun beg, con or sell fake milk powder or eggs.</p>
              <p>We are singaporean, we served NS to protect you, we contributed to our country growth and wealth and can proudly say, these PRC are here to grab and enjoy the fruit of our success, and even that, we, the 60++% singaporeans are so graceful to allow them to do so without a bullet fired nor a revolution taken, you simply just walk thru it with sponsored scholarship for you too. And even that, our sponsored PRC scholar can call us dog and we just move on without any disruption, peace and harmony is what we pledged.</p>
              <p>The question is therefore to ask back, if you find singaporeans proud, then why you come here, see and yet want to conqueror this place. Laos people are the least proud, so is papua new guinea, congo, cuba and jamica. For your info and deep consideration</p>
