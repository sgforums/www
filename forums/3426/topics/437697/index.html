              I m refering to those in the  town of Tampines,Sengkang,Simei,Hougang,Bedok,Woodlands,Yishu
              It is so confusing to remember the exact location like Bedok North Ave 1, 2 3
              then there is Bedok South Ave 1,2and Bedok North Str 1,2,3
              
              then come str 21,32,71,72,74, 91, 51 etc of the so many town.
              
              Next u must know Hougang is connected to AMK and Sengkang,Tampines is to Simei,etc.
              
              The ONLY and HARD way is to MEMORISE ?

              <p>Most town Ave 1,3,5 runs parallel  and perpendicular to 2,4,6 etc. Street 11 will be block 100++ Street 21 200++. For Woodlands simple if Street XX will be on Marsiling MRT side Drive XX will be on Admiralty MRT side with reference of Causeway Point in the middle. Sengkang Anchorvale is 100++ Compassvale is 200++ Rivervale 300++ Fernvale 400++. Punggol still small so easy only 3 main road Punngol Field, Central, Drive parallel to TPE. If you not sure ask the pax which part of Ave X you want to go? And they will tell you near Ave X side or near some landmark. If still not sure ask pax guide you.</p>
              <p>Actually no need memorise. If you are well travelled then will automatically know the place after you been there few time. It is more difficult to know how to get to the place then to know where is the place.</p>

              <p>Just drive and learn, everyday is a learning journey, learn abt location, abt communicating with different peoples, abt driving skills, and so on.</p>
              <p>For location, if I do not know, I will ask pax, if pax also not sure, then use my smarthphone to locate, then on meter and move off, on reaching, mark and note down the location, later go home, study it, it will go direct into your memory because you had been to this place. Then study the road surrounding this location, ask yourself what other option I can take to this destination.</p>
              <p>By reading and memorising location can be quiet taxing, furthermore, you only lean it by theory, you could had memorised woodland drive 40, but once you turn into Ave 12, you go blank, then you make a wrong turn and pax start to flare up, that time you start to say, i remember this and that, pax would had scolded you deep deep.</p>
              <p>Do not get excited and be scare of location, no doubt singapore is small, the the road mass per sq km is one of the world most congested, if you go malaysia or other places, they just got a few straight roads and one main road, singapore is full of it, three main road crisscrossing each others and within, many small lanes and roads inside a km sq. So, i understand that it is not easy, and we are usually get block by HDB or other tall buildings unlike other countries with a low flat landscape which you can pin point and see the location.</p>
              <p>By order of learning, the location that i went wrongly and scolded by pax is usually the one I will never forget. Knn, this shows we need to learn the hard way</p>

              <p>I will probably "Errrrrrrrrrrr............."</p>
              <p>Cos Toa Payoh doesn't have any formula to remember .</p>
              <p>Unlike AMK , St 21 , means Blk 200+ . St 31 means Blk 300+</p>
              <p>Toa Payoh ? Fuck lar .... Blk 59 ? Where ?</p>
              <p>I usually will tell pax i dun no where the block , unless they can provide me Lorong ..... not even near AMK Hub or whatever .</p>
              <p>No Lor , pls take another taxi .</p>

              <p>By the time u say u dunno , they will say why not at the first place say so , if can they will take another taxi .</p>
