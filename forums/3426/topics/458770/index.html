                      Last time I went there do some test at ICA, I think 4 months back the staff there told me got shuttle bus from tuas checkpoint to jurong point and jurong east for those coming back from Malaysia. But I can't take cos I need to return pass and once return I can't come back in, if drive cab I also don't know where to drop them. Below where the sbs bus u-turn if drop them there they also can't go in.
                      When I was there doing testing I notice a lot of China tourist coming in, ICA staff tell me they take flight to jb then take bus from tuas cheaper. Maybe that's why they building a hotel at jurong east, cater for budget China tourist.

              <p>Yes, there is a bus shuttle at the bus lane checkpoint, after they clear custom, they have to wait at the bus bay, if bus full, too bad, have to wait for another one, it run from jurong east, jurong point, tuas checkpoint into malaysia, end up senai airport at JB, many people living in the west go to senai airport to travel to penang or thailand, more cheaper with air asia there, less fuel charge, less ap tax, less waiting time, less airfare when you book thru internet, from west side to senai airport is just abit further to changi airport.</p>
              <p>If you are driving, senai airport can be a good option if you want to travel around SE asia that air asia provide, even the food on board are cheaper, parking at senai airport cost $15 sing dollar per day, the parking is all under security, many sg car there, so if you go 4 days, you pay $60 upon return, On the way, can also pump cheaper fuel, now that perlin highway had open up, so much easier.</p>

              <p>If you live in the west, you take a cab to AP morning peak would cos you nearly $38++, on return, if midnite, wow! if me TD, very happy. It may cost you $45++. Why not just drive into senai, park there for 2 to 3 days cos you about $45, yet do not need to wait for taxis, and some more can put petrol on the way out.</p>
              <p>Then again, if you are flying to other malaysia state, like penang, kL or sabah..you only go thru the checkpoint immigration, after that, you are consider domestic, no need to show or go thru immigration anymore, just the boarding and bags check in.</p>
              <p>At same time, senai is not an international AP, however it serve bangkok, chengmai and hatyai, the airport tax is low and in ringgits, fuel charges is also low as per malaysia price, boarding waiting time is only an hour, not like changi, check here and there, wait 2 hours, high airport tax even if you do not buy or use anything, then have to wait for air clearances due to many flights. And most of those budget airlines alway late.</p>

              <p><br>You drop them at the bus lane, there is a passenger immigration, those singapore bus, cars and taxis will make a U turn back, but most private cars will had gone into malaysia.</p>
              <p>Most tour agents, beside those big ones like 5 stars or whatever, will sent their customers into the bus passenger checkpoint in a Singapore registerd bus, fully packed, from there, the customers will do their own custom clearnce, passport chopped, then, they will be greet by malaysia tour buses, the customers now got more buses, as malaysia buses more cheap mah..the singapore bus and taxis will make an U turn back to singapore.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>What happen sometime is someone missed the tour bus in Singapore, or do not know where is the pick up point, so, they took from hotels or home a taxis to checkpoint, only the tour bus lane side got individual clear customer facilites at tuas checkpoint. You ferry them into bus lane, stop somehwere and U turn back, and also collect your fare <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p></div>

              <p>CW3/CW4S from Jurong East Interchange and CW6 from Jurong Point are the official public bus routes that go to Johor from the west side of Singapore. the bus company cannot operate another route that goes to legoland directly from Singapore.</p>
              <p>so what they did was to boost frequency by providing extra bus at the JB/Tuas customs that will go directly to legoland. while the official routes continue their normal routes to bt indah etc.</p>
