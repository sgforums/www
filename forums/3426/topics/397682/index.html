              <p>In this case, I got to agree with POOLMAN. Well I never complained against taxi drivers before except once got one uncle bang me in the back and drive away tried to run away, I told the customer service centre, I ask them call the uncle, if he doesnt come back, I will go to police, wah he come back damn fast haha.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any case, I agree that its attitude that sometimes make people go complain against the driver. Cmon who dun drive fast on the roads? Although i feel TDs should be a bit more careful with speeding cos that is your livelihood afterall, everyone speeds on the road Sometimes its black face or the guai lan attitude that eventually push the pax to complain. If speeding, normally will just ask uncle eh dun so fast, then if uncle give black face or guai lan you, thats it.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Actually I want to know the mentality of taxi drivers. I know that the faster you get to a destination, it means that you got more time to pick up more passengers. But have you thought in the long run, by speeding or driving recklessly, cutting in and out etc, you get into accidents and that means your livelihood is affected so why still do it?</p></div>

              <p>In this case, I got to agree with POOLMAN. <span style="color: #ff6600;">Well I never
              complained against taxi drivers before except once got one uncle
              bang me in the back and drive away tried to run away, I told the
              customer service centre, I ask them call the uncle, if he doesnt
              come back, I will go to police, wah he come back damn fast
              haha.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any case, I agree that its attitude that sometimes make people
              go complain against the driver. Cmon who dun drive fast on the
              roads? Although i feel TDs should be a bit more careful with
              speeding cos that is your livelihood afterall, everyone speeds on
              the road Sometimes its black face or the guai lan attitude that
              eventually push the pax to complain. If speeding, normally will
              just ask uncle eh dun so fast, then if uncle give black face or
              guai lan you, thats it.</p>

              <p>that's a nice one..</p>
              <p>sometimes..taxi drivers just deserve to be complaints..thinking that passengers or other road users are push-overs..and thus they bully them for their ignorance only to have them back-firing at them..</p>
              <p>it's just a competition of who is more guai lan, lao lan, xia lan those kind of stuffs..the strongest wins, with the backing of facts and law with reasoning..</p>

              <p>Well, I heard from one of my friend's experience... She told the cab driver the route she wanted to go by, the cd suggested another route. She say it's okay, just go according to her route. But then the cab took a wrong turn and start to go by his route.</p>
              <p>Upon knowing she's pissed... he turn off the meter halfway through and tell her in a challenging way just to pay whatever she want to.</p>
              <p>Going on a longer route might not leads to a complain... Insisting on going the route against your passenger's will also do not leads to one... but challenging the passenger... I almost guarantee that... Don't know she did complain or not...</p>
