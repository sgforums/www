              <p>Those AP regulars stay at dot com estates, queuing there is only natural.</p>
              <p> AP should upgrade surcharge to 5 or 8 plus meter. Then those no money pax will take MRT. </p>

              <p>If people think that FT going to drive taxis is going to be good, think thrice please.</p>
              <p>FT are also hungry wolves, their motives does not include loyalty to Singapore, their motives is to make as much as possible and fark off from here.</p>
              <p>If FT is to take over, by all means, by the scenarios will be worst than now, at least now, most of us cabby understand the term "if want to Q, dun complain".</p>
              <p>Imagine if  a PRC FT waited for hours to takes you at the airport, and you said, Loyang ave, what will happen, you know all these PRC and Indian FT well, they might even whack you. So, it is up to you, if people voted for FT to go into taxis driving, by all means, we Uncles can do other things, from pimps to casket driving to peng bak kua or tao kua.</p>
              <p>Taxis drivers are all Singaporean, most of us gone thru the courtesy campaigns, the one singaporean phase, the give a smiling campaign that said courtesy is our way of life, went through serving army, the pledge of to strive and to excel for singapore. If you want FT to come into taxis trade, by all means, it is a demorcratic country afterall. But please do not end up you prefer to take a Singaporean cab</p>

              <p>In any trade/business, there will be black face, eg, in natas tour, you get serve better if you are going to USA, for malaysia, they just get a junior to serve you with no free gift, you go into a restaurant, order abalone or lobsters, the captain or even chef may even come out and serve your personally, but if you just order fried rice, you can see the black faces.</p>
              <p>But nevetheless they still serve, this are all human nature, some like BJ and Bowah are able to take it, some like unable to keep their emotion and show it, but they still bring you there.</p>
              <p>And bear in mind, in psychologically speaking, the pax who wanted to take a cab to the nearby places from AP tend to have pre thought of getting a black face cabby, even if my face is normal, the picture protray by the pax is that I am unhappy and showing black face, but actually there is nothing, it is ok. I will said only 5% people show their black face (not being racist, indian not counted). So, whenever you landed in singapore, as a pax, you start to think, cham liao, my house only pasir ris, TD is going to be unhappy, but that is not the case, it is your mind playing with you and this led to assumption.</p>
              <p>As saying goes, the mind anticipate your action which ultimately translate into the way you look at the TD. For that matter, I could hv a headache or stomach discomfort, but you term it as black face, what can i do??</p>

              <p>There is alway a system put in place, if you find the cabby service not up to your expectation, you can alway make a complain, get the cabby management working, get them to sit with you, together with the cabby and spell out the agendas of your dissatisfaction. We are available most of the time.</p>
              <p> The system is already in place, not happy with the cabby reaction, you can go into LTA, cabby companies, CASE, singapore tourism board, NTA and even the MOT, but you all choose to make a case with a PAP MP. People should be talking more about high cost of living, high inflation, price hike, FT invasion, high govt pay structure and foreign scholar at University, this will make the MP work harder for the high allowance he is taking, but instead, they choose to ask the MP to do the simple job regarding Taxi?? Singaporean ar!, singaporean?? when will you all learn.</p>
              <p>And finally, tell me, which TD refuse to take you to pasir ris or tampines?? black or no black faces</p>

              <p>I am not expecting the service provided by FTs to be better than locals.</p>
              <p>But, as the industry is protected, every one adopt the same strategy of making a living and there will be loads of complaints during non-peak hours.</p>
              <p>It will drive the authority to take action.</p>
              <p>As they know they cannot do anything to the local, they will employ FTs.</p>
              <p>In the end, the local TD also have to suck thumb and accept the new comrade.</p>
              <p>It is not the last frontier but the eventual move if the taxi company keep getting complaints.</p>
              <p>Stop holding the dream of local only industry forever.</p>
              <p>No one is safe from the foreign invasion.</p>
              <p>I am not pushing or promoting this approach but it will be the eventual outcome.</p>

              <p>That's why I always say there are lots of things taken for granted here in sg.</p>
              <p>FTs for policemen, soldiers, politicians? TDs contribute to the safe and secured environment here too. Ever heard of TDs committing criminal offences here like in some other countries where even illegal immigrants can drive a cab? They rob you, make a fortune and then disappear?</p>
              <p>Why? Because we are stakeholders here and also we hv got nowhere to hide or run to.</p>
              <p>Some things can never be compromised. Not if the present governing party remains in power. I can bet my last dollar that the taxi companies would love to emply FTs, only they are not allowed to.</p>
              <p>No, nay, never will we need to suck our thumbs.</p>
