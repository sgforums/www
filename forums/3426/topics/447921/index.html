              <h2>Separate queue at airport mooted after residents in the east tell of having to face moody taxi-drivers</h2>
              <p>They say their quick journey home from the airport can sometimes be 
              an unpleasant one - and the short distance has everything to do with it.</p>
              <p>Mr Baey Yam Keng, a Member of Parliament for Tampines GRC, says he 
              has heard of such stories from his residents: They return from a trip 
              abroad, get into a cab at Changi Airport, and get a dour-faced cabby who
               thinks driving them home to areas in the east is not worth their while.</p>
              <p>Some of these taxi drivers could have waited for as long as two hours
               for a fare at the airport. And a one-way trip to Tampines or the Siglap
               area would fetch them only $10 whereas a trip to Orchard would easily 
              be double that.</p>
              <p>A recent suggestion to set up a separate 
              taxi queue at the airport for passengers who want to travel to nearby 
              destinations was made by a resident to Mr Baey. The MP, who posted the 
              suggestion on his Facebook, sparked a discussion on whether doing so 
              would be effective for both passengers and drivers.</p>

              <p>Would suggest you go study the concept of "market forces" in depth.</p>
              <p>As for the FT driving cabs, if you hv a young, sweet and sexy daughter, try having her take his cab on a sat early morning. Then tell me how that feels!</p>

              <p>The points that I have highlighted are toward picky taxi drivers.</p>
              <p>As for FT driving cabs, if you are worried about your gal, buy her a car and tell her not to take any bus since some of them are driven by FTs.</p>
              <p>Not all FTs are wolves as there are local wolves.</p>
              <p>As for losing the way, they can install a chinese GPS to guide them.</p>
              <p>All these issues can be resolved easily.</p>
              <p>No need to ask the consumers to wake up as it is not their fault to stay near changi airport and cannot find a cab during "sleeping" hours.</p>

              <p>I feel that if u wanna join the airport queue, we must play according to the rules of the game.</p>
              <p>Ever queue for less than 8 mins and kanna one pax wanna go Jurong. I ask her how come she got no luggage and she replied that she works there.</p>
              <p>I also kanna one family of four, scared I dun fetch them, load up everything, get into the cab then tell me "Buangkok". Sorry, they see me wrong liao. Not only I no black face, still fetch him swee swee to their place, no tips some more but still help them bring their luggages to the lift lobby.</p>
              <p>If you queue at airport frequently, cannot be so suay every day kanna short trip one la. I can take the long ones happily, I also take the short ones.</p>
              <p>But, on the other hand, TD also human right? got feelings and emotions too. Imagine as they say, queuing 2 hours at airport and kanna short trip, wanna scold cannot, wanna reject also cannot, black face also cannot, all surpress inside, one day sure explode.</p>
              <p>My advice (wah lao, newbie wanna advice) for ppl queuing there is, expect every trip out to be short trip but if u get a long one, it's a bonus. with this kind of attitude, make life alot easier.</p>
              <p>As for TD making themselves unavailable during off-peak hours, I dun agree that it's bad attitude. TD also doing business right? Sure have to pick the time less busy to eat, rest, or peeeee right? is it viable to go do such thing at your busiest time? No logic right?</p>
              <p>But from my limited observation, off-peak hours like better opportunity to do business. Fare is so cheap. People tends to wave at taxis more liberally. can get connection every where. </p>
              <p>Another point is, when there is a night shift (peak hours), they is also a day shift (off peak). Many TD, especially those who want family life, opt for day shift even though less income, or rather more work for the same income. These people if really take a break during their shift, then what they eat? fresh air or grass?</p>

              <p>wanna go Q airport , don't complain,</p>
              <p>wanna go Q airport , expect short trip to nearby</p>
              <p>i understand the feeling for q-ing at the airport, but why must make your own life difficult. my  kakis always info me about airport when is good, but even i nearby i don't want to bother, reason is simple, don't wish to get myself into such situation.</p>
              <p>during peak time, let's those pax q long long.</p>
              <p>airport surcharge $3 is it worth it? to wait up to 30min, 1hr, or 2hr? to me happen to be sending pax to airport  and is png then i go into terminal, png, even nearby i don't care, cos i do not have to q at all,  considering $3 surcharge is extra to me, and put my mind set , later simei, tampines, pasir ris can png. most of the time , reach dest, less than 5min get a pax and go.</p>
              <p>short trip is not a problem, problem is the waiting time td have to wait . i reckon more than 15min time is a waste of time (in the day) .</p>
              <p>So to me, let the pax wait, let the tourist wait, let them wait, until someday better surcharge change.</p>
              <p>just wonder why no pax call for taxi when waiting time could be1 hr before their turn come ( not allow by lta?)</p>

              <p>Some bro here says different people prefer different ways of getting pax. Tat's why I dun understand why ppl queue up at airport, sometimes T1 queue can go along the way to T3 and T3 queue all the way to PIE. What's yr logic? anyone in that position wanna share?</p>
              <p>Not only airport, even at MBS, why ppl bother to queue so long when there are pax everywhere in the city willing to give them $3.30 plus $3.00?</p>
              <p>was wondering if ppl just enjoy smoking and chit chatting while passing time to queue? Queuing at T3 from PIE takes how long and chances of a Pasir Ris is still 50-50 right?</p>
              <p>More me, I spend my time chatting on watsapp or looking for advance job on my iphone CDG apps. Still not very productive la.</p>
              <p> My mode of operation (MOD) :</p>
              <p>taxi stand - more than 3 taxi, I dun queue.</p>
              <p>Airport - ony hear got fast moving lobang or pick and go lobang from walkie, then I go.</p>
              <p>most of the time, rather go down town empty-to me, it's more productive.</p>
              <p>especially night shift drivers who dun smoke-queue too long start to feel sleepy.</p>
