              <p>Today, got the mood to do airport arrival, go in 3 times empty taxi.</p>
              <p>1st trip- from Potong Pasir go in T3., cos heard got pick and go. Got conned cos got 3/4 1st avenue and the queue hardly moved. waited for 40 mins. Got a Pinoy lady going to Jurong East. Cool!!!!!.</p>
              <p>2nd Trip- from Punggol- still based on pick and go info at Budget- reach there, at least saw 20 cabs, make a detour to T2. WTF, pick and go? taxi queue until outside. Head for departure hall to go back Budget but saw from the top, T2 queue move rather fast, so rejoin T2 queue. 10 mins out liao, kanna 2 Nihonjin going Riverview Hotel. Fare was $29.85, give $30, knn, expecting to take his change even. Gave him 20cts, he really took it. Got to lugi 5cts some more. If I know, give him exact 15 cents. Nevermind, still swee swee, help them unload luggage and wish them have a pleasant stay in Singapore.</p>
              <p>3rd trip again from Punggol, this time queue at T3 cos only T3 got flight at 3am. </p>
              <p>Actually feeling real hungry, was hoping for a long trip but same time, worry has to come back all the way to Lavendar to makan. So just take whatever come la. Kanna Punggol Field. Ok la, nice pax, had a good conversation with him. Reach there, far was 21.90, round up to 25. not too bad right?</p>
              <p>starting to like airport arrival liao, but there again, still not keen on long queue.</p>

              <p>I think it's rather difficult as too much logistic would be
              involved.</p>
              <p>I understand from someone that currently, if the TD happens to
              get a short trip like nearby airport type, he can inform the
              wardens and return for another go without having to queue again.
              Anyone heard about this?</p>
              <p>This can be extend to nearby neighbourhood too, maybe just
              issuse a voucher to those vicinity within this classification.
              (Tampines, Simei, Punnggol etc...)</p>
              <p>I was thinking of another scheme too : any trip from the
              airport, regardless of distance :</p>
              <p>$20 for non peak, $25 for peak and $30 for afer midnight.</p>
              <p>if like that, eveyone sure siam the Jurong west type. Haha</p>

              <p>wanna go Q airport , don't complain,</p>
              <p>wanna go Q airport , expect short trip to nearby</p>
              <p>i understand the feeling for q-ing at the airport, but why must
              make your own life difficult. my  kakis always info me
              about airport when is good, but even i nearby i don't want to
              bother, reason is simple, don't wish to get myself into such
              situation.</p>
              <p>during peak time, let's those pax q long long.</p>
              <p>airport surcharge $3 is it worth it? to wait up to 30min, 1hr,
              or 2hr? to me happen to be sending pax to airport  and is png
              then i go into terminal, png, even nearby i don't care, cos i do
              not have to q at all,  considering $3 surcharge is extra to
              me, and put my mind set , later simei, tampines, pasir ris can png.
              most of the time , reach dest, less than 5min get a pax and go.</p>
              <p>short trip is not a problem, problem is the waiting time td have
              to wait . i reckon more than 15min time is a waste of time (in the
              day) .</p>
              <p>So to me, let the pax wait, let the tourist wait, let them wait,
              until someday better surcharge change.</p>
              <p>just wonder why no pax call for taxi when waiting time could be1
              hr before their turn come ( not allow by lta?)</p>

              <p>Some bro here says different people prefer different ways of
              getting pax. Tat's why I dun understand why ppl queue up at
              airport, sometimes T1 queue can go along the way to T3 and T3 queue
              all the way to PIE. What's yr logic? anyone in that position wanna
              share?</p>
              <p>Not only airport, even at MBS, why ppl bother to queue so long
              when there are pax everywhere in the city willing to give them
              $3.30 plus $3.00?</p>
              <p>was wondering if ppl just enjoy smoking and chit chatting while
              passing time to queue? Queuing at T3 from PIE takes how long and
              chances of a Pasir Ris is still 50-50 right?</p>
              <p>More me, I spend my time chatting on watsapp or looking for
              advance job on my iphone CDG apps. Still not very productive
              la.</p>
              <p> My mode of operation (MOD) :</p>
              <p>taxi stand - more than 3 taxi, I dun queue.</p>
              <p>Airport - ony hear got fast moving lobang or pick and go lobang
              from walkie, then I go.</p>
              <p>most of the time, rather go down town empty-to me, it's more
              productive.</p>
              <p>especially night shift drivers who dun smoke-queue too long
              start to feel sleepy.</p>

              <p>there used to be semi-express bus service driect to Orchard Road and Suntec City using ECP that was SBS service 390. Also there use to have express 506 to Bedok, Toa Payoh, Bukit Batok and Jurong East and West. All this service has been remove or shorten due to MRT. very stupid or very smart for LTA.  </p>
              <p>Of cos weekend airport has free express bus service from Toa Payoh, Seng Kang and AMK and Changi business park during lunch break weekdays. </p>
              <p>But I hope changi airport should bring back 390 and 506 as MRT system cannot make it!!! sorry taking taxi is for people in a hurry or already booked hotel or rich. but for normal customer, they need more than just taxi support. actually there is service 27 and 34 to nearby towns.  </p>

              <p>From what I'm hearing SQ is trying to change the arrival time of SQ11. They've got numerous complaints from NRT and US-inbound pax on the ridiculous arrival time at SIN which results in a 4 hour waiting time for connecting pax to other SEA-destinations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Likely from Winter '12 timetable, SQ11 arrival would be pushed back to after 5.30a.m or 6a.m, depending on availablity of landing/departure slots at Narita Airport. Just for your info.</p>

              <p>I don't see why a separate queue should be added.</p>
              <p>The way I see it, it is pandering to those taxi drivers with attitude problems. If we cater to everyone who has an attitude problem, then the world would be an even worse place to live in.</p>
              <p>The problem isn't with passengers who live nearby; it's with drivers who don't want to take them there. Sure, some passengers may live in Tanah Merah, but there are also many others who live in Jurong West or Bukit Batok.</p>
              <p>If you don't want to take a passenger who lives nearby, then don't queue. Simple as that.</p>

              <p>From what I'm hearing SQ is trying to change the arrival time of
              SQ11. They've got numerous complaints from NRT and US-inbound pax

              waiting time for connecting pax to other SEA-destinations.</p>

              <p>Likely from Winter '12 timetable, SQ11 arrival would be pushed
              back to after 5.30a.m or 6a.m, depending on availablity of
