              <p>OBB</p>
              <p>Sorry for sounding a bit hostile in my earlier reply, but it seems like many just like to come into forum and start asking question when all the answers are all here.  My apologies.</p>
              <p>Now, my $0.02...</p>
              <p>I have been driving for about 7 months.  I wasn't OBB when I decided to go into driving taxi.  Instead, I had just lost more than $70k and there are days where I had less than $5 in my pocket.  For the past 7 months, I have been driving as a relief, first driving a Yellow Top taxi and now, a Comfort Sonata.  Although am a relief, there are times when my hirer goes on "leave" and I'm supposed to cover half his rental.  I remember sometime in Nov last year when I had to cover him for 6 days.  I thought "Ho say liao... Got the cab for my own use..." and started driving 14 - 16 hours a day. </p>
              <p>I am those type that Poolman will call "cannot see open type".  See a pax down the road and I'm tempted to press the hazard light and stop for them.  Earnings was very good.  I won't quote any figures here though.  (No point, as what I earned might not be equivalent to what you earn.)  But, by the 4th/5th day, I'm starting to doze off while driving and ended up having to pinch myself to keep myself awake. And, inevitably, it finally happen.  I was on SLE going back to town one late night and doze off.  Next thing I know... I ran into the concrete centre divider of the expressway.  One of the tyre is half punctured and I had to re-spray the paint for the driver side of the car.  (I think Poolman can recall when I calleed him asking for help regarding changing tyre.)  End result is that those extras that I had earned during the past few days all went into repair.</p>
              <p>I never shared this with anyone before.  Reason why I'm sharing this... Don't just because you "owe big big", you start thinking of going OMO and cheong 16 hours a day.  Ultimately, your body won't be able to take it.  If fall sick, still ok.  Can see doctor and get yourself cured.  If (touch wood) kenna accident.... Not worth it lah.  You need a fit body and be always alert in order to fight another day lah.</p>
              <p>Today, 7 months on, I'm still driving as a relief and always looking to increase my income, I don't go past driving for 12 hours.  My honest advice is to just start driving as a relief first.  Go 7 days a week if you have to.  Poolman might not agree with this, but start with Comfort.  Get an autocar such as Sonata.  You will thank God when you kenna stuck in a traffic jam.    Get a manual car and you will start cursing yourself when stuck in a traffic jam.  You save maybe $5 in rental per day.  But end of the day, you get a stiff left leg and always kenna potong jalan by faster taxis... Not worth it.  My buddy, who started with a Crown, is so much happier now that he's driving a Sonata.</p>
              <p>Once you get some rythm going and your income is stable, then talk about going OMO...</p>

              It also depends on ur needs.
              Some omo because they need the car for family outings. One of my classmates owns a business, so he omo to supplement income, and can use cab to deliver goods. Heard also ah long drive cab, they have to be omo, need to buy paint, need to drive to coffeshops to settle their business...
