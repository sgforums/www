              <p>today had a short conversation with a lady from india just started working here not long ago.</p>
              <p>seems very unhappy with her working place and started asking questions.</p>
              <p>lady: excuse me are you a singaporean</p>
              <p>me: yes i am</p>
              <p>lady: can i ask u a question? do singaporeans in general dislike people from india and think that they are very rich since they can come to singapore to work?</p>
              <p>me: huh? sounds like you are very unhappy at your work place and u felt being discriminated?</p>
              <p>lady: yes i do feel this way now...most of them just dont communicates much with me and i can feel the distance from the way they talk to me.</p>
              <p>At this point i just got abit honest and frank with my opinion to her.</p>
              <p>me: well miss, stereo type and racial discriminations happen everywhere, but in my opinion you are not being racial discrinimate as singapore is a multi cultural society and im sure u would have known it before come here to work.</p>
              <p>Most singaporeans have friends from across all races. The problems that you are facing is because of the policy that is being implemented by our current goverment years ago which spiral to what you face today at your work place.</p>
              <p>At this time she was still clueless abt what im talking and asked me what govt policy.</p>
              <p>So i told her to go google on our last election and what most singaporeans are talking and their concerns is about.</p>
              <p>Get my point now? Not all jobs in singapore are as sweet as rosy as before and she would have felt the same as us if her country start doing to her like our country.</p>

              <p>today had a short conversation with a lady from india just
              started working here not long ago.</p>
              <p>seems very unhappy with her working place and started asking
              questions.</p>
              <p>lady: excuse me are you a singaporean</p>
              <p>me: yes i am</p>
              <p>lady: can i ask u a question? do singaporeans in general dislike
              people from india and think that they are very rich since they can
              come to singapore to work?</p>
              <p>me: huh? sounds like you are very unhappy at your work place and
              u felt being discriminated?</p>
              <p>lady: yes i do feel this way now...most of them just
              dont communicates much with me and i can feel the distance
              from the way they talk to me.</p>
              <p>At this point i just got abit honest and frank with my opinion
              to her.</p>
              <p>me: well miss, stereo type and racial discriminations happen
              everywhere, but in my opinion you are not being racial discrinimate
              as singapore is a multi cultural society and im sure u would have
              known it before come here to work.</p>
              <p>Most singaporeans have friends from across all races. The
              problems that you are facing is because of the policy that is being
              implemented by our current goverment years ago which spiral to what
              you face today at your work place.</p>
              <p>At this time she was still clueless abt what im talking and
              asked me what govt policy.</p>
              <p>So i told her to go google on our last election and what most
              singaporeans are talking and their concerns is about.</p>
              <p>Get my point now? Not all jobs in singapore are as sweet as rosy
              as before and she would have felt the same as us if her
              country start doing to her like our country.</p>
