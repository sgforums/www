              <p>Last nite at Chjimes encounter 2 times 2 super YAO GUI TDs who cut queue. Usual practice is to queue outside the main road.</p>
              <p>1st Case: 1 super YAO GUI TD after dropping pax inside Chjimes, waited inside for few minutes n then pick up new paxs. As I was at the back of queue, I'm too lazy to walk all the way to confront tat fucker who waited inside.</p>
              <p>2nd Case: Went to Chjimes 2nd time to pick up pax n waited n finally I was the 1st in queue. Saw a taxi put "Busy" on roof n drove inside Chjimes carpark. I suspected tat sometin was amiss. I walked inside n saw the knn ccb Yao Gui TD change his roof from "Busy" to "Hired" n he waited at the drooping point for pax. Lim pei super tu-lan n from far gestured at him n he saw me n wun dare to look at me. Jus then 2 paxs boarded his taxi n another pax walking in my direction to take my cab.</p>
              <p>As tat yao gui fucker was driving out in my direction, I stared at him n he did not dare to look at me. The other pax then boarded my taxi to Yishun. Along the way, I was thinking tat I should have blocked / intercepted his taxi at the main exit n create a big scene to make him malu n scolded him n dun pick up my pax. I belived those waitin behind me wil sure join in n fuck him together. But as I was more concerned to make $, I pick up my pax.</p>
              <p>I know of many many places where SUPER YAO GUI TDs will cut queue at the expense of others who had waited long in the queue, another classic example is at T2 queue. Those fuckers will pretend to stop n use the toliet for a while n then cut the queue at the canteen n toliet area. They know tat they sure can cut into the queue as some kind-hearted TDs way behind the queue wun suspect anytin n will let those fuckers join the queue cos they thought tat those fuckers r there having meal or there for a long time already.</p>
              <p>Big Bro Poolman n other more experienced TDs, how to deal with those SUPER YAO GUI TDs ? <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Cos these fuckers must b taught a lesson........ cannot allow them to kip on cuting queue, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must make as many of those</span> SUPER YAO GUI <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wake up their idea</span> for the benefit of all TDs. </strong></span></p>

              <p>jus to add...........tis is sometin like a small child doing sometin wrong......if no one lecture them or correct them, they wil kip on doing the wrong tins or repeating the same mistakes.......</p>
              <p>wat i mean is........if more TDs r more proactive n fuck those YAO GUI TDs who cut queue, I believe tat we can cut down the number of these Yao Gui ! Cos if whenever they cut queue n TDs behind the queue bother to get down their taxi to fuck them, honked them, n mati mati dun give them space to cut in, then sure some Yao Gui wil wake up their idea n b less Yao Gui.</p>
              <p>In short, we must <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>not turn a blind eye n MUST DO SOMETIN</strong></span> whenever we see a Yao Gui cut queue again..........</p>

              <p>Such problem as Yao Gui cut Q will never cease, this is not only a TD trade problem, it is a human mentality problem that apply to all trade. Even the rich cut Q to buy shares and discount cars. Even my company executives cut Q whenever there is a buffet lunch offer by company and even passengers cut Q by flagging outside of Taxi stand occasionally, I also got paxs boarded my taxis at drop off location, telling the ushers and me that they need to go hospital urgently, but later on the way, onlyÂ to their cluny roadÂ private house.</p>
              <p>Of course it is not nice to cut Q, as all are TD brother, it is really shameful to let the public see TDs quarrelling and even fighting among ourselves. So, all TD brothers and sisters, please understand that we are good people, not those rich or executives who studied so high, earn so much and yet behave like animals.</p>
