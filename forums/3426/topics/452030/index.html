              <p>Singapore is base on gender equality, that is why many guys cannot get local girls, the gender equality had made our local girls out of femine attraction and also lack of feminity and woman in them, as a wife or gf, many also lack the understand of serving their love ones.</p>
              <p>And that is why many local guys today including young ones are more interested in foreign women.</p>
              <p>My time in the 80s and 70s, local women are more caring, discipline, respect their love ones, today, hardly, you can't blame the local women, because the society of gender equality gives them the leeway out of family committment.</p>
              <p>Even country like Japan or korea and taiwan, wife do still respect their husband and place him as chief of the house.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">, you know the jap and korean men works very hard, when they go home, their wife remove their shoe, childrens will bow to respect their father, wife prepare hot tub for bathing and also hot food for dinner, remove husband cloth for washing, then prepare newspaper and tea for him to relax, later have good sex.</p>
              <p>The men in turns work very hard, the never say die type of working atitude, to them, it is their duty to bring food back, and to the wife, it is her duty to serve her husband and care for the family. And because of their full committment in work, they produced toyota, sonata, sony, samsung and many own brands,</p>
              <p>They are not like we, a slave of govt and MNCs, cos singapore can only produce casinos, singapore pool and SIA girls, therefore, we are alway at the mercy of foreign economy. We lack the skill to create and innovate, even china are producing Iphone and Cherry, bought volvo, we dun even produce a toy car.</p>
              <p>Problem is govt take this country as company and not a society</p>
              <p>Singapore gal, lan lah, cook also dunno, can only cook maggie me, ask them to make coffee, they can ask you to make it yourself, then when you are brewing, they ask you to make one for them. In a nation where man looks like woman, woman looks like man, what is there left for marriage and children bearing?</p>
