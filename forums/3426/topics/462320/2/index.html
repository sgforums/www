              <p>Yes, I do agree, by meeting up might be a good solution to build

              <p>Old birds feel threatened by newbies? You must be kidding. They
              just move on to cari makan after realising it's not worth the time
              and effort to carry on guiding new birds who are not
              appreciative.<br> <br> I remembered BCL (fka TCL) once said to me that he won't mind
              sharing to anyone who took the effort to meet-up for kopi. Sharing
              has to be a 2-way traffic not just consuming and not contributing.
              We can assess a person during meet-up to see whether that person is
              worth guiding. Have seen many newbies come and
              gone.ï¼ˆå�ƒé¥±æ‹�æ‹�å±�è‚¡å°±èµ°äººï¼‰<br> <br> How many newbie started humbly and 6 months down the road became
              ya-ya papaya, act garang and talk big. Some even posted their
              fantastic collections (with pictures somemore) despite repeated
              calls to refrain from doing it.<br> <br> Just my perception that this is the reason many earlier forummers
              "retreated" from here. They just don't feel comradely enough
              compared to earlier days.<br> <br> Cab driving is about each earning their own dough. TD don't have to
              envy or even jealous of other TD earning big bucks.</p>

              <p>if not for them , i dunno who is going to help us to desptach those paxes at Little India .</p>
              <p>I lucky not from CDG ..... cos more drivers means less calls for them , it really does't bother me too much .</p>

              <p>I know where to get kuching kurak passengers ..... not those long trip types .</p>
              <p>If one are to tell me cos of this forum , more drivers are coming in , now they face competitions , they are just not good enough .</p>
              <p>All i can say ..... many had already decided to becoming a taxi driver . Before they sit into this forum .</p>
              <p>Taxi driving cannot get knowledge on paper one .</p>
              <p>All have to go through while driving .</p>
              <p>More drivers doesn't mean Comfort has got overnight 30,000 taxis , same fleet .</p>
              <p>Only different , SMRT has got more Chevy .</p>
              <p>Does many Chevy afftected me ?</p>
              <p>No ...... to me , i see same thing everyday .</p>
