              </p><p>There shouldn't be any "uneducated" mention on Taxi Driver, this is a misleading perception from the olden days. We should not further advance such misperception to the next generation.</p>
              <p>I can accept "lesser education". </p>
              <p>Althought Taxi Driving is an easy entry business, but that doesn't mean it belong to "uneducated", many smart people take it as a "job/career shelter" for some downtime in their career path. There are more entrepreneurship quailty people in this trade that many others.</p>
              <p>I do agree there is nothing glamorous about this job, but after many years of walking in life, how glamourous can it be even working in the CBD, wearing branded long sleeve and tie? </p>

              It is not right to talk about educated or uneducated people, driving taxi.
              
              All the taxi drivers are educated and trained in taxi driving.

              <p>There are pros and cons in everything, Earning 4 to 5k today is a norm, nobody will give you that kind of Wow! earn so much look. Maybe 10 years ago, yes, people may envy your pay. The economy of singapore is moving at a fast pace, in the next 10 years, or even now, living in condo is nothing.</p>
              <p>The question is, are you happy with what you are doing? if so, you are tends to be very productive and enjoy life to the fullness. If not, too bad, you need to do something about it, if you hold on to something you do not like but because of $$, you hv to endure it, then, happiness is not in your life, for once, happiness is priceless.</p>
