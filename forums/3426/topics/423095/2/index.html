              <p>Poolman where's the LV page? Got something to say about LV, recently got alots of new member and maybe they are lone ranger or friends in LV never teach them how and when to get XXX call not even knows about open call, try call or cfm call...i think when new member join LV should give them 1 week of learning time, which mean this 1 week is free time, can't take call just listen and learn. After 1 week then start of member fee. ofcoz the best is to open class...hahaha...</p>

              <p>Had a coffee break with some BT Pj Sonata drivers .</p>
              <p>Hey , u know what ?</p>
              <p>Something happened to them , they realized something !</p>
              <p>Whenever they put on to Scheme B , if they got a pax , their pax will tell them : " <span style="color: #ff0000;">Uncle , why like that ? Operator gave me 2 taxi numbers</span> ! "</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">That could be the reasons to so many<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> No Shows</span> on them as well .</span></p>
              <p>Imagine operator sent them 2 taxis , my friend got the pax , what will happen to the second taxi ?</p>
              <p>So next time if u got a pax , ask them how many taxi numbers were they given ?</p>
              <p>If Scheme B kena call , if no show , for me , i will call pax personally , and ask them nicely , does operator gave them 2 numbers , instead of 1 ?</p>
              <p>For benefits of all Comfort &amp; Citycab drivers , ask for the truth . Discover the truth .</p>
              <p>It's okay if u pretend nothing happen . Not your problem anyway . Not mine as well .</p>

              No show or cancellation is not because of scheme A or B
              
              During hot / peak hours , when Pax A called, system will throw this call to a few drivers (or could be 2)
              eg driver x, driver y
              
              If both these 2 drivers accept the booking, the one with the shortest timing will get the job, the other will get call cancelled message
              
              If both press 3 mins, the nearer one will get the job (calculated by system)
              
              But sometimes system cork up, when driver x is supposed to get the job, call cancellation was not sent to driver y (or air time jammed) therefore you will encounter both drivers at location to pick up 1 pax
              
              In this case if both drivers call the call centre, the auntie will tell them whoever arrives first get the job, 2nd to arrive balek kampong ... haha

              <p>Yah, yesterday afternoon got hit by this problem. But yesterday was a SUNDAY wor. Demand was not especially high. Got a booking from this condo, (was on scheme A). 5 mins arrived at lobby, just in time to see another sonata (hired) leaving. Methinks, hijacked liao. But no cancellation came. BIG SUPRISE. The first sonata pulled up about 20ft away and this guy (pool's favourite race) alighted. Walked over to my cab, pressed $ in my palm and said "called for 1 but they sent 2 cabs. sorry". I tell you, really made my day. Not the money (less than press meter), it's that this guy bothered to alight and explained the matter to the late comer. I think 1st and last time for me, sibe gentlemen this guy <img src="http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/4/4_17_206.gif" border="0" alt="Thumbs Up">. Despite being "No Show"ed, was in a good mood, it really was the thought that counts. Thank you for making my day!</p>

The first sonata pulled up about 20ft away and this guy (pool's favourite race) alighted. Walked over to my cab, pressed $ in my palm and said "called for 1 but they sent 2 cabs. sorry". I tell you, really made my day. Not the money (less than press meter), it's that this guy bothered to alight and explained the matter to the late comer. I think 1st and last time for me, sibe gentlemen this guy <img src="http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/4/4_17_206.gif" alt="Thumbs Up">. Despite being "No Show"ed, was in a good mood, it really was the thought that counts. Thank you for making my day!</p>
