              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rot? You drive 12-15 hours expect relief to rot? Lets see what
                  happen after 3-4 years, who will rot?</span></p>
              <p>You can offer whatever price, depends whether ppl want or
                  agree.</p>
              <p>What Poolman is saying is correct. 8pm to 8am although looks
                  like 12 hours, actually isn't. You can't drive these 12 hours
                  fully. Because weekday after 1-6, not easy to find, so have to go
                  back and then come out again at 6 to find morning pax, effectively
                  you are splitting the relief shift, so is 50-50 fair, ask yourself?
                  Whereas hirer guaranteed of pax from 8am to 8pm.</p>
              <p>Hirers can think what they want, but those who have been driving
                  long, know it's very much a relief's choice still to choose whether
                  to deal with calculative hirers.</p>
              <p>Hirer and relief not the same. Hirer gets all the benefits,
                  relief doesn't, you expect the relief to share the your burden
                  50-50?</p>
              <p>Good luck with your $60 offer, but let me tell you, relief never
                  will rot, not in our industry.</p>
              </div>

              <p>U dam power la. from this sentence, you can comprehend until I said let the relief rot. Are u having problem with your English or you are twisting my quote to put words into my mouth to serve your own gain?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>In any jobs, working in midnight shift are alway paid more, from operators to shipyard workers to guards, they are given special allowances and benefit, so in fact, those driving nite shift should earn more than those morning shift, and that is why got these 25 to 50% surcharges, but if you, as a hirer is going to base on this to justify a higher relief rental, I believe it will be hard for any relief to swallow, unless one who is new or plain naive.</p></div>

              <p>anything dun fall between 5-5 is abnormal? who decide?</p>
              <p>So happens that MOST ppl choose that time slot, that's all. Most ppl do it doesn't make it a LAW.</p>
              <p>People set their timing on their own convenience, I have seen 3-3 type cos hirer need to do other stuff after 3, anything wrong with that if he can find a relief? or just because it's not 5-5, must give hefty discount? Mine is 6.30 to 6.30, anything wrong?</p>
              <p>I DO know what is graveyard shift. It's also compensated there with the 50% surcharge. It's also normal of relief to so call "buy at lowest, sell at highest" or "buy garbage but sell as antique. He sure want to get the lowest possible rental and as u said, even if he can sell as antique is non of hirer business.</p>
              <p>Anyway, no point argue so much, everything is subject to supply and demand.</p>
              <p>U want my cab at $30, I rather leave it idle there and rest. As Poolman said, $30? press meter can get liao. No need to spoil the market.</p>
              <p>Relief is King? see which hirer u meet la!</p>

              <p>anything dun fall between 5-5 is abnormal? who decide?</p>
              <p>So happens that MOST ppl choose that time slot, that's all. Most
              ppl do it doesn't make it a LAW.</p>
              <p>People set their timing on their own convenience, I have seen
              3-3 type cos hirer need to do other stuff after 3, anything wrong
              with that if he can find a relief? or just because it's not 5-5,
              must give hefty discount? Mine is 6.30 to 6.30, anything wrong?</p>
              <p>I DO know what is graveyard shift. It's also compensated there
              with the 50% surcharge. It's also normal of relief to so call "buy
              at lowest, sell at highest" or "buy garbage but sell as antique. He
              sure want to get the lowest possible rental and as u said, even if
              he can sell as antique is non of hirer business.</p>
              <p>Anyway, no point argue so much, everything is subject to supply
              and demand.</p>
              <p>U want my cab at $30, I rather leave it idle there and rest. As
              Poolman said, $30? press meter can get liao. No need to spoil the
              market.</p>
              <p>Relief is King? see which hirer u meet la!</p>

              <p>Look fellas, as TS said $50 sat nite 8pm to 8am, I think is a golden opportunity for the relief to make money. Can easily turnover 4-5 times that amount!</p>
              <p>Talking as a hirer myself:</p>
              <p>I am main con and the relief wanna sub my vehicle for biz gotta hear my terms and conditions right? Accept or not is up to him.</p>
              <p>After all, he gets to make money and if suay suay he thrash my cab until half-dead, I have to pick up the pieces, right? So it is up to me to feel it is worth my while before I let the relief have the cab, right?</p>
              <p>We dunno each other and I am not doing public service, so there is no who helping who right? If the relief is not making any money and willing to share paying my rental, then that is called helping! </p>
              <p>So back to supply and demand, if there are 10 reliefs around my block, is it wrong for me to increase the rental?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>I think before we start talking about my command of English, pls re-read what you had posted and the thread in general and see what it means.</p>
              <p>If we not talking about a relief taking over then what are talking about? CDG got 2 hirers now?  Cab park there means what? Pray tell? For a passer-by to take over?</p>
              <p>Or park there because hirer want terms that relief has to follow? Since when will a parked cab come to rot?</p>
              <p>We already had many threads about late night shifts. Once I asked for opinions about a 11pm to 6 pm one @ $25. After much discussion, I agreed with many posters that hirer while not wrong is trying to squeeze every single bit. Of course midnight can earn, but at what price and effort? Why not offer 6pm to 12 midnight at $25, as you say 6pm to midnight only got 25% not 50%. Offer that la.</p>
              <p>Yes forum is about opinions, you can offer yours, but expect others to disagree. If you made a mistake, just admit it, yeah I thought it was a good idea, but after consideration maybe not such a good idea.</p>
              <p>Go ask any TD, midnight shift means what? From 5 or 6 pm to 12 midnight, you must go earn your rent, diesel and minimum amount, after 12, it's all bonus, except Fri and Sat, after 12 can cari makan.</p>
              <p>Talking about 8pm. My friend has an offer at that time for 20 days. 8pm to 6am, he ask me what to offer, I said anywhere from $35-40, if you get $30 better still, but $35 is about right. Why because no point extending to 8am, you will have stay awake for 12 hours at night, not good on the body.</p>
              <p>Your offer is genuinely what you believed, but it's also flawed when you consider all the factors in. If you cannot accept that, then no point in explaining further, you're entitled to your views, we are entitled to offer differing ones in turn.</p>

                  <p>My point is not half rental, or half shift..is the timing.</p><p>
                  
                  </p><p>No permanent night relief will come knock your door and offer to drive this time. If have, please pm me, good for me.</p><p>
                  
                  </p><p>5-5 is norm, 6-6 ok la, 630-630, still can sustain...7pm onwards...night drivers think twice lo.</p><p>
                  
                  </p><p>My years of driving, the successful partnership between both parties still 5-5, don't believe, ask around. No argument one, long term partnership.</p><p></p>

              Hi. Been a silent  follower of the forum for so long, cant resist my fingers to post a reply to this thread. FYI I am a OMO
                      
              For e start, I think it is perfectly fine to charge relief $50 for a fri or sat 8pm to 8am shift. Relief will have no problem to fetch a decent return as town is full with paxs even during midnite. If lucky, can get connections at hdb estate.
                      
              But to charge relief $50 for a weekday 8pm to 8am shift is subjective. For me is a no no. Granted that there are 6 hrs of peak hrs and 6 hrs of midnite surcharge. Relief will face a challenge to make it works. For example.
                      
              Relief starts driving at 8pm at CCK, if lucky he can get a fare straight away at CCK. Cross his fingers that the trip will bring him to town or near it. If not shuttles between hdb towns, or drives to nearby business/ industrial district and waits for call. Likely he will need to drive empty to town starting fr 11pm. By then town is almost dead. After 2am, waiting time will be longer. Midnite drive during mon to thurs is never easy. No doubt relief can still earn a minimum of $100 for this 6 hrs of midnite driving. Considering his higher usage of diesel, his hourly average will be lower than those driving during non peak hrs daytime. 
              
              Come to morning peak, relief will have to drive very restrictedly as he will have to return cab by 8am. Can he take call or fetch street pax to airport and rush back to CCK in time? Imagine getting himself stuck in jam on expressway during his way back. Lastly should he need to wash car or top up diesel, more downtime needed.
              
              Finally it still comes down to the supply vs demand thingy. If relief willing to bite e bullet and take e 8pm to 8am slot for weekdays, it will be his choice. He has only himself to answer for his decision. 
              
              As a responsible hirer, one has to set terms to achieve a win win situation for both hirer and relief. Then relationship will then be a long lasting one
