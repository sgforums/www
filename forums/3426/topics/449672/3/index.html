              <p>Yes, I agree. Point is also that midnite shift have certain patterns for sleep.  Best is to sleep before the sun comes up, because when it does, it usually takes a little longer to sleep easily unless of course super tired.</p>
              <p>I find many ppl have this same pattern, must sleep before 6.30 to 7, if not, the next timing will be at 8.30 - 9am. Miss that then it comes between 11-12 noon.</p>
              <p>I think the body naturally reacts easily in darkness for sleep as opposed to daylight.</p>
              <p>Limo line (pvte) is easier, can sleep in parts, every time no job can catch 40 winks until the next job. So like that even if got midnite or 2am arrival/departure, your body already programmed to rest in bits to make up the daily 8 hours. But TD cannot do that, your jobs depend entirely on you finding them, be it through bookings or street hire. You gotta get proper rest before starting.</p>

              <p>I think before we start talking about my command of English, pls
              re-read what you had posted and the thread in general and see what
              it means.</p>
              <p>If we not talking about a relief taking over then what are
              talking about? CDG got 2 hirers now?  Cab park there means
              what? Pray tell? For a passer-by to take over?</p>
              <p>Or park there because hirer want terms that relief has to
              follow? Since when will a parked cab come to rot?</p>
              <p>We already had many threads about late night shifts. Once I
              asked for opinions about a 11pm to 6 pm one @ $25. After much
              discussion, I agreed with many posters that hirer while not wrong
              is trying to squeeze every single bit. Of course midnight can earn,
              but at what price and effort? Why not offer 6pm to 12 midnight at
              $25, as you say 6pm to midnight only got 25% not 50%. Offer that
              la.</p>
              <p>Yes forum is about opinions, you can offer yours, but expect
              others to disagree. If you made a mistake, just admit it, yeah I
              thought it was a good idea, but after consideration maybe not such
              a good idea.</p>
              <p>Go ask any TD, midnight shift means what? From 5 or 6 pm to 12
              midnight, you must go earn your rent, diesel and minimum amount,
              after 12, it's all bonus, except Fri and Sat, after 12 can cari
              makan.</p>
              <p>Talking about 8pm. My friend has an offer at that time for 20
              days. 8pm to 6am, he ask me what to offer, I said anywhere from
              $35-40, if you get $30 better still, but $35 is about right. Why
              because no point extending to 8am, you will have stay awake for 12
              hours at night, not good on the body.</p>
              <p>Your offer is genuinely what you believed, but it's also flawed
              when you consider all the factors in. If you cannot accept that,
              then no point in explaining further, you're entitled to your views,
              we are entitled to offer differing ones in turn.</p>

              <p>First all, this is a forum, not a classroom, not need to highlight in blue or red.</p>
              <p>You want respect, give respect? Why not write all in CAPS, better way to gain attention.</p>
              <p>No need to explain further, either you don't understand even what your writing or trying to pin the blame for others,  when it was you who started comments chiding reliefs for not agreeing with hirers demands or burdens.</p>
              <p>Just look at your second sentence ; relief dun want to bear burden...</p>
              <p>And then before your classic red lined sentence:  hirer eveything have to bear...suka suka let relief throw key, is that fair?</p>
              <p>Follow by soon all hirer will be like me blah blah....rather let park the cab there, let it rot also shiok...</p>
              <p>So you still deny you were only talking about a cab here, not a relief. Despite inferring and refering to it prior to it, about relief's demands.</p>
              <p>Any layman will understand from your sentence: that unless reliefs accept hirers terms and conditions, hirers will be like you, not wanting to give reliefs a cab to drive, prefering to park the cab, letting reliefs suffer (or rot) until they give in.</p>
              <p>You don't have to spefically say 'all reliefs should rot', you already infered to it very clearly by saying hirers shouldn't have to share 50-50 with relief, because hirers already have a burden and it's not fair of relief to demand things equally.</p>
              <p>Then you go on to suggest hirers should be like you in adopting this policy. By doing so, what would be the logical explanation? - That unless reliefs accept the terms, hirers should earn less by parking the vehicle, and enjoy watching reliefs struggle to find a cab. How do I know? Because when you say rot followed by shiok, who are you referring to? The cab? Come one la - which hirer watch their own cab rot, is shiok?</p>
              <p>Or let the cab be there, reliefs left to rot and hirers enjoy seeing them do (shiok).</p>
              <p>Since you like to mark in red and blue, go ask any English schoolteacher, lawyer doctor (someone very good in English), who they think you're inferring to when they read your post?</p>
              <p>And no, forummers here are not stupid, maybe just 1 or 2. They also can see very clearly what you're referring to, just like I did.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>First all, this is a forum, not a classroom, not need to
                          highlight in blue or red.</p>
              <p>You want respect, give respect? Why not write all in CAPS,
                          better way to gain attention.</p>
              <p>No need to explain further, either you don't understand even
                          what your writing or trying to pin the blame for others,  when
                          it was you who started comments chiding reliefs for not agreeing
                          with hirers demands or burdens.</p>
              <p>Just look at your second sentence ; relief dun want to bear
                          burden...</p>
              <p>And then before your classic red lined sentence:  hirer
                          eveything have to bear...suka suka let relief throw key, is that
                          fair?</p>
              <p>Follow by soon all hirer will be like me blah blah....rather let
                          park the cab there, let it rot also shiok...</p>
              <p>So you still deny you were only talking about a cab here, not a
                          relief. Despite inferring and refering to it prior to it, about
                          relief's demands.</p>
              <p>Any layman will understand from your sentence: that unless
                          reliefs accept hirers terms and conditions, hirers will be like
                          you, not wanting to give reliefs a cab to drive, prefering to park
                          the cab, letting reliefs suffer (or rot) until they give in.</p>
              <p>You don't have to spefically say 'all reliefs should rot', you
                          already infered to it very clearly by saying hirers shouldn't have
                          to share 50-50 with relief, because hirers already have a burden
                          and it's not fair of relief to demand things equally.</p>
              <p>Then you go on to suggest hirers should be like you in adopting
                          this policy. By doing so, what would be the logical explanation? -
                          That unless reliefs accept the terms, hirers should earn less by
                          parking the vehicle, and enjoy watching reliefs struggle to find a
                          cab. How do I know? Because when you say rot followed by shiok, who
                          are you referring to? The cab? Come one la - which hirer watch
                          their own cab rot, is shiok?</p>
              <p>Or let the cab be there, reliefs left to rot and hirers enjoy
                          seeing them do (shiok).</p>
              <p>Since you like to mark in red and blue, go ask any English
                          schoolteacher, lawyer doctor (someone very good in English), who
                          they think you're inferring to when they read your post?</p>
              <p>And no, forummers here are not stupid, maybe just 1 or 2. They
                          also can see very clearly what you're referring to, just like I
                          did.</p>

              <p>Guess no need to bother typing so much. waste band width.</p>
              <p>It take a real man to admit his mistake and I guess I not talking to one.</p>
              <p>trying to cover a mistake with more and more mistake. </p>
              <p>Just another slippery guy trying to play with words or rather mincing them.</p>
              <p>what imply? infer? refer? defer? gosh</p>
              <p>does so many ugly exchanges imply that I am going for your life? so literaly means I commit murder? so by right I should get the death sentence? just due to your imply?</p>
              <p>If all judges works on your theory that imply or infer or refer means actual happening, death sentence in SG break all time high.</p>

              <p>You like to offer your opinion on how things should be, the way you reckon it should.</p>
              <p>Fair
               enough, doesn't matter, new or old everyone got a view.  Some of us, 
              old mentality also must change and follow the new, who have better ideas
               sometimes. Same goes for new, some things not in a position to comment because the experience not fully reach there.</p>
              <p>But when you take a position or assume things, where experience 
              will suggest otherwise, then expect people to disagree and respect that 
              right to disagree.</p>
              <p>If you want post things not wanting people to comment, then ask Poolman to lock your threads, so only your view will be there.</p>
              <p>I
               find uaskforit sometimes asking silly questions, but when he asked for 
              views about your midnight to 6 offer, what's wrong with that? You put up
               an offer in a forum where everyone can ask, question or discuss, what's
               wrong with him asking for views, be it positive or negative?  This not 
              comfort portal, if you post at comfort portal and he mention it, fair 
              enough, he's wrong.</p>
              <p>He never say you must stop asking for such 
              offers, nobody says either. But generally almost all old timers here and
               many others would disagree or caution ppl taking up such an offer.</p>
              <p>But
               no, you take it as a personal attack, rather than what we explained as a
               flawed or risky offer. You can do it, good for you, but many can't and 
              shouldn't. We offered our opinions against it, but never said you were 
              wrong or ppl should 100% reject it. If got, good for them and you.</p>
              <p>You
               post and answer things based on your mentality, you assume things, but 
              sometimes such things has been proven wrong with experience. But with 
              your limited experience, you insist you're right and take it very 
              personally when ppl point out the flaws. Then you push the blame 
              everywhere but yourself.</p>
              <p>As you said, forummers not stupid, they 
              know exactly what things are, how things operate and what is right or 
              wrong. You can deny, condemn and get personal, that is entirely your 
              choice.</p>

              <p>You reply without referring to forummers, I treat you talking to

              <p>you CB never see I target other forummers, cause Knnbccb, they
