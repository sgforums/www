            <div class='col-md body'><p>My wife just told me this morning about her Vietnamese GF who took a Transcab taxi from CCK Crescent to Airport terminal 2 at about 10.30am. Two ladies and a little girl, the lady sitting in front seat left her wallet which had S$7K in it. Was told that the Vietnamese lady came to earn money for her mother's operation. She is asking for the driver to come forward and please return her money. Was told that young Vietnamese fainted when she realised her money left in the Transcab taxi. Poor lady.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I heard from my wife that she came to Singapore and worked in KTV to earn the money needed for her mother's operation. She had to carry seven One Thousand Dollar notes so that it is easy to hide from Vietnam customs which only allows US$4,000 to be brought into Vietnam. She accidently dropped it when she took out money to pay for cab fare. She was sitting in front seat. The 7 1K notes were rolled up and tied with rubber band. She discovered it was missing when she took out her passport to check in. It is her hard earned money, she took 3 months to earn and save this money but now I lost it. I have already made a police report on her behalf and will go to TC to see if I can get Jasmine to help trace the taxi. According to her, she thinks the TC driver lives at same block 690 CCK cause he was seen carry a water bottle into car park and exit the car park just as the ladies walk out to flag taxi. Anyway, just have to see if the TD got heart to return what they really lost and need. I feel so bad for her. So they know some details about the taxi.</p></div>

              <p>They are on tourist visa so cannot open bank account here. Even money they earn per day they have to keep under pillow or mattress. Even if u TT back to Vietnam, the Vietnam authority will start checking where money come from. Have to hand carry mah. I heard these girls everyday earn bread or instant noodles to save as much as they can. Only when go out wt custs then they eat more cause they no need pay. I think these things we never think or encountered.</p>

              <p>First of all, thanks god $7k was recovered........</p>
              <p>It lead me back to my first question, why bring so much cash with you if you know the limitation by Vietnam's custom? </p>
              <p>Secondly, nobody is judging this Viet's gal, detail provided by TS, I'm just post what I know, why a tourist pass holder working in Singapore? Simple as that, and full stop, the rest is provided by TS..........</p>
              <p>Lastly, Why must I know the situation of other country?.......you come Singapore, you follow rules, I go Vietnam, I follow their rules, simple as that........ </p>
              <p>Don't reiterate just for reiterating, everything is provided and post by TS, nobody is assuming.........</p>

              <p>In fact, in Singapore, the reverse is more true, we cabbies are more worry about cheapo, run fares, drunk beating and robbing paxs.</p>
              <p>We are therefore better than Jap cabby as we need to be wary, handling and facing all these hazards</p>
