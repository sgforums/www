              <p>Took my wife to accompany the Vietnamese Lady to collect back her lost money. After she got back the money she called her mother in Vietnam and started crying. Felt so proud and good when see her smiling and crying. I just collect taxi fare for sending her to and back from TC. She asked me to thank all those who helped, I got the TD contact from TC and she will personally call the TD that return the money. Wait for the call.... By the way TD, she can speak mandarin so u can communicate wt her.</p>
              <p>My wife later to me that the lady did not dare to tell her mother that she lost the money, only after get back the money in hand then she dare to tell. that was when she started crying. Guys in this forum did good. Merry Christmas!!!</p>
