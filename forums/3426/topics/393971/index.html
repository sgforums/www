              <p>I really don't understand why other road user don't like to give way to taxi. Even taxi don't give way to taxi. I use to give way especially other taxi, I always give advance signal but other just don't give way. Don't signal still can eat once signal other will acce faster. So if pai kai abit will let people flash la hon la. I swear i never give way to others even taxi i also won't give.</p>
              <p>Just last night towards ORQ at the junction b4 AIA. Get a call so need to turn right, signal on liao...once light turn green nobody give, saw a gap wanna cut f**king crown just drive faster. What the hell....! If not on call i sure play with him, mark him don't let him take the lane towards ECP. So all bro next time see i don't give way don't angry with me. Cos other don't give me first. Sound like small kid??? Bo bian...</p>

              <p>Yah, sorry but I have a habit of doing that too. If you signal, you will have a hard time getting into the lane. I will raise my hand as a gesture of saying THANKS - only after I am in the lane.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p><br>coz if one signal, then other drivers will die die not allow to that particular driver to cut rite? lol. no lah, i have seen a fair share of drivers who don't mind giving way coz u signal. those that dun r juz guai-lan.</p>
              <p>well, on the other hand, most of the taxi drivers are the guai-lans, they will never give way to other motorist....perheps they r rushing all the time to make money.</p>

              <p>i think the driving in singapore is rather timid. Once the front corner of the car has entered into either lane, by all means drive out but of cos dun be a dumb ass and cut out when the other guy driving at full speed. I ever saw a car drive out of the filter with an oncoming car just a split second away. The accident was averted with some quick reflexes from the oncoming car. So guess which driver was the guy and which was the lady? haha.</p>
              <p>Different countries have different driving cultures. Horning here can be considered quite rude but in other countries, it can be "pls look out, I'm here".</p>

              <p>I really don't understand why other road user don't like to give
              way to taxi. Even taxi don't give way to taxi. I use to give way
              especially other taxi, I always give advance signal but other
              just don't give way. Don't signal still can eat once signal other
              will acce faster. So if pai kai abit will let people flash la
              hon la. I swear i never give way to others even taxi i also won't
              give.</p>
              <p>Just last night towards ORQ at the junction b4 AIA. Get a call
              so need to turn right, signal on liao...once light turn green
              nobody give, saw a gap wanna cut f**king crown just drive faster.
              What the hell....! If not on call i sure play with him, mark him
              don't let him take the lane towards ECP. So all bro next time see i
              don't give way don't angry with me. Cos other don't give me first.
              Sound like small kid??? Bo bian...</p>

              its an 'sickness' habit for me to signal wen switchin lanes but wen doing so, i always give adequate adv notice. 
              
              Therefore m seriously pissed off wen aft i signal + give enough 'advance' notice + cut in liao, the bloody car(s) &gt;20feets behind can honk or beam at me! obviously they r drivin slow initially bt started to accelerate suddenly cos unhapi to allow a van come in front of em.
              
              i met few of such &amp; they managed to 'acquire' some rd courtesy aft that...one auntie got tailgated &amp; air-horned by me all d way on pie for few kms @ 110 while d other screwed-up-ah-lao kept a 4 car-length distant behind me when i slowed &amp; turned back pt finger at him to come nearer. there was one Beng on an old galant whom i wound down my window &amp; showed him the gesture 'why horn? see no signal?' He shrinked &amp; kept 2 containers' length away fm me tho me not threatening la...

              i do however feel particularly hapi wen d veh whom i gave way to put up their hand to 'thank you', tho its ok i rec'd nothing 99% of d time!
              
              which's why sometimes wen @ 80+, wen d veh behind me gave way to me switchin into em, me always wave 'thank you' to em too...becos appreciated car allows van in + its then again a 'sickness' habit la :)

              <p>i think the driving in singapore is rather timid. Once the front corner of the car has entered into either lane, by all means drive out but of cos dun be a dumb ass and cut out when the other guy driving at full speed. I ever saw a car drive out of the filter with an oncoming car just a split second away. The accident was averted with some quick reflexes from the oncoming car. So guess which driver was the guy and which was the lady? haha.</p>
              <p>Different countries have different driving cultures. Horning here can be considered quite rude but in other countries, it can be "pls look out, I'm here".</p>
