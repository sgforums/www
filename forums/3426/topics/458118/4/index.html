              <p>Of course in reality of life, where one still needs to fed school going childrens, old parents and a housewife, of course it is never going to be a joke. It is more of responsibility.</p>
              <p>The joke is between a private and taxi new mercs, if one is well to do,  do not mind a taxi on top, why not? But having said that, it will certainly make lesser taxis on the road which ultimately displeases LTA and cabby companies.</p>
              <p>And in fact, there are some (clowns) just earn $20 to 30 per day, keep car liao. Some of my older hirers is like this, you said I drive for you today, they tell you, if can drive for me a week, lagi good, but mostly are older ones who already make their nests with their grandchildrens, just like most older workers in companies, it merely a passing time with something to do.</p>
              <p>Even their children ask them to give up, throw keys, they also refuse, at least their legs got sometime to step on better than sitting forlornly at the void deck or infront of TV.</p>
              <p>The reality of life is choice, in life, there are choices, if this cannot, then do that, some like to take risk, some are more prudent, and some simply never want to take risk, each has their own pros and cons. Of course the higher the risk, the greater can be the return but less secure, the lower the risk, the less in return but more secure. </p>
              <p>It is up to individual to weight the balance for themselves, and like Bro ericgo rightly put it, you can hum, laugh or confirm such rental will make one die cock standing, but cdg is confident that peoples will take it, they already did their maths.</p>

              <p>Of course in reality of life, where one still needs to fed
              school going childrens, old parents and a housewife, of course it
              is never going to be a joke. It is more of responsibility.</p>
              <p>The joke is between a private and taxi new mercs, if one is well
              to do,  do not mind a taxi on top, why not? But having said
              that, it will certainly make lesser taxis on the road which
              ultimately displeases LTA and cabby companies.</p>
              <p>And in fact, there are some (clowns) just earn $20 to 30
              per day, keep car liao. Some of my older hirers is like this, you
              said I drive for you today, they tell you, if can drive for me a
              week, lagi good, but mostly are older ones who already make their
              nests with their grandchildrens, just like most older workers in
              companies, it merely a passing time with something to do.</p>
              <p>Even their children ask them to give up, throw keys, they also
              refuse, at least their legs got sometime to step on better than
              sitting forlornly at the void deck or infront of TV.</p>
              <p>The reality of life is choice, in life, there are choices,
              if this cannot, then do that, some like to take risk, some are more
              prudent, and some simply never want to take risk, each has their
              own pros and cons. Of course the higher the risk, the greater can
              be the return but less secure, the lower the risk, the less in
              return but more secure. </p>
              <p>It is up to individual to weight the balance for themselves, and
              like Bro ericgo rightly put it, you can hum, laugh or confirm such
              rental will make one die cock standing, but cdg is confident that
              peoples will take it, they already did their maths.</p>

              <p>Yes, that's true have met a few TD, whose cab got 3 to 4 drivers, all old timer, just to earn pocket money. All pay rent around $20-25 depending on the make.</p>
              <p>Of course the last one has the longest time span say 9pm to 5 or 6 am, the rest 5-6 hours.</p>

              <p>thanks for sharing this. where can we find out more about this ,

              <p>Yes, very classy for a special class like yourself. This model surely can help you meet your targets.</p>
              <p>I strongly recommend new drivers like yourself with good qualifications to drive this cab. Comfort also prefer, better educated drivers to drive this cab. Because you will meet higher class of pax, and obviously being a graduate helps in dealing with them.</p>
