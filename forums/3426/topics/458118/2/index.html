              <p>Depending on your style of driving, switching from old to new, sees an increase of $15-30 (full/half day) extra in rental give and take. But the fuel consumption could lower it by over $10-20 (full or half day)</p>
              <p>But all things remaining equal - for myself I almost always drive the same hours and mileage. 5-7 hours on weekday at around 150-200km, be it Sonata, Crown or Azera.</p>
              <p>In fact it was the old Sonata that costs me more compared to the guzzling Azera. Azera I play town or airport most times. Also selective searching of pax more compared to Sonata.</p>
              <p>I would have gone on to drive the new Merc in january next year if I remained with Azera hirer as he had applied for it. I did my calculations and could forsee paying an extra $10 -15 day in rental after deducting everything. But for the comfort and smoothness of the drive as I had driven Merc (as pvte Limo), I felt it was risk worth taking. Only I found the hirer unreasonable that's why I switched to a different hirer driving Crown.</p>
              <p>Basically I would need to either drive 30 to 45mins extra each day, or come out a little bit earlier and/or find another short distance CBD peak period fare to make up the extra rental.</p>
              <p>That is the worse case scenario, if really good, you can get more booking/transfer (new cab sure to be pushed for more jobs) or find good pax or regular to take me more often. No need to sweep and go slog extra hours.</p>
              <p>So not impossible - all a question of strategy, experience and of course, luck. No need to work hard but must be smart.</p>
              <p>But for me, very idle, only wanna drive from 6.30 to 1am every weekday, sometimes even shorter, therefore the new merc maybe not so good idea. But if I on the ball like I started many years before, then sure can cari makan and I'll deffo give this a try. Worse case cannot, throw key lor.</p>

              <p>Oh 159, perhap I alway love to give people a lower image of rent and myself...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>As the chinese saying, when the ship reached the wharf, somehow it would automatically align and straighten herself along the bank.</p>
              <p>We might said, wow! so high rental, but there will still be people taking it, find reliefs and drive on, and life goes back to the normal again taking 159 as the benchmark, then again, after half decade gone, most cabs would had gone up in rental with newer sonata or kia or cheverolet, and then a newer merc will come into the picture with a 180 rental per day.</p>
              <p>The strategy adopted by taxis company to increase rental is therefore a clear cut one, newer taxis, higher rental. That in turn, renew the TD to plough the road longer, work more smarter if not harder for them on a pretext of I am driving a new merc, knn, where on earth as a sex 2 general Woker, can I think of driving a new merc.</p>
              <p>And as bro JR put it, drive first, worry later is also good, cannot, then throw back lor, at least you touch and feel it and gain some experiences from it.</p>
