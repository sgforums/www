              <p>Remember only she felt unwell tha she decided to take taxi home.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">ON NOV 20, a Sunday, I felt unwell while at Orchard Road and decided to take a taxi home. I tried booking a cab via the ComfortDelGro iPhone application many times but there were no taxis available for booking.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;"> </p>

I then joined the long queue at Orchard Cineleisure where the taxis that drove up were mostly 'on call'.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">I noticed that the drivers of some cabs that came in had decided to call it a day and did not pick up another fare while others specified their destinations. Finally, 11/2 hours later, I got into a cab.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">When I told the driver about the hard time I had waiting for a cab, he said there were fewer taxis on the road because it was a Sunday and there were no peak-hour charges. Furthermore, he said, as it had rained earlier, cabbies chose not to drive.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">Unlike MRT trains or buses which run on schedule, rain or shine, taxi drivers work at their own time. So, adding more taxis on the road will not, in itself, meet demand.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">Taxi companies should address the issue of shortage when there are no peak-hour surcharges and when the weather turns bad. They should instil a certain degree of responsibility in the cabbies.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;"> </p>

              Think hard, taxi fares structured to benifit tourist. 
              
              Hk? Haha same la u go as tourist got cab pick one. Asked the local there, some places no cab must call and bid higher price to get a cab. 
              
              Some thoughts, take away surcharge some may give up driving means lagi longer wait for taxi
              
              no midnight charge gyahaha, as good as asking everyone to take night rider Liao. If there is a demand of people you think mrt won't operate?
              
              Increase taxi fares is the way

              <p>Up the cab fare. Its the best way. Just change $0.20 to $0.30 increment. Its all we need. Its all I want to say.</p>

              coincident or what? 
              
              2007, i had seen various complaints on straits times forum regarding taxi issues , suvey on waiting time at taka , report card on waiting time at various zones . and in the end . price overhaul at december 2007 . 
              
              Then for a long time . nothing happens . no complaint etc . . 
              
              now sekali so many complaints . then what next ? 
              
              my feeling could be the same like what u thinking now . yes price adjustments.

              <p>Allow me to address a few points on this issue and also, what the future lies for TDs after the 2007 restructuring of fares.</p>

And this does not include the employer's CPF contribution, high Medical insurances, annual leaves, few month bonuses, MCs and all other perks in employment which can total up to $4 to 5k.</p>
              <p>So, if taxis driver are earning below that amount, you are consider under lower wage income group. And by this Decemeber, the median income will rise further.</p>
              <p>Secondly, taxis driver must harder to get above the median wage, and most are getting older by the years, it is not easy to drive, physically, can be stressful, it is not a 8 hrs job with 2 hours rest in between, if you do that, you surely fall far far below that median wage structure. For that kind of fares as of now, you do not attract people to be TD</p>
              <p>And thirdly, with an influential workforce, meaning a educated workforce, most youngs will not even think of TDs, and that further reduce the TD strength, as TD get older, they have to rest more, enjoy life more and relax more often. Remember TD are overnite businessman from an unemploy condition. And as businessman, it is all up to individual on the way they do business.</p>
              <p>That gives us a picture of a diminishing TD in near future, so unless the fares is to rise everyyear to match the median wages, the cost of living for TD is going to suffer, from high inflation to rentals and fuel, and that would reduce new intake and more throw keys, therefore the authority, have to look into it seriously, unless they got other plan, which is recruit foreigners, PRC or Indians to be TD here, then, that will be the end of TD for singaporeans. <br></p>
