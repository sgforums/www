              a quick witted wife.<br>
              <br>
              19 jan 11 wed 2320h, after pumping diesel at sin ming, i drove my
              taxi, and saw a man flagging my taxi along sin ming ave(near the
              prawn fishing). Further up ahead was an yellow top taxi, another
              guy was trying to help his friend into the taxi, but it seems that
              the taxi driver did not want to take them. The guy who flagged my
              taxi opened my door but did not get in. He waited for the guy that
              was helping a drunk guy and they are coming towards my taxi. They
              settled down the drunk man into my taxi. I was not happy that the
              guy who actually flagged the taxi is not the one taking the taxi. I
              was given a drunk man instead.</p>
              <div class="">I was expecting one of those sober guy to have gotten
              into the taxi as well, but they did not.....After they settled down
              the drunk man, who is semi conscious say 340b Sembawang close, he
              collapsed at the back seat sleeping....I dont like the feeling
              having a time bomb, i was feeling uneasy the entire trip, and i
              wouldn't know if he is going to vomit anytime. And if he had slept
              too soundly, I would have to go to the police station
              again....Finally I reached the destination, the fare is $10
              exactly. I tapped him to wake him up, and to my surprise he woke
              up....he paid $10 and asked for the receipt.<br>
              When i was about to pass him the receipt, he asked how much and
              wanted to pay again, in his hands are several pieces of $10 notes.
              I did not accept that and told him he had already paid.<br>
              <br>
              After that i drove off and along sembawang road, got a lady pax
              flagged my taxi. She is going to Joo Chiat. After she got into my
              taxi, she saw a iphone and passed to me.<br>
              At the same time, the phone is ringing and I had already started
              driving, so i stopped by the side.....the tone goes off, then it
              rang again....I tried to answer the phone, but there isnt any
              button to press to answer.<br>
              There is a *Slide to answer*, but i cant seem to get it
              right.....Sad to say.....I do not how to answer an IPHONE... 
              , I asked the lady pax to help, and she answered the phone
              effortlessly.<br>
              I continued driving as the lady is in an hurry. On the other side,
              it seems that the iphone owner wanted me to return the iphone to
              him immediately. The lady told them she is in a hurry and she would
              have to<br>
              go to joo chiat first. It seems that they cannot get to an
              agreement, and my lady pax put the phone to speaker mode, and the
              pax say he would give me $50 to return him the iphone. I explained
              to him that I have a pax onboard and have to go joo chiat before i
              can come back. At this moment,my phone rang and it is the control
              center. Operator asked if i had found an iphone, i said yes.
              Operator ask me return to pax, i said i have a pax right now going
              to joo chiat, and then after that i can return the iphone. I can
              feel the operator have been pressured and she wanted me to call
              back the wife.<br>
              <br>
              I was driving and at the same time, operator asked me to call the
              wife, I even have difficulty taking down the hp no., all thanks to
              the lady pax, she helped me take down the no. when i repeated
              it.<br>
              But it seem pointless to have taken down the hp no., after the
              operator hang up, I tried to call the no. given, but it was busy.
              And i had an incoming call, it was the wife calling.<br>
              Looks like the operator had told her my hp no. after much
              pressure!!!!  The wife wanted to know wat time i can return
              the phone, and i replied 0030h.<br>
              <br>
              I was supposed to meet some members for dinner around 0030h, but i
              told them i would be there after i returned the iphone.<br>
              After dropping the lady pax at joo chiat. I start the meter and
              headed towards sembawang close 340b.<br>
              Upon reaching, i saw the drunk man who look very sober now, and at
              a distance behind, a lady which i supposed is his wife.<br>
              The fare is $29.10, and he came up to my taxi and handed me
              $20......I said the meter fare is $29.10 and you only gave me $20,
              it is not even enough to cover the fare.....<br>
              Anyway i passed him the iphone.....he assured me he would pay me
              another $20 the next day, so he asked me to key in my bank account
              to his hp no. and i did.<br>
              I do not understand how the initial $50 had become $20......but
              only after i prompted, it become a promise to transfer another $20
              into my account.<br>
              Anyway, i returned the iphone, my part is done......</div>
              <div class=""> </div>
              <div class="">Up till now, I had not received any money....It is a
