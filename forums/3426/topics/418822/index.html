              <p> <a href="http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001_"></a> Let me share agin some stories .</p>
              <p>A few years back .</p>
              <p>At the old bugis Junction t/s , picked a fat young lady to Tampines St 22 .</p>
              <p>Reach there about $28 ?</p>
              <p>Think so ..... credit card , okay credit card .</p>
              <p>Swipe ? Failed , declined .</p>
              <p>So she decided to go up take money .</p>
              <p>" Can i have my credit card back ? " She asked .</p>
              <p>I said : "  <a href="http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001_"><img src="http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/4/4_2_109v.gif" border="0" alt="No No No"></a> , bring down the money , i give you back the card ."</p>
              <p>She went up ....</p>
              <p>20 minutes i waited .</p>
              <p>I called Citibank up .... from the card i saw the number , i explain to Citibank to call the pax down to pay money , as i am waiting here ,"</p>
              <p>She came down after i called Citibank , Citibank also aware she swipe card and declined .</p>
              <p>Still no money .....</p>
              <p>From her body language , i can sense she has the intention to run away , forgo the card .</p>
              <p>But she got the wrong person , who would think i would call Citibank up ?</p>
              <p>Because i am holding her card , and had called Citbank , she cannot claim to lost the card .</p>
              <p>She lan lan have to call her good friend to pay me from another part of Tampines .</p>
              <p>Want to run away from me ?</p>
              <p>I am not going to make your life easy ....</p>

              <p>Alot of taxi drivers got runaway fare, some just let it go, some cannot take it, and quit driving taxi. Most would just let them go and forget about the matter, thinking that it is their unlucky day. I do not like this. This is getting out of control, we have those fines up to $1000 for not paying taxi fare.....so what?</p>
              <p>Pax still run away fare....even if they got fine....the money dont goes into our pocket, and the incident is affecting our mood very badly, and lost focus on the road.</p>
              <p>If everyone let go those pax that dont pay.....it is going to happen more and more often, so it will be your turn to get such lousy pax. If you know beforehand, how to handle the situation, you can make our taxi world a better place!</p>

              <p> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001_"></a> Let me share agin some stories .</p>
              <p>A few years back .</p>
              <p>At the old bugis Junction t/s , picked a fat young lady to Tampines St 22 .</p>
              <p>Reach there about $28 ?</p>
              <p>Think so ..... credit card , okay credit card .</p>
              <p>Swipe ? Failed , declined .</p>
              <p>So she decided to go up take money .</p>
              <p>" Can i have my credit card back ? " She asked .</p>
              <p>I said : "  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001_"><img src="http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/4/4_2_109v.gif" alt="No No No"></a> , bring down the money , i give you back the card ."</p>
              <p>She went up ....</p>
              <p>20 minutes i waited .</p>
              <p>I called Citibank up .... from the card i saw the number , i explain to Citibank to call the pax down to pay money , as i am waiting here ,"</p>
              <p>She came down after i called Citibank , Citibank also aware she swipe card and declined .</p>
              <p>Still no money .....</p>
              <p>From her body language , i can sense she has the intention to run away , forgo the card .</p>
              <p>But she got the wrong person , who would think i would call Citibank up ?</p>
              <p>Because i am holding her card , and had called Citbank , she cannot claim to lost the card .</p>
              <p>She lan lan have to call her good friend to pay me from another part of Tampines .</p>
              <p>Want to run away from me ?</p>
              <p>I am not going to make your life easy ....</p>
              <p>I'll bite and suck you like a leech .<br><br><br><br><br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.smileycentral.com/dl/index.jhtml?partner=ZSzeb097_&amp;amp;utm_id=7925"><img src="http://www.smileycentral.com/sig.jsp?pc=ZSzeb097&amp;amp;pp=" alt=""></a></p>
