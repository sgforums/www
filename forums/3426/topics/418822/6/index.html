              <p>Some card issues , some network issues .</p>
              <p>Some driver's issue .</p>
              <p>If some insist on card payment like at supermarket , good for them .</p>
              <p>Cash is still King .</p>
              <p>A scenario , at CCK ave 4 .</p>
              <p>11am , street full of people waiting for taxis . Infront , behind , opposite , all directions .</p>
              <p>One waited for 15 minutes , still no cab , call also no  cab . This pax always used nets .</p>
              <p>In a hurry liao , siao liao .</p>
              <p>Sekali from one car park , got a private yellow top just start work .... come out of the car park . That waiting person is the nearest .</p>
              <p>U tell me , will this waiting pax take this yellow top ?</p>
              <p>But this yellow top no nets liao .....</p>
              <p>What will you do if you are that waiting pax ?</p>
              <p>Still insist on Nets ?</p>
              <p>Huh , this time very flexible , right ? Can go nearest ATM press money , right ?</p>
              <p>Still need to take cash , right ?</p>
              <p>Cash is still King , right ?</p>
              <p>So what's the problem with carry about $20 cash with you all the time to take taxi ? Even if u do not take taxis , take extra $20 will kill you ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Die die use NETS people , are because their bank account only left with $19 . Minimum withdrawal is $20 , so cannot withdraw , but can use NETS .</p>
              <p>So talk so much , pax insufficient funds in the account , go ATM also no use , once network down , they siao liao .</p>
              <p>No tricks , just realistically they got no money in the bank . Cannot withdraw even $20 .</p>

              <p><br>We are going through more and more cashless, if you ask me, i rather take cash, system fault and transaction delay could make us lost our next potential pax in tight times.</p>
              <p>With several different cashless transaction that taxi can accept now, it creates more confusion what cashless payment taxi can accept.....yesterday i just had a pax who wanted to pay by CASHCARD...lol</p>
              <p>Eg. To be fair, a good pax would usually ask, can you accept EZlink card? (If they have run out of cash).</p>

              <p>Precisely... Got once I send a pax from Katong to Pasir Laba Camp.  Along the way, he already indicated that he will be paying by Nets.  (Sidenote: I actually prefer cashless payment mode.)  But, the horror begins when we reach his camp and after trying for close to 15 times (no exaggeration), keep getting Timeout Error.  Really sweat man. Think the fare is close to $30 and according to him, the nearest ATM also quite far as there is no ATM in his camp.  (I thought all camps used to have a POSB ATM near the guardroom??)</p>
              <p>Luckily, after messing for about 30 minutes, he saw one of his bunkmate and manage to borrow cash from him to pay.</p>
              <p>It's ok if you want to stick to NETS payment, but to prevent such incident, it's always wise to keep some cash with you lor.</p>

              I always give benefit of doubt 1 cause sometimes i ask if they
              
              hav another card try still cannot i will try at least few more times.
              
              So far all my cases all can after a few trys so i tink is network prob.

              <p>Hi All!</p>
              <p>I am a newbie in this thread as I wanted to find more info about being a TD.</p>
              <p>After browsing this thread, I finds that there might be some misunderstanding going on.</p>
              <p>My 2 cents is that any forum is for sharing of information and experiences, no need to be hostile to each others, constructive feedbacks are welcome!</p>
              <p>Mr Zweiz, from the following post by Mr allulu69, he is referring to the army guy not a reply to your post about nets/visa failed. Well, unless you are that army guy, there's no need to be agitated.</p>
              <p>As for technical failure, nobody wants that, it will means inconvenience to everyone and to make TD to wait for pax to go ATM withdraw it is $$ lost to them as time=$$.</p>
              <p>Sometimes to comprise and move on, it will make ourselves more happy then to keep dwelling on something.</p>
              <p>Please correct me if I'm wrong, in a nice way that is.</p>
              <p>Happy sharing!<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Drunk man lucky encounter to meet an kind driver, an honest pax, a quick witted wife.<br><br>19 jan 11 wed 2320h, after pumping diesel at sin ming, i drove my taxi, and saw a man flagging my taxi along sin ming ave(near the prawn fishing). Further up ahead was an yellow top taxi, another guy was trying to help his friend into the taxi, but it seems that the taxi driver did not want to take them. The guy who flagged my taxi opened my door but did not get in. He waited for the guy that was helping a drunk guy and they are coming towards my taxi. They settled down the drunk man into my taxi. I was not happy that the guy who actually flagged the taxi is not the one taking the taxi. I was given a drunk man instead.</p>
              <div class="content">I was expecting one of those sober guy to have gotten into the taxi as well, but they did not.....After they settled down the drunk man, who is semi conscious say 340b Sembawang close, he collapsed at the back seat sleeping....I dont like the feeling having a time bomb, i was feeling uneasy the entire trip, and i wouldn't know if he is going to vomit anytime. And if he had slept too soundly, I would have to go to the police station again....Finally I reached the destination, the fare is $10 exactly. I tapped him to wake him up, and to my surprise he woke up....he paid $10 and asked for the receipt.<br>When i was about to pass him the receipt, he asked how much and wanted to pay again, in his hands are several pieces of $10 notes. I did not accept that and told him he had already paid.<br><br>After that i drove off and along sembawang road, got a lady pax flagged my taxi. She is going to Joo Chiat. After she got into my taxi, she saw a iphone and passed to me.<br>At the same time, the phone is ringing and I had already started driving, so i stopped by the side.....the tone goes off, then it rang again....I tried to answer the phone, but there isnt any button to press to answer.<br>There is a *Slide to answer*, but i cant seem to get it right.....Sad to say.....I do not how to answer an IPHONE...  , I asked the lady pax to help, and she answered the phone effortlessly.<br>I continued driving as the lady is in an hurry. On the other side, it seems that the iphone owner wanted me to return the iphone to him immediately. The lady told them she is in a hurry and she would have to <br>go to joo chiat first. It seems that they cannot get to an agreement, and my lady pax put the phone to speaker mode, and the pax say he would give me $50 to return him the iphone. I explained to him that I have a pax onboard and have to go joo chiat before i can come back. At this moment,my phone rang and it is the control center. Operator asked if i had found an iphone, i said yes. Operator ask me return to pax, i said i have a pax right now going to joo chiat, and then after that i can return the iphone. I can feel the operator have been pressured and she wanted me to call back the wife. <br><br>I was driving and at the same time, operator asked me to call the wife, I even have difficulty taking down the hp no., all thanks to the lady pax, she helped me take down the no. when i repeated it.<br>But it seem pointless to have taken down the hp no., after the operator hang up, I tried to call the no. given, but it was busy. And i had an incoming call, it was the wife calling.<br>Looks like the operator had told her my hp no. after much pressure!!!!  The wife wanted to know wat time i can return the phone, and i replied 0030h.<br><br>I was supposed to meet some members for dinner around 0030h, but i told them i would be there after i returned the iphone.<br>After dropping the lady pax at joo chiat. I start the meter and headed towards sembawang close 340b.<br>Upon reaching, i saw the drunk man who look very sober now, and at a distance behind, a lady which i supposed is his wife.<br>The fare is $29.10, and he came up to my taxi and handed me $20......I said the meter fare is $29.10 and you only gave me $20, it is not even enough to cover the fare.....<br>Anyway i passed him the iphone.....he assured me he would pay me another $20 the next day, so he asked me to key in my bank account to his hp no. and i did.<br>I do not understand how the initial $50 had become $20......but only after i prompted, it become a promise to transfer another $20 into my account.<br>Anyway, i returned the iphone, my part is done......</div>
