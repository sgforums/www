              Thanks for your input, but you care to elaborate and share.
              Are our Sinkie driversn all so anti TDs ?

              Thanks for dropping by.
              I am quite familiar with the general direction of places.
              We can always ask the passengers for directions when nearer their 
              destinations, right ?
              When I ride in a cab, I will always tell them which way I want to go by 
              when I first board.

              Thanks, I plan and will do that.

              I am sure many of us would prefer to have a normal job 9-5 job with good salary, full CPF, medical etc etc.
              Sometimes its circumstances beyond our control that leads one to make certain decisions.
              Right or wrong, we have to make the best of and live with it. 
              I understand that it's not going to be an easy job but I am no U grad or even a Poly grad and passed 55 already so getting a regular 3-4 K job will not be easy.

              I am always reasonable and considerate, talk about the problem, not the person.

              YOU TALKING TO ME ??? ( remember this quote by Robert de Niro from the show ? )
              
              I am still looking at my options, nothing is decided yet, have not even gone for my nedical yet.

              i saw a few old white haired old lady driving SMART green colored taxi,they really motivated me!i mean how many old white hair old lady driving taxi?most will be contend to work in coffee shops collecting plates and pans!me a man who is 50 plus and able body can't drive a nissan taxi?shame on me!
              
              YOU TALKING TO ME ??? YES YOU, YOU TALKING TO ME ???? 
              
              Yes I have seen and in fact talk one driven by a "not so white haired" lady recently.
              Which also motivates me to give this TD thing a shot. It may or may not work out for me 
              but I won't know until I gave it a good shot.
              To do a Manual or a Auto cab is a choice anyone can make, rite ?
              
              
              Thanks and appreciate all those who have contributed here and safe drive all.

              Hi alpacino,
              
              This is my first post and I am a newbie taxi uncle.
              I shared the same working life problems as u except that I am 5 yrs older than you.
              
              Some of the advices here are worth considering, like being a relief first and then work yourself up from there.
              
              When I first registered for a cab, my plan was to go OMO, after going through posts here, I got myself a relief driver and is thankful for the advice I received here and the decision I have made.
              
              After about 10 days of manning a cab, let me tell you it is really tough driving a 12-hour shift for guys our age. 
              For your info, prior to this, I have been driving for the past 40yrs averaging 45 to 50k km per year. Casual driving is very different from driving a cab. Casual driving counts for nothing in driving a cab. Casual driving is more forgiving.
              
              I am also a route idiot. 
              I bought myself a search friendly GPS. Paxs now are different, before you could reach for your GPS, they already have the route plotted out in their mobile phones - meaning they are very receptive to this mode of routing.
              
              Another advice from the forum worth taking note of is, asking pax for directions.
              Do it. they will directed you willingly.
              
              Alot that are written here by old birds come from their many years of driving experiences.
              Seperate the woods from the trees and go for it and adjust as you get along.
              
              What is my take for my mere 10 days of cab driving?
              I am doing fine. No the 7k of earnings as reported, but enough for the 3 daily meals and some. 
              
              For a newbie hirer with a relief like me, it is nice knowing that half your rental is already in the pocket when you start out each morning.
              
              PM me, perhaps we can sit down for a chit chats between two TD wannabes.

              <p>Hello again all bros,</p>
              <p>i took the TDVL test last Friday and luckily passed at the first attempt.</p>
              <p>Must say the test is quite tough, a lot of my course mates didn't mmake it </p>
              <p>the first time, especially those who are not so good in English.</p>
              <p>Collecting my VL tmr but in the meantime have been down to some of the</p>
              <p>taxi operators to check on rentals and incentives etc etc.</p>
              <p>Went to Comfort to register as relief but was told need to get VL first before </p>
              <p>I can register but collected the Hirer looking for Relief list anyway.</p>
              <p>Found two suitable hirers ( correct timing and I can get to him by MRT or walk )</p>
              <p>but they have already found their reliefs.</p>
              <p>Besides the channel above, any other way to find a hirer to partner ?</p>
              <p>Maybe someone here looking for relief who have not posted in the sticky ?</p>
              <p>Appreciate any help, thanks.</p>

              <p>Very good analysis.</p>
              <p>I stick with CDG because those days only CDG is king, only got green cab, yellow top and citycab just start - all the si gina go there.</p>
              <p>Those days MDT just start, but bowah one, always kena hijack, but those days CDG is like Silver or TC now. Nobody care about you, complain also tak jalan.</p>
              <p>So when I restarted, naturally I go back to CDG, altho CDG now and then is totally different. But maybe if I knew the situation on the ground I might not have gone back.</p>
              <p>That said, CDG as screwed up as they are still got some virtues especially if you're the hardworking type - anyhow sweep or a hirer. Gots calls, got better repair facilities. If you are the obedient type and cincai type just look at the bottom dollar than CDG not bad for you.</p>
              <p>But if you like me, then perhaps not a good choice, that said even CDG can find hirer or relief easier. If you get good hirer or relief, you will think might as well stay on. If kena red card, then red card lor. It's not about the company it's about the individual.</p>

              <p>Currently i driving a Skoda , this machine in terms of Comfort , they are ahead of all including Wish 2.0 .</p>
              <p>Why Wish 2.0 is good to drive ? Cos it is smooth and quieter engine  .</p>
              <p>Downside of Skoda , smooth but engine like lorry ( due to diesel powered ) .</p>
              <p>Of course their noise reduction sealing very well done . Typical continental design .</p>
