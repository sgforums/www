              <p>I pity the taxii driver and the passengers. If I am the taxi driver I will stop the taxi and talk to the passengers to clam the kids, if cannot clam the kids ask the passengers to take another taxi nicely. no money will be taken. but i think comf..k sacking is too much for the taxi driver. maybe the driver should bring a few kids to the HQ and make alot of noise in front of the f..k manager.</p>

              <p>Now you know why I rank pax with small children very low on my list of potential pax.</p>
              <p>With babies, I might consider, but small children - no thanks.</p>
              <p>Anyway there 2 sides to this story, if one were to take a neutral stand.</p>
              <p>a) The driver may have been extremely aggressive and did certain things like use vulgarity also. And CDG (I'm not defending them) normally hv a policy of issuing a warning for a first offense of quarelling with pax. Maybe this cabby already had a previous warning in the 12 month period and this was the 2nd one.</p>
              <p>b) or CDG as usual when got a lot of TDs on the waiting list with not enough of cabs, act very yaya. Incidents like these give them the opportunity to replace drivers they feel are not in tune with their policies. So they just kick him.</p>
              <p>The driver should just forget abt CDG and find another company, many fish in the sea, don't drive for CDG not the end of the world, worse case go Beach Rd, sure got taxi to drive.</p>
              <p>No point going to office, they would hv covered their arse by stipulating in the terms and conditions they have the right to terminate over issues like this.</p>

              <p>The global economy is now at a time bomb setting period, meaning by next years, something would happen in europe, and even USA, and also, as you read the news, Singapore is technically at recession, technically meaning a double dips on 2 quarter reports continiously. If by end of this year, the index is still dipping, then we are in recession, meaning a break in economy process.</p>
              <p>Silently, few companies, especially the manufacturing one that contribute about 20 over percent of our GDP is retrenching or making locals staffs resign themselves thru pressuring tactics.</p>
              <p>So, you will tends to see a strong Q for cabs, and you will also see a reduction in spending by people, which will affect our earning no only in lesser pax, but also in more taxis on the road.</p>
              <p>Given such conditions and future perspectives, it is advisable to remain where you are, work and earn within your limitation, and save for the raining days ahead. It is not that you cannot spend, but spend wisely.</p>

              <p>I pity the taxii driver and the passengers. If I am the taxi driver I will stop the taxi and talk to the passengers to clam the kids, if cannot clam the kids ask the passengers to take another taxi nicely. no money will be taken. but i think comf..k sacking is too much for the taxi driver. maybe the driver should bring a few kids to the HQ and make alot of noise in front of the f..k manager.</p>

              <p><br>Day in day out, most TD are stress out, some drive until forget about their father name. But all is for the sake of earning a living and also for the betterment of our family spending power so as to put better foods on the table.</p>
              <p>There tends to be mood in everybody and TD are human, we are not exceptional, however most paxs took us as part of the vehicle, a robot that work for some companies, and thereby, as part of the vehicle, a non living thing should have no emotion nor any mood. And that is entirely wrong.</p>
              <p>For the above case, the driver could be having a moody days, i mean we all have our moody day, with family, with mistress, with gf, with OBK days, with companies, with friends and so on. So gum gum he picked one that blow off his temper that goes out of control.</p>
              <p>But I believe if he had apologised to the paxs or to cdg managements, thing could be different, I believe that he must be banging and shouting at cdg management and that end the contract. Another case of iron teeth.</p>
              <p>To me, there is no sacking, but a termination of contract, he could had said, I sacked CDG</p>
