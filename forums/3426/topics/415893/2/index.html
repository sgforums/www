              <p><br>Aiyo, yan dao, people 18yo already use knife to kill other liao. Mai lah, at the end of the day, everyone is earning a living mah. 35yo should learn to be more gentle liao.</p>
              <p>Not only taxi trade is like this, in my permanent job, we also face many kinds and types of dirty colleagues who backstab each other, and even Q for food also want to jump Q, this is not new, its happen all over the world. There are certain unprofessional drivers out there who only think for themselves and careless abt other drivers. And when one reject a pax, the others, like monkey see, monkey do, they also follow. Then there are also TDs here and there booasting about the way they rejected pax with nets, or those lousy trips and feel proud about it, this will also make the younger driver to do the same, so end up, in ten years time, still the same thing will happen.</p>
              <p>And this is something that you alone cannot solve it, it is matter of culture and mindset, which very hard to change unless something big changed, like change of govt or laws. There is line in our life which is called, Live with it, if not, move out. Even if you can Fxxk one guy and get him to acknowledge his bad habit, there are many out there, so are you going to get angry at all the stands??? You just dun follow them, do job as you are suppose to do, take in the good habit other practice and throw away those bad ones, and slowly, you will become a good TD for other to follow.</p>
