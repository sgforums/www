              <p>Engine still ok. It's the gearbox. Diesel engine have higher

              Turbo with single or dual exhaust has got no bearings to engine overheating. Dual exhaust imho is for esthetics not performance enhancement for many makes. It is the diameter of the pipe that matters, having dual pipes or an overly large exhaust may cause high back pressure that has a negative effect on engine efficiency resulting in decrease of power output that must be compensated by increasing fuel consumption. 
              
              I'm pretty sure the designers have made calculations to have an optimal exhaust diameter. Anyway, i believe sonata is using light pressure turbo optimize for city driving. Sports make like WRX on the other hand needs a large bore exhaust as it has a T-Rex turbo charger :)
              
              The answer lies in components used in sonata, not the design that cause fire hazards.

              <p>Sidetrack a bit.</p>
              <p>I don't know why cars in Singapore and most car shops sell and recommend "coolant"</p>
              <p>Most of the "coolant" sold actually contains glycol aka anti-freeze. Anti-freeze (Ethylene glycol) is  useless in Singapore, we don't have freezing temp so we don't need anti-freeze.</p>
              <p>Ethylene glycol actually has a specific heat capacity about one half that of water. Meaning is absorb 50% less heat. Only advantage of Glycol is it increase the boiling point.</p>
              <p>That is why u see racing cars usually use just plain water, distilled water best cos no impurities. But racing cars overhaul engine after every race. Using tap water ok, but contains chlorine and other stuff which might, in the long term, damage cooling system.</p>
              <p>For using just water in your car/taxi in long term also not good as it would cause corrosion on the cooling parts.</p>
              <p>From experience, all the previous vehicle i own, even my old water cool gaming computer i, never use "coolant" that contains glycol. In gaming PC espcially i can see using Glycol base coolant slowly clog up the cooling system.</p>
              <p>After my Wish radiator hose leak and send to workshop, they flush the radiator and mechanic just add plain water! I was happy!!!</p>
              <p>Went and buy RedLine WaterWetter added to my radiator.</p>
              <p>I recommend, RedLine WaterWetter or Purple Ice, both to add with plain water for automotive cooling system. Both are wetting agent and corrosion inhibitor with no glycol. </p>
              <p>Purple Ice: <a href="http://royalpurpleconsumer.com/products/purple-ice-radiator-coolant-additive/">http://royalpurpleconsumer.com/products/purple-ice-radiator-coolant-additive/</a></p>

              <p>Both also available already premix with distilled water:</p>
              <p>SuperCool with WaterWetter: <a href="http://www.redlineoil.com/product.aspx?pid=117&amp;pcid=10">http://www.redlineoil.com/product.aspx?pid=117&amp;pcid=10</a></p>
              <p>I can't find any link for Purple Ice premix, but i know they have it at Autobac.</p>
              <p>WaterWetter $16+, SuperCool $38 i think, Purple Ice Premix $32 i think</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> SINGAPORE - <strong>After extensive investigations by engineers, taxi
              operator ComfortDelGro has found the likely cause of the recent
              fires involving its taxis, including two Hyundai Sonatas which
              caught fire three weeks apart.</strong></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"></span> <br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> In response to TODAY's queries, the land transport giant, which
              dominates the taxi industry with about 60 per cent of the
              approximately 28,000 taxis here, said engineers from the vehicle
              manufacturer were "flown in to carry out thorough
              investigations".</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> "They narrowed down the likely cause to electrical
              short-circuitry," said ComfortDelGro Group Corporate Communications
              Officer Tammy Tan. </span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> Additional fleet-wide safety checks were carried out upon
              recommendation and the taxi operator has "continued with stringent
              maintenance checks" to minimise such incidents, added Ms
              Tan.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> Hyundai has been providing the taxi operator with the 2.0
              turbodiesel engine Sonatas - used exclusively here by ComfortDelGro
              - since 2006. </span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> And in the wake of a spate of taxis catching fire on the roads
              earlier this year, ComfortDelGro said South Korea's biggest
              carmaker sent specialists to assist with
              investigations.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> Last week, Member of Parliament (Ang Mo Kio) Ang Hin Kee filed a
              parliamentary question to get an update on the number of taxi fires
              and whether the cause had been established.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> In his written reply, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew disclosed
              that 26 cases were reported to the Singapore Civil Defence Force
              between January last year and Sept 21 this year.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> While one case was due to sparks from a road accident, electrical
              short-circuiting was the likely cause in four cases, and 21 of the
              cases were probably due to engine overheating.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> Mr Ang also asked about the measures put in place to ensure the
              safety of drivers and passengers.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> Mr Lui noted that taxis operators conduct "regular preventive and
              corrective maintenance" of their fleet "to keep them in roadworthy
              condition at all times", and the Land Transport Authority subjects
              all taxis to compulsory inspections every six
              months.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> When contacted, an LTA spokesperson said that during the
              inspections, "automated equipment tests are carried out on the
              vehicles' systems and major components for brake efficiency, wheel
              alignment, headlamps, exhaust gas and noise
              emissions".</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> She said: "Visual inspections on the conditions of vehicle body,
              lightings, steering mechanism, tyres, undercarriage and exhaust
              system are also conducted." </span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> Brand new taxis are also inspected to ensure compliance with the
              LTA's technical requirements, before they are registered for road
              use, she added.</span><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> <span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> According to the SCDF, there were 87 vehicle fires from January to
              June, compared to 100 vehicle fires for the same period last
              year.</span></p>

              <p>Good News. But comfort outsources maintenance to third party workshops. Does comfort really check on the maintenance standard of its workshops? If it did, none of its vehicles would be on fire.</p>
              <p>Anyway they narrowed down the cause to Electrical short circuitary. Whose faulty is it? Manufacturer's defect or poor maintenance?</p>
              <p>Taxi Vehicle is the money making machine for taxi drivers. Best taxi driver in singapore earns 7k. Already reported in the papers. What is not reported is what Taxi Companies earn and how much they spend for maintenance.</p>

              <p><br>Turbo with single or dual exhaust has got no bearings to engine overheating. Dual exhaust imho is for esthetics not performance enhancement for many makes. It is the diameter of the pipe that matters, having dual pipes or an overly large exhaust may cause high back pressure that has a negative effect on engine efficiency resulting in decrease of power output that must be compensated by increasing fuel consumption. I'm pretty sure the designers have made calculations to have an optimal exhaust diameter. Anyway, i believe sonata is using light pressure turbo optimize for city driving. Sports make like WRX on the other hand needs a large bore exhaust as it has a T-Rex turbo charger :) The answer lies in components used in sonata, not the design that cause fire hazards.</p>

              Ermmmmmm.... I think that Komoco guy is an engine near not an engineer n doing Hyundai a disservice by saying that. Ask him to explain Hyundai sonata CRDi sold in Australia n NZ since 2008? Mind you, these are huge market we are talking abt. Will Hyundai juz any o how redesign n move it to these mkts haphazardly? I sincerely believe it is built quality and maintenance which is the issue here, not design. Koreans are doing a great job designing stuffs from electronics to cars, my only gripe is built quality usually.

              <p>Australia and NZ use alot of diesel operating vehicle, for them, with their kind of temperature, no problem for their cooling system, in fact they have to heat up the vehicle with heater during winter or cold weather, as for tropical car, the design is different, the cooling bore and space must be bigger, now you know why toyota, honda and nissan assemble in thailand, so that they can test run on a hot weather, but sonata is make in korea,</p>
              <p>And when they arrive into singapore, the engineer have to replace the cooling bore bigger in diameter, increase the timimg and flow.</p>
              <p>In country like singapore, flashing of cooling system once a while is a must, otherwise once heated up, your vehicle will not be the same again, why? because at high temperature, many parts goes out of alignment/expanded/melted and many other irregularities. So, even if you are able to address and fix or renew the burnt parts, many other parts already affected, leading to less hp, more intake of fuel to move and noises.</p>
              <p>It just like a body, if you do not take care, drink water, get very sick, go into operation, you are not the same anymore.</p>

              <p>They like to copies german make car than alter a bit here and there, it engine is robust, but it cooling system need to improve with more cooling channel within the engine, it electrical system I should said, lost to the jap, their light bulbs like to blow off easily, this show an erractic current surge at times, and when electrical current is not stable, thing burnt.</p>

              <p>Turbo charger , exhaust pipes bla bla bla too will not cause
                  fire.</p>
              <p>It's all due to "Cheap Replacement Parts"!!!!</p>

              <p>I also last time think engine overheating won't cause fire. So far for petrol engine, i think it overheat most likely piston sieze first then before any fire can start.</p>
              <p>Then i read somewhere regarding diesel engine fire, diesel engine slightly different. Engine still can remain running even when radiator dry.</p>
              <p>It will in turn overheat the engine oil, which then would spew out of the engine oil dip stick and even the engine oil pour hole. That is the part that cause the fire.</p>
              <p>I read it from some fire investigation report.</p>
              <p>Diesel fuel on its own very difficult to burn, i try before during army time. Soak at rag with diesel, put lighter, super long then burn. Burn when burn liao burn long time.</p>
              <p>That is why diesel engine high compression and use glow plug instead or sprak plug. The compression part cause the combustion actually.</p>
              <p>Video of diesel engine, i cut short to important part (2min 28sec onwards):</p>
