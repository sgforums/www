              <p>My meter hit $109 when I was driving the Crown back then. It was a Russian who took my cab &amp; he was going around looking for car spare parts to ship back to Russia.</p>
              <p>Another time was about $45 from Changi Village to Tuas. The German asked if I can wait for about 45 mins &amp; drive him back to Changi Village. I thought why not. But it's not fun for this kind of long trip. Very tiring &amp; exhausting &amp; it's about 70 mins drive.</p>
              <p>I told the German that it was the longest trip so far I have driven for any of my paxs.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>In the few times I take taxis nowadays, I have never met taxi drivers I seen on this forum. They are usually friendly, humble and are sincerely interested to make a living, a honest living. Some of the people on this forum, maybe they are just talking big, or maybe they are just people who pretends to be TDs to mar the reputation of TDs, but it seems that these people on forums like to act high and mighty and insist that they do not need to drive a taxi for a living, that they are driving for fun, kena a bit of attitude from passengers, come here complain. So if in my work, my customer, THE PEOPLE WHO FEEDS YOU AND FAMILY, give you a bit of attitude, I will demand they be nice to me? Luckily, I think MOST TDs are not like that.</p></div>

              <p>I think this thread has been really taken out of context. Multiview, you must understand pple who type in this forum does not use proper english terms.</p>
              <p>Though I dun really like the attitude of SgCabby for being so negative at times, I am sure he does not has the intention of wanting to bluff customer more by saying the word "squeeze". There are times TD want to keep a "Guiness World of Record" kind of thing in their mind like wad is the highest metered fare they ever achieve, or highest earning in a day and tries to break that.</p>
              <p>mpv is a very new guy, I think he tried to explain to u a little on that. However, you have taken it a little too afar by saying such things. Seriously, I think you and some others should chill out.</p>
