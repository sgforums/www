              <p>Taking a taxi is for those who can afford it, or once in a blue moon when one is in a terrible rush.  What's the most a fare can be stretched by? Maybe a $40 fare becomes $50.  If $10 matters that much to the passenger, he/she really shouldnt be taking a cab.  Singapore has an excellent mrt+bus system, use it people! Besides, expensive cab fares encourage people to plan their schedules better, and to actually listen to the alarm clock when it rings!</p>
              <p>For the uninformed.  Its far cheaper to take a taxi everyday for 10 years (inclusive of phone call booking fee) then to buy a car (including COE and Fuel). So thank you mr. Taxi Drivers ;P Just dont overcharge people too much yeah? =)</p>

              <p><br>It is not the amount of money that matters.. This is a matter of principle.. These people are taking passengers as idiots.. Openly soliciting ways to rip the passengers of money.. How else to 'squeeeze the meter somemore'? Maybe deliberate alteration of taxi meters so that passengers will be charged more? This is even more dangerous than fixing a price with customer before a journey.. We cannot even trust the taxi meter! Another way which they can 'squeeze the meter more' is obviously to take a longer route. You mentioned that some people took a taxi beause they are rushing for time..How would you feel if you meet somebody like sgcabby who only cares about his wallet and not about whether you can make it for your important meeting?</p>

              <p><br>Bro unless u got proof, dont anyhow accuse him. Money is never easy to earn. Even in the office, people also thinking ways to make more and squeeze whatever cents they can from their bosses. This is normal. Unless u wish to work for a charity.</p>
              <p>The biggest cheats are the taxi companies. They impose artificial high rents and low fare systems on us. High rents so what - public wont complain what. Low fare works for them - public also wont complain what. Chow cheebye dare to collect 50 cents per call booking. It is our hard work ok. The MDT rental already inside the rent mah. Somemore got automated call booking system. Still insist on 50 cents per booking. No shame. Money is really no enough for these greedy bastards.</p>
              <p>So the TD kenna squeezed in between. Direct your anger at the management of these blood sucking companies. Their marketing gurus dress them up as sheep to the public but really they are wolves.</p>
