              <p>Gotcha, System engineer doing "data processing". Probably his boss put him in "cold storage" and hopefully he resigned.  Then can employ another FT to replace with lower salary. Knn, WTF trick.</p>
              <p>I think it is up to your friend to smell and sense his surrounding. What's the big deal with IT?   In this field, whatever you know now will be obsolete and redundant very fast.</p>
              <p>Better get out of that square box and do something else if he really have innovative brain.</p>

              <p>i think it is to each his own.. everyone has different expectations of life in terms of financial, lifestyle etc.. i am used to working 7 days and long hours cos i have been a hawker before.. working from 5am to 11pm.. that is really no life..</p>
              <p>when i come into this trade, frankly, for the 1st time, i feel that every dollar is really hard earned.. and realise last time in corporate world, money is more easily earrned..</p>
              <p>again, we should not resigned ourselves to being taxi drivers our whole life.. at all times, we should be thinking of other business or investment to do.. so bro TCL, 41 is still young, me 39, i consider myself still very young, to be honest..</p>
              <p>for me, i buy share and keep for long run.. must buy those wen wen de.. like sgx, dbs etc.. once i got spare money, i will just buy 1 lot and keep..that is my style..</p>

              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">From all your posts , u painted the good sides. How abt at fault accidents? fatigue at the wheel? LTA complains , unreasonable paxes? daily deduction of rent even though u are sick? etc etc</span></em></p>
              <p>I've said a thousand times ..... one must be discipline in all aspects , to avoid those things you mentioned .</p>
              <p>Do you see me got involve in accidents ? Touch wood , but it's individual driving habits and disciplines in driving .</p>
              <p>Fatigue ? One must be discipline in ample rest , again discipline , very regimental .</p>
              <p>LTA complains ? Since when u heard Uncle Poolman got caught ? Once again , one must be skilful and discipline when communciating with commuters .</p>
              <p>Unreasonable paxes ? Which customer service dun have such issues ? Ask Mcdonald , Kentucky , Watson's etc .... Bus captains , it's part and parcel of customer service trade .</p>
              <p>Of course with Super Flu bugs virusing around , it's inevitable to be sick , again , when u are discipline , u can avoid that ! To some extend , open up your windows for better ventilations , Vitamin C capsules daily , drink water , alot of them .</p>
              <p>All those points u provided , can be avoided .</p>

              <p>I had never painted all good for all people , it's individual basis .</p>
              <p>Say for example .....</p>
              <p>One 31-yr-old young man , own a house in Sengkang , 2 kids , wife housewife . House can tahan instalment by CPF , cos he worked for 10 years already .</p>
              <p>He lost his job in a factory , earning previously $1800 a month before take home .</p>
              <p>Found a new job , as a store clerk cum delivery man , per month $1450 . 5 and half days work , 8am til 5pm , sometimes overtime late for delivery .</p>
              <p>If he asked me : " Pool , u think i should drive a cab , money no enuf ? "</p>
              <p>I 100% tell him he must drive a cab .</p>
              <p>Becos to me , i've seen many cabbies , hardworking , less fussy type , earning cold hard cash $1450 in 2 weeks !!!!! Just 2 weeks .</p>
              <p>Dun say $2900 a month , just say $2400 a month ( per day pathetic $80) .</p>
              <p>Against $1450 a month as store cum driver .</p>
              <p>Which one is more logical ?</p>
              <p>This is precisely what many here has this problems .</p>
              <p>Credit cards issues , gambling issues , divorce issues , business collapsed etc ..</p>
              <p>Do they got any other choices ?</p>
              <p>Any other jobs that has got daily cold hard cash for them to roll ?</p>
              <p>Pls find for them , u'll be a hero .</p>

              <p>Meaning resigned from possible pension, and yearly steady income
                  of $42,000 from the SPF .</p>

              <p>Lets not take mr 37 as an example coz he is less than a year in the TD bizness. Still new , still fresh , still charging.Lets hear from the &gt; 5 year TDs will be more ideal.</p>
              <p>Strange the last time i met him he told he is sick and very tired of driving cab but at the same time gotta respect him coz i think he ranks amongst those top guns in taxi industry. those that hit X,XXX per mth. 1 % of the TD industry i think.</p>
              <p>As for the SPF thingy , i have no comments.</p>

              <p>i think it is to each his own.. everyone has different
              expectations of life in terms of financial, lifestyle etc.. i am
              used to working 7 days and long hours cos i have been a hawker
              before.. working from 5am to 11pm.. that is really no life..</p>
              <p>when i come into this trade, frankly, for the 1st time, i feel
              that every dollar is really hard earned.. and realise last time in
              corporate world, money is more easily earrned..</p>
              <p>again, we should not resigned ourselves to being taxi drivers

              business or investment to do.. so bro TCL, 41 is still young, me
              39, i consider myself still very young, to be honest..</p>
              <p>for me, i buy share and keep for long run.. must buy those wen

              <p>Actually erm my bro in law also face the same situation , working in 1 of the banks . coz of his many years in the company and climbing to manager .</p>
              <p>In recent years he got bumped down to a high paying 'clerk' earning 4k . Asked me if he should resign and join me as a td. After giving him a scare on wad TD is about , he is still working there , stressed out &amp; basically a nobody but imo he's still better off than being a TD. Cos the stress that he gets is nothing compared to the stress u get on the roads. And fyi , if he makes mistakes, the bank will not ask him to pay anything . Taxi u make mistake u pay dearly.</p>

              <p>Yo bros, me started driving last friday and sat nite, so far so
              good except that during the nite the sign board quite difficult to
              see especially when you are new to tis trade..I have also attended
              the MDT half day course yesterday which at least now I am more
              confident to take current booking calls, nets and credit card
              payment, any wise words from all of u...:)</p>

              <p>Gung my advice is to just whack. see 1 pick 1 . If there is a call , judge quickly if u think u make it to the place within a certain eta. Too far just reject and also pay particular attention to the pick up pt , if it says main road , REJECT. </p>
              <p>Not all CDG calls can take one... some are really rotten and phui chao nua type.</p>
              <p>Friday i would say just whack street la. plenty people around.  Coz u only drive 2 days and these 2 days are about the best in the week. So no pt wasting time taking calls .</p>
              <p>It is days like mon , tues that u need a certain strategy to stay alive.</p>
              <p>Friday?? no need to strategy .... just whack</p>
              <p>Saturday let those who drive give u some advice. me no drive saturday one :p</p>
              <p>good luck</p>
