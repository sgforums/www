              Monday, my second day of driving.   started from 5.30pm.   my hirer informed me that the fuel cap gone missing.   luckily I remembered the Pump station and was able to retrieve it back.    newbie inexperience.
              
              have not found the routine from my set off yet, cruising around for 20 mins empty.  decided to go in to SUNTEC, paid the $2 erp.  bingo, the queue was moving fast.  got a pax to takashimaya.  from there to Ardmore park.    join the queue at shaw centre as fifth taxis.   
              
              a pax came knocking on my window, said " can u make a u-turn (Claymore Hill) and go to Adam rd".  In my heart, this pax must be a smart pax,  when reached the destination, must give some discount.    true enough, he said the round up figure to $.
              
              around 11.30pm, got a pax to pasir ris st 51.  went down AP to queue at T2.   queue there for 2 hrs.  (did not do homework: checking of flight)  moved off at 2am, brought an ang moh couple to traders hotel.   at orchard, everywhere I go,  only see empty  taxis cruising.   stop driving at 4am, felt  like eating hainanese curry rice.  went to syed alwi rd .  
              
              lesson learnt:  1) checking of flight  2) fuel cap  3)  cheap diesel at CDG but oily hoses 4)a few new roads

              <p>Anyway I think my online account still avaliable so I might be able to check the next excursion date for u...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>As you can see, as of now the earliest excursion date is  6 June with only left 2 slots, so by the time you get you login info I think most probably no more liao so your excursion date will most probably be the 13 June one...</p>
              <p>Anyway you can't really book the test date by itself, as it will be given to you when u attend the excursion, and it is usually like the week after the next of your excursion date. So assuming u book the 13 Jun one then the test date will probably be like on 22 June plus minus a couple of days.</p>
              <p>For the online course, I managed to finish it in about 3 hrs while reading briefly though and doing all the quizzes, but if you choose just click through the whole thing without reading at all I think less than half hour can settle liao, only thing is quiz u still must pass all then can book the excursion date.</p>
