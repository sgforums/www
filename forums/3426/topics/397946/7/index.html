              <p>HI JLKL, welcome aboard.</p>
              <p>As all the seniors have put it here, with right mindset and attitude you will go a long way.</p>
              <p>99% of pax will guide you if you tell them you don't know the place (the other 1% cannot guide you because they also don't know themselves). If you kay kiang and screw up later, then the pax will get really annoyed.</p>
              <p>Me also new cabby, been on the road only 3mths plus. Know about 71% I think, better than that useless Zero 5. :)</p>

              <p>thanks all bros for the advice and encouragement.. and after 3 days of driving, i can now fully understand what is no life of OMO.. the only good point of OMO is you can have the flexibility of choosing what time u want to drive..</p>
              <p>routes wise so far, most pax guide me from start to finish cos i dun even have an idea how to go.. like last nite, i pick up a pax going 2 places, turn out he also taxi driver but his cab is under repair, so need to take cab.. i ask him to guide me, which he did. the way he guide, i must say very impressed.. so familiar with all the road names.. i ask him how he master, he say for him easy cos before he become taxi driver, he also is a driver..</p>
              <p>collection wise, me of cos no good lah, very little in terms of hrs on the road.. my peak hour very lousy.. off peak better.. must think of how to improve my peak hour.. cannot be my off peak colection is better than my peak hr mah</p>
              <p>another problem i have is i dun like to queue, i cruise around but sometimes can be quite demoralising crusing around but becos i am new, i took the opportunity to just try to remember the road names etc..</p>
              <p>physical wise, 3 words.. si bei xiong</p>
              <p>topping up of cng so far okay lah.. have been to the 3 stations.. yesterday morning go sgn nth one, knn reach there close, my gas running out.. lucky got pax send me to maxwell.. then i go from there to toh tuck..</p>
              <p>hope to meet up with u guys one day.. for those cng drivers, we may have met at those cng stations, just that we duno each other identity nia..</p>

              Hi JKL
                     thanks for your reply, i was in fact this morning at defu lane 1 transcab office (22/06/10) i did ask for the wish 1.8 but the lady say now dont have to wait and dont know went but she ask me to take the new wish 2000c and that will be in end augest 2010 as per the term what u wrote is the same so u got ur wish in one week? thats good, thanks to all the brother here who have wrote some good review and i feel they are right cause i did my e-learning from smrt they seems to talk seet but they cant keep all the cabbies there so i thought i rather get wish while waiting just do some relief, driving until i get the wish and let take a step at a time, thank you and see you and the rest some time soon
              
              goodnight
