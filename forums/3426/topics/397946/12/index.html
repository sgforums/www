              <p>There are 25000 cabs on the road... and how many cases of robbery are reported per day? </p>
              <p>Overall Crime for 2009 is 33,000 cases. That include everything, eg rape, housebreaking, petty theft, etc.</p>
              <p>So that'll work out to abt 90 cases of crime per day. and its all sorts of crime not pertaining to only robbery.</p>
              <p>Even if all 90 cases are robbery. There're 25000 taxis on the road. So to get rob is 90/25000 of a chance. Thats 0.36%. and its saying if there's 90 cases of robbery per day!</p>
              <p>So like what poolman says, to get rob is destiny liao. They are more likely to rob from passer by then to rob a taxi driver. Why? becos if they take a cab to some place, its sure somewhere near their home. So if rob there... very soon will get caught.</p>
              <p>If not near their home, worst. After they rob... still have to take cab back home. u think they'll walk?</p>

              <p>I heard one story from another old TD driver while chatting and he told me of a real life story regarding a TD that jump to his death due to his spouse not convince of his low earnings after hearing from others what their husband can earn as much.  Moreover this TD has sickness and also cannot perform his TD works efficiently that contribute to his low earning. Whether it is true or not , i don't know but it is real sad to hear about it.</p>
              <p>And i forgot which year....some time in the 1990s....it is in the newspaper that one young chap in his 30's drive many hours a day and died on his steering wheel in the expressway.....This chap take in $$$$ but ignore his health....What a sad scenario....leaving young kids and wife without breadwinner.</p>

              <p>I think you got the maths wrong.... its not 420$ take home... thats the gross figure... after rental and diesel.. its much less.</p>
              <p>The one thats earning big bucks is not the TD. its the taxi COMPANY!!!! GO TELL THE ROBBER TO ROB CDG!</p>
              <p>AND ITS NOT EASY MONEY!!!!! 19HRS IS NO JOKE!!!</p>
              <p>Anyway, my revealing of the $$$ here is just for the newbies. All lao jiaos already know what kind of figure to expect... eg $30/hr. </p>
              <p>Just dun hype on Taxi as being a moving ATM. its not. if a robber really wants to rob a TD he can do it anytime.... Like poolman reveal in the newbie thread on how much to prepare before the start of the taxi trip. </p>

              hearing from others what their husband can earn as much. 
              Moreover this TD has sickness and also cannot perform his TD works
              efficiently that contribute to his low earning. Whether it is true
              or not , i don't know but it is real sad to hear about it.</p>

              <p>Understand your point. </p>
              <p>But if the spouse of a TD thats 50 yr old and expect him to do a 19hr shift... pls tell the TD to divorce her... she is a vampire. Not human.</p>
              <p>And to all newbies here... Please dun just look at the final figure. LOOK AT THE HOURS PUT IN TOO!!!! </p>

              <p>I think you got the maths wrong.... its not 420$ take home... thats the gross figure... after rental and diesel.. its much less.</p>
              <p>The one thats earning big bucks is not the TD. its the taxi COMPANY!!!! GO TELL THE ROBBER TO ROB CDG!</p>
              <p>AND ITS NOT EASY MONEY!!!!! 19HRS IS NO JOKE!!!</p>
              <p>Anyway, my revealing of the $$$ here is just for the newbies. All lao jiaos already know what kind of figure to expect... eg $30/hr. </p>
              <p>Just dun hype on Taxi as being a moving ATM. its not. if a robber really wants to rob a TD he can do it anytime.... Like poolman reveal in the newbie thread on how much to prepare before the start of the taxi trip. </p>

              <p>the point is whatever you type, will be view by others... others may not be lucky enough to clock whatever you have for SUNDAYs. (SUNDAY ONLY TD).</p>
              <p>Singaporeans alway love to compare and complaint.... Spouses will read forum pages and compare their hubby revenues.... why this, why that...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Robbery is only one factor</span>... have you consider that you may have also done a FREE SURVEY for PTC to consider releasing more taxis on the road ??</p>
              <p>The percentage of robbery may be low... <strong>some robbery ended up fatal</strong>.  When a life is lost... then you can also say ( <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thats 0.36%. and its saying if there's 90 cases of robbery per day</span> ).</p>
              <p>I am not bias against you.. but it is only a advice i give to other forumers.  If Poolman says i am wrong... i won't come into Taxi Forum and post anymore...</p>

              <p>Everyone has a reason for doing something.  Bro Sandisct, I really appreciate you sharing this valuable information. It is very good reference to newbies like me. And this is the main reason you took so much time to go into detail. (To help newbies have a better understanding)</p>
              <p>However, TCL has a point too. Giving too much detail like telling other people your earninga, which is a very private thing, might invite the wrong interest or misunderstandings. People might not be able to understand that takings can fluctuate (heng sua factor) and nearly 1 whole day driving is seriously no joke. Minus fuel, rental, carwash costs, and time for makan and toilet break, earnings are just decent only. Many people over 30yrs old hold 2 jobs and earn &gt;$3k in Singapore. No big deal. </p>
              <p>Maybe Sandisct can edit your post on the earnings part and try to give a range. Or maybe emphasize on the need to deduct rental and fuel costs?</p>
              <p>In fact, such earnings are really no big secret, just that people do avoid saying them. I once sat on a taxi an the uncle break down this earnings to me in detail and I though he was kidding with me! He works 16hr days, 25 days a month (OMO) and earns &gt;$4k monthly. But if I work 2 office shifts, I also can get close to $4k. But I am burning my life twice as fast and it is no joke to work hard for money, we all know. Hope everyone can settle this nicely. Good night.</p>
