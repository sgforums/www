              Guess u probably 've been driving for &gt; 1 yr n have never

              <p>10 years bro... 10 fucking years. what nice things to expect me to say abt this trade?</p>
              <p>Singapore is really a very unique country where the citizens drive the foreigners around.</p>
              <p>if u are 30 or mid 30s , pls la dont give up the fighting sprit in the corporate world. The fact that at this age , u guys jump into taxi driving serves to let the regime know that citizens are farked up thats why need foreigners to come in.</p>
              <p>When u are 1 or 2 years into the trade , ya plenty of good things to say but down the road u begin to wonder why u are this farking deep shit with no prospects of a turn for the better and as you go longer and longer , u will realise that job opportunities are slipping away and then you start to realise... kinda late bro, too late.</p>
              <p>1 year a new taxi driver , 10 years still a taxi driver , 15 years also a taxi driver.</p>
              <p>Think abt it</p>
              <p>btw im not discouraging people but this is 1st hand experience from many of those that have driven for decades.</p>
              <p>wanna listen up to u all.</p>
              <p>Remember , TCL dont paint rosy pictures for people to jump in.</p>

              <p>A friend of mine , barely 30 years of age , just married with a new flat. Prior to this , he was desperate to seek a job after getting laid off coz of well foreigners. With an engineering diploma , he was jobless for half a year.</p>
              <p>Asked me if he should drive taxi. i advised him against it and told him to fucking go and look harder for a job. He understood where im coming from.</p>
              <p>Now he's got a 2500 per mth job , not much but theres something to look forward to and that is promotion, CPF , leave , MC etc etc.</p>

              <p>10 years bro... 10 fucking years. what nice things to expect me
              to say abt this trade?</p>
              <p>Singapore is really a very unique country where the citizens
              drive the foreigners around.</p>
              <p>if u are 30 or mid 30s , pls la dont give up the fighting sprit
              in the corporate world. The fact that at this age , u guys jump
              into taxi driving serves to let the regime know that citizens are
              farked up thats why need foreigners to come in.</p>
              <p>When u are 1 or 2 years into the trade , ya plenty of good
              things to say but down the road u begin to wonder why u are this
              farking deep shit with no prospects of a turn for the better and as
              you go longer and longer , u will realise that job opportunities
              are slipping away and then you start to realise... kinda late bro,
              too late.</p>
              <p>1 year a new taxi driver , 10 years still a taxi driver , 15
              years also a taxi driver.</p>
              <p>Think abt it</p>
              <p>btw im not discouraging people but this is 1st hand experience
              from many of those that have driven for decades.</p>
              <p>wanna listen up to u all.</p>
              <p>Remember , TCL dont paint rosy pictures for people to jump
              in.</p>

              4 AP trip til 11am then roam the st til 1pm. He'll start AP again
              at 4pm n if possible make 2 more AP + sweeping n knock off at 11-12
              . He says his mthly net is quite comfortable. (Been doing 4 past
              1.5 yr) I'm skeptical abt it, can he really earn that kind of

              <p>Very true what TCL said.  I have friends who started being TD in their 30s and still stucked in this and cannot get out.  One other guy driven for 5 years also in his 30s and finally get out and he sighed that he had wasted those 5 years and restart his careers all over again and mind you he is very academic and hands on qualified. He finally survive in his latest career.</p>
              <p>Before i become a TD, one kind Old TD advise and told me that if you wanted to become a TD:</p>
              <p>1) you mustn't have debt or if possible no more mortgage to maintain.</p>
              <p>2) Children a little grow up.</p>
              <p>3) You must have health and maintain a healthy lifestyle once you become a TD.</p>
              <p>4) Don't think taxi is your own family car or otherwise you get distracted with your routine.</p>
              <p>Number # 4 :  haha the word "routine".....What TCL said is true....you will stuck to a Routine......because no matter what you come out with Plan A or Plan B strategy for the day, it is still Mundane Routine.</p>

              <p>I would said that it is true that as a TD you must have a good self discipline, and there are pros and cons between TD and working in a company, TD are actually working for a taxi company, but on a self mode condition, the key word here is "in" and  'for".</p>
              <p>The corporate world also have stress, pressure, politics, colleague pressure,  boss and subordinate disatisfaction  and many  more, and you have to look at people face to work, more so is the 8 or 9 to 5 routine job, more routine than a TD. </p>
              <p>TD, is own discipline, own time and own target,  they may not enjoy MC, leaves, and CPF, but they get cash, can plan their time and leaves, and more so, they are the frontline contact with customers which help singapore as an important transport mode.  Other than having to pay the hiring fees to the compay that provide them the taxis, they do not have to support a high overhead cost like in company, where there are MD, GM, managers, Admin and office peoples, exectutives are overhead that suppressed the real productivie workers/staffs' wages.</p>
              <p>So, i do not really agree that taxis career is not better than some others, but the most important is that, as long as you are happy in what you are doing,  go ahead, take pride in it, stay healthy  and dsicipline, takes thing easily, you can be a very happy cabby. </p>
