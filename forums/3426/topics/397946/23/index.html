              <p>All these points are more truthful.  Not $, Not careers, and also Not Jobs but everyday different BO smells.</p>
              <p>Everyday you watch live the real personalities of all ranks of People. Bankers, Pastors, Monks, Widow, Prostitute, Con Man, Rich People, Poor People etc....</p>
              <p>When they talk they show their true self when most of the time all their real personal traits are concealed in a Sheep Clothing.</p>
              <p>One raining night, I fetch a Female Pastor who claim to have the "Biggest Congregation in her country" from one of the big country in our region...she talk and talk and get frustrated in traffic and tried to get me to filter lane indiscrimately, question me how i drive even both lanes was Jam-Park. Later "kena" reverse lecture from me on Life and God....and I told her how her flocks will forgive her even if she will be late for sermons.....</p>

              <p>As the chinese said, every job produce it own master honorary degree, taxis driver is a decent job which have it own degree, not that everyone can do it nor does everyone can work on it for life.
