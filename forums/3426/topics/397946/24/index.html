              <p><br>to my understanding, in older days, taxi drivers were original taxi owner, there are no taxi companies other than taxi selling companies, so being able to drive a taxis is consider a towkay, no need to pay rent and can charge any price depend on time and the crowd, no meter, or got meter but never use, so, in a way, who offer the best fare can take the taxi, I remember when i was young, when we were very poor, taxi is like a big luxury ride for us, so I have no doubt that in those days, taxi driver can make a living, afford this and that, but today, if you ask a taxi driver to single handedly bring up 5 childrens and one wife and also old parents, I think he can die cock standing first.</p>
              <p>There also many people jobless and some like my dad and uncle, working as bell hopper at train station carrying ang mo or rich peoples language earning a few cents per day plus tips from ang mo, and they also have 6 to 8 or even 10 childrens,...until PAP said stop at 2</p>

              <p>Everyone is entitle to their opinons, mouth belong to them, you cannot stop it, if you care about what other said, forever, you will not have a peace of mind. A smart TD will take in the good advices, improve himself on it and remove all those nonsense remarks. At function or wedding dinner, when frens or relatives ask, i alway proudly said, i am a TD, some may walk away and look down on me, some may talk about road and wanted my advice on how to get to here and there at the fastest way, just get on with it, you own no one a living, nor does anyone own you a living. And also you come with nothing, born nake with nothing and you go with nothing, and that nothing last forever, not LKY nor his wife. Take life as easy, TD or MD or plate collectors, as long as it is decent, we are proud to be, there was this story about body parts argueing  that some may have heard before...</p>
              <p>All the body parts get together for a meeting, every part, be it the eyes, stomach, brain, hands etc etc said that they are better than each other in contributing to the body, as they go on to decide who contribute the most and who contribute the least, the asshole said that he is the best, and every other parts laughed at him, saying that the asshole is nothing but a tube to let go shit and sometime get whacked or raped, shitty hole..so asshole should be the lowest contributor in the body parts, the eyes said, if i shut my eyes, the body cannot see, the brain said, if i switch off, the body goes blur and mad, the hands said, without me, you feel nothing and touch nothing,..the stomach said without me, you cannot eat...and so on. The asshole was left out of the meeting, so he goes on strike for a few days, closed the hole for a few days, all the other body parts become so frustrated and tight, as all the waste and shit are on Q, the brain is getting hot and mad, the hands are getting weaking, the stomach are full and in pain, the eyes also blur blur and feel the heat...and the many other parts start to complain and ask the asshole to open the hole, they begged him to open and let go all the shit...then the asshole said, on one condition, I wan to be the most important part of body, respect me and honor me. All the others body parts start to kneel down and beg him, they agreed to all request, as long as he open his hole and stop going on strike. Now, you know that asshole are sometimes the most important of the society.</p>

              <p>I last night call on my former taxi colleague , now currently employed by MBS , as dealer .</p>
              <p>Before as a MBS dealer , he was a store supervisor . åŒ…å±±åŒ…æµ· ã€‚</p>
              <p>As a store supervisor , he earned $1600 before CPF .</p>
              <p>I was thinking , wtf .... i can earn that in 16 days ! Average 8 hours daily work for me .</p>
              <p>He need to work for 20 days , 9 hours at least base on MOM regualation !!!!!! That's providing his company is a 5 days work company .</p>
              <p>I cannot imagine how i can survive with that mini $1600 a month !</p>
              <p>If i am to work for this 4 days , i'll be at least $400 more than him each month .</p>
              <p>Now he is emloyed by MBS , month $1500 , miscellaneous allowance $350 .</p>
              <p>Shift work .</p>
              <p>Now high blood pressure , due to high level of stress in his dealer's job nature .</p>
              <p>One mis-calculation , that's it , penalty !!!</p>
              <p>Anyone for MBS ? Now they need more dealers , cos many quitting soon .</p>

              <p>OK again i think some of u havent got the point. My point is a person in their 30s should not be a TD coz this job is a dead end with no light at the end of the tunnel. Anyone can disagree to this?? Poolman surely u cant disagree coz u are driving almost a decade like me?</p>
              <p>If u asked your son what will he like to be when he grow up? would u react nicely when his reply is Papa i wanna be a taxi driver.</p>
              <p>My views are no doubt somewhat negative but it reflects the truth. Those who wanna join noone is stopping u but think for a moment what TD can offer u in the long run.</p>
              <p>Taxi driving cannot delegate to others to do while at the same time u earn , for every dollar u make , the metre must be running. Never run u eat grass , sometimes have to top up with your own $. Its pure sheer hard work , no idling , no fooling around.</p>
              <p>And next time u wanna go back to employment , your resume put what?</p>
              <p>But i guess people who visit the taxi forum has just about made up their mind to be one so good luck.</p>
              <p>OK cant post much gotta go hospital now. Problems are surfacing after 10 years behind the wheel.</p>

              <p>Taxi driving is not about just picking whoever that comes , if u do this after a while, u are going to get burn out very soon.</p>
              <p>After 1 mth lau hong is not a very good sign bro. it took me abt 3 years to lau hong , disillusioned and feel souless abt taxi driving.</p>
