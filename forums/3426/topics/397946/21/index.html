              <p>and in corporate world, you take MCs, when you come back, the boss face is as black as charcoal, and things will be piling up for you to do, so it does mean that you got the benefit of MC, you are better than a TD, and there is this taiji pushing jobs and blaming culture here and there, I also need to learn, if not kenna push here and there, and been the lower staff, easily get targeted to be scapegoat, but as TD, you are responsible for what you do, if sick, go home rest also nobody criticise you, and you dun have to be scapegoat for others. Knn, those top management, good compliments or jobs done, they said they do it and managed well, those cock up one, all push to us, knn, me also get warning letters before.</p>
