I don't mind though if smart passenger like her can afford it and prefer to have a cab waiting for her while she finish whatever she's doing at the moment).

              <p>Depends on your technics , skills , stamina , handling etc ..... Cannot afford to lose neither of them .</p>
              <p>Technics - Where to find paxes ?</p>
              <p>Stamina - Can endure 12-16 hours of driving .</p>
              <p>Skills - Both driving and judging skills .</p>
              <p>Handling - without knowing pax's destinations , u find ways to find out before moving out .</p>

              <p>eg , if u can find paxes , easy right , go any taxi stand , but that particular taxi stand , will make u earn less in our hour rated calculation .</p>
              <p>Lot-1 ....... even if u Q &amp; pick anyone from Lot-1 , most likely pax will sent you to Yew Tee , CCK Ave 4 , CCK Ave 2 , Bukit Panjang .</p>

He'll start at 7am Q AP n make at least 4 AP trip til 11am then roam the st til 1pm. He'll start AP again at 4pm n if possible make 2 more AP + sweeping n knock off at 11-12 . He says his mthly net is quite comfortable. (Been doing 4 past 1.5 yr) I'm skeptical abt it, can he really earn that kind of monies?</p></div>
