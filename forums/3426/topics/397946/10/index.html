              <p>ok here my maiden journey as a TD report!!! This will be a very looooooong report.... hahaha After writing this i think i can qualify to be a yao gui liao.</p>
              <p>Cab: <strong>Citycab Sonata</strong></p>
              <p>Time:(Sunday) <strong>0800-0300</strong> including pump diesel and car wash.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Qns:Can anyone share with me where can i find 24hrs human car wash service up in the north? or anywhere?</span></p>
              <p>Total hours:<strong> 19hrs</strong> including 2.5hrs of break.<span style="color: #0000ff;"> (1hr lunch and 1hour dinner... 30mins lost due to mistake so take it as a break.)</span></p>
              <p>Total distance covered :<strong>600km</strong></p>
              <p>Total diesel cost:<strong>$51</strong></p>
              <p>Rental:<strong>$85</strong> (according to poolman its <span style="color: #ff0000;">$70</span> take it or leave it. but i already agreed this price before i saw the message... )</p>
              <p>Total takings:abt <strong>$420</strong> including tips. <span style="color: #0000ff;">(can lao jiao here share is this average or good for a sunday full day?)</span></p>
              <p>Total Pax served:<strong>40</strong>pax. (target was either <strong>50</strong>pax or <strong>2</strong>am whichever comes first)</p>
              <p>Total Calls taken: <strong>10</strong> ( Target hit. which is extra $25.)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #008080;">Details :-</span></p>
              <p>Start my first day very kancheong. Totally dunno what to expect. But remember alot of tips from this forum. So try to use it.</p>
              <p>First thing, as I m not too sure of many routes, I'll start the trip by asking the pax do they know how to get there?, out of 10, 9 know and will guide you. So this thing so far not a problem to me. But I screw up 2 trips becos pax never say how to go. Will explain later.</p>
              <p>For sunday morning, i reckon the crowd would be people going to church, heading to extra lessons for kids, going to market, etc. So most of the time I'll stay put at the housing estate and just sweep. And if you know which estate got more foreigners, like Japanese or Koreans, just sweep there. Best time to start would be after 7am. or even 8am. Becos most lessons starts at 9am. One thing i learn is to think like pax. Eg, What would people normally do on a Sunday and usually where would they head out from. And just go....</p>
              <p>So far, no problem getting connecting pax. For my first sunday, by the time i hit 1230pm i already covered my rental and full day diesel cost liao. I think for a total newbie like me, can consider quite good liao hor? haha...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I screwed up 2 trips.</span></p>
              <p>1 from Conrad Hotel at Temasek blvd to Bedok Centre. When i hear Bedok both my legs totally lembeh... Bedok I totally got no idea how the roads there work!!! totally got no idea how to go there. Well actually got rough idea. Was thinking maybe use ECP=&gt;Marine Parade=&gt;Bedok, so i ask pax "use ECP?" He say too far... Maybe use PIE. WAH KOR!!! WORST!... Kan cheong liao, at that moment i can only think of going PIE from selegie=&gt;bendemeer road... So I just tell him ok PIE....</p>
              <p>When i reach Rochor Road turning to little india, he ask me why i take this route. I told him sorry... first day.. not sure... so apologise to him... Suddenly I saw a Charcoal sitting besides me... hahahaha</p>
              <p>When I reach bedok, he was sleeping... So i ask him turn left or right... he guide me until dunno where but very near liao... then he keep quiet... after i missed the turn I'm suppose to turn he said you should turn just now... in the end I alight him at the carpark just besides the interchange. Get fare from him and glad that he was gone.. haha</p>
              <p>End of trip $11.20. just collected $8 from him... damn paiseh... haha</p>
              <p>2nd trip Screwed up - After alighting a pax from lucky plaza to novena road pick up a filipina along the road at 5.50pm. Ask pax does she knows the way?. NO!!!!? So think ok...Going to Pearls Bank near outram MRT, so first thing i thought of is use CTE exit Outram. So was thinking hard how to connect to CTE from Novena side at thomson Road. So think, ok, use <span style="color: #0000ff;">Balestier Road=&gt;CTE (city)=&gt;Outram exit</span>. Ok. Think quite reasonable. then off we go...</p>
              <p>BASKET when i reach end of balestier road i only see CTE(SLE/TPE)... WHERE THE HECK IS CTE(CITY)??? then make a wrong turn... dunno how come ended up at bendemeer road!!!!! Wah lao!!! So ok tell pax sorry, first day driving.. So bo pian drive up to PIE (Toa Payoh) was thinking fish! how to connect to CTE...</p>
              <p>Dunno how and why suddenly drive and ended up at <span style="color: #ff0000;">BUKIT TIMAH ROAD</span>!!!! HAHHAHAHA... apologised like mad... lucky pax quite soft spoken... never cow peh cow bu... So park at road side quick check road directory... Mind totally blank liao. After checking abit was damn fedup with myself already... So i off the meter and tell pax "Tell you wat. I'll send you there for <span style="color: #ff0000;">FREE!!</span> sorry for all the inconvenience caused". In the end managed to send her there at 6.20pm. And when we reached there then i realised <span style="color: #ff0000;">PEARLS BANK IS A ROAD NAME AND NOT A BANK!!!!!! </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">And she still gave me $6. Nice lady.</span></p>
              <p>Overall My first day of driving, I wasted alot of unneccessary time, distance and diesel. I think i wasted abt 50km doing unnecessary distance for missing a turn and dunno where to U-turn and in the end travel damn far then make a U-turn. eg. While heading to vivocity Taxi Stand from alexander road got No-U-turn sign.. then siao liao... so go straight... SHIT!!! all the way no U-turn sign!!!!!... in the end ended up turning to Keppel Road=&gt;cantonment road and u-turn back... then realised... SHIT I CAN ACTUALLY DO IT AT Kampong Bahru road!!! HAHAHAHA... sigh... lessons learnt.</p>
              <p>Alot more things to learn.. Next sunday another day to conquer... think quite ok, as long as dun fetch grouchy and hot tempered pax... should be quite a pleasant thing to do. End of the day I can feel why there's this sense of satisfaction being a TD. <span style="color: #ff0000;">A WALLET FULL OF CASH!!!!</span></p>
              <p>Thats all for now. Hope will do better next time. Got so many question I want to ask the lao jiaos here... maybe next time when we meet up will ask.</p>

              Hi Sandisct, try to look at the street directory and find out how come you end up in bendemeer, bukit timah, etc when trying to go to outram
              
              at balestier, there's a slip road towards city further up, think you saw the first word CTE and just whack without thinking, the first one goes north instead of south
              
              Conrad to Bedok - use nicoll - KPE - PIE short, sweet and fast
              
              As for vivo from alexandra side, i always suggest the ramp drop off, fast drop and fast to pick up another fare down the ramp
              
              FYI, the ramp connects both vivo and harbourfront
              there are 3 dropoffs in this area, try to study them
              what are the amenities next to them
              and find out how to best U Turn legally
              there are many pts where you can u turn legally
              too many combinations to describe here
              
              Good luck and report back, we would like to see how you
              fare on a typical week day drive
