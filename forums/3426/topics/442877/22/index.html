              <p>I think it time for the red boss to do something in transcab
              fares soon, even super relief like me and many others are opting
              for cumfark or smrt, for 4 years, companies had been giving wage
              increases of 2 to 4% to their employees, if you compound it at
              average of 3%, if would had gone up 12% + add on % base on year to
              year wage, most would had 15% raise on average from 4 years ago
              paid. And taxi driver get nothing. Meaing a staff of 3k paid 4
              years ago, will be getting 3.45k now not withstanding promotion and
              other variable bonuses.</p>
              <p>As for rental increase, I would said, it will not happen at the
              moment, because the govt policies of upper singaporean wages is on
              the top priorty, and taxi drivers, which is also a supply and
              demand chain, need to be better paid and care for inorder to have a
              good stream of newbies supply inorder to address the demand</p>

              <p><br>For technical ground job, yes, especially old industrial such as Marine, construction, electronic, steel work, delivery logistic, food and metal industries. It is also true that ladies in office are getting more than us, somehow, overhead (office staff who contribute less) get paid more than the billable one like us who work, bleed and sweat hard for it. Knn, dun tell me the govt do not understand all these, we are paid low because of foreign wages depressing it, our wages become stagnated because of foreign workers and technicians who accepted any pay just to get into singapore.</p>
              <p>Lady like your fiancee is just at the brink of it, if today, pinoys and mynamar takes over office job, you think she can go up further? That is exactly what happen to the ground, we are exposed to low wage competition from third world countries people. They earn and go back to their countries happily, we here licking our wound on how to pay housing loan/expenses and powersupply bills.</p>
              <p>Then the farking govt come out saying singaporean are earning more nowaday, i threw the paper into the drain, knn, talk cock sing song, cbb. Drink two bottles go home sleep better. What statistic are they using, including our OT???

              <p>PTC is like the father. CDG and SMRT are their own children. Transcab and the rest were adopted from the streets. So still must care for them, but must make sure their own children do not see red after their step-brother make announcement.</p>

              <p>Ah Pool you got any ideas? You very well connected. I am sure u know something.</p>
              <p>If PTC needed 2 months, I bet they are doing a taxi fare simulation. Yes a full blown computer simulation. Key in all the variables like tentative taxi fare pricing, driving patterns, passenger patterns, SMRT and bus fare structure for the past years. Couple that with in house feedback from their staff, maybe some priviledged cabbies living in landed areas, and selected VIP and corporate customers.</p>
              <p>The result must be that overall, the new Transcab fare does not end up funnelling future cab business away from their "own children". Because once the Father rubber stamps, he cannot anyhow take back the approval. Once chopped, it will be years before he can come in to review things. Otherwise the general public will give PTC the Father, a very big black eye.</p>

              <p>When you talk about figures and statistics, increase and sales, these smart alex peoples like to use percentage, so call a 3% increase or 6% increase here and there, so what the committee full of real and fake scholars would had said in their final decision is, increase the jump by 10%, the admin secretary recorded it, put it into the figure and there you are a  new $0.22 from 0.2.</p>

              <p>Day drivers focus alot on consistency. Today make enough go back spend time with family or friends. Perhaps thats why they choose to drive day in the first place although there are hardly any surcharge , a lot of jams &amp; very hot.</p>
