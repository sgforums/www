              <p>Most comments are directed at the cab companies and not at the
              taxi drivers.</p>
              <p>The drivers also used special skills to maximise their
              earnings.</p>
              <p>So, no one bothered to solve the root of the problems.</p>
              <p>End of the day, the cab company will use this reason against the
              local drivers to employ foreign drivers.</p>
              <p>This day will come eventually if the drivers continue to use
              their special skills.</p>

              <p id="articlecontent" style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 14.3px;"><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Singapore's consumer watchdog Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) has asked ComfortDelGro to justify its taxi fare revision.<br><br>CASE executive director Seah Seng Choon said: "The fare increase in our view is quite hefty. I suppose if they say it is supply and demand, they should then reveal the findings they have so that the public is aware of the rationale for such adjustment."<br><br>The new fares by Singapore's largest taxi operator will kick in on December 12, just as festive shopping kicks into high gear.<br><br>The new fare structure has drawn flak from commuters, who are unhappy over having to pay more, especially at night.<br><br>Some commuters are upset that the peak period has been extended to stretch from 6pm to midnight, compared to 5pm to 8pm currently.<br><br>"I think taxi fares shouldn't increase any further because with the surcharges and the ERP fees, they are already incorporated into these taxi cab fares. I think it would just be too exorbitant," said a female passenger.<br><br>Another passenger said: "I think it's ridiculous. It's too expensive and it's so hard to get taxis at peak hours, especially."<br><br>Others felt the adjustment was still acceptable.<br><br>"Things are going up and taxi drivers need to live as well. It's not very much compared to other countries where you have to pay much more," said one passenger.<br><br>Singapore's competition watchdog, the Competition Commission of Singapore, also reminded trade associations not to become a vehicle to facilitate price collusion or price-fixing.<br><br>This came a day after the National Taxi Association (NTA) urged other taxi companies to adjust their fares, in line with ComfortDelGro's revision. <br><br>The NTA, a trade union body representing 12,000 taxi drivers, said drivers of other taxi companies also face similar operating cost pressures as those from ComfortDelGro. <br><br>The drivers expect the association to reflect these ground sentiments to taxi companies so that they are taken into account when setting taxi fares, said NTA.<br><br>NTA president Wee Boon Kim said: "We need to (adjust the fares) because our drivers have been making a lot of noise about diesel prices going up tremendously. No one can help and we have to look into the income of our drivers. Being the leaders of the taxi association, that's very important for the interests of our drivers." <br><br>Most ComfortDelGro taxi drivers Channel NewsAsia spoke to said the rise in taxi fares may keep passengers away for a while but they do not think that there will be any long-term effect on their business. <br><br>One taxi driver said: "The night drivers will benefit more. We (morning drivers) will benefit less. I don't think there will be much difference. It will be a few months before people will take cabs again." <br><br>Another taxi driver said: "There are still passengers who like to take cabs. Because if they are taking cab, they have more privacy for themselves. It should be okay." <br><br>The other taxi operators said they are reviewing the situation to see if they should also revise their fares. <br><br>In response, the chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Transport, Cedric Foo, said that in a deregulated sector, market forces should be left alone to work itself out. <br><br>To cater to those who want a more comfortable ride, Mr Foo suggested that the Land Transport Authority (LTA) look into expanding the capacity of "business-class" express buses plying between housing estates and city hubs during peak periods.<br><br>Responding to queries from Channel NewsAsia, ComfortDelGro said it has currently no plans to increase taxi rentals and that it will continue to subsidise diesel for its cabbies.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>
