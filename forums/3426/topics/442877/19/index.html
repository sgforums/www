              <p>I would prefer that since Trans Cab is now the 2nd largest taxi
              company, they should fix their own fare structure. Make known to
              public that they are more value for money .Objective is to fight
              with the Blue/Yellow. If their drivers suffer, because of less
              business and then transcab got more business…drivers will jump
              ship. In times to come , transcab will have more drivers and more
              business. Then got money to upgrade toilet and workshop and employ
              more mechanics.</p>
              <p>Now is a good time ….if not, got to wait long long…Look at
              <span>SMRT</span> ..over the years they achieved
              nothing..just follow the leader .<br> Can Transcab take the challenge and make the big guys follow them?
              It is not always about money. It is about showing your influence on
              the industry and be the next big brother..</p>
              <p>I hope that the fare structure will be different from all taxi
              companies . Make the fare structure as confusing as possible .Make
              the passenger confused and they will complain more..create more
              things to do to the ppl sitting in their air con office
              .hahahah!!!</p>

              <p>Bro do you know that comfuk remove the 10% from  35% peak
              hour  and then shift 10 % into the distance travel. They want
              their  TDs to drive longer hours instead of shorter hours to
              please the general public. Thats why taxi operators must not follow

              Left to the market, are taxi fares getting out of control? 
              
              The latest revisions on how much taxi passengers have to pay have turned the spotlight on the fare structure, with some observers, including at least one Member of Parliament, repeating a call for the authorities to regulate fares again.Â The fare structure - which has become increasingly unwieldy and to some extent, inexplicable - should also be re-examined, they said.Â Taxi fares were deregulated in 1998. National University of Singapore's Associate Professor Lee Der Hong noted that the deregulation was to "allow more competition into the mix and encourage more players into the field". But the current landscape is practically a monopoly or duopoly, the transport expert said.Â Last week, ComfortDelGro, which operates some 15,600 of the 26,700 taxis here, announced revisions to its taxi fares.Â  They include raising the flag down fare and extending the hours subjected to peak period surcharge.On Tuesday, SMRT, the third-largest operator here with 3,000 taxis, followed suit by unveiling fare adjustments identical to ComfortDelgro's.Â Arguing that there is an urgent need for the Government to intervene, Assoc Prof Lee said: "The situation is at a terminal stage ...

He added that according to a study done by his students, call bookings do not make a difference to the amount of time that passengers spent waiting for taxis.Â Neither does it affect the amount of time that taxis cruise around without passengers. On advanced bookings, Assoc Prof Lee argued that taxi operators should, in fact, give discounts for commuters who book taxis in advance as they are helping the companies manage resources to meet demand.Â The simplest way to restructure the system would be to just have a flag down rate and variable rate, said NUS transport economist Anthony Chin.

But it has no say in the matter. Mr Ee noted: "Like any other retail product, consumers feedback has an influence on the price and commuters should send their feedback to the operators if they are unhappy."

              <p>Today, comfort is the largest is mainly because of their booking quantity, they have successfully created their booking demand, and driver join them are mainly for that reason.</p>
              <p>Comfort had spend years of effort to establish that, there is no way or very costly way to outbid them in this area. And The rest of the company are giving out incentive, lower rental etc to attract driver, this in a long term are still unhealty to the company and driver too.</p>
              <p>And since booking is already not a main revenue resources for the company and driver ( Transcab and others), The company should forgo this area, and uses this area smartly to lure in more driver to join them and growth.</p>
              <p>This could be done with extention of Location Surcharge in hot zone at hot timing. When CDG charge $3.30 per booking, driver actually cash in $2.80 after booking levy, set a surcharge of $2.50. The driver are more that happy to recieve this amount cos usual there will be nothing, will see them start camping at those area. And for commuter, it will reduce their time of waiting, frustration of getting thru the "hotline" and paying lesser compare to booking. Isn't it a win win?</p>
              <p>Plus, with such extra income, comfort booking is no longer that attractive to driver and their driver will begin to migrate away from CDG. Isn't it another win for the compay too?</p>
              <p>So it is a win win win situation.</p>
              <p>The fare structure determines people behavior, also can determines the company growth with minimum expenses. </p>
