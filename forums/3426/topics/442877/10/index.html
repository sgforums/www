              <p>Just a thought, if the reds does change strategy with the fares
              structure as per what poolman suggested, it would be interesting to
              watch, no other cab co. can go against cdg except the reds now.
              Then the rest <cite>? I bet premier follow cdg, I drive for them I
              know their style. Another sudden thought how if all the cab
              companies comes up with different fares structure</cite> Crazy
              Liao. Anyway good time for reds to show what they are made of to
              pull one up against the big brother.</p>
              <p>About the ft thing, medical oil, do you think if a ft going to
              drive our cabs are stupid? You think they won’t start thinking of
              the best way to earn ? I am 100% sure they will do the same.</p>
              <p>Sure maybe you are thinking employ the ft by salary and let them
              drive. Have you been to Vietnam? The cabbies are employed by the
              company, they pick a customer, they page and inform their control,
              then when end of trip, collect money, write down the mileage and
              what do they do…....<cite>!</cite> Stop and wait lah, drive for
              what no pessenger not their fault, just sit and wait lor, no
              passenger better no need to work. So in the end what? Ft not stupid
              lah, neither are we singaporeans td stupid.</p>
              <p>Some think they clever, flag for the cab just a few meters
              before the Bencoolen erp sign, haha very very funny. I don’t think
              td stupid either….</p>

              <p>Profiteering is a must in every business, taxi companies, as said, are not charity organisations, and especially comfark deglow, with a stock and shareholders to answer, works in a way of increasing business KPI (profit) year by year. We here are talking about lowering of rental as a choice, they are already reviewing to increase rental, lowering of rental is therefore, never, never in their vocabulary. Because for all taxi companies, rentals is profit.</p>
              <p>The strategic plan of Cumfark to implement new fares and surcharges is not mend for TD to earn more, but rather to readjust the movment of paxs, addresses pax complains holistically, to tell pax to foot the increases of diesel/fuel price and finally, in a disguise of fare rise, when things have settled down abit from the initial big bang, which happens when fare increases, they will increase rentals with new taxis, or better taxis. Again, rentals is profit.</p>
              <p>Just as paxs are begining to understand peak and surcharge period/location for different cab companies, new surcharge/peak period, booking fees and fares start to confuse them again. Then Uncle me have to explain again, for the past few days since they announce, whatever cabs I drove, I get those nasty look and question of why why why increase these and that from pax. Guess many brothers will face the same music, because at the end of the day, we are the middle between taxi companies and paxs.</p>

              <p>In the first place, why Taxi as a public transport are categorize into the same quota as private car?</p>
              <p>Taxi, as a business tool can generate revenue, and can be supported by fares increment easily or easily increase the fares to support. It is put into the same competition with private car, it is just begin unfair to the private car owner.

              <p>Just as paxs are begining to understand peak and surcharge
              period/location for different cab companies, new surcharge/peak
              period, booking fees and fares start to confuse them again. Then
              Uncle me have to explain again, for the past few days since they
              announce, whatever cabs I drove, I get those nasty look and
              question of why why why increase these and that from pax.
              Guess many brothers will face the same music, because at the end of
              the day, we are the middle between taxi companies and paxs.</p>

              <p>If you pump Comfort diesel, you will also notice the cashier rounding DOWN the diesel bill for you. So always pump their diesel to the nearest $0.08 or $0.04</p>
              <p>On paper, Comfort cannot ask cabbies to round UP. Comfort also cannot expect cabbies to provide the exact change to customers, even $0.01. But they can ask you to round DOWN, knowing most of the time your pax will round UP if paying by cash.</p>
