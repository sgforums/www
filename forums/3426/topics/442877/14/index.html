              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>
              </p><p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">ComfortDelGro and SMRT Taxis are drawing a largely negative reaction from readers of The Straits Times Online after their recent fare hike announcements, with many readers calling for boycotts of the taxi companies.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">ComfortDelGro and SMRT had earlier announced revisions to their fare structures, which they said would help improve their cabbies' take-home income and defray rising operating costs.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">However, many readers were sceptical of their given reasons. 'To help the cabbies earn more, reduce the fixed cost rental rather than increase the fares!', said Goh Jane Lee in a post on The Straits Times' Facebook page. 'Why increase fares? If the management of Comfort is so compassionate, that's what they should do.'</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">Firdaus Hashim agreed, but said it was too early to talk about the impact on taxi driver income. He added: 'Public transport companies will continue to raise prices without shame or guilt, using higher costs and flat earnings to justify increases.'</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">Another reader, Lawrence Lee, said there was 'no logic' to the the taxi fare revision. 'Service and (the) attitude of taxis drivers have dropped tremendously. Time to upgrade and...improve the standard of service and attitude or face consequences,' he said.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">Several readers accused the taxi companies, as well as the National Taxi Association of colluding to fix prices. 'It's an outright case of price fixing which goes against fair competition,' Vincent Ong argued.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">On Monday, some ComfortDelGro taxi drivers said passengers avoided taking their cabs when fare hikes by Singapore's largest taxi operator rolled in.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">In a report in The Straits Times on Tuesday, Premier Taxis driver Tan Keow Ling - who did not see an impact on demand for his services on Monday - said passengers fretted over whether other taxi firms would follow ComfortDelGro's action.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">'Customers who get into my cabs tell me that they are boycotting the Comfort cabs,' the 58-year-old said. 'Everyone is worried about the price increase and asks if my company will follow suit.'</p>
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Those against boycott call</span></strong>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">Khor Fujie was among the few readers who argued against a boycott of the taxi companies. 'The rental still needs to be paid by the drivers. In the end, the drivers suffer while the companies just sit back and earn their money,' he said.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">Some readers called on the taxi companies to lower daily rentals for the taxi drivers instead of hiking fares. 'Cab companies should lower their rental to show they really want to help cabbies,' Goh Chye Huat Dean argued.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">Most taxi drivers, however, fear that costs will rise further, in particular rental, although a ComfortDelGro spokesman told The Straits Times on Dec 6 that 'there are currently no plans to increase taxi rental'. She added that the last time rental was adjusted, was in 2000. Taxi drivers, however, said that rumours of an increase are rife, especially given the high vehicle certificate of entitlement (COE) prices currently.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">Finally, reader Jason Ng added that if the companies were 'genuine' in helping their taxi drivers, 'they should be able to predict the length of this down-period and at the same time, lower the daily rental of the cab'.</p>

              <p>Is like this one lah, after CNY, life goes back to normal.</p>
              <p>As I said before, taxi driver stands not to gain much, for the past years, taxi driver had been lure to drive newer vehicle with higher rental rates, for that, no one in the public knows or even known, did not give a damn about it. We become the liability of both the taxi companies and the public at large. With the surge in inflation and diesel cost, we endured all these years of being exploited by companies and at time, paxs. And we still need to endure further, because, as i said before, govt do not want taxi driver to be rich man and woman, govt want taxi drivers to alway go hungry so that they will have to plough the road for their bread and butter issue. This, I believe those in the fare restructuring committee would had discussed and think over it before coming out with this new structure.</p>
              <p>As LKY said, a few bunch of idiots cannot do much, just nab the bud and the flower will not blossom, then the rest of the buds shall be tame.</p>
              <p>I sincerely believe that all these agony and frustration is voice toward our govt rather than cabbies, and every cabby are normal singaporean with relatives and frens who are also paxs on the road.</p>

              <p>Don't worry, typical singaporean are like this, 4 frens agreed not to patronise that stall, then somehow, end up 3 eating there, 3 good buddies agreed not to work for that companies, then somehow, 2 end up working there with good position and paid. Then in real, many of my relatives and frens said they will forever not buy cars, but somehow a few of them end up buying it and show off to me. If by middle age, as a singaporean, you still do not understand singaporean, then be PR better.</p>
              <p>When LHL said, 2012 is going to be a tough year, he does not imply only at the economy slowing down, he is also implying that cost of living is going to go up higher and higher. Take MRT? Mrt is soon going up to cover central line cost and current extension cost, Bus is also going up due to higher diesel prices and cost of building new roads and air con depots under shopping centres. Take care</p>

So, we got to understand their concern and frustration as the same as prices of housing and rental goes up. There are many kind of way to express displeasure, some go to the extreme, some keep it internally, some just let it go and forget about it.

If your pump price exceeds $0.03=round UP to $0.05 and $0.08 round UP to $0.10 for your info.<br><br>Is this consider "Overcharging" by Comfort diesel kiosk?</p>
