              <p>Tks guys 4 all yr advices n comments, I been looking 4 jobs in the private sector for only a few days n I feel like giving up liao......</p>
              <p>1) with jus O-Levels, almost impossible 2 find a job tat can pay 2.5K/mth n above. Even jus wan 2K also very difficult.</p>
              <p>2) have 2 take bus n MRT (nw Spore already packed like sardines like Japan), waiting times, walk 2 bus stops or MRT already sweat like hell, if heavy rain, even gt umbrella, also sure wet. When we r driving taxi, when pax pay us fares costing $20 or more during peak hr or midnite charge, we really feel shiok! Tat day I took a cab n the fare is $25 during peak hr, really heart pain. If I drive bk cab again, sure must give even better service than the good service I provided last x. </p>
              <p>3) Like wat Poolman n other bros said, we r our own boss! In private sector, I tin any x can get sack or f*ck by boss or yr superior. I drove taxi 2 years, only ganna ple run fares 2x, ple vomit inside my cab jus 1x, no major accident (minor minor 1 repair less than $100, so stil ok.</p>
              <p>4) Very very convenient as gt own transport, pls try 2 tk a cab during midnite or peak hr n far distance, then u sure feel the pain. If u r like me, eversince started workin got motorbike, then saloon car then own taxi, cannot imagine have to walk under hot sun or heavy rain n then have 2 squeeze n no seats n if u add the waitin n journey times, have to leave home at least 1 hr earlier.</p>
              <p>5) U wil discover tat <span style="color: #0000ff;">being a Taxi Driver is a good paying job</span> (when touchwood if jobless like me now), minimum tk home 2K+, if hardworking, 3K+ n even 4K+. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Own boss, wan 2 go anywhere in Spore very fast n convenient, at least it's an honest job, meet different kinds of ple everyday (many chio bus) n many many other perks n benefits.</span> </p>

              <p>This is bad advice. Maybe only 1 in 20, 50 or 100 can become successful traders. Try can try, play small money can. But dont bang on it. Everyday drive taxi sure profit one. But trading? Come on. Risk of losing money and sleep is very very high.</p>

              <p>I dunno your uni and degree...but generally speaking...if the job that U want is in the same field as what U majored in uni...2.5K is a little low...at least for engineering positions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if not the same field...then its a matter of how low U want to go for the company to want to consider U...this is more complicated because U have a limit on how low it can be...money for parents...food....transport...insurance...housing...etc....Ur friend can take a lower pay doesnt mean U can....work out your expenses....calculate a minimum benchmark U must have....and stick to it.</p>

              <p>I dun blame expat or foreign talent. cause some of them not cheap..............................</p>
              <p>I blame it on the local mentality of "want cheap and good". They want local talent and yet they dun wan to pay.</p>
              <p>These kind of employers blame it on locals that they dun wan to work, attitude problem, etc etc.</p>
              <p>Until today, locals still have the colonial mentality that western country has more and better talent.</p>
              <p>They dun wan the hassel of dealing with head strong locals who know all their lousy tricks to exploit pple. Why certain group of foreigners work willingly at low paid industries?</p>
              <p>1) They have little choice as they already paid explotive high referal fees to so call agents. You will notice some HRs takign a cut from it.<br>2) Even with the current pay they received in SG, they can build private house and few storey apartments with only 3 yrs plus. (first 2 years their money mostly are paid back to the loan sharks agents etc)</p>
              <p>$2k salary in security line as a supervisor and no local wan the job? Did they tell the newspaper what is the component of the pay ? How much overtime included in the pay package which is already exceeded what MOM recommended?</p>
              <p>Local stubborn? I dun think so. We are stubborn because we know what is going on and we can afford to be stubborn.</p>
              <p>As such, it is not the foreigner fault. I have the previledge of leading lower tier foreign workers. Some of them are surely more hardworking and more brains than the locals. But I can tell you, not all of them are perfect. What makes them so attractive is that they can be expandable when needed without the need to incurr huge expanses such as retrenchment benefits (or nothing at all for many cases lol)</p>
              <p>This problem is not uncommon. Other developed countries is facing it as well. The free market economies will push companies to think of ways to save money. The only diff is that many of the developed nation in the west have strong laws to protect the general work force and they are educated in such a way they are willing to pay.</p>
              <p>Here in SG, we are made by law to avoid certain bad behaviours such as littering. But then, when that restrain is removed, we behave like uneducated fools. We go other countries and behave as if we are better than pple and throw rubbish.</p>
              <p>We are condition to stick to the line, to put it diplomatically, if there are enough incentive(s) to do so. Once the incentives are gone, we dun see anything wrong with negative behaviours cause our moral and values are near to the bottom.</p>
              <p>Like the minister, I hope the foreigners here can contribute to SG especially to the mentality and the way we think. It will take another generation or 2, but I sincerely it will eventually take place.</p>
              <p>my 2 cents worth....only 2 cents</p>
