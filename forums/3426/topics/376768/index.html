              <p>take your time bro ....... pass first then say .</p>
              <p>If pass liao , new bird start off as relief , will be less stressful than those that started off as OMO . Life oready so stressful in Sgp , why add to the oready stressful routine ?</p>
              <p>OMO ? U can PM those the likes of Azera Vincent , Mr Lam of Azera , Patrick or Ken Teo . They qualify to comments , as far as i know , their salary might not be neccessary higher than me , maybe on par . Vincent and Lam definitely lower than many of us relief , cos they are OMO without experiences .</p>
              <p>The key going into taxi now , is experience , unlike those days , happy-go-lucky u can take home $100 . Now still same , can take home $100 easy , but every moves made , must be more precise . One wrong move , checkmate !!! One wrong customer , onto the wrong destination , at the wrong time , the overall salary the whole day can go wrong .</p>
              <p>Taxi driving is about being relax , free &amp; easy , good decent salary ( providing u are hardworking )</p>

              <p>Take home could be about average daily $80 from Monday to Friday , for someone new .</p>
              <p>Saturday and Sunday u might not neccessary take home more , Saturday and Sunday morning is a waste of bullet . 6am to 9am , no business one . Go round and round oso no waiting customer one . Will be quite demoralising . Public Holiday same .</p>

              <p>If u intend to work solo , no intention to find a relief , than u can chose between TransCab , Comfort or SilverCab .</p>
              <p>U know la , TransCab Wish is on CNG , again best pay-out in the market of $716 mthly , no gimmicks . U sign a Red Wish , $1000 signing-on fee for you . If u get Ken to recommend u ( Ken is currently a Red Wish hirer), Ken gets $1000 recommendation fee , for example .</p>
              <p>Comfort is about getting diesel conveniently , almost 8 or more kisoks all over Singapore island , cheapest diesel in the market .</p>
              <p>Comfort is about convenient when u want to get relief driver .</p>
              <p>Downside of Comfort , they don't really give good attractive benefits like those from TransCab and SilverCab . For Sonata , the benefit is like $1000 for a year . $1200 for those old Toyota Crowns .</p>
              <p>Comfort is bad when giving money to their hirers .</p>
              <p>Comfort has the biggest market share in relief populations .</p>
              <p>SilverCab has launched some new Magentis and Crown benefits , quite good .</p>
              <p>Like that Crown , like $80 rental per day , month end $500 benefit . But down side , diesel price at Shell , Esso and Caltex now quite high . This scheme doesn't allow u to pump at their Silver Kiosk at subsidised prices .</p>

              <p>I started off as relief ....since 2001 . With Comfort .</p>
              <p>Others drive Comfort for call , my vehicle that time no MDT , i start earning most from the street hire .</p>
              <p>Good ? Yes , a good learning process . U learnt those route quite easily .</p>
              <p>Then 6 months later , i start taking bookings ..... good ? Yes , i started to learn those places and building from Shenton Way , Robinson Road , Cecil Street etc CBD area . Now i am master of Shenton , thanks to Comfort that time for throwing bookings at me . Without this booking stuff , i might not be that familiar with Shenton in such a short time .</p>
              <p>Then i understudy Tuas Area , Jurong area , good ? very good . An option for me at West Side . Thanks for Comfort for making me a good Tuas driver .</p>
              <p>Then when i am good , ready to go solo , i went into OMO at 2005 , 2006 i quit as OMO .</p>
              <p>Poolman quit as OMO , can u imagine how tough is it ? Considering i am a tough guy .</p>

              <p>In Sgforums here , many went into OMO , and quit in short time .</p>
              <p>Curtis aka QuickPick , quit OMO in 3 days , with CityCab .</p>
              <p>Vicent and Lam from Azera troops , doing well , improving , and tired they claimed .</p>
              <p>David Chong quit SilverCab after completed his 1 year Silver contract .</p>
              <p>I quit OMO in 9 months .</p>
              <p>Funny enough , TransCab Wish new OMO here seemed the happy lot ... Patrick , Ken , Zeemax , Rotary ....... why ? I still trying to figure out .</p>

              <p>Hi Guys,</p>
              <p>Need some help from you. Fail my business venture last month so owe money big time. Married &amp; have a kid coming soon next May. Applied many jobs but no replies so far. Now 29 years old, coming mid Nov, 30.</p>
              <p>Planning to go for Comfort Sonata as OMO.</p>
              <p>Intend to drive   Mon - Thu: 11:30 - 01:30.   Fri - Sat &amp; Eve of PHs: 15:00 - 06:00. Sun: 15:00 till cover rental &amp; fuel, then go back.</p>
              <p>I go OMO precisely because I seriously don't like share cab with others.</p>
              <p>I am also interested to take on the Toyota Wish from TransCab but no idea what's the deposit like. However feel like not going to Transcab as the taxis doesn't have NETS facilities like Comfort &amp; CityCab do.</p>
              <p>So wanna ask you guyz see for my situation which cab company &amp; which auto vehicle to drive can give me the most yield.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>6am-8pm, doable..but no life.</p>
              <p>my friend doing this timing, but lao gui and got nite relief. relief driver from 8pm to 6am, rental $20 (have to be cheap to attract relief) anyway after 8pm he doesn't drive, so why not let out. market got quite a few drivers holding full-time job but need extra $$$. average $360-$380, good days $400+. so he takes home min. $200 cos rental &amp; diesel abt. $140-$150. add the $20 from his relief driver...more than $4000 a month easily. sunday let out whole day with discount. so 6 days solid driving, sunday rest. but i still think no life. he's been at it this way for more than 15 years already. be prepared to sacrifice family time if driving this way.</p>

              <p><br>Good deal ?</p>
              <p>I am not a hirer , but survey i did , at the moment , no taxi company cash payout $8592 yet per year .</p>
              <p>Again , u'll get a $1000 signing on fee . If any hirer recommend you , he'll get $1000 .</p>
              <p>I think the $716 scheme will go on until they fulfill the 6000 Wish on the road , currently only 2000 Wish on the road .</p>
              <p>$716 = $450 cash benefit and $266 CNG rebates . Use to be $766 , as in $500 cash and $266 CNG rebates . But after Toh Tuck Road start the CNG Kiosk , they amend a bit .</p>

              <p>bro collection of new wish is on every middle &amp; end mth,the deposit is $1.5k but u can neg with them to pay $1k first,then the rest contra from the $716 bonus</p>
              <p>So far after driving the wish for 1wk plus,overall is good! most pax love it &amp; some tourists even request to take photo :)</p>
              <p>Bro green hornet,I suggest u make a list of all the models u fancy &amp; also list down the rental &amp; operating cost. Then compare &amp; make a decision from there</p>
