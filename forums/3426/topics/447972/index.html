              Forbes ranks Singapore as 3rd richest nation
              
              Singapore is the third richest country in the world, ranking behind only Qatar and Luxembourg, according to Forbes magazine. 
              Using the most recent International Monetary Fund data available, Forbes said Singapore â€œthrives as a technology, manufacturing and finance hub with a GDP (PPP) per capita of nearly US$56,700 (SG$71,200).â€�
              
              This compares with a per capita gross domestic product (GDP), adjusted for purchasing power (PPP), of more than US$88,000 for the world's richest nation, Qatar. The Persian Gulf emirate of 1.7 million people taps the world's third-largest reserves of natural gas for its wealth, some of which it is pouring into the construction of all air-conditioned stadiums for the 2022 World Cup.
              
              Coming in second, with slightly more than US$81,000, was Luxembourg. The tiny Grand Duchy, bordered by Belgium, France and Germany, has only a half-million people, but scores as a financial hub with banking secrecy laws that makes it a tax haven, Forbes said.
              
              The magazine said it compiled its rich list by examining the GDP of 182 countries, adjusted for PPP, which is preferred by economists when doing international comparisons. It says this takes into account the relative cost of living and inflation rates. This is mostly from 2010 figures, but a 2009 estimate in Singapore's case.
              
              But Forbes quotes associate professor of economics Gian Luca Clementi, of New York University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business, as saying that â€œthe numbers must be taken with a grain of saltâ€�.
              
              Many issues, including how the quality of goods varies from country to country, can make any GDP comparisons misleading, he said.
              
              The top 10 list includes fifth-ranked Brunei, the United States at No. 7, and eighth-placed Hong Kong.
              
              ---------------------------
              
              Friends have been sending me SMSes expressing incredulity over news that Singapore is the worldâ€™s third richest country according to Forbes.
              
              We all know Singapore is in the top ten when it comes to sovereign wealth funds but this doesnâ€™t register with the man in the street as the news that the country is the third richest in the world.
              
              Why, you may ask?
              
              Just ask yourself Do you feel really so rich that you face no anxiety over present and future monetary issues?
              
              Despite the outward appearances of a glittering and ultra-modern infrastructure, the average person is the grips of anxiety over money problems: rising costs of transport, education, healthcare, housing and food.
              
              Naturally, our ministers who pay themselves the highest ministerial salaries in the world for governing a mere 704 km2 or 272 sq mi, which is smaller than some Malaysian plantations, are mystified over these concerns.
              
              The extraordinary oddity is the fact that the third richest country has thousands of its senior citizens, some well into their 70s, toiling away in menial jobs as cleaners in eateries, shopping malls and toilets.
              
              In my travels in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia I observed that such cleaners are much younger people.
              
              China also faces the challenges of an ageing society but again cleaners are predominantly younger people.
              
              The older generation helped to lay the foundation for modern Singapore. Now that they are in their twilight years this government has largely forgotten them.
              
              This government, quick to reward themselves princely salaries, bonuses and pensions, have failed the older generation who have to continue in toiling at backbreaking jobs to survive.
              
              Shame!

              <p>Forbes is a business journal, what do you think it will protray and write? It is more toward business sense which ultimately unable to quantify it statistic but rather a promotion and advertising for business people and country alike.</p>
              <p>Unlike Times or business news, which is more neutral in a sense, Forbes is nothing but business entertainment news.For god sake, it didn't do a empirical study but base on GDP and per capital which is massaged by each country, especially financial centre country like singapore and luxembourg need to show inorder to attract more money into the banks here.</p>
              <p>GDP is the export we make, if it said 10% GDP growth this year, meaning $10 billions in export growth, 3% mean 3 billion and so on, negative GDP meaning more import than export, which is bad, like -1 to 2% during SARs period, meaning losing 1 to 2 billions, and this amount divided by the citizens, you get the Per capital, that is how they derive to the $72,000</p>
              <p>Per capital meaning per person on average earning per year, knn, nearly 800,000 singapore fall below that, from childrens to army to workers, so where does the bulk goes into, the top 10% super rich and the 20% richs, what we get is peanut, some not even hv peanut, but bolt and nuts. So much for equal distribution of wealth.</p>
              <p>If look at it, usually the country having less population (citizens) yet good in export (high GDP) will have a high per capital. For that matter, can you as a cabby earn 72,000 per year??</p>
