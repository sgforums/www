              <p>I am no loyal fan lah, just stating the fact lor.</p>
              <p>Like in some postings, BCL, TCL and ah pool all said when I return my merc to smrt, I'll get hamtum by them and smrt will inspect every inch of the car.</p>
              <p>But when I return all so smooth and quick except smrt said my bumper got scratches. So I do some on the spot polishing and that's it.</p>
              <p>Case closed and car return.</p>

              <p>Today drove CDG, along sembawang road, a call came in, reach only, saw a lady going to AP, asked her if she is on call, she said yes, then confirm if her name is Ms Lee, she said yes, so why she dun board my cab?? cos her phone got a different vehicle nos, then comfort Siao (not xiao) mei called me, Uncle, where are you? are you picking up the admiralty pax, another taxis is on the way. I was thinking, what the fuck, knn. Then tell her, I move off, let the other cab take, knn AP peak period at sembawang leh. Then as I was about to move out, she called again, said to pick up the pax, cos the other cabby scolded her.  So, i turn back and pick the lady. Now, how can one call get 2 cabs???</p>

                              <p>Have to admit that so many companies I drive for, CDG has the
              best on call, if you are CDG driver, make full use of it, dun hv to
              join any radio or walkie group, in fact, no intention to talk bad
              here, walkies and all these radios group are out of date or
              very soon, going out of date, with a smartphone, I can know nearly
              what is going on in singapore, confirmed or landed flights, also
              can receive call even if you drinking coffee or in toilet. To me,
              CDG is good when in a hot lazy afternoon when there are not much
              pax, just roam the condos and private houses, sure can get one.
              Moreover, you do not have to take the call if you dun want.</p>
              <p>Today drove CDG, along sembawang road, a call came in, reach
              only, saw a lady going to AP, asked her if she is on call, she said
              yes, then confirm if her name is Ms Lee, she said yes, so why she
              dun board my cab?? cos her phone got a different vehicle nos, then
              comfort Siao (not xiao) mei called me, Uncle, where are you? are
              you picking up the admiralty pax, another taxis is on the way. I
              was thinking, what the fuck, knn. Then tell her, I move off, let
              the other cab take, knn AP peak period at sembawang leh. Then as I
              was about to move out, she called again, said to pick up the pax,
              cos the other cabby scolded her.  So, i turn back and pick the
              lady. Now, how can one call get 2 cabs???</p>
