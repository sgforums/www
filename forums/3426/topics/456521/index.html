              <p>Taxi sudden braking</p>
              <p>Lady passenger claims hand fracture and wanted compensation</p>
              <p>Lady passenger didn't put on seat belt, taxi driver sudden braking at redlight, lady passenger claims that it caused her hand to be fractured and wanted compensation.</p>
              <p>Mr Liu, 55 yo, is a relief driver, on 21 June morning at 6.45am, picked up 2 retail passengers towards eastern part of the island. Before the journey commence, the warning alert for passenger to put on seat belt sounded but the passengers ignored the warning.</p>
              <p>When the cab passed through building, the traffic light suddenly turned red on two occasions and Mr Liu had frightened the passenger in sudden braking.</p>
              <p>Mr Liu said, "although the passengers were shocked but both continued to chat as if nothing had happened and they even joked with me".</p>
              <p>After the trip, one of the passenger alighted and Mr Liu bring the other passenger to the 2nd destination. The second passenger suddenly complained that her hand was fractured. </p>
              <p>"She paid the cab fare and was about to open the door and she suddenly turned and spoke to me in a strict tone, 'just now when you sudden brake, it caused my hand to fracture'", and after that she left the vehicle but didn't mention anything about compensation.</p>
              <p>A week later, Mr Liu received a call from taxi company saying that the lady passenger had lodged a complaint and wanted him to pay for medical fees. </p>
              <p>After the taxi company gathered the details from Mr Liu, he was requested to go to the company to make a report and he complied.</p>
              <p>Mr Liu said, "When submitting the report to the company's accident department, I clearly stated that they did not comply to safety instructions to wear safety belts and hence caused the accident. The warning is always given before the trip commencement. Driver normally will also remind front passenger to wear safety belt but due to concentrating on driving, will not be able to check on rear passengers". </p>
              <p>Mr Liu pointed out that the company is currently investigating the lady passenger's complaint to see if she is really injured. </p>
              <p>"if passenger ignored safety advice and did not wear safety belt, they should not insist compensation from the driver"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part 2</span></strong></p>
              <p>Taxi company mentioned, driver be prepared to pay thousand dollar compensation.</p>
              <p>Driver: This is not fair to me</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Taxi company mentioned that they have instructed driver to place $1000 accident deposit to the company so that if necessary, the comapny will be able to use it for compensation payment. Driver retaliated saying that this is not fair to him.</p>
              <p>Mr Liu said that he was very disappointed with the management outcome. He mentioned that the company should have some protection for them as drivers for the company. How can they simply just accede to the customer's unreasonable demand and wanted him to fork out the $1000 as compensation fee.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part 3</span></strong></p>
              <p>Taxi company: Standard procedure</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The taxi company pointed out that asking drivers to fork out a accident deposit in event of accidents is a standard procedure. It does not mean that the driver need to pay the compensation.</p>
              <p>Company spokes person answered the reporter saying that according to company's standard procedure, the company firstly will inform the driver to go make a report and following by investigation conducted by the insurance company as well as issuing a letter to driver requesting him to standby an accident deposit amount in case the accident is due to his fault and responsibilities. </p>
              <p>She said, "In this case, driver Mr Liu, only receive the company's letter informing him to prepare the accident deposit. It does not mean that he needs to pay for the compensation because the case is still ongoing. We are also getting in touch with the affected passenger".</p>

              <p>On the pax part</p>
              <p>1. safety belt was announced, but pax did not follow the instruction.</p>
              <p>2. fracture work in a way of immediate attention, meaning once you get fractured, the pain will sear throught the nerve system immediately that end up you can be screaming or crying in pain, but not this case, pax still chitchat and happily wait until wanting to drop, then feel or show the sign of it.</p>
              <p>On the cabby part</p>
              <p>1. Lack of alertness lead to emergency brake, he could be driving too fast or lack of alertness in the surrounding traffic lights.</p>

              <p>There is alway this misconcept that the company you work for will support you, this is not the case, remember, the company do not owe you a living, nor do you owe them one, the relationship is a business one, not a uncle and nephew one.</p>
              <p>I had seen so many Uncles saying I had work for them for many years, knows the Dros so well, even the boss also know me, now I got problem they ask me to prepare this and that, never help me. Very very disappointed.</p>
              <p>Therefore, in the first, you must understand your position with company, the company is a money making organisation, recognise $$ more than you. When no problem or time are good, all can chitchat and happily merry go round, then when it comes to the crunch, you felt betrayed. And that add on the frustration.</p>
              <p>So, it is important to know your rights, your position and the distance you should keep from this money making organisation, or so called capitalist</p>

              <p>In fact, car seat beat is a very costly belt, it go thru rigorous inspection before get passed, for private car, it cost about $400 to 500 if you want to change/install it, and as for taxis, the intangible cost is actually passed down to pax, if they do not use it, it is their waste.</p>

              <p><br>I think it all comes down to how much you want to show concern to the pax, The branding plays a part, "Comfort", if you as a pax, what will you expect from comfort?</p>
              <p>As for others, it is their company policies and culture on how much they want to listen and satisfy their pax. And in here, satisfying is not saying must give in to them, satisfying mean to have a proper system of complaining and hearing, follow by judgement as accord to the rules and regulations.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, if one is not satisfy, again, the system can call for civil suit</p>
