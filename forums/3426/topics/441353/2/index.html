              <p>Even with booking , it is not beneficial for us .</p>
              <p>Yes , if MBS $3 surcharge remains , i would pay ERP to go into just MBS .</p>
              <p>Not CBD taxi stand .</p>
              <p>So if every cabby think like me , MBS will be a Massive Car Park for Taxis !!!!!</p>

              <p>Once again i sense no logic here .... why 10pm where the people taking taxis are hottest ?</p>
              <p>If 10pm .... no peak hour surcharge , no CBD surcharge , just normal , but with MBS $3 surcharge .</p>
              <p>Then LTA and Comfort are creating another problem , turning MBS into a Massive car park as i can foresee all taxis will Q at MBS !!! For that $3 .</p>

              <p>Only thing , we dun chose specifically inside CBD .</p>
              <p>There will be more calls .</p>
              <p>Cos every commuter after 10pm , have a equal chance of getting a cab .</p>
              <p>The centre portion inside CBD or rather the whole of CBD , will face massive problems getting a cab .</p>
              <p>Cos we cabby always come in from outside of CBD into CBD .</p>
              <p>So we will sweep from outside to inside .</p>

              <p>maybe they can change CBD (city) surcharge to "ERP Surcharge" (not to be confused with erp charges).</p>
              <p>$2 or $3 erp surcharge, timimng in sync with erp hrs. Citycab used to levy cbd surcharge from 5-8 pm only before they merged with CDG.</p>

              <p>The ERP gantries is going to be remove once the GPS satelite ERP system which they are testing it now works to perfection. The changes will come inline with the new GPS ERP system, which is a totally different ball games. I heard there will be a widening of CBD area as financial and other services industrial business expand. Construction in Marina south is a big thing coming up, they just dig Asia City, which is the next financial district, bigger than suntec and marina FC join together.</p>
              <p>If today you go jurong industrial, you see those old companies being tear down, along jalan boon lay and those tukang satu to lima to,..quality road, new ones are in tuas, more high tech, more modern, and the financial centre in CBD will serve as their banking and corporate partners. This is no more a low cost old jurong industrial, it had moved up to knowledge base and skill base economy.</p>
              <p>So, the future of taxi driving, which is a service industry, looks good, but the problem now is, where to get so much cabbies?? with an aging population combine with a highly educated youngs who go for banking, casinos, hotel or financial job without even a look at taxi driving. Ask yourself, as Cabby, do you want your son to be a taxi driver, if yes, something must be wrong.</p>
              <p>Singapore govt are good in one thing, that is pre emptiveness, they alway plan ahead before anything happen, and they also have contingent plan if their plan A could not work. If the future looks good for the service industry like TD, they need to plan to get the right people in, and to get it, they hv to look at the X generation, from the 40s to the 70s, mostly will be within the 40 to 50 yo mark, those in the 30s are only a small percentage and most may switch job before 40s, and at 40s to 50s, most are stabled family men with the responsibility to raise school going if not Uni kids. Therefore, it is critical to raise the fares and at the same time, the variable surcharges to make TD more vibrant and acceptable as a professional, not as a trade for oldies or those who get retrenched or those who sick of working or those in debts. But if govt is thinking of recruiting FT as Foreign Taxis driver, which in NY, Canada and part of europe practice, then the locals like we here can kiss our asses</p>

              <p>I strongly urge govt insitution like e2i, learning hub or any other related insitution to upgrade the skills of Taxi drivers, make Taxi driving a profession like Japan and Britain, they are well respected. Having a taxi licence is, as you all will agree, as easy as ABC, on practical side, you can achieve it within 2 to 3 months, just like our Khoon did. However my suggestion is that taxi driver should be given a chance to upgrade to serve the public better, course like communication skills, public relationship and handling skill, basic human pyshology and tourism that include one more languages, or any other servicing course related should be TD should help taxi driver to move up the ladder of this profession, give those who manage to achieve it, be given certification and higher grade in TD, meaning he will be pay more in rebate for top class serving that help the relevant Taxi company he work in  to gain more respect and good reputation. Example, if e2i can come out with a japanese course, module can include basic japanese ethic, languages, manner, culture, way of their taxi system, their likes and dislike etc etc or even a trip of co payment to japan for study tour will in return help cabbies taking the course able to understand what is the need and requirement, and once they get jap customer, they can dispatch all these trained cabbies at a higher rates, in return, the Japs are happy to get a basic jap speaker who understand them, a higher rates for company and a higher income for the driver.</p>
              <p>This are just food for thought, many trades hv upgrading and skill developement sponsored by govt, especially those in their 40s are given free, but not taxi driver, die die also just a taxi driver with no grades</p>

              <p>Day shift , due to the nature most cabby wanted a normal working life , still most cabbies would not want to drive night and turned into a Vampire lifestyle for that little bit of difference .</p>

              <p>Replying to DAY SHIFT issues .....</p>
              <p>I really do not see a need to adjust anything other than the peak hour rate , which i thought many are like me , disapprove of 35% !</p>
              <p>So far only one driver i know openly said he love this 35% peak hour surcharge ..... and now he dun even drive peak hour .</p>
              <p>One key issue is ERP , ERP rates at some gantry are killing commuters during morning peak hours !</p>
              <p>Like CTE into town , scary sia all those gantries add up .</p>
              <p>LTA should changed their mindset now .</p>
              <p>To encourage fellow Singaporeans NOT TO DRIVE to work .</p>
              <p>They should encourage more to switch to Buses , Train , taxis .</p>
              <p>Taxis should be collected at net value at all gantries , regardless of timing .</p>
              <p>$1 .</p>
