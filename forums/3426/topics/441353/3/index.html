              <p>By right NTA, the national taxi association should be the one talking about all these for TD, not me, knn, all sleeping and take union fees, only work during election period. CCB, upgrade the TD, there is nothing to loose but more to gain, more productive, better services and image for companies and our country as a whole.

              <p>Psychologically speaking, once you are trained both in soft and academy skills, you feel more confident and take pride in your work, and you may end up taking a lifelong learning journey which benefit both you and the society as a whole. It will definitely makes you more vibrant in going back to class with buddies, otherwise, it will be the same old start engine, move on, pump, take pax, take call and go home count money, sleep and eat.

              <p><br> Yes, I believe we can get good pax if service is good, there are of
              course fullerton class and hotel 81 class, so to speak, but in a
              first country and going forward, people also expect good service
              taxis, our taxi fares are cheapo in comparing to most first world
              countries, we are taken for a ride, the car can improve and change
              for the better, but the driver also need to upgrade his skills and
              knowledge to adapt, once you are skilful, pax better pay some
              respect. Because we will be able to handle awkward situation and
              know the laws of our trade, which will be helpful for us to go thru
              with a course on Singapore public laws instead of agar agar you
              tell me, i tell you, he not sure, all these can help a driver
              better.</p>
              <p>By right NTA, the national taxi association should be the one
              talking about all these for TD, not me, knn, all sleeping and take
              union fees, only work during election period. CCB, upgrade the TD,
              there is nothing to loose but more to gain, more productive, better
              services and image for companies and our country as a whole. And
              even if TD end up throw key, he still got some relevant certificate
              to work on other trades, especially on service sector, which he can
              be chauffeur or velvet or company VIP  or any related
              trade such as tourist guide cum driver. </p>
              <p>Psychologically speaking, once you are trained both in soft and
              academy skills, you feel more confident and take pride in your
              work, and you may end up taking a lifelong learning
              journey which benefit both you and the society as a whole. It
              will definitely makes you more vibrant in going back to class with
              buddies, otherwise, it will be the same old start engine, move on,
              pump, take pax, take call and go home count money, sleep and eat.
              Which after 10 years, unless you are have the mentality like Bro
              Pool, who is a good activist, you may get a natural die out on this
              trade.</p>

              <p>I strongly urge govt insitution like e2i, learning hub or any
              other related insitution to upgrade the skills of Taxi drivers,
              make Taxi driving a profession like Japan and Britain, they
              are well respected. Having a taxi licence is, as you all will
              agree, as easy as ABC, on practical side, you can achieve it within
              2 to 3 months, just like our Khoon did. However my suggestion is
              that taxi driver should be given a chance to upgrade to serve the
              public better, course like communication skills, public
              relationship and handling skill, basic human pyshology and tourism
              that include one more languages, or any other servicing course
              related should be TD should help taxi driver to move up the ladder
              of this profession, give those who manage to achieve it, be given
              certification and higher grade in TD, meaning he will be pay more
              in rebate for top class serving that help the relevant Taxi company
              he work in  to gain more respect and good reputation. Example,
              if e2i can come out with a japanese course, module can include
              basic japanese ethic, languages, manner, culture, way of their taxi
              system, their likes and dislike etc etc or even a trip of co
              payment to japan for study tour will in return help cabbies taking
              the course able to understand what is the need and requirement, and
              once they get jap customer, they can dispatch all these trained
              cabbies at a higher rates, in return, the Japs are happy to get a
              basic jap speaker who understand them, a higher rates for company
              and a higher income for the driver.</p>
              <p>This are just food for thought, many trades hv upgrading and
              skill developement sponsored by govt, especially those in their 40s
              are given free, but not taxi driver, die die also just a taxi
              driver with no grades</p>
              </div>

              <p>upgrade = $ from td's pocket. in the end, meter still starts at $3.00 &amp; jumps $0.20, worth the effort, time??</p>
              <p>worst if they put more taxi on the road cos more people retrenched meaning more cabbies sharing the same pool of pax as now.</p>
