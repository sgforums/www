              <p><br>There are many sticky thread like how to operate taxi meter and so on, you can learn from there, be focus and smart, there is no such thing as unable to cover rental and fuel cost, if so, 28,000 cabbies would had throw key already, however, there is a thing call less earning or no earning. A car you call car, a taxis you call taxis, it operate differently</p>

              <p>Brudder, learning routes night and day is, in my opinion, something you have to learn ojt. Can't be help. You are thinking of first day jitters right? I have been driving weekend relief for 4 months now and still get first day jitters, but I just tell them I just started driving last week and keep saying sorry. They are usually quite nice and will say, don't worry, I will show you the way. But of course, basic routes you have to know, including the expressways and so on and so forth. I say daily should be able to cover basic rental, fuel and food plus a bit more when you just start, but with more experience, you should see your earnings go up.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, don't fret too much and just focus on your TVL and come to this forum to browse old threads. It will benefit you much. Take it easy brudder.</p>

              something you have to learn ojt. Can't be help. You are thinking of
              first day jitters right? I have been driving weekend relief for 4
              months now and still get first day jitters, but I just tell them I
              just started driving last week and keep saying sorry. They are
              usually quite nice and will say, don't worry, I will show you the
              way. But of course, basic routes you have to know, including the
              expressways and so on and so forth. I say daily should be able to
              cover basic rental, fuel and food plus a bit more when you just
              start, but with more experience, you should see your earnings go
              up.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, don't fret too much and just focus on your TVL
              and come to this forum to browse old threads. It will benefit you
              much. Take it easy brudder.</p>

              <p>To be honest, I got my TVL on mid Nov 11 and start relief one month later. Till date, me is lucky to find a hirer that let me drive weekend full only (Either Sat or Sun or both). In my first outing (Sat) i drove a while to pick up confidence and indeed the jitters is there. Although my first passengers (group of 4) don't the road (Poh Huat Road), they allow me to look at the Street Directory first before proceed. Thus lucky.</p>
              <p>After that pick up another 3 more and use for private purposes. So to be honest need to be polite and humble to passengers and they will guide you just like my remaining 2 trips.</p>
              <p>So, to start off as a relief is to gain experience unless you familiar with majority of road. Will be driving the coming weekend again but hopeful have good passengers and enough to cover my rental. Remember always ask the customer for their prefer route and ask them to guide if possible. Take care and concentrate on your TVLC first. Good Luck.</p>

              <p>From minister of lower profolio to high profile full minister .</p>

              <p>My last advice , as for OMO , the best is to get a taxi which gives you extreme low overheads .</p>
              <p>Low rental is one of the first criteria i put on top .</p>
              <p>Cos when u are sicko , off for that day , won't bite off your previous days salary .</p>
              <p>EP77 another example , sicko due to HFMD , still need to pay rental .</p>
              <p>Imagine u driving a Merc , @$127 , 3 days $381 in rental !!! Sick and not driving , bye bye $381 .</p>
              <p>Chrysler and sicko ? Bye bye $450 !!</p>
              <p>So how to curb such thing u cannot predict ?</p>
              <p>Get a lowest rental taxi ..... like Wish 1.8 , after calculating all including benefits , u pay roughly $78 in rental .</p>
              <p>Sick 3 days , not working , pay $234 nia ... still not too stiff .</p>
              <p>Actually can you find a Auto car at $78 rental ?</p>
