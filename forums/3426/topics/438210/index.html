              i really salute those uncles who had been driving taxi for more than 20 years n above. cos i cannot imagine whether i can do tat or not.
              
              cos driving taxi is never easy......... if u r not the kind who exercise regularly, driving taxi definitely wil a tk a toll on yr health.
              
              wat motivates u 2 continue driving other than earning $$$ n feeding yr family n yrself?
              
              after driving taxi for a few years, i still dun know whether i'm happy or not? 
              
              sometimes i see those uncles who r already in their late 60s, they stil struggle 2 drive n they r already quite weak n slow physically n i feel sorry for them.........
              
              would u drive til yr vocational lic expires when u r 73 ? let's say u pass yr medical checkup every year.......

              <p>TT said can drive until 75yo, shit men.</p>
              <p>Well, pyschologically speaking, no one, not even us have predicted that we would eventually become a TD as part of our life. So, I believe in the capacity of a TD, whose work is so unpredictable, as you do not know when you end up or what is going to happen tonite or today on the road, let the future thinks for itself. Unlike working, you can predict your salary, your promotion, your career aspect. I believe that by the time we reach 60s or 70s, things would had changed, and somehow, peoples still able to drive on, but certainly, not as chiong as now, maybe can make a profit of $30, keep car n go park/home sleep liao</p>

              10 or 20 years later, the taxi trade i tin wil change..........
              
              new taxi models will come n the taxi fare wil change...........
              
              Chrysler mayb expensive now but when i tin the taxi fare 10 years later wil surely b more expensive......
              
              tin there wil b many electric taxis or environment friendly taxis on the road..........
              
              in the future, mayb u nid 2 get a diploma or pass some customer service courses b4 u can get a taxi vocational lic.

              <p>Lat sunday, I took a taxi, the td was around 50 yr old, being driving for more than 20 yr old. He told me recently went for his checkup on his back bone, his lower backbone was a little bit bend and the tip hits his nerve causing pain while trying to get out of his taxi or bend down. That is due to 20+ yrs of long hour sitting in the taxi.</p>
              <p>Tell more, how he going to drive till 75 yr old if majority of the td has this problem?</p>
