              <p>Many kinds of jobs pay more than graduates. It is a myth that a good uni education is a good start to the job market. Having said this, of course I want my children to go to uni, unless they themselves refuse to go. Even then, its not the end. There are plenty of rich business people who got little to no education yet live in nice houses in nice districts.</p>
              <p>I ever fetched a cleaner a few months ago who became a millionaire after he started his own cleaning business. He lives in Thomson Lakeview area.</p>
              <p>What about Ah Du, the famous mandarin singer who was once a construction foreman.</p>
              <p>What about the many cabbies out there whose kids got into NUS and dated student doctors and lawyers? Its ok if we failed in life and became a cabby, just make sure next generation dont end up like us. I am sure there are doctors, lawyers, bankers and accountants whose parents were either hawkers or cabbies.</p>

              <p>Haha profound words but oh so true by f1taxidriver. Many of the post 65ers of sg grew up in a generation where "the paper is what gets you places". And then they worked so hard, some are lucky and they stay in a good job for the rest of their lives. Many others are deemed overpaid when they reach post 40s and then they wonder what they have actually studied so hard for.</p>
              <p>10 out of 10 baby boomer entrepreneurs in Indonesia do not even hold a degree or diploma and yet they're multi-millionaires. (Well, that's my estimate haha) Their children all enter universities as they mature into adults yet NONE want to be employees. That's the main difference in mentality between singaporeans and chinese indonesians....it's also vitally one which entrenches the status of å”�äºº (addressed as "teng lang" in hokkien) in Indonesia's history. Singaporean chinese? God knows in 30 years time with all the hungrier chinamen coming in.</p>
              <p>Speaking of that, I just met somebody from China who swam 8 hours to HK 30 years ago (illegal immigrant!!) to make his living and today he's the president of a jewellers association in Guangzhou. The hunger of chinamen, especially those in foreign countries knows no bounds.</p>

We S'porean dare to risk too, throw cigarette anyhow, use fake ID to go casino, drive like a f1 on the road.......!!!! Sorry to say that if  a Degree holder drive taxi will bring shame to their parents. If they are over 40plus, still can be accepted. They can use their knowledge for so many corporate industries here. For , those retrench ones, they must accept a lower pay if they change their trade to make end meets. If you can go so far in education, you should be very proud of yourselves. In every part of the world, there is still kids who were stuck with poverty and dun even has basic educations.</div>

              <p>Singapore though the govt claims it is first world, it is "FIRST WORLD" for the "First World" government and their cronies to get First World pay.    The rich also get first world pay.  The rest of us are Third World. </p>
              <p>Soon if this continues, locals will have to go overseas work as maids.</p>

              <p>Many kinds of jobs pay more than graduates. It is a myth that a good uni education is a good start to the job market. Having said this, of course I want my children to go to uni, unless they themselves refuse to go. Even then, its not the end. There are plenty of rich business people who got little to no education yet live in nice houses in nice districts.</p>
              <p>I ever fetched a cleaner a few months ago who became a millionaire after he started his own cleaning business. He lives in Thomson Lakeview area.</p>
              <p>What about Ah Du, the famous mandarin singer who was once a construction foreman.</p>
              <p>What about the many cabbies out there whose kids got into NUS and dated student doctors and lawyers? <span style="color: #ff0000;">Its ok if we failed in life and became a cabby</span>, just make sure next generation dont end up like us. I am sure there are doctors, lawyers, bankers and accountants whose parents were either hawkers or cabbies.</p>

              <p>Bro, objection, I do not think that life failed and became a cabby, for some, it can be reborn or life get better, some cabbies are rich fellow, they just drive to pass time, or at least keep themselves active, most are the older cabbies, even their childrens tell them to stop driving, they still go on the road for a few hours, if you said that they failed, no, they used their bare hands and brain to earn a living, they raise childrens to University who are filial piety to them, but they choose to be a cabby just because of one emotion...Happy</p>
