              once drivin is no prob, then comes those messy roads!
              
              wen starting to drive, always got lost or touring round &amp; round ard 'messy roads' such as:
              1) serangoon territory
              2) cbd areas
              3) bedok side
              4) tuas 
              5) ubi
              
              think its totally diff as delivery &amp; taxi profession. yes generally road routes knowledges shld be ok but comes to exact destination, think old birds cabbies r much more proficient. esp funnier places &amp; street names, or shorter routes, or even old hokkien nicknames for places by oldies passengers, experienced cabbies definitely boh la sa

              <p>My very first day on the road as a cabby already got involved in accident</p>
              <p>I still remember this lady board my crown from eunos mrt to ritz chalton</p>
              <p>knn ritz chalton where ar i also not sure....super green</p>
              <p>then when driving don't know why kiss the backside of a toyota altis oh shit i still remember this was the first thing i said after impact</p>
              <p>my mind was a blank....i drive for so many years never accident then drive taxi first day only kena liao omg</p>
              <p>lucky the force not that great...only a small dent on his altis</p>
              <p>i nego till $100 i compensate the owner,my own damage still have to pay sigh</p>
              <p>I stop at a car park take out my cig,tell myself it's over for me..I called my wife told her i will return the taxi to smrt,i don't dare to drive liao....haven earn $$$ already lose $$$...very very demoralising</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but that time really difficult to find a job so i picked myself up from pieces &amp; tell myself: I will give it a shot again,treat it as a learning exp...minor accident no issue</p>
              <p>turn out from car park a man flag me,"Go Imm" I press the meter &amp; i'm very happy,cos i always go imm so i'm confident...This particular imm trip really was a turning point,it really let me felt alot more confident...till today i still rem the fare was $19.60...fucking happy when i got the 2 pieces of $10 from the pax,seems like hell lots of money</p>

              <p>thanks for all the sharing and the kindness, at least now everyone, 
              not just 
              myself, can find some common rapport (and more importantly, solace) here
               not readily available even with the most expensive counseller (who 
              NEVER drove a cab for much needed living). Though the bad 
              news is almost everyone has their own sad stories, but now that they are out in the open, they instead become everyone's good 
              news, becos now everyone knows that everyone else is also not born a saint from the 1st min! Everyone is HUMAN.</p>
              <p>i will just add 3 things here.</p>
              <p>right after i started this thread (about my phobia), immediately 
              something happened but i
              do  know its not my entirely fault. I dont blame myself but at the same time I dont feel good either. what i dont know is if 
              its really suay or sixth sense. or both.</p>
              <p>secondly, i heard someone
               mention starting off omo make $5. but strangely i made over $100 (now 
              its almost $150) for 
              the few days i started..my friends and family find it 
              strange when i tell them for some reason, I always manage to pick up the
               next passenger either at the same place I dropped off the previous one 
              or just around the next bend, the next building, or the next junction. 
              even if i 
              wait around or join a queue (which I only do so becos I am tired and wants to take a breather to sort some loose ends), always in less than 5min, someone will 
              automatically 
              come up, sometimes i also dont know which direction they come from until
               they suddenly open the door suddenly and i look up into the mirror to 
              see who...or is all 
              this just beginner's luck?</p>
              <p>last bit. about the way i express myself. i applied to the University of London to undertake their Bachelors of Law degree for distance learning and on location study. I was offered a 2yrs graduate entry for the former. and a full 3yrs on campus study for the latter. I know the 2yrs here is not really the same as the 3yrs on campus one, I really wanted to drop everything and fly over blind for 3yrs. But as i said. everyone is human. I really dont know what will happen after I finish paying for the 1st air ticket to go over. and maybe after the first month rent. and I cant drop everything yet. at least for another 1-2yrs. And after going through all that, there is still no assurance if my paper chase will pay fruition given I am a late bloomer. As for coming to driving, I always face a common problem at work. If I sound better than the seniors, somewhere someone will throw me out. If I sound better than the juniors, somewhere someone will throw me out. At the end of the day, I am neither here nor there. I never figure out how I should sound exactly so that everyones happy, so I chosed to move on.</p>

              <p>sgcabby, yeah i'm the one who made $5 on my first few days. means collection is around $150, deduct ~ $145 rental + diesel and i take home 5 miserable bucks. NOW if you're making $150 (means nett, not collection?) then you don't have any problem at all. now as a dayshift driver, i take home $150 only on good days, $130 is the average. but this month dam solid, got more than $200 takehome pay. enuf said.</p>
              <p>as what xbird said, just drive, don't think about accidents happening. these things have a life of their own if you dwell too much on them. the most important thing is to swallow your pride and accept the status quo. with acceptance, the driving part will become easy as you become relaxed. no point dwelling on the past. good luck.</p>
