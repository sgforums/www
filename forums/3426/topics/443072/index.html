              <p>A few weeks ago I took a cab from the taxi stand just outside of my condo. As I jumped in, another taxi further down the road started horning at us and flashing his lights, but we didn't take notice and my cab driver drove on.</p>
              <p>As we were driving, not too long later, the same cab driver, that was horning and flashing at us, drove towards our cab, cut into the front of us, and stopped. We had to stop as well since our way was blocked.</p>
              <p>The cab driver jumped out and was scolding at us in Mandarin. When my cab driver unwind his window, he was shouting in Mandarin saying stuff like 'you eat my dinner is it?' 'you want to eat my money?'</p>
              <p>And then he looks at me and says 'F you oso'</p>
              <p>He walks off and drive away.</p>
              <p>I was bought shocked and concerned, because since he stopped his cab right infront of us, we could have crashed into his, causing an accident, putting my life in danger.</p>
              <p>I have his number plat and would like to take a law suit against him for his actions, suiting every penny he has.</p>

              legal fees. And my legal counsel only need to send him a letter and
              attend a mediation session at sub court with the district judge and

She initially agree so I get all the documents ready but she last min back out. So I sign on her behalf and get the credit line.

              <p>She is in the Air Force and I am in the Navy so his officer cannot ask me over to investigates that's how the SAF legal department steps in.

So in the end they conclude that a crime is committed and handover the matter to my CO which he can just conduct a summary trial and fine me and close the case. But hor you know me lah. I always kuai lan with people especially him so he says hor....this is a serious case so he recommend me for court martial....Very KNN one right?
