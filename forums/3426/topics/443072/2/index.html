              <div>We have a legal case against the cab driver. We have
              been able to track down, through Comfort's assistance, the cab
              driver's details, and the cab that was giving me a lift that night
              had graciously offered to stand as a witness.</div>

              <p>You mean you and your legal counsel have not establish a case yet? You want help you can ask me lah. I can provide you free legal advise and help you establish a case for you. I myself also cannot tolerate such nonsense. I just came back from CDG lodging a complain against one of their driver for dangerous driving act.</p>
              <p>I dunno to say whether your are a smart person or guillible one. From your observation of my posting online you can deduce what kind of person I am. Still water runs deep, never judge a book by it's cover....</p>
              <p>Serious if you want can meet up with me. You tell me what actually happen I can tell you what to do. Drinks on you of course lah....<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>But you still think I am uneducated then ok loh I got nothing to say.</p>
              <p>But one think I need to advise you. To win a legal battle is not about evidence, truth....But is see who have the better lawyer and who have the dough to last the entire battle....So if you confident you have more dough then the bugger and can engage a better lawyer then him go ahead.</p>
              <p>But hor...have to warn you there is also alot of millionaire around and you will not know loh.....</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sex on the first date almost appears to be on the menu, after
                                      dinner and drinks. It has become extremely easy in Singapore, when
                                      90% of the first dates turns into a sexual encounter as well.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Perhaps it's because of stress, a more open culture, lack of
                                      committed relationships, or just pure fun.</span></p>
              <p>But hor you seem to be not willing to pay the dinner and drinks for the girl that you can bonk 90% of the time. Still asking Robin818 for advise on free bonk?</p>

              <div>I am not even buying your fairy tale, macho man, story of how you been to win $7k from someone else. Sounds too 'good' for someone as silly as yourself.</div>
              <div>Update</div>
              <div>We have a legal case against the cab driver. We have been able to track down, through Comfort's assistance, the cab driver's details, and the cab that was giving me a lift that night had graciously offered to stand as a witness.</div>
              <div>If we are able to prove his intention was indeed to stop infront of us and block our path, we are able to prove his intention was not less than criminal.</div>
