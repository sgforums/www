              Ruthless , maybe .
              
              Force to take call , yes .
              
              Taxi companies charge levy for every booking , a handsome profit every year . The taxi starting fare and distance fare was set at so low margin , make us grap a call to make up for the lost .
              
              In between , they get a profit of $0.30 - $0.40 from the levy .

              I take TransCab for example .
              
              Previously , on Sunday , before they lift the MBS $3 surcharge from 6am - 11.50pm . 
              
              We aren't interested in their Sunday booking ($2.50 before $0.40 levy ) .
              
              What call we also never interested , cos only $2.50 .
              
              We just go MBS collect $3 surcharge .
              
              We made $0.90 more .
              
              The when they realized they aren't making enough , upon pressure from LTA for that so call Service Standard , they took out that MBS surcharge that forced us to take call to make up for that lost of MBS surcharge .
              
              In the end , day shift kena . . . night shift they bo pian , after 5pm , CDB got surcharge until 12mn .
              
              If they do not take out that particular MBS surcharge , their revenue drop , revenue dropped nevermind , will also fail that Service Standard on Booking , will get a fine one by LTA .
              
              So who's fault ?
              
              Main culprit LTA , follow by taxi companies . Because LTA fine taxi companies , to avoid getting fine , they need to come out with a fare structure , to protect them getting fine by LTA .
              
              If LTA do not fine taxi companies , most of the revenue will go to us instead , so who's fault ?

              That is why , during 2009 after MBS started operational , Comfort n Citycab do not have that MBS $3 surcharge , whereas other taxi companies has got it .
                  
              So why Comfort Citycab dun have ?
                  
              Very obvious , if they have that $3 MBS surcharge for their drivers , their $2.50 booking who going to take ?
                  
              Sure die one .
                  
              DO they care about their drivers ? 
                  
              Nope , they cared about that levy instead .

              <p>Eventhough u have minds of your own, living in this society is tough. So many factors/policies affecting our life and we sometime have to do thing out of our minds too. But most imptly, you must know your limit and not è¿‡åˆ†è¿‡å¤´.</p>

              <p>Dun forget we have dependants and that really brought us down to earth. Being modest and live a simple life is the  key to the survival in the society. For as long you dun see colour, race or religion as a problem , we sure can overcome the difficulties  in this modern era. And should we overcome these problems  it makes us grew stronger.

              <p>Maslow is a professor in managment who said that peoples have their needs and ambitious, it takes a good leader or manager to identify it and bring the best out of them, on the hand, individual can also put himself up to a state of achievement. However, all these motivation can diminish when the needs are not met.</p>
              <p>Example, if you are a crown driver, you think of driving a sonatas or wish, given the good opportunities, you move up, then you want to drive limo, maxi, pte limo and so on, each platform must provide the motivation for one to move up, one must see the good and the needs to move up, taxi management must provide the conducive enviroment to upgrade it driver and provide care, once this is met, people will excel and climb up the hierrachy ladder to be the best cabby. This is call Maslow laws of motivation, because he understand that human wants to excel, but you need to met their need before they can excel to the next platform and so on.</p>
              <p>But sad to say, taxi companies and govt LTA take more care of themselves, there is not enuf support and motivation to bring out the best of a cabby, if you like my hirer driving a crown for years, sure get bore and low in morale, it takes alot of self motivation to bring one up the ladder of achievement.</p>

              <p>Well said. This is also what I have in my mind too. To be honest, I hope every industry also can allow simplicity for suvivial, but not that practical in SIngapore only the minority.
