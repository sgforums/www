              <p>Be very careful, my firends mother also died of stomach illness,
              a few years after her op.</p>
              <p>My own brother died of a 1mm diameter hole in his stomach.</p>
              <p>So stomach illnesses are no joke.</p>
              <p>Be very careful from now on.</p>
              <p>I not concerned abt whether you do your CS or not, that is a
              joke among forummers after all, but I bit concerned about your
              pro-PAP stance since you got medical illness. Do you know how
              expensive it is at hspitals and folllow up?</p>
              <p>While nobody expects a free meal, your PAP has done very little
              to curb runaway health and after-care costs. I know many who lost
              all their savings to rising medical bills, there's only so much
              insurance, medisave and medicare can do, you got no money, it's
              really a slog.</p>
              <p>If you really like the PAP, that's your choice but I think you
              should go see your PAP Ministers and MPs to help out your medical
              costs and see whether they walk the walk or just talk the talk.</p>

              <p>Sometime, you cannot use bullet on them, you must also understand that there are a group of TDs who are unable to mix with the society due to slowness in neuro function not up the extend of going to Buangkok green, but still able to depend on themselves to make a living without bordering others much.</p>
              <p>I will not put it into a clear straight meaning to it, but if you are experience enough, you should know that some TD are abit handicap on their behavorial and brain cell function, and that is also why they end up as TD. But I hv to qualify that I am not tarnishing the image of TD, for I am also one of them.</p>

              <p>Ah Guan is correct about doctors and wards.</p>
              <p>That's the good thing about Singapore hospitals, you get to see the best or whoever undeerstands you best, irrespective of wards. You get the same procedures as well, rich or poor.</p>
              <p>I have been to hospital 3 times, once for a broken leg and I got to see some Indian professor at Alexandra (I forget his name), he was at the time the premier orthopaedic surgeon in Singapore and many future surgeons were taught by him.</p>
              <p>Then I broke my hand and needed surgery in 2002, I got to see Dr Inderjit Singh at SGH, he was also very good and was treating national footballers with their fractures as well.</p>
              <p>In 2007, I had a gall bladder operation at TTSH, this time is was the MO supervised by a senior colleague. I also got no complaint, the doctor being new was very thorough and caring.</p>
              <p>I never got to stay at ward higher than B2, in fact actually dont mind C, I believe you always should go for the best -A1 or the most common - C.</p>
              <p>Their is nothing wrong with our hospitals and the treatment is fair to all, we ge the best equipment and access to best medical officers.</p>
              <p>Really ours is so much better, you try public hospitals in the UK or US (I have sisters there) and compare to ours, then you know how good we are. Dont talk about rest of ASia, even royalty in Asia want to come here.</p>
              <p>The problem lies with runaway costs and follow up, after my ops I think I only went for 1 follow up, because it was just to expensive to keep coming back for reviews. That time I mata, dont say, all free, 100 times also can. Now a basic 1 will set you back around $300-400.</p>
              <p>Ah Guan will have this problem again, and need to see doctors, the point is there must be some way to assist in costs without depleting our little savings.</p>
              <p>Thats my only real complaint about medical care here</p>

              <p>Brother, I think you are referring to the Late Professor N Balachandran, He was a very humble man, treated patients from single wards to C class wards. According to my professor, The Late Professor N Balachandran never believed in the so called "Caste" System.... He treated all patients equally, providing the best he could have offered to all of his patients.</p>
              <p>Recently, a scholarship was launched under his name, to train the future generation of orthopaedic surgeons.</p>
