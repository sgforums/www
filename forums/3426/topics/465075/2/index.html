              <p>You got stomach cancer, you have all my best wishes for a happy and speedy recovery.</p>
              <p>Be very careful, my firends mother also died of stomach illness, a few years after her op.</p>
              <p>My own brother died of a 1mm diameter hole in his stomach.</p>
              <p>So stomach illnesses are no joke.</p>
              <p>Be very careful from now on.</p>
              <p>I not concerned abt whether you do your CS or not, that is a joke among forummers after all, but I bit concerned about your pro-PAP stance since you got medical illness. Do you know how expensive it is at hspitals and folllow up?</p>
              <p>While nobody expects a free meal, your PAP has done very little to curb runaway health and after-care costs. I know many who lost all their savings to rising medical bills, there's only so much insurance, medisave and medicare can do, you got no money, it's really a slog.</p>
              <p>If you really like the PAP, that's your choice but I think you should go see your PAP Ministers and MPs to help out your medical costs and see whether they walk the walk or just talk the talk.</p>
