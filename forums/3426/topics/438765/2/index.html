              <p>There is something wrong with this perception in our society. People like to or feel great to begin verbally abusive over their little unhappiness.

              <p>Yes, one can still choose to be unhappy out of the best, if one unable to translate the unhappiness gentlely, please "walk away". The great wisdom you have experience thereafter, will then make you so proud to share with others.  </p>

              <p>Took advance booking 6:50am to AP. Stupid pax come down at 7:05am load up luggage. Still ask me wait for wife and kid 7:10am then move off. KNN I F him upside down. Ask him if no need a cab that early dun book so early. KNN the timing very important to me. Traffic condition before and after 7am totally different. Queuing time also different at AP. This 20mins delay cost me $$$ leh. End up reach AP he offer to tip me $10 I ask him F off. I dun need that $10.</p>
              <p>Why I F him leh got 2 reasons.</p>
              <p>1. He is of a certain race and yes I AM RACIST.</p>
              <p>2. Second incident in 2 days. Yesterday also took one 4:25pm to AP from town. KNN the bell boy load up luggage and tell me wait until 4:45pm because the guest IS HAVING A DRINK AT THE BAR. Yesterday I good mood so nevermind so they are spared my Fking.</p>
              <p>While waiting I dun on meter because it is against the law and I dun want to appear to be so cheapo for a few dollars more.</p>

              <p><br>Brother, racist should be kept inside, we must look at thing objectively, our purpose is to make money, you can said something about the time factor, not race is a very sensitive issue, I also can be a racist to certain people, but during driving, be professional enough, do not let personal emotion and feeling be put into driving, it will cause you more problem. Once bags or anything is loaded into the taxi, that is when you can press the meter, it is your rite. You can charge them as per waiting time.</p>

              <p>I dare to admit I am a racist then I am prepared to accept the negative remarks. But in the first place it's that certain race that do so many LJ tai chi that make me a racist against them. This is not built up overnight. Since my navy days until before I turn in to full time TD. I work with so many people of the certain race especially those come from their home town type all pattern alot one. Locals ok in fact I have a few good friends whom themselves dislike their own race from the home country. So actually I only partial racist lah.</p>
              <p>Agree with some of the bros says. We are treated like shit. But not all lah. Most pax are ok one. Of course those nice ones I give good service lah. If I dun reciprocate then something is wrong with me liao. So not always I F my pax ok! Only those deserved to be F.</p>
              <p>I dun anyhow pass my fustrations to innocent people. So dun think I am like giving TDs a bad name leh.</p>

              hammer bro, careful i am not so worried about your temper or your pax. i am more worried because you seem to have a lot of frustrations pent up inside. maybe you dont feel it, but outsiders like us can sense it from your expressions even if you might not mean it word for word. i worry all these stuck inside, can surface at wrong time wrong place wrong people, its one giant volcano. i know because i see it many times.
              
              i suggest, maybe take a break or pick up a new interest that take up most of your excess attention.
