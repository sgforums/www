Ask him if no need a cab that early dun book so early. KNN the timing very important to me. Traffic condition before and after 7am totally different. Queuing time also different at AP. This 20mins delay cost me $$$ leh. End up reach AP he offer to tip me $10 I ask him F off. I dun need that $10.</p>

              <p>1. He is of a certain race and yes I AM RACIST.</p>
              <p>2. Second incident in 2 days. Yesterday also took one 4:25pm to AP from town. KNN the bell boy load up luggage and tell me wait until 4:45pm because the guest IS HAVING A DRINK AT THE BAR. Yesterday I good mood so nevermind so they are spared my Fking.</p>

              <p>since luggage on board, just take it that passenger also on board. just turn on the meter lah. If they can afford to go drink at the bar, surely they can afford to pay the extra waiting charge.</p>
              <p>and be nicer to the AP bell boys lah. they even worse, work for free you know? Their income comes solely from tips.</p>

              <p>Took advance booking 6:50am to AP. Stupid pax come down at 7:05am load up luggage. Still ask me wait for wife and kid 7:10am then move off. KNN I F him upside down. Ask him if no need a cab that early dun book so early. KNN the timing very important to me. Traffic condition before and after 7am totally different. Queuing time also different at AP. This 20mins delay cost me $$$ leh. End up reach AP he offer to tip me $10 I ask him F off. I dun need that $10.</p>
              <p>Why I F him leh got 2 reasons.</p>
              <p>1. He is of a certain race and yes I AM RACIST.</p>
              <p>2. Second incident in 2 days. Yesterday also took one 4:25pm to AP from town. KNN the bell boy load up luggage and tell me wait until 4:45pm because the guest IS HAVING A DRINK AT THE BAR. Yesterday I good mood so nevermind so they are spared my Fking.</p>
              <p>While waiting I dun on meter because it is against the law and I dun want to appear to be so cheapo for a few dollars more.</p>
