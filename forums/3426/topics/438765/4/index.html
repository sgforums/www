              <p>Agree with some of the bros says. We are treated like shit. But
              not all lah. Most pax are ok one. Of course those nice ones I give
              good service lah. If I dun reciprocate then something is wrong with
              me liao. So not always I F my pax ok! Only those deserved to be
              F.</p>
              <p>I dun anyhow pass my fustrations to innocent people. So dun
              think I am like giving TDs a bad name leh.</p>

              <p>I fully support you 100%. Everyone has some form of racism in them.  Even though same,  they are my last choice and 95% I will never pick them up. Even during peak period, midnight sometimes also refuse.</p>
              <p>Actually this is not fully racism it's called stereotyping. As a former policeman, I can tell you, ordinary citizens may think of ex-criminal as part of yellow ribbon project blah blah, but policeman cannot afford to do so. Policeman must consider all ex-convicts with suspicion and trust is only based on results.</p>
              <p>These particular ppl you don't like, I don't blame you. They bring in their values from their country and want us to follow. They say 2 mins means 30 mins? Like that can arh? Cannot what. They have system where ppl are classed according to social status, do we practise that here? Of course there are some instances, but even then it's not done openly, there it's comon practise. To them we are low class, just drivers, we must wait for them. They are paying what.</p>
              <p>Our time, our window to earn money is nothing to them. So long as we send them there at whatever time to their convenience, if they want to complete a journey that takes 20 mins in in 40 mins, just too bad, we must tahan. Talk cock sing song right? They pay $10 expect $20 service, Fair or not?</p>
              <p>I dont have  problem with locals, unless the drunk type, but then again all drunks are trouble in our line, whatever race you are.</p>
              <p>A Singaporean working in an office, would definitely want to finish work at 5.30pm and rush home. But they are cunning, pretend do extra work (OT) until 8pm or 10 pm, then book cab, come late as usual and pay by card because stupid Singapore company is cheap, their salary is lower, so company can afford to absorb their taxi fare.</p>
              <p>It's they who behave this way and cause ppl like you and me to react accordingly. If they never spoil market, behave decently, we also do likewise. They spoil market and cast a bad light on their whole country or race, we are unable to tell the good from the bad, so play safe avoid altogether.</p>
              <p>If this is what's called racism, just too bad. We didn't create this system, it's Singapore companies, the Govt and they themselves who have made us xenophobic. But I am not a racist neither are you in the true sense of the word. We don't see ourselves as superior human beings, we don't curse them or their kids in the streets, we don't ask for violence against them, we don't mean any harm to them, it;s just that we choose not to entertain them based on past patterns of behaviour by a majority of them.</p>

              <p>Personally, I do stereotype certain people myself, so are many here, everyone is sure to hate someone here and there, but once we sit on the cab, ply our trade on the road, we should be professional enough to on our main objectives, that is to ferry peoples from point A to point B, regardless of who they are as long as our service rendered is being paid accordingly as stipulated by the laws.</p>
              <p>However, after certain years of pattern, you come to know what to pick and what not to pick, it is all up to you, but as long as you are in green, available for flag down, you pick up the passenger, you have to do your duty regardless if you like or do not like him or her. The simplicity here is if pax respect you, you respect him or her double, otherwise, careless who or what type of people they are, I will just ignored them, and if they keep trying to pester or disturb me, then I will warn them, if still insist, then, too bad, fark them.</p>
              <p>But first and foremost, as service people on the road, we must know who we are, there are different hats to wear in a day life, in family, you might wear the son or father hat if you are a father, in kopitiam chitchatting, you can wear a buddies relaxing hat, but when you are wearing a taxi Hat driving a taxi, you main objective is to make money out of ferrying peoples</p>
