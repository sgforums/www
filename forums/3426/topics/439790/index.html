              <p>There are two type of motivation, instrinsic and extrinsic motivation.</p>
              <p>$$ is an extrinsic motivation, external kind of motivation, although this kind of motivation do really motivate a person up, but it will not last long, once $$ is gone or no more relevant, the motivation factor start to decrease. It can come from everything, from pax tips to companies policy, example if a cab company offer a good rental price with rebates, people are motivated, because $$ is involved, they can save more, but as times goes by, with increase in fuel prices, lowering of rebates, high cost of living, peoples start to find it normal and the motivation factor start to depreciate.</p>
              <p>Family, emotion and mindset form the instrinc kind of motivation, this type of motivation last very long, because there is something permanently to look forward to, the mindset and emotion get motivate whenever that something and not money is attained. Like example, our Pool, his motivation derives from wanting his family to live good, happy and togetherness, very good indeed. So, for him, a strike a good balance between driving and family time. Money is of course also important, but it come secondary in comparing to his family. By caring and making his family as a motivation factor in his heart, he ultimately will have to motivate himself look for money and do other neccessary thing to support the family. And as long as his inner mind is motivate by his family, he most likely stay motivated.</p>
              <p>We as TD, should therefore put instrinic motivation as our tool in our daily driving, and extrinsic motivation as secondary, meaning to say, if have $$ is of course good, do not have, also nevermind, as long as we drive for our family and oursleves, we are motivated.</p>
