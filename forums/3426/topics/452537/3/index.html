              <p>Newbies : These old bird can talk like that, you know why?</p>
              <p>cos they already there!</p>
              <p>ask them to tell u how long they need to learn, how much
              sacastic remarks they got from their pax cos they dunno they way.
              They many unneccesay mistake they made to learn. Is it really
              necessay?</p>
              <p>From my using this GPS for 3 months, the feeling is like someone
              like Poolman transfering all his "Chi" or skill into me in one
              single breath. A GPS is as good a 10 years those old bird need to
              knock and burn on the road to get it.</p>
              <p>I dun have to depend on my pax's mood to guide me.</p>
              <p>Contra to what u say Poolman, the GPS shows me so many routes
              that I can take to a certain destination. This is something that I
              need a long time to learn as I am driving alone and dun have a
              senior next to me to teach me that. The next time, I know that
              route, so I dun need to use it anymore.</p>
              <p>Taking calls, be it advance or current or even street job is a
              breeze. U be surprised lots of ppl knows their postal code, even
              Ang mohs. Just enter code and go.</p>
              <p>Feedback from my pax:</p>
              <p>A)They should make every taxi have this thing. Most taxi driver
              doesn't know where we stay and we got to tell them each and
              everything.</p>
              <p>B) I been here at least 5 times and most taxi driver got problem
              in getting here.</p>
              <p>C) from one ang moh in a jest: Hey, u cheating! like that
              everyone including me can be taxi driver. Just follow the
              instruction and go.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>GPS not only show me how to get there, usually yr pax can help
              direct u there but what happen after they alight? u got lost in
              their area, especially those small roads in landed property. GPS
              leads me out anytime.</p>
              <p>The "FUEL" icon is especially useful for me. It doesn't show me
              where to pump diesel. Wherever I am, if I need to go to "pee", I
              just activate that icon and it will bring me to my nearest
              "toilet".</p>
              <p>I used my "DIESEL" icon to show me where is the nearest of our
              17 diesel kiosk that I can pump, wherever I am.</p>
              <p>I used the "CASH" icon to bring me to the nearest atm if my pax
              needs with withdrawn money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course I know my brain should be the best GPS, but until
              then, I not trading my Garmin for anything else.</p>
              <p>Anyway, at 55, how many years I have to live? Why taxed my brain
              so much? So what if I will use my GPS for the rest on my life? I
              rather spend the time to learn something else.</p>
              <p>Know something? It's equvalent to like ppl still prefer to do
              mental calculation even tho they got a calculator in hand.</p>
              <p>If now I am in my 30s, maybe still make some sense.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Wah bro BJ you 55 this year? I thought you in your mid or late 40s nia. What's your secret of staying young?</p>
              <p>GPS I agree is useful tool. I swear by it to help me locate ulu ulu places. BUT NOT ROUTING because they will bring you go HOLLAND. Tanglin Halt to Redhill must go by CTE? Sounds familiar? Lol</p>
              <p>How I use it simple. Just key in address and show the map. No need press GO. At least agar agar you see the place you will know how to go there. And when the vehicle is near the vicinity it will shows me where is my taxi with respect to the destination. Simple as that.</p>

              <p>From Bukit Batok , he want to come to CCK Ave 4 .</p>
              <p>OK GPS sent him using Bukit Batok West Ave 5 , which is correct .</p>
              <p>But . . . at Bukit Batok Road junction , cross of Bukit Batok West Ave 5 .</p>
              <p>GPS told him to turn right !!! Which is not wrong , but it's not right either !</p>
              <p>Which the correct way is going straight onto Brickland Road !</p>
              <p>Becos CCK Ave 4 via Brickland Road , it's the fastest and cheapest !</p>
              <p>Imagine if i was the pax , nasty one , once u turn tight , i started hurling missiles at you for going long route , waste time bla bla bla , big round .</p>
              <p>In the end , very unpleasant situation .</p>
