              that I can take to a certain destination. This is something that I
              need a long time to learn as I am driving alone and dun have a
              senior next to me to teach me that. The next time, I know that
              route, so I dun need to use it anymore.</p>
              <p>Taking calls, be it advance or current or even street job is a
              breeze. U be surprised lots of ppl knows their postal code, even
              Ang mohs. Just enter code and go.</p>
              <p>Feedback from my pax:</p>
              <p>A)They should make every taxi have this thing. Most taxi driver
              doesn't know where we stay and we got to tell them each and
              everything.</p>
              <p>B) I been here at least 5 times and most taxi driver got problem
              in getting here.</p>
              <p>C) from one ang moh in a jest: Hey, u cheating! like that
              everyone including me can be taxi driver. Just follow the
              instruction and go.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>GPS not only show me how to get there, usually yr pax can help
              direct u there but what happen after they alight? u got lost in
              their area, especially those small roads in landed property. GPS
              leads me out anytime.</p>
              <p>The "FUEL" icon is especially useful for me. It doesn't show me
              where to pump diesel. Wherever I am, if I need to go to "pee", I
              just activate that icon and it will bring me to my nearest
              "toilet".</p>
              <p>I used my "DIESEL" icon to show me where is the nearest of our
              17 diesel kiosk that I can pump, wherever I am.</p>
              <p>I used the "CASH" icon to bring me to the nearest atm if my pax
              needs with withdrawn money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course I know my brain should be the best GPS, but until
              then, I not trading my Garmin for anything else.</p>
              <p>Anyway, at 55, how many years I have to live? Why taxed my brain
              so much? So what if I will use my GPS for the rest on my life? I
              rather spend the time to learn something else.</p>
              <p>Know something? It's equvalent to like ppl still prefer to do
              mental calculation even tho they got a calculator in hand.</p>
              <p>If now I am in my 30s, maybe still make some sense.</p>
