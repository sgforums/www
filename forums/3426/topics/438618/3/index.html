              <p>Bros, no offend, as a seaman, i travelled to south america, america, africa and part of russia beside all those normal europe and east asia, it will surpirse you that in south america, people still do not know where and what is singapore, most know HK, and think singapore is part of malaysia or even china, it is people like Filipe massa or those south america F1 driver that is here, help to put us in their radar, LIVE. In San Francisco, and las vegas, when i show people a $1 singapore coins to prove this country exist, they wanted to collect it as memorable item, they alway think we are china or part of malaysia and indonesia, worst are the russian, beside seamen, most on the northern side dun even know malaysia, they knew indonesia due to it population and terrorism existence.</p>
              <p>Today, europe is down, US of A is down, Asia will also be drag down, it is only the south america, the brazil, agentina, chile, peru are booming, it is a big market there, keppel is in brazil, sembcorp is having offices all over there, E. Goh keep visiting them. As a resourceless country, we need to promote ourselves, with our current image of SIA gals, you can forget about it, you have to agree with me, any PRC gals or viet gals can be much better than them, I took lots of SIA crews, and surprise me most gals are thai, jap, taiwan and malaysia, only a few singaporean aunty doing supervison job. Therefore we need to promote our cities, that is why lots of international event, even at a lost, is still good for singapore, because of the advertisment which is free and live.</p>
              <p>F1 needs money, singtel and many are sponsor of it, including johnnie walker, my favorite, this is a professional sport. Now you tell me, does the drivers prefer a full rally circuit or a city circuit which they cannot see far as all corner and road are barricaded, just like if you are a footballer, do you like to play in a nice stadium field or at the padang with many on lookers and nothing sort of a grand stadium? There is alot of money pour in to attract them here, it helps to market singtel too, for me, I will prefer a subang circuit than a night cities race that is more of a merry making party cum entertaining than a real pro challenge.</p>

              <p>The abolish of changi circuit is not as simple as thought to be, no funds??? no funds???but got funds for Youth olympic and nite race in cities??</p>
              <p>In a business mind, who care much about F1?? professional sport are more on making money, betting and superstars. Let look at it if F1 is to move to a new changi circuit, what will happens, you still can in Shikira all all those superstar singers and entertainers?? are you sure singaporeans or even foreigners will go to a ulu changi?? or what is so different between circuit and the other circuit of the world?? why when F1 goes to subang, they are not so popular. Why singapore so much fuss? all because we are the first night city race in the world, that is the different, and that is what people will take note and wanted to come or watch it live.</p>

                      them. As a resourceless country, we need to promote ourselves, with
                      our current image of SIA gals, you can forget about it, you have to
                      agree with me, any PRC gals or viet gals can be much better than
                      them, I took lots of SIA crews, and surprise me most gals are thai,
                      jap, taiwan and malaysia, only a few singaporean aunty doing
                      supervison job. Therefore we need to promote our cities, that is
                      why lots of international event, even at a lost, is still good for
                      singapore, because of the advertisment which is free and live.</p>
              <p>F1 needs money, singtel and many are sponsor of it, including
                      johnnie walker, my favorite, this is a professional sport. Now you
                      tell me, does the drivers prefer a full rally circuit or a city
                      circuit which they cannot see far as all corner and road are
                      barricaded, just like if you are a footballer, do you like to play
                      in a nice stadium field or at the padang with many on lookers and
                      nothing sort of a grand stadium? There is alot of money pour in to
                      attract them here, it helps to market singtel too, for me, I will
                      prefer a subang circuit than a night cities race that is more of a
                      merry making party cum entertaining than a real pro
                      challenge.</p>

              <p>there are a lot of ignorant people in this world. we dun need the whole world to know us. when people need to come to singapore, they will find out more and come. if they have no biz here, there is no incentive for them to even know whether singapore ever existed.</p>
              <p>as for to market singapore, we have to do targeted marketing. dun just anyhow shoot, must aim &amp; shoot to achieve best results cos we have limited budget. i dun think south americans would want to come all the way here just bcos of f1 given that language &amp; culture is a world's apart. likewise singaporeans dun travel to south america when they go for holidays. people tend to visit places where they are familiar with the language, culture and most importantly shopping, which i think south americas is not anything close.</p>
              <p>the pap smeared man is going there (south americas) to get biz for their father's corporations. when the pap smeared man goes to s.americas, they bring along glc like kepple, sembcorpse etc., these are companies with deep pocket (filled with people's $$) u think they care about the local small &amp; medium enterprises? unless a company is a very big one, it's not easy to set foot in south americas not to mention to penetrate their market.</p>
              <p>as for the night race, everyday eat dragon meat also sian lah. it's just the initial years people are interested in this night race. like people always say "new toilet must use 3 days mah". give another 5 years, it's just another f1 race liao.</p>
              <p>no offence, bro bowah. i sense that you are a very optimistic person. i am not saying optimistic is no good, but over optimistic is not. like we always say "kiang jio ho, mai gay kiang". the same goes to "optimistic is good, mai over optimistic".</p>
              <p>we have a lot of prob here in sg but the govt choose to focus on those big events that bring pride to add to their ever growing ego.</p>
              <p>just my $0.02</p>
