              <h4 class="piccaption">Charlie Lim Chau Lee, 51, was jailed six months for dodging 
              traffic offences. -- ST PHOTO: WANG HUI FEN</h4>
              
              <p> </p>
              <p>A SALES executive, who got two friends to take the rap for his traffic 
              offences, was jailed six months on Friday.</p>
              <p>Charlie Lim Chau Lee, 51, was also fined $1,000 for running a traffic light 
              in a separate incident.</p>
              <p>After a tip-off, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau investigated and 
              discovered that Lim had approached at least three fall guys.</p>
              <p>One of them - Benny Sng Kwee Hock - was jailed 1 1/2 months by the same court 
              on Friday for claiming to be driving Lim's car when it ran the red light along 
              Lavender Street on Dec 28. Lim paid the $200 fine but Sng, 54, was docked the 12 
              demerit points.</p>
              <p>Any motorist who got 24 points within two years will have his driving licence 
              suspended for a year.</p>
              <p>The prosecution had asked for a jail term of three months for Sng but Judge 
              Low noted that the business consultant committed the offence out of friendship 
              and not for financial gain.</p>
              <p>Earlier that year, Lim had approached businessman Ding Chiang Kum, 52, to 
              help him find someone to take the rap for a speeding offence for $100.</p>
              <p>Lim Kim Hock agreed to do so but the 40-year-old cleaner backed out after 
              finding out that it was illegal. Lim's friend Lim Ah Hwa, 39, is then said to 
              have submitted her particulars to the police. She also paid the $150 fine with 
              his money.</p>
              <p>At a karaoke lounge in Chinatown the following month, she is believed to have 
              received an additional $300. Her case will be heard on Oct 8 (10). Ding is 
              claiming trial.</p>

              <p>A spokesperson from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) informed Stomp in an email that they were alerted to an incident involving a bus colliding into a bus stop at around 12:32pm.</p>
              <p>Upon arrival, SCDF rescuers and paramedics attended to the 21 casualties. No one was trapped.</p>
              <p>"15 adults and 6 children were conveyed to the Changi General Hospital and KK Children?s Hospital respectively for follow-up medical attention.</p>
              <p>"1 of the adult victims sustained head injury. The other victims suffered injuries such as cuts and bruises," said SCDF.</p>

              <p>This is getting no where.....</p>
              <p>Ok let talk some facts here.</p>
              <p>Much of the taxis are driven non-stop 24hrs/7days a week. The total mileage of a taxi can reach over 300k in less than 3 years. Most private car for the purpose of traveling in Singapore for work and leisure purposes will definitely take longer to clock the kind of mileage.</p>
              <p>There are over 91k TDVL holders. About 25k taxis are available in Singapore. In another words, we can safely say there about at least 30k, in reserve estimation, of active TD on the road each day.</p>
              <p>The accident stats as shown by the original poster (OP) mentioned that though taxis only occupy 3% of the total vehicle numbers in Singapore and we are involved in 14% of the accident. It is in no doubt that we TDs are in the high risk group.</p>
              <p>I am quite sure that if there is a statistic on the number of hours and mileage clock by all 4 wheel saloon users compared to taxi usage, we will definitely overshot 3% in overal total usage. (maybe there is one such stats and I am not aware. If u know where to get it, post it)</p>
              <p>However, are we dangerous? or to be more exact, are we dangerous drivers all the time? Seriously, if we are so dangerous all the time, you should see us dies like insect by the dozen each day. If u look at the fatality and injuries rate, it is the motorcyclist and pedestrians that occupy the high risk group.</p>
              <p>The stats as provided by the OP is meant for the purpose of explaining the cost of insurance for taxis is heavy due to the high accident rate. It is not a measurement of saying or making judgement on whether TD are dangerous. (if u ask me what kind of driver is dangerous, I would say woman drivers lol).</p>
              <p>On top of that, this guy seems to be related to the taxi hating blog.....so shall we do the usual?...just ignore him...................close the thread, Poolman. no point arguing with TD hater. Waste time.</p>

              <p>You can use statistics to verify events of a physical nature, like this machine produces a failure of 1 bolt for every 1,000,000 produced or this hard disk has a MTBF of 100,000 hours.</p>

              <p>There has been a substantial growth in air travel in the past decade, but if you compare the statistics in the Air Crashes Record Office, the accidents has decreased with the increase in air travel. Quantity of flights is not proportional to the number of accidents.</p>

              <p>If we follow your line of argument that more driving leads to more accidents, then at a 5% growth rate, the number of airline accidents should be 361 in year 2009, not 122 as stated by ACRO. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><strong>The growth of world air travel has averaged approximately 5% per year over the past 30 years</strong>, with substantial yearly variations due both to changing economic conditions and differences in economic growth in different regions of the world. Historically, the annual growth in air travel has been about twice the annual growth in GDP. Even with relatively conservative expectations of economic growth over the next 10-15 years, a continued 4-5% annual growth in global air travel will lead to a doubling of total air travel during this period.</p>

              <p>Reckless is arguemental, if you understood a taxi driver plying for his living, you would had understand their condition and thus give them the benefit of doubt, I would said that many private car drivers in singapore are good enough to give way to us and to make an effort to divert out or wait for us behind to pick or drop pax, just like we understand why workers get retrenched by the CEO, becos he wanted to optimise his profit by reducing wage cost, and therefore, we become the scape goat and given the age and choice, chose to drive taxi, so far, so good.</p>

              <p>The fault line lies on the mid range, most of taxi accident accounted for only 1/2 the fault blame on the taxi driver, and the public on the other half. And there are more private vehicle accident than taxi accident per day. And that is why private vehicle insurance had gone up tremedously. However, taxi rate still the same.</p>

                              and the authorities. Legislation helps to control the way in which our roads are 
                              used. This simple guide is designed to give drivers a general understanding to 
                              some common driving offences in Singapore.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p class="body2">Drivers are reminded that the standard of safety they need to 
                              maintain is very high. The courts in Singapore are of the view that drivers owe 
                              a very serious responsibility to other road users. Drivers must at all times 
                              ensure that they do not cause danger to other road users, including pedestrians.</p>
              <p class="body2">The standard of safety a driver has to maintain may differ 
                              depending on the circumstances at a particular time. A driver must take into 
                              consideration all prevailing driving conditions for example, lighting 
                              conditions, the weather, volume of traffic and the presence or possible presence 
                              of pedestrians. It is also important to note that the mere fact that someone 
                              else was also at fault in causing an accident may not be a sufficient defence. 
                              In accidents involving pedestrians, for example, the Singapore courts have 
                              commented on the standard required of drivers:</p>
              <p class="body2">Public Prosecutor v. Teo Lian Seng [1996] 1 SLR 19</p>
              <p class="body2">"… It must be emphasised that the standard required for 
                              expressways cannot be the same as that for normal roads. While on the latter, 
                              especially in housing estates, there would be a need to be alert at all times to 
                              the possibility of persons crossing the road indiscriminately, particularly 
                              children and the elderly regardless of whether there are specific signs of their 
                              presence, such as schools, playgrounds or parks. And what is appropriate for a 
                              normal road would not be for car parks." (my emphasis)</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p class="body2">Section 84 Road Traffic Act requires the driver involved in a 
                              road traffic accident to stop and render aid. The driver must also aid any 
                              police officer as may be reasonably required.</p>
              <p class="body2">An offence is committed if Section 84 of the Road Traffic Act is 
                              not complied with. The offence carries a fine of up to $3,000.00 or imprisonment 
                              for up to 12 months. For a second or subsequent offence the maximum sentence is 
                              a fine of $5,000 or two years' imprisonment. Drivers should not move any 
                              vehicle, or persons killed or injured, unless:</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="body2"><strong><a name="police"></a>Police action against drivers </strong></p>
              <p class="body2">When a road traffic offence has been committed the police may 
                              take action under the Road Traffic Act or the Penal Code. Drivers may be 
                              formally charged in court, or the police may issue traffic summonses. The 
                              procedure of bringing a criminal charge against an accused person is dealt with 
                              in a separate article.</p>
              <p class="body2"><strong><a name="common"></a>Common driving offences </strong></p>
              <p class="body2">Many of the driving offences in the Road Traffic Act and the 
                              Penal Code may overlap. For one incident a driver may have committed offences 
                              under a number of provisions in the Road Traffic Act or the Penal Code. For 
                              example, if a driver uses his handphone while driving, he may have committed the 
                              offence of driving without due care and attention, or an offence of using a 
                              handphone while driving. Such an overlap actually gives the police, the courts 
                              and the driver, through the criminal process, the opportunity to arrive at an 
                              appropriate charge on which to prosecute, to convict or to plead guilty. The 
                              choice of an appropriate offence will depend on the facts of each case and the 
                              prescribed punishment for each offence. Set out below are some common driving 
                              offences and the prescribed punishment for each offence:</p>

              <p>Yes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Taxi drivers only half of the fault, the other half goes to the pedestrian, like the Viet lady who was killed at Geylang Lor.41, she shouldn't be sitting outside the pub with her friends, it's her fault. Taxis have the right of way to drive their vehicles into five foot ways. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
