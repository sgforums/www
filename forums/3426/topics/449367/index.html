              <p>My previous Azera hirer sustained a minor heart attack, numbness of fingers and now some puss in his backside in just 6 years of taxi driving.</p>
              <p>Most of the time he was an OMO, or with reliefs that don't cover all 7 days. Yet he still carried on because he enjoyed the 'freedom and convenience' of being a hirer.</p>
              <p>Even now, after he was warded and on MC after an operation, he still wanted to take a crown or sonata out.  Only when his weekend relief and myself told him we cannot guarantee driving 1/2 shift for him everyday did he began to reconsider.</p>
              <p>Finally he's seen sense, and has decided to drive Beach Rd taxis for 5 days in the morning.</p>
              <p>So pls, especially newbies, be careful of being an OMO. After you get used to driving after a month or two, you think hey this isn't so bad. Drive whole day, whether splitting hours or just 1 go, doesn't seem so bad, and you feel your body can adapt easily.</p>
              <p>But as the weeks turn into months and months into years, suddenly you began to wonder why you can't maintain the same momentum. Whether it's fatigue, illness, boredom or no mood doesn't matter. Most will go through this phase.</p>
              <p>And that's where they problem starts, you slow down a lot, earn little and then suddenly the bills pile up or worse, you fall sick. Then no matter how you try or how much you drive, you just can't seem to return to when you first started and you become frustrated. It can also happen if you have full time relief. Why? It's called burn-out, once you cross it, it's very hard to return to the old ways. Just like drinking, once you pass your peak, you can never drink as much as much as before. Now maybe 1 or 2 bottles, sei already, those days, 6-7 no problem.</p>
              <p>So pace yourselves, give yourself off days, got to have 2 or 3 reliefs to cover also ok. You can't expect your full time relief to share your responsibilty as the hirer all the time.</p>
              <p>No need to drive 10 hours or more, very unhealthy. Try to work like you would at a normal job, 8 - 9 hours with 1 hour break, with 1 or 2 off days a week. Some days you wanna chiong, go ahead, but slow down either the day before or after.</p>
              <p>Don't bother if you read how some drivers break records and can earn 4-5k. Set your own targets each day or month, once you meet it, relax.</p>
              <p>Just my advise, I hate to read or see drivers succumbing to illness or death. I don't know everything, sometimes I talk also but myself never do. But by typing this and reading things like this, I can be reminded too.</p>

              <p>I think in every job, there is a job hazard.</p>
              <p>These things you mentioned may be peculiar to Taxi Drivers.</p>
              <p>But there are things we can do to keep our life healthy.</p>
              <p>Exercise =&gt; swim, jog</p>
              <p>Proper diet =&gt; Vegetables, protein (non-meat) food, and less meat.</p>
              <p>Proper Work Schedule and Attitude towards life.</p>
              <p>There are people who loves to work, and they will be stressed when there is no work. And it happens when someone is passionate about what he does.</p>
              <p>When a person is not passionate, and work long hours, it normally equates to health problems.</p>
              <p>We just have to understand our body and do the right thing. And when illness comes, at least we know we already done our best.</p>

              <p>Yes, money cannot earn finish, knn, for me huat alot or OBK alot, end of the month, also look same same. So might as well drive calmly, happy, steady and smartly.</p>
              <p>As TD on the road, we are clueless to what tomorrow will be, since clueless, might as well let tomorrow worry by itself, most people became TD because of wanting a free and open life, in a way of how I drive will be what I get to earn. We owe nobody a living, non does anyone owe us a living. And if you end up with health problem as a TD, then what is the purpose of driving it?</p>
              <p>At our age, diet is important, so is exercises.</p>

              <p>Initially, it's ok to go full swing until experienced enough. But initial period cannot turn into months. 6-8 weeks maximum, that already a lot.</p>
              <p>Like any job, no point working so hard at the start and then inevitably will slow down. The boss also will think, wah before he so hardworking, now slacken already.</p>
              <p>Gradual or constant is always better.</p>
              <p>Eat garlic (raw), lemon (both good for heart) and drink essence of chicken, or like our chief poolman does, fish soup, chicken soup very good too.</p>
              <p>Somebody told me, that parsely leaves, you know the ones they put on top of chicken rice is very good. Buy a large number pound and boil them and then keep cool in fridge and drink from time to time. (if really must add a little suger or salt for taste). Drink 1 or 2 cups, very good for clearing the kidneys and cleaning the urine.</p>
              <p>I haven't tried but will do soon, and report outcome.</p>

              <p><br>It is the same for all trades, you need to start as an apprentice than slowly move up, army also hv to start from Basic training. But newbies alway like to chiong, and further more those Taxi academy keep luring them into OMO with rebate of TD course fees, can't really blame them.</p>
              <p>I remember taking taxi license, all the trainees mood is going OMO, nobody mention about relief or that god knows if they know what is a relief.</p>
