              <p>Super pro driver. Tailgate on expressway, keep flashing headlight if the front driver never give way. I can see a lot of the front vehicle also very scared of this taxi driver.</p>
              <p>The whole journey is tailgate + keep flashing + overtake. End up.. a 20min journey cut short to 15min. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> I haven't buy insurance yet~</p>
              <p>After I reach my place, I ask the driver last time he do what want... he say he drive crane~ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>

              <p>They can answer me, dun play play, the newly dead are like newbie taxi driver, full of wondering and reasoning, being with the body for many years, to impart it cannot believe it.</p>
              <p>For the first few days, it do not think that it had gone into the next realm of space, just like newbie cabby who find it strange that why he is driving taxis and everything change from his normal way of living in the past.</p>
              <p>Most importantly is that we must respect them, it do have feeling and alots of question to ask, so family and friend support is also good for them, like it or not, it was once like us, living.</p>
              <p>The most active one are those sudden death, sudden hit by car or out of nowhere, get stroke or heart attack and passed away, these type will tend to dwell ino our earthly realm for much longer, because they are not prepare to go, but somehow they are gone. Sad it might be, because they miss alot of love ones, and they simply cannot believe it.</p>
              <p>As such we do said abit of pray, the chinese will burnt and pray for a smooth journey, the christian will send them to their god, the muslim Iman will give sermon for them to accend to heaven, for me, no matter what noise it makes, I just drive, and tell it, I am your driver sending you, not your assistant. It will ask, why and where are you sending me, how come you are sending me..to where?? why are you taking my body??? then you tell it, calm now, this is an advance booking from your family, I am the limo driver sending you to AP, your family will be there, they will be there waiting for you.</p>
              <p>But when it talk, never look back, not even use the rear mirror, if you notice in casket driving, most mirror are tilt high and for me, covered when taking it. never even use it, only use the side ones, these are all our skill in this trade</p>
              <p>Mirror exocist spirit, it give them a much confuse situation of where and what they are, and in their realm, it can stay in the mirror and follow wherever you go, and that is also why it is good to put a charm on the rear mirror like most vehicle do</p>

              <p>They can answer me, dun play play, the newly dead are like
              newbie taxi driver, full of wondering and reasoning, being with the
              body for many years, to impart it cannot believe it.</p>
              <p>For the first few days, it do not think that it had gone into
              the next realm of space, just like newbie cabby who find it strange
              that why he is driving taxis and everything change from his normal
              way of living in the past.</p>
              <p>Most importantly is that we must respect them, it do have
              feeling and alots of question to ask, so family and friend support
              is also good for them, like it or not, it was once like us,
              living.</p>
              <p>The most active one are those sudden death, sudden hit by car or
              out of nowhere, get stroke or heart attack and passed away, these
              type will tend to dwell ino our earthly realm for much longer,
              because they are not prepare to go, but somehow they are gone. Sad
              it might be, because they miss alot of love ones, and they simply
              cannot believe it.</p>
              <p>As such we do said abit of pray, the chinese will burnt and pray
              for a smooth journey, the christian will send them to their god,
              the muslim Iman will give sermon for them to accend to heaven, for
              me, no matter what noise it makes, I just drive, and tell it, I am
              your driver sending you, not your assistant. It will ask, why and
              where are you sending me, how come you are sending me..to where??
              why are you taking my body??? then you tell it, calm now, this is
              an advance booking from your family, I am the limo driver sending
              you to AP, your family will be there, they will be there waiting
              for you.</p>
              <p>But when it talk, never look back, not even use the rear mirror,
              if you notice in casket driving, most mirror are tilt high and for
              me, covered when taking it. never even use it, only use the side
              ones, these are all our skill in this trade</p>
              <p>Mirror exocist spirit, it give them a much confuse situation of
              where and what they are, and in their realm, it can stay in the
              mirror and follow wherever you go, and that is also why it is good
              to put a charm on the rear mirror like most vehicle do</p>

              <p>The drivers that like to speed + high beam + tailgate + sirens are those private ambulance drivers.  They are driving at 120 km/hr at least n expect ppl to give way even heavy traffic even though they are not those emergency cases. Saw a lot on sle towards woodlands. So definitely not going to hospital. Recently saw one case rushing on sle.  Speeding very fast. But once it turn into woodlands ave 2 from sle it slow to 30 km/hr. crawling speed + siren off. Follow it n it turn right to ave 5 at slow pace. Finally it stop at ave 4 roadside beside 888.
