              <p>I guess this is the topic which many of us has been thinking before jumping into the wheels. I've drove a cab before during the 2003 SARS recession and my 6 months of driving really make me a better person.</p>
              <p>Those who are driving will tell you, i will give out my taxi if i'm being offered a $2500 job while those who are working with higher pay will think of giving up his job and jump into taxi.</p>
              <p>My feel on driving</p>
              <p>OMO</p>
              <p>1 When you start your engine in the morning, you will have to think how fast can you cover your rental. If you start at 6am, on a goodday by noon your cost shd be covered</p>
              <p>2 Total stress out after 0930am where the streets is empty and you only have hotel,hospital,zoo,birdpark etc to cover</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Relief</p>
              <p>The best option for beginers, fast way to cover cost and start whacking to make more income. The plus side is, you will have enough rest and free time after your driving shift.</p>
              <p>Cons- You must have a good hirer, i personally kena 1 that always ask me to pay him in advance cos he need $$$. He smoke in his cab and the whole car aircon system smells.</p>
              <p>If you are willing to give up your usual sat,sun spending time chilling up at home, shopping,dinning or quality time with your family. Than i guess you are mentally prepared to cheong all the way</p>
              <p>I'm currently planing to give up my 5 days work week with a salary of $4500 and 21 days leave with medical benifits to be on the road.</p>
              <p>You may ask me why, my objective is to spend more time with my son who is currently at P3. So i should be on a OMO ops with different driving patterns.</p>
              <p>6am - 12 noon, 1700hrs till i make my profit.</p>
              <p>My current tots will be which company should i join?? &amp; shd be opt for a limo or a sonata which doesnt require a tie in period.</p>
              <p>So whatever your tots is, goodluck and work your way up in whatever choice you have opt for. Life is short - Just do it</p>

              <p>i think it is a notion of "u see me good, i see u good"..</p>
              <p>unless u are in the line or in the job, u can only understand that much.. people with high pay doesn't mean they are well off in terms of financially, emotionally and physically.. for me, chancing upon this forum makes me open up to many things...</p>
              <p>what i can say now at this juncture is that in every trade, there is always some who can make it, some don't.. so give it a shot and then you can see whether taxi driving is your cup of tea... it will not make you a rich man driving taxi, this is a fact, but should be able to provide food on the table and some savings and most importantly, i think at the end of the day, we have to be happy at what we are doing.. cos only if you feel happy and satisfaction from your job, will you do well in them.</p>
