              <p>I visited all taxi companies website on surcharges for MBS. Let me share with you my finding.</p>
              <p>All taxi companies website indicate surcharges $3 for MBS following CBD timing, mon to sat, 5pm to midnight.</p>
              <p>Comfort, Citycab, in their website, they did not indicate passenger must pay for surcharge $3 for sunday and public holiday, 6.am to mid night and public holiday, therefore passenger can dispute if surcharge is imposed.</p>
              <p>In transcab,SMRT, Prime website, they indicate passenger has to pay surcharge of $3 for Sunday and Public Holiday from 6am to midnight, therefore taxi driver under these companies can impose surcharges.</p>
              <p>No wonder, I passed by MBS during deepavali, saw a long line of red toyata wish lining up at MBS waiting to pick passenger.</p>
              <p>Remarks : Only you are within CBD and pickup customers within CBD then can impose surcharges for CBD. If you outside CDB and received a call inside CBD, you go inside CDB to pick passenger, you cannot charge $3 for CDB, this apply to any color of taxi.</p>

              Utterly utterly rubbish to say its a fact that if u are outside cbd . and received a call to pick up inside cbd . u cannot collect cbd surcharge .

              i now seriously doubt if threadstarter is a taxi driver ? or just a taxi fan ? 
              
              if he has been taking such calls . without applying cbd surcharges on passengers , then i.would advice him . no need so busy take call . just drive into cbd and pick anyone that flag for him. Easier n no stress. Same $3 extra .

              <p>Wahpiangz, I didn't know my posting on MBS $3 surcharge and my 
              remarks on CBD make some people so hot, even locked thread can be 
              unlock.</p>
              <p><strong>MBS $3 surcharge on Sunday and Public Holiday, </strong>I am pleased to provide respective website for public reference and its self explanatory.</p>
              <p>Comfort and City Cab, Premier,Smart did not mentioned in their 
              website that their driver can collect $3 surcharge from passenger pickup
               at MBS on Sunday and Public Holiday.</p>
              <p>http://www.premiertaxi.com/our_commuters/taxi_fare.asp</p>
              <p>http://www.smartcab.com.sg/</p>
              <p>http://www.cdgtaxi.com.sg/commuters_services_rates.mvn?cid=1624760</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Transcab,Prime,SMRT mentioned their website that their driver can collect $3 from their passenger at MBS.</p>
              <p>http://www.primetaxi.com.sg/TaxiFaresComplete.pdf</p>
              <p>http://www.transcabservices.com.sg/view_page.aspx?id=12</p>
              <p>http://www.smrt.com.sg/taxis/additional_charges.asp</p>
              <p>Hope
               the above websites clarified. And if taxi drivers which their company 
              did not mentioned about the $3 for Sunday and Public Holiday who wish to
               collect $3 from their passenger, it is up to individual but prepare to 
              be call up when the passenger disputed it by making reference to the 
              company's website. BTW, there is no CBD charge on Sunday and Public Holiday.</p>

               driver plying within CBD and within CDB timing, received an oncall from
               taxi company or pick up customer, this case, the taxi driver can charge
               $3 CBD surcharge. </p>
              <p>Scenarios 2</p>
              <p>Taxi driver plying outside 
              CBD and within CDB timing, received an oncall from taxi company, for 
              this case, the taxi driver has the right to reject the oncall given to 
              him if he cannot collect $3 surcharge for CBD and if he choose to 
              accepted the call outside the CBD, then he should prepare to forgo the 
              $3 CBD surcharge and ERP charge if any. Most of the forumers here 
              disagreed to it and I respect their disagreement but I still stand by my
               belief.</p>
              <p>May I asked forumers here a questions, a taxi driver 
              plying outside CBD area during CBD timing, a passenger use his iphone to
               call for taxi and the call was routed to him. He picked up the 
              passenger and his passenger wanted the taxi driver to enter CBD to pick 
              up his friends and proceed to another place within or outside CBD area, 
              can this taxi driver collect $3 CBD charge from the passenger?</p>
              <p>Folks,
               forum is for discussion, I do not come here to quarrel and I come here 
              to share my view etc Agreement and disagreement bound to have. You might
               be right and I might be wrong or vice versa, of course everyone here 
              want to make money but making money has to be justifiable based on 
              principle. If I am prepare to loss money to stand by my belief, I do not
               think I committed an offence. You can lock the thread or remove or ban me if you like, I had give a piece of my mind.</p>

              <p>for the benefit of those people <span style="color: #333300;"><strong>who slept through</strong></span> their rules and regulations class while attending the taxi Academy here is the extract from the manual on CBD surcharge.</p>
              <p>Page 6 Q 16. When can you collect CBD surcharge</p>
              <p>A. only when I convey passenger <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>whose trip start from the restricted zone </strong></span>during the operational hours of the CBD surcharge</p>
              <p>Page 6 Q 17 if a passenger hires your taxi from elsewhere to pick up another passenger inside the restricted zone during the CBD operational hours can you ask for CBD surcharge</p>
              <p>A. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>No, because the trip does not start from the restricted zone</strong></span></p>
              <p>now if a passenger is picked up from CBD area on-call no matter whether the taxi driver was in CBD, outside CBD or drop from sky since the journey begins from CBD according to Singapore taxi Academy you can collect CBD surcharge.if passenger disputes I am more than happy to scan the copy of the manual page for your reference to download. Please ask the passenger who disputes to lodge a complaint with LTA as well as the taxi company so this time while you're having coffee you can also give a good lecture to the LTA and the taxi company for wasting your time</p>
