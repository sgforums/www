              <p>Today hirer tried to help me by handing over the taxi to me at 2pm, went to eat some light food before I start. Just when I was about to start my car, I recieved an emergency call they my mum was being sent to NUH by ambulance, condition critical. Rushed down to hospital A&amp;E, spent about half hour to get a parking lot, dam pek chek. Waited for the doctor to do all the test, waited till 6pm then tell me her lung and and brain got bacteria, drag until about 10pm then transfered to ward, diagnos pneumonia. Bad things all comes at one go, really makes me break down mentally. Everything settled down, already 1130pm, decided to cover back some cost, exit car park at 1145pm, car park fees almost $19. Pick up a staff from NUH taxi stand  go Ang Mo Kio, the roam around until pick up one Indian going MBS who had worked in SG for 6 years, MBS long queque so roam until reached Clemencea road pick up a lady to some location near Outram, make wrong turn and kenah f until I feel like ...... she asked for reciept, don't know gonna complain or what, went Orchard and newton, then passed by royal hotel all taxi no human. Try Thomson road, pick one nice guy along Thomson Plaza going Woodlands, after that pump diesel wash car. Managed to get $53, diesel $13, rental $50, so still lugi $10, I think, consider lucky already. For the past few nights, once reached 12am, I was lost, beacause taxi long queque everywhere. Now I realised, actually sweeping can also fetch some dollars after midnight as long as don't give up. I think, I have a better idea now of what style I gonna adopt. Hope things will gets better day by day. This evening would be going to NUH after some driving to visit my mom, then queque at NUH taxi stand after that. Really hope my mom will get well soon.  </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Thanks bros for showing concern about my mom's health condition, she is better now. Wanted to drop by to visit her during midnight, but didn't have the chance to do so. I have my own finacial commitment, so just have to drive on. There's a strange trend I encounter, different pax keeps sending me to the same town on the same day. Some day Bedok a few times, sometimes Sengkang, etc. After 5 days of driving, not so nervous anymore, even when yearning for the next direction board to appear to my rescue. One thing I discovered, GPS doesn't work well in certain areas due to newly construct road or buildings, like Sengkang, Punggol, some road around Rochor, Bugis, Suntec towards MBS, etc. Have to use 1/3 brain, 1/3 road direction board, 1/3 GPS. Tommorow have to go for MDT course, can only start driving at 7pm, most probably cover cost then go visit my mom.</p></div>

              <p>Today drove almost 270 km,  slowly starting to improve my
              stamina in driving. The earning today is still below my personal

              <p>Yesterday woke up early morning at 11am (consider early for me) due to MDT course at 1.30pm, started driving at 7pm and went to visit my mom at 2am, doctor said they discover that she's has hyper thyriod, more test will be perform on her, neverending testing.

              <p>Today tried to perform the same stunt again, however, it never happened the same way. After waking up early yesterday, and today's continual driving, I really feel burned out, Saturday is my off day, Sunday wil be driving OMO.</p>
