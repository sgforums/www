              <p>Before start shift, whole lot of strategis, but once on the road becomes headless chicken. I just try to sweep around the place after pax alight, if not too far away from Vivo, I'll go there, cause always have waiting passenger, after 3 days of driving find it not productive. Today first pax from CCK go Redhill, Redhill then I went Vivo, pax go Seletar Hill, GPS lost connect with satelite, end up CTE up and down, reached offer pax $5 discount, pax said never mind, somemore pay metre plus $10 tips, I also blurred and said thank you very much twice. Proceeded to no Novena Square taxi stand, pax go Cairnhill. Follow by go Suntec pick up and go some ulu hotel at Beach Road. Anyhow roam reached Raffles City taxi stand and queque, then pax bring me song song to Jurong. Mind totally numb, found a coffee shop to have my first meal of the day. After meal, really don't feel like starting engine, by then already 9.30pm. Really don't want to force myself to go on, if not later accident lagi worse. Fetched my wife back home, wash car, pump diesel call it a day, made $15 after cost. Really feel like giving up. </p>

              <p>The essence of being a TD in our days is when we find no way out and need to feed a family, but today, being a TD is an option to many newbies, that is why, they can easily give up and choose an alternatives due to better certicates and opportunities.</p>
              <p>To me, that time, family and safety were the primary concern, road and pax is secondary, and that makes us tough and able to handle problem with ease</p>

              <p>Nobody is a sotong or blur king, it is either we are inexperience or nervous, or simply our genes play a part, some are born that way, and that is why some get outcasted by the greed society out there.</p>
              <p>If you make $100 or 200 or simply 15, take a good look at that $15 and tell yourself, my hard earn money, not thru exploiting others, not thru cheating others, not thru using others, but all my myself, perhap that will help you to move on, and even if you end up giving up driving, is also kind of blessing.</p>
