              <p>This Saturday night have some unforgettable journey with pax.</p>
              <p>1) Pick up pinoy from Lucky Plaza going to Bt Panjang. Suggested to go by PIE--&gt; BKE. Pax die die wants to go by CTE then PIE, knn, how can connect? So I thought she got 'Special' route to connect, halfway ask her exit where, then she said she dunno, so I exit at Braddel to connect  by Lornie. On the way kept grummbling that she usually only takes 10 mins to reach Bt Panjang from Lucky Plaza a few times. I would really wants to know anyone out here are able to travel that fast until 10 mins can reach during peak hours? I told her off when I cannot tahan her CB mouth anymore. Reached complain about fare too expensive. I insisted to collect full fare and printed the receipt for her without she asking for it. She wanted to go by CTE, not me. </p>
              <p>2) One young teen girl boarded at CCK (3am) go Woodlands. Suggested to go by the old Woodland Rd via Stagmont Ring. She insisted to go by KJE BKE. When reached fare was $18. She dig her wallet and found that she has only $16, and I told her no problem I'll forgo that $2. Actually I wanted to tell her nevermind lah, uncle give you a free ride, just study hard for your future beacuse she really look very pity, but after a few second of thinking, I thought, I pity her, then who pity me when I have to pay rental and diesel?</p>

              <p>Yesterday night I went back to my old ways and it works wonder
              again. The night before yesterday, after I parked my taxi, took a
              cab back at the MRT station. That TD off engine and waited patienly
              when I boarded his cab at about 4am. He was the only taxi driver
              there. I asked him like that wait also can meh? He told me
              sometimes no luck also cannot give up. His determination really
              motivated me. Yesterday after midnight landed in some ulu places,
              and I remembered what that TD said to me, and I sweep non-stop at
              those places which I have never been to or think of. Results? I
              would say collection not secondary to Friday night. However reached
              home leg pain back pain. Hopefully still can chiong
              tonight. </p>

              <p>Monday night started at 5.30pm, thinking that just cover cost and make little bit then keep by 12am. However up to 11pm only made $20 when reached CCK. Thought just queque at Yew Tee MRT taxi stand to pick up short trip before close, since the profit was so bad. Pax boarded, want to go Yishun, aiyah anything also take lah, as the night was dam down.</p>
              <p>Reached Yishun, wanted to head back home, kenah flag by 1 guy go Lavender St. Since already there and midnight charge started, drove towards Mustafa to pick ah neh. Before I could turn right at Desker Rd, 1 uncle flag and go Sengkang. At Sengkang wanted to go home via AMK ave 5, along the way a lady flag go Woodlands. When reached Woodlands, told myself must go back liao, very hungry and tired backs and legs.</p>
              <p>While heading back, pax flag go Jurong, knn, tired also have to go. Reached Jurong got another connection go Depot Rd. After alighted pax, I can really feel the pain on my back. Park in a carpark nearby and have smoke break. After that head back to CCK to pump diesel, when done, along CCK Way, a lady flag, thought it is some short trip, so I stop. She wanted to go Tampinese, but told her to take another cab. This trip midnight I think can fetch another $35 -$40. Dam heart pain, wanted to carry on, but my body already started to complain a few hrs ago. Went for makan at Yew Tee around 3am, then went home.</p>
              <p>At least my hard work is worth something tonight. Made $1xx after cost. Midnight driving is really full of suprises sometimes. </p>

              <p>Some people might be thinking I big cannon, but what I gain from doing that? My weekdays are most times better than my Saturdays. I oftenly make only $60 on Saturdays, which is suppose to be 'Huat Day' for others. </p>

              <p>I don't believe in only 1 method of doing things. If I can get connection after connection, what is that $3 surcharge? Empty back to town also have to queque at most time, somemore have to pay more for diesel, end up less collection. Got pax just pick lah, if luck is on your side, what wood or kang also no problem, especially after 12am.</p>

              <p><br>Sorry to let you thinking, because I want people to think, thinking process is how we master the road, but most of the time, I agreed, we lazy to think so much.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Going PIE tuas need to go one round, CTE out by upper seranggoon exit and make a U turn up PIE.</p>
              <p>Secondly for Bukit Timah, you do not hv to go so far, at Bideford turn left cairnhill, then toward scott, turn left toward Hyatt, but keep right then U turn up steven road all the way to PIE.</p>
              <p>But since pax said go by CTE, so be it lor, exit at upper seranggoon lor.</p>
