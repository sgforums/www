              <p>I have different opinion from you. I don't find it is anything to be big huh ha about. I don't post $$$ to boast, what is so big 'F' about making $100 - $200 "Somedays" with 8-12 hrs of hardwork? Some down days will make it an average of $2000-$3000 per month depends on individuals with 8-12 hrs of hardwork daily.</p>
              <p>This kind of income and working hrs is it hard to find in Singapore? Definitely not. This kind of income, working hrs, work nature, social status, health hazard, and have to risk safety, if people still want to come in to compete, then I would warmly welcome him/her, because he/she really walk until no road liao.  </p>

              <p>Last night was pay day for most people, but activities at the field doesn't huat, by 11pm Orchard Rd already dead. Drove 9 hrs then only managed hit close to $xxx.</p>
              <p>At about 1.30am, many taxi with green lanterns became very hungry. I was roaming at second lane a long Thomson Rd towards Marymont and AMK at 50-60km/hr, suddenly one Toyota crown speed very fast from behind at 3rd lane to be infront of me then slowed down to about 40-50km/hr to block me. Knn, so yao kwee, I purposely tried to align with him, then he speed up a bit more, I don't give chance and forced him to travel beyond the speed limit if he wants to cut me out. At last he gave up and filter out at AMK.</p>
              <p>I didn't do that to fight pax with him, just pissed off with his kind of move. I know by doing that, I'm just another CB fellow, but this kind of CB have to use the CB way to treat him.</p>

              <p>Why should I feel small when someone else can perform better than me??? They own it through their hardwork and skill.

              <p>The maximum a taxi metre can run in a month is limited. Some drive real fast like mad just to pick up more pax, is it worth to risk safety? Some try to stay within CBD by doing interview, why make life so difficult? I ever saw TD kenah 'F' by pax at taxi queque and many people at the taxi stand was laughing due to interview. </p>
              <p>No matter how 'Top' a TD is , the social status of TD will never change in the eyes of the public. If a TD income can make anyone feel 'Small', then I think it's the most funny joke I ever heard. </p>

              <p>'Throw out pax' are words too strong to descripe what happened. I was trying to mitigate the situation by inviting the pax to take another cab. Do you think I should hold on to him until I hunt down the destination just because of my taxi metre fare?</p>

              <p>Yesterday night I went back to my old ways and it works wonder again. The night before yesterday, after I parked my taxi, took a cab back at the MRT station. That TD off engine and waited patienly when I boarded his cab at about 4am. He was the only taxi driver there. I asked him like that wait also can meh? He told me sometimes no luck also cannot give up. His determination really motivated me. Yesterday after midnight landed in some ulu places, and I remembered what that TD said to me, and I sweep non-stop at those places which I have never been to or think of. Results? I would say collection not secondary to Friday night. However reached home leg pain back pain. Hopefully still can chiong tonight. </p>
