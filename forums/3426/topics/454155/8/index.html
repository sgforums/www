              <p>Start engine at 3.45pm with blood shot eyes, and the sun was really killing me. First trip oncall CCK to Bt Timah, then I proceed to my favourite makan place in town for fish porridge. After break proceed to Orchard, from then town to east follow by queque at airport, repeat the sequence twice. By 8.30pm, whole body feel very hot and itchy, went to petrol kiosk look into the mirror.... shocked. My face and body are very red, with lots of rashes. I feel my forehead, wah lao a, high fever. Quickly put busy go home. The fever also triggered some of my old medical problems. Didn't bother to save that money to go CDG pump kiosk, pump diesel at Shell with 18% discount, difference only about 5 cents every litre, washed car and keep.</p>
              <p>When I step out of the car, I feel real drousy, can't even walk properly. As I was walking down from 3rd floor of the car park, I feell so weak and drousy that I have to stop halfway and sit on stairs to prevent falling down. A couple passed by the stairs I was sitting at, most probably thinking that I am drunk or under influence of drugs.</p>
              <p>Forced myself to walk to the main road, my house is just 5 blocks away, but I flagged a cab to send me back, that's how weak I was. By 12am, my fever escalated, my joints are swollen and very pain (Nothing to do with driving) even with the strongest painkiller. Could not take it anymore, my wife sent me to main road to take taxi to Tan Tock Seng A&amp;E. I asked her not to go with me, knowing that there will be someone at the entrance to help, morever, she have to work tomorrow morning.

              Bro, i really sympathise with your situation. Get a good rest &amp; find other hirer. Don worry, hirer also easy to find (for CDG).
              
              Best time slot would be 5pm-5am for most night relief. Target $100 for mon &amp; tues night &amp; go home early. Wed, fri, sat chiong all the way. As for thur, depends on starting or ending of the month.
              
              Listen to your body, if really v tired for that night, pack up early &amp; go hm zzz. 
              
              What u need are months of sweeping knowledge, where &amp; when to take call. 
              
              Take care bro. Dont worry, drive cab wont starve you one.

              <p>Bro, thanks for your thoughts towards me. I just want to pour out what's happening to me, as I do not want to share it with friends around me, not even relatives.</p>
              <p>I am beggining to like night driving, too bad, my body needs sometime to adjust. Right now my wrist, fingers, knee and toes are still swollen, it's a long term joints problem I have for the past 20 yrs. Will rest for another few days then drive again.</p>
              <p>I was thinking of giving up during the first few days, then I think again, aunty auncle can make it, why not me? Before I becomes a TD, I used to think that taxi driving are for idle and lazy people, always queque at taxi stands, airport unproductively, and stop after a few hours of driving for as long as one hour break. However, now I have a different point of view.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Start engine at 3.45pm with blood shot eyes, and the sun was really killing me. First trip oncall CCK to Bt Timah, then I proceed to my favourite makan place in town for fish porridge. After break proceed to Orchard, from then town to east follow by queque at airport, repeat the sequence twice. By 8.30pm, whole body feel very hot and itchy, went to petrol kiosk look into the mirror.... shocked. My face and body are very red, with lots of rashes. I feel my forehead, wah lao a, high fever. Quickly put busy go home. The fever also triggered some of my old medical problems. Didn't bother to save that money to go CDG pump kiosk, pump diesel at Shell with 18% discount, difference only about 5 cents every litre, washed car and keep.</p>
              <p>When I step out of the car, I feel real drousy, can't even walk properly. As I was walking down from 3rd floor of the car park, I feell so weak and drousy that I have to stop halfway and sit on stairs to prevent falling down. A couple passed by the stairs I was sitting at, most probably thinking that I am drunk or under influence of drugs.</p>
              <p>Forced myself to walk to the main road, my house is just 5 blocks away, but I flagged a cab to send me back, that's how weak I was. By 12am, my fever escalated, my joints are swollen and very pain (Nothing to do with driving) even with the strongest painkiller. Could not take it anymore, my wife sent me to main road to take taxi to Tan Tock Seng A&amp;E. I asked her not to go with me, knowing that there will be someone at the entrance to help, morever, she have to work tomorrow morning. Told her if by 3am I do not call her, just go and sleep and inform my hirer that I will not be able to drive for a while.</p>
              <p>The taxi driver offer to help me walk to the A&amp;E, I rejected as I know time is money for him, but he insisted. He really touched my heart, I wish this CDG driver and his family members good luck and good health. Didn't note down his name and car license plate, as I was already in a very bad conditon.</p>
              <p>I was given first priority, no need to queque. After some basic test, nurse said blood pressure very low, no wonder felt like fainting. Made to lied down on a bed with wheels, pushed in to treatment room, recieved pain kiliing and rashes injection. Monitor untill 7am then discharged with some medicine.</p>
              <p>Took a very old Transcab manaul taxi, driven by an aunty. Reached home didn't even bother to shower and straight away sleep. Woke up at 1pm, eat Mac delivery, and medicine then sleep again, just woke up not long ago. </p>
              <p>Hirer found a new relief immediately to replace me, 4pm - 4am shift, it's very easy for him to get relief anytime.</p>
              <p>The best shift for many people might not be the best for me. As 4pm - 6pm, sometimes the sun can be very hot. After some analysis, I think, I'm more suitable for 6pm - 6am. Somehow, I usaully can perform better during late hours. 4pm - 6pm many drivers change shift, but this advantage doesn't suit me. I think it will be quite easy for me to find 6pm - 6am shift work. Will rest for a few days first.</p>
              <p>Hirer message me to collect my belongings and to pay for the scratches on the right front tyres ($80) + Rim ($15), due to I mounted curb on last Friday night. Life is really dramatic for me.</p>
