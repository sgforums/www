              <p>Started to be on the road again last night at 6pm. Month end night shift really quite tough. Majority are short trips without connection. Kenah ping pong between North and West for 4 hours, can't take it anymore and proceeded to town. From there, the metre started to rock n roll.</p>
              <p>Town within town, till one pax brought me to Tampinese. Go queque at T2. Reached T2, eyes almost pop-out, double file and long long dragon. Pax go Hougang, after that I went back Orchard and pick up a pax go Bt Gombak, looked at my watch, already 4am, pump wash and keep.</p>
              <p>Starting to have momentum in taxi driving, which really makes this job more enjoyable. Last night end shift did an calculation on the mileage per litre of diesel, only 9.5 km per litre, is this normal? Mine is a 2 yrs Sonata. </p>
