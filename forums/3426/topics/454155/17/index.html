              khoon will know the difference i felt from omo to now having eric as relief.. i duno abt eric, but i am sure this is the rite move for both of us, hopefully he agrees to what i think.. 
              
              it is realy a world of difference being omo and half shift, even thou i am driving the cheapest rental taxi.. style also change, but i think for the better.. my only stress thru out the day is only from 8am to 9.30am.. if i did well, basically, by 5pm i can actually close shop and earn the same as last time when i need to drive till 8pm..
              
              furthermore, with 2 days off per week, i think that is more than enuf rest for me..
              of cos, khoon is the one who pull the strings for both me and eric to work together and i really am grateful.. 
              
              but i still need to say this to you although i know what is your decision for now.. that is, do consider a less stressful life being a td, that is, what you always believe, find a relief or be a relief.. 115 is really too much and really now worth it.. you and me not like hammer.. haha..

For me stop for a week and relax is not a problem, just watch more TV proggramme and go shopping.Â </p></div>

              <p>He kept asking why want to terminate the partnership, I told him truthfully it's about off day and shift timing request which he rejected with sacarstic comments about my family members. He told me if I stay with him, he could make the changes according to my request, but everything are too late, I do not want to have partnership with such person without minimum respect for individual.</p>
              <p>Reasons why I want to stop being his relief:</p>
              <p>1) Take advance call he say I cheapskate, knn it's all because he sometimes could not handover car on time.</p>
              <p>2) Cannot take pax from sea side like east coast, because a lot of sands, wtf? Since when I didn't clean up?</p>
              <p>3) Late in handing car oftenly with lot's of crap reasons.</p>
              <p>4) Have to pump diesel for him, and lugi $x most times.</p>
              <p>5) He is rude in conversations and like to cannon with commanding tone, ccb, I'm not his employee.</p>
              <p>6) Ask a lot of personal queations, wtf have to do with him? He really think he is my uncle, knn.</p>
