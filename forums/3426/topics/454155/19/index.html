              <p>I'm using GPS, but sometimes it just keeps recalculating at
              certain areas. Although the GPS fail me sometimes, but I would say,
              without it, I won't be able to even make $50 a night. When I even
              out my average daily profit over the past month, it's about $100
              daily, sometimes $160 - $200, sometimes $50 - $80. I think I need
              about another year or two to be really more well verse in
              route.</p>

              <p>It's not that I boycott the whole CDB area, I have my own favourite locations in or near CBD. I have not drive day shift before, but I don't think night shift is any easier either, you can say my luck is good, but honestly I work very hard between 6pm - 12pm, no chit chat and long breaks, only 2-3 short smoke/toilet breaks. There are days that I only make $60, where got easy? You said I still can survive, but whenever my friend who is also driving taxi ask me my collection at 12am, he usually will laugh at me saying I no standard even when I hit $80 profit. It really makes me think what is the maket standard for old bird from 6pm - 12am so that I can works towards it.</p>

Whenever I post my profit in this forum and someone will say that night shift so easy to get $$$, seams like the profit I have been generating for the past month is good to them or they are preventing more people to join in the taxi trade? If latter mentioned is the reason, then I'm not worried, because most people will only take up this job full-time as a last choice. Most drivers keeps their real daily taking to themselves, I really have a hard time knowing who I should benchmark myself.  </p></div>

              steroetype of passengers that I hate to pick up, some due to
              unfamiliar to the road with lot's of small streets and endless
              turning to left and right with construction going on. At the

              <p>St James didn't even cross my mind before. 12am - 3am I have my own favourite locations, not die die must go drinking places. Not everybody who stay out late must be some drunkard dogs. By 1am if the field is cold, I'll go makan then after that if no changes I'll keep. During my first 2 weeks, I usually drove until end of my shift, now seldom unless got form and the field is full of pax waving. </p>
              <p>I have never Q @ Cineleisure and MSQ b4. I don't mind taking long trips from CBD to HDB areas(Even to the West). Those trips and locations old bird don't want, all I take, no point wasting time to compete on the $3 surcharge when I can get pax around me. With good connections at times in certain HDB areas, my collections are better than staying in CBD.</p>
              <p>I'm still at the discovery stage, so collections are not consistant, and somedays/time when the pax demands changes, I could not react accordingly. Still searching for more new way of generating collections.</p>

              12pm, no chit chat and long breaks, only 2-3 short smoke/toilet
              breaks. There are days that I only make $60, where got easy? You
              said I still can survive, but whenever my friend who is also
              driving taxi ask me my collection at 12am, he usually will laugh at
              me saying I no standard even when I hit $80 profit. It really makes
