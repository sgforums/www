              <p>Sometime, we hv to understand that when both motorists are inside their car, be it a taxis or private car, the only communication is the horn, highbeam and maybe tailgate, therefore, unlike when you are walking and you want to by pass someone, you will say, excuse me, or sorry or please, and thank you, but in a car, you use the horn, and that horn expression/sound is alway taken as nasty, but the intention can be, please, can you move one side, thank you.</p>

              <p>MIA, lol. </p>
              <p>Recently very busy. My mom was ward in NUH again. The 2 cord in her throat was not opening when she tried to breath, almost pass away. Every evening visit her and start driving at around 8-9pm just to cover cost. Morale dam low in driving. She's was discharged yesterday. Just like her, I can breath better now and concentrate on my driving.</p>
              <p>Started with the new hirer (4.30pm - 4.30am), first 2 days already late about 30 mins. Third day 40 mins before handover already rush me to go back, saying that he have regular pickup every morning at 4.30am, huh? That means he expect me to handover before my shift ends everyday? Knn........ I gave him back the key with 3 days notice, didn't want to just throw key and walk away, not my style. There are lot's of hirer in CCK, but to stay on with one is so difficult. Some not punctual in handover, some 'makan' diesel, some talk like they are my director, sigh.......    </p>
              <p>Recently night shift driving was quite bad for me, don't know about others. After 12am very difficult to get pax, really OBK, most days only make $xx.</p>

              <p>I never have problem in handover on time since day 1 of driving taxi though only a few months on the road. The hirer have to reach his pax destination by 4.30am, that means he expect me to keep early every night, how can he have this kind of expectation?</p>

              <p><br>I support. But then, businessman are businessman, these hirers just want some extra while not driving but yet cannot let go the last pax syndrome.</p>
              <p>some even think the cab belong to them...I told them never assume, you are just a hirer, if both of us think like this, cab company will just ass you and me.</p>
