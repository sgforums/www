I signal right changed lane and zoom off, knn, this kind of cheapskate want to save that 60 cents difference in metre. Got taxi still want to pick and choose, dam cb. After I zoom off, in my heart, I feel dam shiok. It balance up my frustration, for being rejected by pax for the past few days for not knowing the route. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p></div>

              <p>Thanks to the tips from this taxi forum. Whenever I see the opposite direction of certain areas taxi are mostly hired, I just charge towards the direction they comes from. Usually those makan places, where after party pax go supper or pax have breakfast before going to work. Sometimes also have chee hong kia send gals back home. HDB within HDB, at times if good luck can get about $30/hr. However, last night don't know what happened, only fetch $10 in and hour, went for nasi lemak at Upper Thomson then keep early.  </p>

              <p>Yes I think true, night better for newbie. Night from 6 to midnight got surcharge. Morning from 6-930am, no nonsense must go drive properly cannot idle, plus everywhere jam and ERP all over.</p>
              <p>Even after 930 must be careful got a lot of eyes on the roads (LTA, TP cameras etc), make a mistake and it will be easily spotted. Stopping and parking also problem especially in town.</p>
              <p>At night, after 8 pm some places you can let your guard down a bit.</p>
              <p>Plus lesser car on the roads, you can drive around and learn places easier.</p>

              <p>Night driving must earn more than day driving, that is why it is call the graveyard shift, in any jobs, be it security or operator or those 24hrs enterprise such as airport, seaport or macdonald, staffs working nite is sure to earn more than their colleague working in the day, it is either their shift allowance is higher or their hourly wages is higher. That is a fact, otherwise, who want to work at nite?</p>
              <p>So for a td driving at nite, logically speaking, he must earn much higher, cos he sacrificed his normal living life or family life with kids and family at nite. If he earns lesser, than he better be a day driver.</p>

              <p>Having said that, I do think day driving is healthier, I dunno for all but maybe for me alone.</p>
              <p>Day you wake up with the sun and usually will sleep early by 10-12 midnight usually, sometimes even earlier.</p>
              <p>Night for me, must sleep before the sun rises, if not, the window comes and goes, if miss the 630 to 7am boat, then next time will be around 8 to 9. Miss that, then 10am, and it goes like that every 2 hours, sometimes after night shift I can only sleep at noon, like that how to get up at 4 or 5 pm and drive, even if do so, will be damn sleepy.</p>
              <p>Day you miss your night time slot, you can get up later got pax on the otr still. Even if you start at 10am, still can cari makan. Night you start everytime at 8pm or later, die cxxx stand. Of course sometimes can make it, but long run cannot.</p>
              <p>Even then sometimes after nigth shift I sleep early before 5am and get up after a full 8-10 hours sleep, still drive a few hours feel damn lethargic.</p>
              <p>So got good and bad. I stll drive night but I think eventually I wll have to go do day.</p>
              <p>But to each his own I guess</p>

              <p>Yeah it's very possible or doable what he does, but in his case I think he has to work until the wee hours of the morning to target his specific pax, be it airport or night shift staff and party goers' Maybe he doesn't need to sweep like many do or drive up and down, but all the same, he has sacrifise his time to meet this targets, by standing by for the pick-up.</p>
              <p>But idle like me, after midnight wanna close shop as soon as possible. I seldom drive 8 hours on weekdays, sometimes only 5-6 hours, that also with break.</p>
              <p>But generally speaking if you start late as a 'nighter' and have no strategy, sure obk. </p>
