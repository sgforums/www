              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/pig.png" alt="pig.png"> Sorry bros that I dissapeared myself for a while. OBK? Yes you're rigth, both eyes. I have been driving 12 hrs everyday inclusive of 1 hr meal break. Everyday making almost double of what I used to make. See more money in the pocket, but pain here pain there. Why need to make more? Because I got myself into some trouble with the taxi I drove and lost some money, dam heart pain. Managed to cover up the lost and made more extra.</p>
              <p>My stamina in driving has improved. Everyday drive 300km - 370km, it might be 'Normal' for lot's of old bird here, but I'm really proud of myself for the improvement. My options in sweeping/waiting area after midnight has widened. I tried some sweeping/ waiting techniques/locations which I saw used by other TD, and used to think that they are stupid, somehow it works.</p>
              <p>Few days ago, I took an advance call from Tembusu to Woodlands. After pax boarded and on the way out my right rear tyre punctured in Jurong Island. Tow truck refused to go in due to the trouble in changing pass. I have to drive out of Jurong Island till reached Jurong pier with a punctured tyre.Called the recovery hotline again, the guy reached within 30 mins, changed the tyre and i paid $30 for the service. Tyre beyond repair have to pay another $50 the next day, knn. Lost of rental fees and diesel due to wasting of time, no mood to drive, keep after tyre changed. Jurong Island? Not again for me. Lugi more than $100 that night.</p>

              <p>Anyway, good to see you had improved and working hard, but take care brother, alway learn to do thing progressively, especially so when we are not so young anymore, start with 200, then 220, then 280, then 300, then maybe 350 ++, allow your body to slowly adapt,</p>
              <p>Have a off day to rest, set up a pattern of your driving, slowing, once the body adapt and the experiences gained, you will drive with more ease, and maybe got time to do some other thing you so wish to do, like going to batam or jb. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>In any business or trade, hiccup alway happens, bus also can break down, ship engine can jam up, hawker stall electrical box can burnt up, so, take it as a pinch of salt, puncture is of course suay lah, but it happen to nearly everyone driving, so if Jurong island cos puncture, you not going there, then one day orchard road also puncture, how? Take it easy, as the chinese saying, money no go out, how can big fortune come in??</p>

              <p>Yesterday first trip took an advanced call from Tembusu to Orchard Hotel. AYE jam till Portsdown, detour to Clementi Ave 6 go by Holland also jam, reached destination in 2 hrs, right leg step on break until dam tired. Fare was almost $70, pax pissed off and me too. </p>
              <p>Whenever I'm around town and need a short break, my base is at Newton FC. So... if you see someone's head that look like sotong smoking at the carpark, that's me. I think my appetitite is getting better now, 3 meals a day, used to be 2 since driving taxi.</p>
              <p>Picked up a few trips of couples going hotel after drink, their conversations was juicy, but when I turn around to collect fare and I saw their face, I feel like vommiting. Now I truly understand why some guys rather pay $$$ to enjoy at Orchard Tower or Thai Disco, rather  than looking for one night stand at Clarke Quay. When you pay peanuts, you get monkeys. When you don't pay, you'll get.................?   </p>

When they block the way or suddenly change lane I also horn until they heart jump out, hee hee. Most of the time I'm able to keep on the correct lane now, and rely less on GPS except when travelling on East area. </p>
              <p>Every night see accident happening, always remind myself to keep a safe distance between myself and the front vehicle. I tried to think and behave like one my friend who had been driving taxi for years, and end up collections going down nights by nights. I repositioned myself at my own pace and things got better. Every night I drives at least 8 hrs to make $xxx now. </p>
              <p>For the past few nights, keep on picking up couples after some drink. Some cheapo guys keeps on begging for sex from the lady, and lady keeps refusing, dam irritating. Really feel like giving the guy some money and ask him go Geylang instead. If the lady really like him, the legs already open big big liao, why have to put himself so low?</p>
              <p>The past few days collections has been great, $2xx before cost until Monday night, by 1am everywhere dead. </p>
              <p>Always wanted to pamper myself with some good food after 12am, but can't find a good place with nice food and easy parking. Hope I can find a good 'Zhe Char' after midnight. Those places which I go for supper after midnight are:</p>
              <p>1) Balestier Rd ( Martaban Rd) for BKT/ Sichuan ma lak steamboat.</p>
              <p>2) Bt. Batok ( Near BBDC) for Teochew porridge.</p>
              <p>3) Newton FC ( BBQ Seafood).</p>
              <p>4) Yishun ( Near Blk 291) for roti plata</p>
              <p>5) East Coast Sevice Rd carpark E2 for Indian food.</p>
              <p>You guys have any other suggestion? Hopefully some zhe char place where I can eat leisurely for 45 mins.</p>
