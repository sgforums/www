              <p>Some old birds here might disagree with me. I believe most bro
                  here would suggest newbie to drive day shift. However, I strongly
                  recommend night shift for newbie. </p>
              <p>The peak hour/City surcharge and midnight charge, greatly helps
                  to compensate the incompetency of a newbie to generate a more
                  acceptable income.</p>
              <p>The road after 12am are less conjested, so, newbie can auto roam
                  and get familiar with the CBD area more leisurely, and changing of
                  lane suddenly are much easier.</p>
              <p>If lucky enough, just need to pick up 2 different pax within
                  CBD, and the 3rd going to long distance, could fetch about $40 -
                  $50 in an hour. The down side of long distance is that have to
                  travell 20km back to town after the long journey. Sometimes when
                  luck is on my side, I only need to travell 200km in a shift, to
                  make the same amount of profit as 300km. </p>

              <p>Thanks to the tips from this taxi forum. Whenever I see the
              opposite direction of certain areas taxi are mostly hired, I just
              charge towards the direction they comes from. Usually those makan
              places, where after party pax go supper or pax have breakfast
              before going to work. Sometimes also have chee hong kia send gals
              back home. HDB within HDB, at times if good luck can get about
              $30/hr. However, last night don't know what happened, only fetch
              $10 in and hour, went for nasi lemak at Upper Thomson then keep
              early.  </p>

              <p>Today is my best collection day, and my worst encounter with passengers since I started driving taxi 3 weeks ago. The mileage was 260km, however profit was $2xx., double of my normal day.</p>
              <p>First pax on call CCK go Fullerton. Made 1 wrong turn at Ophir Road, gave $3.25 discount, she still not happy, on the way still said a lot of bird word. Shouldn't have take her call and let her drench under the rain.</p>
              <p>Last pax, pick up 4 very drunk Korean. They look o.k. from the taxi stand at Lucky Plaza, but when board taxi all 4 knock out. They wanted to go Bt Timah Road, Cashew Road, and Diary Farm. When reached, they was so drunk that they could not confirm where to stop. End up going round and round, when asked them straight or turn, they turn verbally violence, follow by banging on the window with vulgar language. Tried to reach for the emergency button, but was too nervous to locate it.</p>
              <p>Until no choice I have to persuade one of the guy to drop a long Cashew. Then I tried to hunt for condo at Diary farm, saw one charged in and bingo.... that's where they stay. I was thinking will they refuse to pay up and what should I do if they turn violence, and luckily, one of the guy was gentlement enough to pay the full fare. He drop his phone in the cab, I helped him to search through the whole cab twice, until I found it under the front seat, wonder how he drop until there. He got his phone back and said thank you, alcohol really alter a person's character. I think.... he is a nice guy when he is without alcohol.</p>

              <p>Usually it takes me 9-10 hours to make $100, including meal/smoke break. Daily spend about 10-11hrs on the on the road, with the remaining hour to wash car and pump diesel. Very tired, hope can improve myself ASAP to make the the same amount with shorter hours like those seasoned drivers here. </p>
