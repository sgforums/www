              <p>To anonymous ,</p>
              <p>I may sound rude but wad the F do u even wanna drive a cab if your pay is 5k ? seriously , i dont understand why peeps think cab profession is really being their own boss and can earn a lot &amp; the freedom involved. Please do not believe wat the papers advertise or see poolman's earnings record in here ( Poolman is half human half robot cabby , cannot compare).</p>
              <p>(1) As for someone earning 5k , you are probably one who gives orders to your juniors, Can you , for a start , get ordered around where to go by pax? turn left , turn right , go here , go there , lan lan u have to obey. can you stomach that? Being ordered where to go contravenes the FIRST perk of being cabby ' BE YOUR OWN BOSS' (whoever invent this statement can ask them kiss my ass )</p>
              <p>(2) Driving cab retards your mind and after a while , before u know it , thats the only thing you can do and u get stuck in this crap for a long long time. 2001 i started , till now , all the kakis i knew then are still !!!...   well holding the steering. Some ventured out to work and came back again. The only thing we can brag is that we drive from small corona to big crown to turbo sonata. big fucking deal??</p>
              <p>(3) To earn close to what you are getting now , hmmm then you have to make your taxi a permanent home . you eat sleep shit in it then maybe can get close. Other than that , be very happy to live with a pay range of 2k to 2.5k and very very solid 3k .</p>
              <p>(4) Day in and day out , its the same shit. i regret coming into this line in 2001 , i thought it was fun but now at 2010 , i come to get sick of this trade . Well no other options , so stick with it la.</p>
              <p>(5) As and when you decide to quit and go back to work ? what are u going to put in your resume? taxi driver from - to -? The reason why i cant find a proper job is i have nothing on my resume to start off with, drive 10 years taxi? hahaha</p>
              <p>(6) Freedom this word comes with a price , the moment u park your cab , you earn ZERO ,  KOSONG , ZILCH but with a job , there are times where u can idle a bit but you still get PAID.So many perks go along with a job , i wonder why wanna be taxi driver huh?</p>
              <p>Unless you have a huge amt of savings or near to zero liability , then by all means , go ahead and drive , it can be fun without the stress but if you are a family man , please reconsider . This year you earn 2 k per mth , 10 years later ( if there are no fare adjustments ) you will still be earning 2k per mth or maybe lesser coz you lose the energy and strength.</p>
              <p>Please , for all newbies that think cab driving is fun la , freedom la , blah blah , please look thru this post and THINK again.</p>
              <p>I am someone who is very sick of this trade , and wanna juz get out if there are better options BUT hahaha better options? not now , maybe next time or never at all</p>

              <p>Hi Bro Anonymous,</p>
              <p>If you cannot tahan office politics and craps? Can you tahan give paxs F you upside down?</p>
              <p>I'm also holding an office job, driving as part time over the weekend (thurs, fri, sat &amp; sun) I told my wife this, unless i tio retrench and unable to find job. Driving full time taxi will be my last resort. It is not an easy life being cabby.</p>
              <p>Hope what you pm Bro Poolman is a new year joke !! :)</p>

              <p>Bro Annoymous, u must be kidding!  I am also a new bird in this taxi trade, only driving for about 4 months only, OMO.  But I joined cos I have not much of a choice.  Kena retrenched, I used to earn 5k as a technical manager with a plastic moulding co; got 40% pay cut early last yr n eventually, 'copper' handshake! (copper cos lousy retrenchment payout). </p>
              <p>I am already into my early 50s, so it is not easy to get another job, less said about close to 5k pay, lol. As a taxi driver, I need to clock in about 12 hours daily, 6 days a week, to make close to my last drawn pay (after 40% pay cut one).  Luckily, wife is also working, so still manageable.  But I have no other choice, at my age cab driving is one solution.  With my girl in uni, boy entering NS soon, I have to but take everything in my stride and go all out to make a living.  Driving a taxi cannot equate to being your own boss.  Do not forget there are no staff benefits, CPF, medical leave etc.  I went for hol with family during Dec and for that period, zero income for me.</p>
              <p>So unless you are really really very piss off with your current job and unable to get another job,  taxi driving is not a wise choice; esp if you are still in your prime. </p>
              <p>Wishing you all the best for the new year, make wise decisions, not hasty ones bro!</p>
