              <p>Bros Poolman,i support you too.Maybe you can write something like that</p>
              <p><span><strong>A sweet lesson on patience.<br></strong><br>A NYC Taxi driver wrote:<br><br>I arrived at the address and honked the horn. After waiting a few minutes I honked again. Since this was going to be my last ride of my shift I thought about just driving away, but instead I put the car in park and walked up to the door and knocked.. 'Just a minute', answered a frail, elderly voice. I could hear something being dragged across <span>the floor.<br><br>After a long pause, the door opened. A small woman in her 90's stood before me. She was wearing a print dress and a pillbox hat with a veil pinned on it, like somebody out of a 1940's movie.<br><br>By her side was a small nylon suitcase. The apartment looked as if no one had lived in it for years. All the furniture was covered with sheets.<br><br>There were no clocks on the walls, no knickknacks or utensils on the counters. In the corner was a cardboard<br>box filled with photos and glassware.<br><br>'Would you carry my bag out to the car?' she said. I took the suitcase to the cab, then returned to assist the woman.<br><br>She took my arm and we walked slowly toward the curb.<br><br>She kept thanking me for my kindness. 'It's nothing', I told her.. 'I just try to treat my passengers the way I would want my mother to be treated.'<br><br>'Oh, you're such a good boy, she said. When we got in the cab, she gave me an address and then asked, 'Could you drive<br>through downtown?'<br><br>'It's not the shortest way,' I answered quickly..<br><br>'Oh, I don't mind,' she said. 'I'm in no hurry. I'm on my way to a hospice.<br><br>I looked in the rear-view mirror. Her eyes were glistening. 'I don't have any family left,' she continued in a soft voice..'The doctor says I don't have very long.' I quietly reached over and shut off the meter.<br><br>'What route would you like me to take?' I asked.<br><br>For the next two hours, we drove through the city. She showed me the building where she had once worked as an elevator operator.<br><br>We drove through the neighborhood where she and her husband had lived when they were newlyweds She had me pull up in front of a furniture warehouse that had once been a ballroom where she had gone dancing as a girl.<br><br>Sometimes she'd ask me to slow in front of a particular building or corner and would sit staring into the darkness, saying nothing.<br><br>As the first hint of sun was creasing the horizon, she suddenly said, 'I'm tired.Let's go now'.<br>We drove in silence to the address she had given me. It was a low building, like a small convalescent home, with a driveway that passed under a portico.<br><br>Two orderlies came out to the cab as soon as we pulled up. They were solicitous and intent, watching her every move.<br>They must have been expecting her.<br><br>I opened the trunk and took the small suitcase to the door. The woman was already seated in a wheelchair.<br><br>'How much do I owe you?' She asked, reaching into her purse.<br><br>'Nothing,' I said<br><br>'You have to make a living,' she answered.<br><br>'There are other passengers,' I responded.<br><br>Almost without thinking, I bent and gave her a hug.She held onto me tightly.<br><br>'You gave an old woman a little moment of joy,' she said. 'Thank you.'<br><br>I squeezed her hand, and then walked into the dim morning light.. Behind me, a door shut.It was the sound of the closing of a life..<br><br>I didn't pick up any more passengers that shift. I drove aimlessly lost in thought. For the rest of that day,I could hardly talk.What if that woman had gotten an angry driver,or one who was impatient to end his shift? What if I had refused to take the run, or had honked once, then driven away?<br><br>On a quick review, I don't think that I have done anything more important in my life.<br><br>We're conditioned to think that our lives revolve around great moments.<br><br>But great moments often catch us unaware-beautifully wrapped in what others may consider a small one.</span></span></p>

              <p>I pressed meter , but once he saw below with 35% , he asked roughly how much to go from here to Chinatown .</p>

              <p>Government or LTA should give out a certain amount of taxi vouchers to senior citizens apply for free taxi rides for a certain of amount of money each month .</p>

              <p>Vouchers are printed with their names and IC number , only those applicants that applied can use this vouchers .</p>
              <p>And it can only be paid only when alone taking a cab , not with family or friends .</p>
              <p>Cabbies may use this vouchers to redeem from taxi companies or redeem thru they respective diesel kisok .</p>

              <p>Good deed stories .</p>
              <p>A few years back , before i joined LV .</p>
              <p>Sweep road era .</p>
              <p>That time peak hr still 35% .</p>
              <p>But already got cbd $3 surcharge .</p>
              <p>I was Q-ing at People's Park Complex taxi stand .</p>
              <p>Here come walking towards my cab an old man , with an umbrella as walking stick .</p>
              <p>Slowly walked step by step cautiously into my cab .</p>
              <p>I see also scared scared , scared he sekali fall down , like buay zai buay zai , shaky shaky like that .</p>
              <p>He made it .</p>
              <p>He closed door and point me towards Keong Saik Road .</p>
              <p>I pressed meter , but once he saw below with 35% , he asked roughly how much to go from here to Chinatown .</p>
              <p>I didn't answer , i drove on .</p>
              <p>Make a left turn and slowly filter out to make a U turn , in minutes , i reached Keong Saik , but he say in Cantonese , Ngow Chay Sui Hey Yun .</p>
              <p>Blur liao , he point straight . i followed instructions . But i think he is going to Kreta Ayer Threatre area .</p>
              <p>End of Keong Saik , he said stop .</p>
              <p>I stopped , he wanted to give me a $10 .</p>
              <p>Without hesistation , natural instinct , i said back in cantonese : " Hm sai leh , hm sao nie lui . "</p>
              <p>Translation : No need , not collecting any money from you .</p>
              <p>He said Thank you , i see he go down also shaky shaky , got down of my cab , holds the door , hold his right arm and settle him down before i move on .</p>
              <p>He said Hm Koi , and walked step by step up to dunno where .</p>
              <p>I saw him walked slowly for about one minute later then i moved on .</p>
              <p>Felt good . . . cos i am still inside CBD , thank god .</p>

              <p>Like $100 value of $5 vouchers .</p>
              <p>Vouchers are printed with their names and IC number , only those
