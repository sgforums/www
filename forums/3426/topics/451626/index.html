              <p>Bros Poolman,i support you too.Maybe you can write something like that</p>
              <p><span class="hasCaption"><strong>A sweet lesson on patience. <br></strong> <br> A NYC Taxi driver wrote:<br> <br> I arrived at the address and honked the horn. After waiting a few 
              minutes I honked again. Since this was going to be my last ride of my 
              shift I thought about just driving away, but instead I put the car in 
              park and walked up to the door and knocked.. 'Just a minute', answered a
               frail, elderly voice. I could hear something being dragged across<span class="text_exposed_show"> the floor.<br> <br> After a long pause, the door opened. A small woman in her 90's stood 
              before me. She was wearing a print dress and a pillbox hat with a veil 
              pinned on it, like somebody out of a 1940's movie.<br> <br> By her side 
              was a small nylon suitcase. The apartment looked as if no one had lived 
              in it for years. All the furniture was covered with sheets.<br> <br> There were no clocks on the walls, no knickknacks or utensils on the counters. In the corner was a cardboard<br> box filled with photos and glassware.<br> <br> 'Would you carry my bag out to the car?' she said. I took the suitcase to the cab, then returned to assist the woman.<br> <br> She took my arm and we walked slowly toward the curb.<br> <br> She kept thanking me for my kindness. 'It's nothing', I told her.. 'I 
              just try to treat my passengers the way I would want my mother to be 
              treated.'<br> <br> 'Oh, you're such a good boy, she said. When we got in the cab, she gave me an address and then asked, 'Could you drive<br> through downtown?'<br> <br> 'It's not the shortest way,' I answered quickly..<br> <br> 'Oh, I don't mind,' she said. 'I'm in no hurry. I'm on my way to a hospice.<br> <br> I looked in the rear-view mirror. Her eyes were glistening. 'I don't 
              have any family left,' she continued in a soft voice..'The doctor says I
               don't have very long.' I quietly reached over and shut off the meter.<br> <br> 'What route would you like me to take?' I asked.<br> <br> For the next two hours, we drove through the city. She showed me the 
              building where she had once worked as an elevator operator.<br> <br> We 
              drove through the neighborhood where she and her husband had lived when 
              they were newlyweds She had me pull up in front of a furniture warehouse
               that had once been a ballroom where she had gone dancing as a girl.<br> <br> Sometimes she'd ask me to slow in front of a particular building or 
              corner and would sit staring into the darkness, saying nothing.<br> <br> As the first hint of sun was creasing the horizon, she suddenly said, 'I'm tired.Let's go now'.<br> We drove in silence to the address she had given me. It was a low 
              building, like a small convalescent home, with a driveway that passed 
              under a portico.<br> <br> Two orderlies came out to the cab as soon as we pulled up. They were solicitous and intent, watching her every move.<br> They must have been expecting her.<br> <br> I opened the trunk and took the small suitcase to the door. The woman was already seated in a wheelchair.<br> <br> 'How much do I owe you?' She asked, reaching into her purse.<br> <br> 'Nothing,' I said<br> <br> 'You have to make a living,' she answered.<br> <br> 'There are other passengers,' I responded.<br> <br> Almost without thinking, I bent and gave her a hug.She held onto me tightly.<br> <br> 'You gave an old woman a little moment of joy,' she said. 'Thank you.'<br> <br> I squeezed her hand, and then walked into the dim morning light.. 
              Behind me, a door shut.It was the sound of the closing of a life..<br> <br> I didn't pick up any more passengers that shift. I drove aimlessly lost
               in thought. For the rest of that day,I could hardly talk.What if that 
              woman had gotten an angry driver,or one who was impatient to end his 
              shift? What if I had refused to take the run, or had honked once, then 
              driven away?<br> <br> On a quick review, I don't think that I have done anything more important in my life.<br> <br> We're conditioned to think that our lives revolve around great moments.<br> <br> But great moments often catch us unaware-beautifully wrapped in what others may consider a small one.</span></span></p>
