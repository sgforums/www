                  <p>Seven vehicles were involved in two separate collisions, which happened about 15 minutes apart, at the same place in Yishun on Sunday night.</p>
                  <p>The incidents occurred at the junction Yishun Ave 2 and Ave 5, next to Yishun MRT station and Northpoint shopping centre.</p>
                  <p>Police received a call at 11.20pm about the first incident, which involved a TransCab taxi, a motorcycle and a car.</p>

                  The injured taxi driver, a man in his 60s, and motorcyclist were sent to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH).</p>
                  <p>According to the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), the taxi driver had chest discomfort and giddiness, and the motorcyclist, a man in his 30s, had multiple abrasions to his body and neck and back pain.</p>
                  <p>Police received another call at 11.32pm about a second incident at the same junction, this time involving three Comfort taxis and a black BMW.</p>
                  <p>Eyewitnesses whom The New Paper spoke to said there was a crash and the BMW flipped, turned over and landed. The impact shattered its windows and deployed the vehicle's airbags.</p>
                  <p>"Passers-by who had been helping at the first accident quickly ran over to help the driver and his passengers out of the car," said Aqil Faiz, 18, a student who was at the scene.</p>
                  <p>Aqil said all victims were conscious.</p>
                  <p>"There was no screaming or crying. The passengers were all quiet. But the entire junction was filled with glass and debris," he said.</p>
                  <p>Two people were injured in the second accident, the BMW driver and one of his passengers. Both are men in their 30s and 40s. One had multiple cuts to his legs, while the other had a cut to his left ear.</p>
                  <p>They were also taken to KTPH. Police are currently investigating the collisions.</p>

              <p>When you pick accident death one, be prepare they ask you where are you taking them, what is happen, how is my taxi or my car, hey hey, where are you going. Just keep quiet and drive, reach Block 9, just shout, get down, the rest leave it to the hospital to deal with it.</p>
              <p>Understood that some asked me, do they really talk to me, the answer is no, but the feeling is very strong, the six sense or they call it the mind eye is open, like it or not, believe it or not, you have to respect it.</p>
              <p>Earthly people are so attached to this world called earth that when it is time to leave, they still want to clinch on it, like holding on a pole and refusing to let go, but this world is a suffering world, we are all born crying, no one is born smiling or laughing, because no one want to be here, but since you are here, might as well get on with it, then as the years passed, you become so accustomed to this world that you think it is the only world in this universe dimension, that when it is time for you to go, you refuse to go.</p>

              <p>A lady of mid forties, this type death is the worst, not time to go, but resigned themselves to go, the spirit is very strong, like looking for revenge, like wanting to seek justice but cannot get it, a very frustrating spirit, you have to handle with uptmost care, again try to be quiet as much as possible, and also do not promise anything, it is very sensitive to promise, once you give empty promises, they got all the right, from heaven to hell to go after you. If you think that our world where words can kill, it is ten times worst there, that is also why many pples get into trouble with spirits and gods because of empty or broken promises.</p>
