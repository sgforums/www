              <p>The Question here is the key word Talent or so called Foreign Talented people becoming Singapore citizens.</p>
              <p>So is Taxi driving consider a talent occupation? Do TD earning put them under the talent group?</p>
              <p>To what I can gather Talent are consider as the PMEs, the professional, the managerial and the executives, not even engineers and technicians or some admin staffs.</p>
              <p>So are we attracting the right talent to be our citizen or merely more Taxi driver as our talent pool? If the later is true, then our govt have to really examine themselves as to what talents they have got into our society.</p>
              <p>I am not saying that this former PRC guy is wrong or at fault, he has every right as a singaporean to be a TD, for that, I respect it. However, on the holistic view of attracting foreign talents by our govt need to review and explained, Foreign Talents become our citizen end up driving taxis??? or is there a conspiracy theory behind our Taxi trade</p>

              <p>I will hv to qualify that what we are attracting are 3rd world third tier talents who are consider trash in their country, and these people are very hungry, renowned all their citizenship of their motherland and hope to make it big here, but end up, like most of us, meet the end of the wall that shed no light at the end of the long tunnel.</p>
              <p>In reverse, they now are committed to pay and pay like us, with family, ah ma, ah kong, uncles and aunties all brought in, then suddenly thunder strike and lost their job or cannot get a good salaried job, end up moonlighting taxis or drive permanently.</p>
              <p>Because, in no way, they are going back and tell their relatives they cannot make it, a total lost of face.</p>
              <p>Anyway, as I said, I am not against them being TD, just that the finger still point to the govt, are you bringing in real talent or TD?</p>

              <p>Retrenchment will be avoided as far as possible to avoid paying retrenchment benefits. They will just tell u that ur performance is not up to expectation. Either u resign or be terminated.</p>
