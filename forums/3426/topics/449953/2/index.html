              <p><br>That's what most brothers said before, OPEN YOUR MOUTH AND ASK FOR THE ROUTE first. TD must be good in communication skill, whereever I take from CBD or any surcharges, I will also inform paxs, whether they know or not will not become an issue. If they ask, I will spell out the whole surcharges and peak hours to them, that is why it is important to know what your trade well.</p>
              <p>Pax bought at City Hall, going to bukit manis, Sentosa</p>
              <p>bowah: Sir, this is CBD period, a surcharge of $3 apply, and now is after 6pm, peak hour of 25% of fare apply, as for sentosa, for 2 paxs, $3 entry fees apply thru my cashcard provided that you have access to sentosa as guest or resident. Is this ok with you.</p>
              <p>Paxs: Ok, just drive, thank you, very informative, by the way, up till now, we still do not quite understand taxis fees and surcharge.</p>
              <p>bowah: Peak hours from........surcharge CBD after 5pm apply ...bla bla...you can google it at taxi fare structure in singapore.</p>
              <p>Pax: Oh, good. Thanks</p>
              <p>You must be the commander of your trade, not the pax, and to be one, you need good communication skill, once you have that, pax will respect you. You are the TD, you command the taxi, not the pax. </p>

              <p>As for viet or PRC peoples, they tends to shout instead of speaking, so, you shout back, just like GEYLAND LOR 32!!!!, I will shout back OK!!!! GEYLAND LOR 32!!!, it is their culture to talk very loud, learn to gel into pax characteristic and manner, once you are able to gel into them, eveything will be easier and friendlier, in a way, you speak their tunes and calm them down.</p>
              <p>Most of these viet and PRC or third world peoples come from a country whereby their taxis driver tends to cheat them of fares, ultimately, in singapore, they think the same, so you got to ask for the routes, on the meter and stick by the instruction if given.</p>

              <p>As for viet or PRC peoples, they tends to shout instead of
              speaking, so, you shout back, just like GEYLAND LOR 32!!!!, I will
              shout back OK!!!! GEYLAND LOR 32!!!, it is their culture to talk
              very loud, learn to gel into pax characteristic and manner, once
              you are able to gel into them, eveything will be easier and
              friendlier, in a way, you speak their tunes and calm them down.</p>
              <p>Most of these viet and PRC or third world peoples come from a
              country whereby their taxis driver tends to cheat them of fares,
              ultimately, in singapore, they think the same, so you got to ask
              for the routes, on the meter and stick by the instruction if
              given.</p>
