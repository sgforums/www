              <p>wau pian...frequent gathering you need ,,,mah, with more taxi drivers  and do more exchange programs with them, don't isolated yourself, as like those students in school went overseas.</p>
              <p> at any meeting places, gain more knowledges.</p>
              <p> MC sure a must than make police report...mah.</p>
              <p> that why? without any help, DIY myself... already collected my $6600. ya</p>
              <p>1st timer kookoo ones, right?</p>
              <p>even the tanchiaka are there at the counter, those who take your accident report, don't believe asked any reliefs or hirers who encounted any taxi accident before, whether agents call them... the next few days...so no need lah. no koo koo.. only my merbok bird sing koo koo when it's happy singing....hehe.</p>
              <p>$200 so easy to earn.</p>
              <p> 3 months  collecting cheque...so easy as abc... can closed a case</p>
              <p>How.... it all depend on your opponent insurance ( as like a few Insurances  (I) (C) (N..C) companies cannot mention here)whether they can close your fast, even 100% win win case.</p>
              <p>than whether you accepted their counter compensation...if not, you still need to go further. some may be more than six to eight months, some till today still waiting for their cheque, as one of my kakis...$13000. his case is more than a year by now.</p>

              <p>MC if not more than 3 days, dun need to report.</p>
              <p>every taxi drivers oso know, in any case accident... any injuries either serious or minor.... the cabby himself or any passenger on board, need to make police report. this is very basic, injuries can never tell on the spot it can be a few hours later or next day..or.. how? come only with MC 3 days,  than police take the case. wau pian....first time hearing this. which law firm stated this..</p>
              <p>as like  the common senerio , neck pain or chest pain, giddy or feel like vomiting..blurr vision....seeing doctor... make sure you got the receipt from the clinic or private hospital, proven that you consulted. i think that is enough evidence the same date as you encounted the accident...it could be wrong, correct me...ha.</p>
