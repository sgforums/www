              <p>Hi, I would like to know what is the practice or procedure should a relief driver encounter a tyre punture.</p>
              <p>Few weeks ago while driving on Sunday, I had a tyre puncture and I managed to change the spare tyre myself.</p>
              <p>As it is a Sunday and my Hirer is overseas, what I do is wait until he came back to SG and then show him the tyre condition which is confirm beyond repair.</p>
              <p>I told my Hirer that I will bare some of the charges if needed but he insist that is OK as long as I am safe from the incident.</p>
              <p>On the next day,I called him again to ask the status and ask him did Transcab charge him for the repair. Initially, he did not want to tell me but in the end after my persistent, he told me the cost is $60. Again, he say no need for me to pay him as I only drive the second time for him. (For you guys info, this is my second Hirer and the car is Toyota Crown).</p>
              <p>So, can relief driver who encounter such cases share their experience with me ??</p>
              <p>Thanks !!!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>My last puncture tyre has been changed in TC for FOC. If you want to repair it outside, just repair and fix back the spare, why $60 if we pay them rental everyday? If not return the spoil and send it back to inform the workshop. We only pay rental, fuel and damage cost to our Taxi.</div>

              <p>Hi Uncle Pool,thanks for your idea.</p>
              <p>According to my Hirer, why Trancab charge him is because they told him that the thread is almost worn and the Hirer should get them replace immediately instead of still driving. (Also, the workshop notice there is a nail on the puncture tyre) It seems like they are pushing the "responsibilty" to the Hirer.</p>
              <p>However, my experience with my other Hirer is different because when I told him that his 2 tyres need to be change, he told me that Transcab will not change until they confirm that the tyres are beyond usage.</p>
              <p>So I am confused...I thought the daily rental covers the maintenance cost of the vehicle</p>

              <p>Knn, so many crowns scrap, got so many spare tyres and they still want to charge and bargain, this transcab really f u one. Last time my hirer comfort crown got accident and bumper damage, go loyang there, so many spare bumper there, take your pick.</p>
              <p>These service peoples care less about our safety one, tyre thread no more, at least do a re thread lah even if they do not want to change, without thread, raining day if you go beyong 90km downslope, good luck to you. Kenna bang, who cares?? CB wants to save cost for company lah, the more they save, the higher their bonuses</p>

              Not true leh, I had got my tyre changed many times this year, new ones. Even got one time I went for servicing, the mechanic found one of my back tyre has 4 nails in it, he changed a new one for me. I think your hirer bluff you or he did not make the effort to get the tyre fix up. If they really want to save money bcos of a tyre, tell your hirer throw key. Then we pay rental for what??? Taxi Company want us to solve their excess taxi problem, not giving us the problem to solve.

              Ya lor , i agreed with Guess .

              Although f*ck type Indonesian brand .
              
              Realistically changed 4 sets of new tyres , impossible .
              
              Changed 2 still okay .
              
              I again inform my relief next servicing , get another 2 new tyres if possible .

              <p>To Guess?... you said maybe my hirer might bluff me ... I think it should not be. Because I only drive on weekends while he is the main driver who spend most of the time on the road. Surely he will not risk his own life, Right ??</p>
              <p>Since he just join Transcab for less than 6 months, maybe he dunno the rules yet...</p>
              <p>Anyway, his Cab is due for servicing this week. Will update the status on the changing of his cab tyres here on Friday....</p>
