              <p>3 possibilities.</p>
              <p>1. LTA cockup-ed the forecast of scraped vehicles and issue COE like nobody's business as published by the papers.</p>
              <p>2. Govt no $, need to generate income from COE.</p>
              <p>3. Worst case scenario, both of the above.</p>

              <p>PAP no money? Also cannot be lar. Our government is very rich one.</p>
              <p>But one thing for sure, PAP is very determined to bring in more foreigners to provide cheap labour for their government linked companies, and also to top up our shrinking population due to low fertility.</p>
              <p>These foreigners comprise at least half of the total population, and probaby need a car or a truck or a van for their jobs. This is what is causing the roads to be so fully utilised even during off peak hours.</p>

              <p>COE forecast cock up is actually what the LTA wants us to believe. The sudden influx of foreigners is the root cause for this increase in traffic &amp; overcrowding here. More foreigners be them FT or FW, needs for food, accommodation, transport etc. increased thus fattening the pocket of MIW linked companies which indirectly supporting more MIW sah-ka kia.</p>
              <p>GLC losing $ is a fact everybody knows. So there must be some ways to replenish their coffers, ie. increasing demands for everything under the PAP roof, $ will flow in.<br><br>Anyway, I don't trust the MIW and anything their medias say.</p>

              CTE tunnel. It took abt 20 mins to clear that stretch of road.</p>

              @&amp;*%$ NBCCB to LTA engrs who has no cow brain building our
              roads causing jams everyday. Fm 3 lanes to 2 and to only 1 lane to
              merge into CTE. Likewise fm CTE to PIE (Changi) also has only 1
              lane. after so many mths of construction to widen it to 2 lanes,
              what are they doing? still not ready!</p>
              <p>Thats why TPT Minister kerna 'sacked'... oh no, ask to retire...
              no, self retired... wtf?</p>
              <p>The new flyover along west coast rd (across Clementi rd) has no
              safety wall-barricade built on the centre devider. Waiting for some
              asshole driver skid and flung across the other side of the road and
              kill someone innocent. Another poor design by LTA. Sign...</p>
