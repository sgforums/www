              <p>I am an Indian. I stay in Hougang. I drive from 6pm to 6 am. By 2 am already no mood to drive because of the number of rejections and number of greedy taxi drivers of other race.</p>
              <p>I was first in queue after queueing for 15 minutes. At 2am there is still queue at Hougang Plaza. Just imagine queuing for 30 minutes at Changi Airport!</p>
              <p>Now I am at Hougang Plaza and first in line. People arrive. Before I can reject them, they reject me. They went to a Transcab taxi behind.</p>
              <p>These were Chinese Nationals who cannot speak English.Why were they allowed into Singapore! in the first place?</p>
              <p>If these idiots don't have the confidence in speaking the ENGLISH! LANGUAGE! Why were they given entry into SINGAPORE?</p>

              <p>Precisely.</p>
              <p>When I drove Azera also faced some rejections, but what it meant, those who took, are better type of pax, not cheapos.</p>
              <p>Anyway, we as TDs also have some form of stereo-typing, or put it plainly, we have to adopt some of our own SOP based on some racial discrimination. Eg: I don't take Indian FTs - so many reasons mentioned already in other threads. The very saart local Indian gals with education, the Pinoys and Burmese (based on areas resided).</p>
              <p>Then we read in the papers sometimes, Malay youths bash up cabby. Things like this makes avoid these kind of pax, so not to have trouble and waste time.</p>
              <p>But are we racists for doing so? I don't think so. In our line, time is precious and money. Is it fair on our part, maybe an outsider will think so, but when you do the job, you realise you have to be street smart.</p>
              <p>Aand if by being a little biased against some type of pax from certain racial groups, because of a few bad cases by some their own, then just too bad. We are just taking our own precautions. As for Ah Tiongs not wanting to take my cab, I will say thank you very much. Why bother with such pax, and later have communication problem?</p>
              <p>As for speaking English, as a pax I have no complaints with them not speaking. maybe they are lowly educated types, so don't have a chance to learn English. But if they work in front line customer service and I'm the customer, this one I surely fuck, but not them, instead I'll for the idiot who deployed them there, when they can't speak English properly.</p>
              <p>Finally as you know, I did take break from driving a few years back and as such was a regular pax myself. 1 thing I noticed and experienced of course, is as an Indian/Eurasian, it's hard for me to get cab sometimes, maybe because of my race and location. Because the Chinese are the majority, obviously rejection from them will be higher. Before midnight, they wont look at my face, after midnight, they will U-turn to ferry me. But as a Td we all know this.</p>
              <p>And sometimes, because of this I get fed up too, so what I do? If after midnight at a taxi queue, I will skip all the Chinese drivers until I find a malay or Indian. That's my own way of getting back at some Chinese drivers.</p>
              <p>All this part and parcel of life, am I racist? No. But everyone will always have at some point of time, a feelling of kinship with one's own race. It's a natural human trait I feel.</p>
