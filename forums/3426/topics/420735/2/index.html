              <p>Poolman, I 100% agreed what you had said. To me had been driving for about a month Liao. Driving taxi I know is not easy, coz it all up to individual what they needs and wants. Bloody hell had been driving for 10 over years never kana points , just after driving taxi for 3 weeks kana 6points and $150. Damm sway coz I know it should not have got this summons becoz i kana at Nicoll highway. Damm. I already try not to speed Liao but dunno why TP like to beo taxi driver sigh... Another problem Is that my skoda always give me problem haven one month already go in work shop twice and today just kana another one fan belt snap aircon not working so tow back to workshop. Sigh tot of changing another cab. The best new ones coz I intend to drive for long. I now driving day and my relief drive night. So far so good. It just bits and puzzle of taxi drivers life. No regrets. The only regret will be if I can't drive anymore. Hahahahahhahah. Any info that I can get new cabs?</p>

              <p>Every professional has their own hazards , it's how u saw those
              hazards and minimised the side effects .</p>
              <p>Even Ministers also got problem , Balaji just passed away due to
              cancer , PM Lee also once a cancer patient , MM Lee are down with
              heart problem , Mrs Lee strokes , Ong Teng Cheong died of cancer .
              Many more .</p>
              <p>They are not cabbies u know ?</p>
              <p>They live well , eat well , drink well .......Millionaires
              lifestyle .</p>
              <p>It's the level of stress .</p>
              <p>Cabbies are one professional , stress level are low .</p>
              <p>If u analyse all professions , each professions has got their
              own inique problem .</p>
              <p>It's how u deal with it .</p>

              <p>It is true that every job got health hazard, last time, i work as security guard also stand until legs get dumbed, must go exercise to loosen it, for TD, neck pain, leg ankle pain (due to pressing the accelerator), indigestion, urinal tube problem, colon problem and back pain is very common, prolong hours of sitting and driving can be hazardous if we do not take time to rest and rejunvenate ourselves.</p>
              <p>Funny how, instead of healthy rejunvenation, most TDs end up drinking, smoking and some womanising, or worst, gambling all nite,  all these will add more burden to the already tortured body of Driving. Discipline is very important in a so called self employ job, if you lose that discipline, whatever Huat is meaningless, here come in, there go out.</p>
              <p>There is more to life than just driving and picking pax from point to point, use your spare time to do something good for your body. Exercise can be of all sort, depending on your health and age, you can play games, do yoga, jog, brisk walk with love ones and go gyms. Make it 2 to 3 times a week, per session can be an hour to two will do just fine. While exercise is important to rejuvenate yr muscle, cardio function and blood circulation, your diet also play a very important part, as most TD are past 30s, try to eat less, not to worry much about whether it is meat or vege or fruit, just eat less of everything will be fine. I see many people jog all the way to hawker centre to have a big meal, that is wrong.</p>
              <p>Make this year of the rabbit a resolution to trim down those tummy and fat of yours.</p>

              <p>Yes, must listen to Poolie. Driving taxi for long period of time will definitely pull down your health. I have already got the bad effect on my health.</p>
