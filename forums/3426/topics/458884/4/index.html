              <p>Wah! brother, you can hold your urine, very strong lor.</p>
              <p>So I think the picture can be like this,</p>
              <p>There is a slight choke and crack on the urine pipe and it
              connect to the last bathroom, so when your urine, the water splash
              out under gravity pressure, then you stop, go take a look, no more
              urine.</p>
              <p>Then again, you go back urine and the pipe again splash out
              water/urine from the last bathroom, then you stop urinate again, it
              stopped, this continued ...and lastly you went back and sleep.</p>
              <p>And for the recruit who get knocked on his head, must have had
              get his legs entangled with the piece of stick and fell down. Also
              good, staying in hospital better than those chicken farm</p>

              <p>Lolx.. nice stories.. :)</p>
              <p>Btw, let me share my own piece of information.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I personally can see ghost from time to time, however I preferred not to see them unless required.</p>
              <p>Based on my years of experiences/researches, ghost/spirits is created by human ourselves. We even created Heaven and Hell that did not "exist" in the past.</p>
              <p>Your mind must be popping up with WT*/How?! </p>
              <p>Ans: Human has only used 3~5% of our brain cells, what's our 95~97% of the cells doing? They are in "sleeping" mode like what scientist has discovered. So what happen if they are awaken? &amp; at the moment when we are about to "pass away". Our brain cells will awaken anot? No one has an answer. (or they are trying to hide all these "informations")</p>
              <p>We as human always have a belief, after death, heaven or hell will be there.. For those restless, they will remain on "earth". But, does this earth exist after death? Does heaven or hell even exist in the first place? Nope, it doesn't have any heaven or hell UNTIL human believe and there it is, we have created it at the moment when we passed on.</p>
              <p>Those restless spirits/ghost that remained on earth have something to do, mischeif or anything that you can see from page 1, because they believed that they will become like this.</p>
              <p>Frequences brain waves, we have alot of radio waves and etc. What's that to do? We will be able to see those spirits with the same brain waves that's in tune with us, living/dead as long it's in "same wave". Can see each other. Why only at night and not day time? U will be able to see in day time as well, just that most people have not encounter before but I've encounted before. Night time is more "subjective" as human always believed that ghost/spirit only comes out at night. Even if there's a spirit/ghost in that super jam train station, who knows/who cares?! Tio bo? :P</p>
              <p>Cut it short and sweet, believe that it's there but don't think about it. Tune your frequences to "cheerful" ones and you will see lesser of those. That's what I always do when I felt something weird, den tune to my happily experiences that I have encounter on that day.. :)</p>
