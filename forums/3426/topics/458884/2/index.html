              <p>The earth are dwelled with humans like you and me, for that, humans control the earth</p>

              <p>All these are spell out like a traffic rules, so for us, which is human, we control the earth, you can do whatever you want here, and those spirits and Gods cannot interfere you, but only can bless or guide you along.

              <p><br>Sure, as said before, especially those who died suddenly and also those younger ones, like myocardia arrest (heart attack) or cerebral infarcation (stroke) or cerebrovascular accidents (shock), upper and lower respiratory tract infection (eg asthma and choking) etc etc </p>
              <p>HA and stroke are main reason for sudden death in Singapore. That is why it is call the no 1 killer. As for stroke, some can be save, it all depend on the timing, but most end up handicapped and some become vegetable, so, dun try to be hero, drive and drive non stop or think that huat huat huat...tell you, singapore money cannot earn finish one, seen many from being hero on the road become zero at hospital bed or in my van is quite pathetic, family members of TD or any other stressful job must also help to advice them not to overwork and a the same time, TD must also discipline themselves, have more time with family and enjoy some private life with good habits and diet.</p>
              <p>The last time I picked up a taxi driver at SGH, his son told me, his father, due to some sickness, did not drive for 2 days, so he asked his relief to cover part of it for him, because the relief also cannot drive 24hrs, so when his father just recovered, he told his relief to rest, and he whacked the whole 2 weekday and also the sat and sun to make back some money. On saturday noon, he got heart attack Sengkang after going for toilet break, and he was gone.</p>
              <p>So brother, I would like to say, whether it is a huat day or deem to be a huat day, or that you hv lost some income here and there because of sick or other matters like travelling etc, not to get anxiety and excited over wanting to make it back, be steady, take your time, money is external and a must, but it cannot buy you a life. It is not everything.</p>

              <p>Like playing football, consistency is the game for TD, as you go along, you set a pattern, each one of us have out own unique pattern, there is no one pattern suit all, some like to Q, some like calls, some like go coconut trees, some like cbd, some like nite and some like half nite and half ball type<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Once you hv the consistency, you will feel more relax and able to cope better with your daily life and ultimately, will be more happier and eventually, happy go lucky. If you a 4 to 4 shift, just stick to it, by 3, time to head back and rest, if you rush, your heart beat rise..heart beat rise with exercises is ok, heart rise while seating is the most dangerous.</p>

              <p>If you ask me about ghost, I said no, there is no ghost in this world, but if you ask me about spirit, yes, there are spirits in this world, from innocent to evil ones.</p>
              <p>Innocent ones are those who gone out of the sudden, they cannot believe that they are gone, they still thot they are in our worldly realm, thing like sudden death, unlike terminal illness or dieases, you know you are going and it prepare to go, but for sudden type, the spirit remain even the body is gone. Like serious car accident, the driver who died still think he is alive, and so the spirit still dwell around the place of the accident, and that is why many said, oh, the this place very dirty liao.</p>
              <p>It need the dead to realise that he is dead either by himself or by someone, thru prayer told him to rest in peace, then he finally realise that he is gone and accept the truth to the next realm of space.</p>
              <p>Now, this spirit are alway looking for it worldly body, once it found it, it get a shock and it is unable to re-enter the body which is nothing but carbon dust deposit.</p>

              <p>2nd type is the pick up collection at Hospital, mostly in bags and nake, cold with tag, this is the hang up IC place, this type talk to you at time. Even in hot morning, your van no on aircon, the inside is very cold, eerie and strange smell. And when it talk to you in a spiritual way, respect it and talk back, like...Hello, Uncle, where are you taking me...then you reply normally, Oh..back to your home, you relax and rest, when reach then I tell you ok, relax, ...the spirit is just beside the body.

              <p>If you ask me about ghost, I said no, there is no ghost in this
                  world, but if you ask me about spirit, yes, there are spirits in
                  this world, from innocent to evil ones.</p>
              <p>Innocent ones are those who gone out of the sudden, they cannot
                  believe that they are gone, they still thot they are in our worldly
                  realm, thing like sudden death, unlike terminal illness or dieases,
                  you know you are going and it prepare to go, but for sudden type,
                  the spirit remain even the body is gone. Like serious car accident,
                  the driver who died still think he is alive, and so the spirit
                  still dwell around the place of the accident, and that is why many
                  said, oh, the this place very dirty liao.</p>
              <p>It need the dead to realise that he is dead either by himself or
                  by someone, thru prayer told him to rest in peace, then he finally
                  realise that he is gone and accept the truth to the next realm of
                  space.</p>
              <p>Now, this spirit are alway looking for it worldly body, once it
                  found it, it get a shock and it is unable to re-enter the body
                  which is nothing but carbon dust deposit.</p>

              <p>Religion act in a way of a cane, telling you that if you do bad, you get caned badly and so on, in history, all believes only start from about 3000 years ago, but this world is more than that, it is billions yo, the nearest prominent one is Islam, about 500 years ago. Christ 2000 years ago, buddhist 2500 years ago, hindu 3000 years ago, but before that, what do we have??</p>
              <p>Many historical rulers uses believes to control it peoples, because religion create faithfulness and discipline, and as peoples start to revolt, more input of believe in whatever way, be it true or false, real or fake in propaganda way, spread to it peoples into believing and therefore become discipline and good citizens.</p>
