              So far my TC mdt at least twice a month got lost and found message. But I think June or July almost every weekend got.
              
              I also just found out when I went police station, if pax left something in cab on weekend can just hand over to police station, no need wait till Monday to send back to TC office.

              <p>Things lost and found is natural, every one of us also lost something once a while, now a day people travel with more things with them, from bags to hp to ipad to laptop, cards holders, second wallets, documents and so on, once even got a safety shoes.</p>
              <p>As long as TD do not lost themselves, I should said, everything is ok</p>

              <p>Only experienced this once. I drive citycab btw. Same company with CDG.</p>
              <p>Dropped off a pax. Pax left a phone in cab. I did not realise it. Picked up another pax. Other pax was honest and returned it to me. I called CDG immediately. Then CDG told me to deal with pax. I returned it to pax.</p>
              <p>Point to note is, if the next pax picked up without letting the TD know, the TD will be accused of stealing it.</p>

              <p>seats are sloping backwards, hence many freebies (especially during night shift at nightspot)... pax (those drunkers) will give you some nice surprises.  ask Komade lah... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              normally heard it in the day, but not everyday, once in a while
              you drive night so maybe don't get to hear
              to me, announce for fark, not all driver has walkie , i think less than 25% driver used
              so no point to announce.
              wait for premier to call you lah if item owner know the taxi number
              but hor you must go office to surrender the item and watse your time

              <p><br>Please understand that anybody lost something is not somebody problem, it is the individual problem, if can find, we return, if not, too bad, there is nothing we can do, as long as your conscience is clear, why worry?</p>
              <p>Let said you lost something, its part and parcel of every human being to lost something, cos too many things already, so you went back to track your movement before the thing was lost, you took a bus to mrt, mrt breakdown, you went for a coffee, then you walk to a TS, took a cab, reach your place, walk to nearby 7/11 buy some cough drops, then proceed to your mother in law house, then you realise, hey, where is my Hp? So you track back..walk, kopitiam, taxi, bus, TS, 7/11..then finally you narrowed down to Taxis, cause that is when you make a call to your wife.</p>
              <p>So you call up cab companies and give a description, cab companies broadcast it out, nobody reply for a few days, so how? lan lan lor, it is an individual mistake, one must take own blame, not plough it back to the Taxis driver or bus drivers or others?</p>
