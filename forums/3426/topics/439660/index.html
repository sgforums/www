              If you want to know if your TVL classmate is telling you the truth or bullshitting? You have to try it yourself, but to get the actual details plying AP. 
              
              As a TD, to have a good income not only work hard or smart, you must have a bit of luck too in your daily routine to find pax. I believe ones should have the so call å¤©æ—¶åœ°åˆ©äººå’Œï¼Œplus è¿�ã€‚
              
              For example, yesterday Sat at 5pm when I drove out from my woodlands carpark , I huat all the way to 9pm collect about 170, 6 long 3 short tripMy personal best since my 2 1/2 year driving. But I know the meaning is that èŠ±æ— ç™¾æ—¥çº¢, business may not be good everytime. 
              
              Playing AP Alone is very risky if there is flight delay or cancelled any single day. Please correct me if I am wrong here.

              <p><br>If you want to know if your TVL classmate is telling you the truth or bullshitting? You have to try it yourself, but to get the actual details plying AP. As a TD, to have a good income not only work hard or smart, you must have a bit of luck too in your daily routine to find pax. I believe ones should have the so call å¤©æ—¶åœ°åˆ©äººå’Œï¼Œplus è¿�ã€‚ For example, yesterday Sat at 5pm when I drove out from my woodlands carpark , I huat all the way to 9pm collect about 170, 6 long 3 short tripMy personal best since my 2 1/2 year driving. But I know the meaning is that èŠ±æ— ç™¾æ—¥çº¢, business may not be good everytime. Playing AP Alone is very risky if there is flight delay or cancelled any single day. Please correct me if I am wrong here.</p>
