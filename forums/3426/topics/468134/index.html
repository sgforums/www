              <p>Yahoo!
               Newsroom - In his first post on Taxi Talk this week, Mr M speaks about 
              the ups and downs of being a taxi driver (AP file photo)</p>
              <div id="mediablogbody" class="yom-mod yom-art-content ">
              <div id="yui_3_8_1_1_1365569215956_1291" class="bd">
              <p class="first"><em>Mr M, 47, was a former senior sales and marketing 
              manager at an electronics MNC for nine years before he was retrenched in
               2009. Married with a wife and twin teenage sons, he tried his hand at 
              being a financial advisor for a year before deciding to become a taxi 
              driver. He has been running his taxi service since 2011. He survived a 
              heart-attack in late 2012 and now has four stents in his heart. His 
              philosophy on life is now to live well, stay healthy and to share his 
              real-life experiences. In his first post on Taxi Talk this week, he 
              speaks about the ups and downs of being a taxi driver.</em></p>
              <p>Taxi driving is a hard life as I work long hours of between 14 – 16 
              hours each day. On a typical week, I clock about 80 – 100 hours on the 
              road.</p>
              <p>It’s a job of “no choice of choices” as I shared with my fellow 
              colleagues who have suffered the same fate as me and were also 
              retrenched. Initially, it was tough going as my retrenchment benefits 
              payout didn’t last me more than six months. I also became depressed and 
              felt a deep sense of betrayal, self-denial and hopelessness.</p>
              <p>I never imagined I would turn to running my own taxi as a full-time 
              job. From a comfy $7,000/month job, I was relegated to earning a mere 
              $2,000/month. My family’s lifestyle had to be adjusted, with steep 
              cost-cutting measures ranging from eating more home cooked food, buying 
              cheaper groceries, less time and money spent shopping, less TV and no 
              holidays.</p>
              <p>The initial job loss made the whole family very nervous. Nonetheless,
               I assured them that as the father and head of the family, we would 
              overcome all adversity and I would strive to give them a good life and 
              education. My kids were apprehensive and had their doubts about my new 
              job -- whether I could cope with the job change, the difference in 
              status, the safety of driving on the roads, and dealing with difficult 
              customers.</p>
              <p>Almost everyday, I would share with them my many encounters with 
              customers and their stories and experiences, and how they could learn 
              from these stories. After a few weeks of driving on the job, I had 
              proved to them that all their doubts and worries were unfounded. They 
              have since stopped worrying for me and re-focussed back on their 
              studies.</p>
              <p>Spending your entire day on the road can be stressful. Road bullying 
              by heavy trucks, coping with peak hour traffic jams, accidents, dealing 
              with unreasonable, unruly or drunk passengers are all part of a day’s 
              work.</p>
              <p>But with the strong support of my faith, hope and love from my 
              family, I picked up the courage to inject new energy into my job and to 
              think and act positively.</p>
              <p>Despite working longer hours, I also learnt that being a taxi driver 
              allowed me to adopt flexible time arrangement with family and friends. I
               began to enjoy picking up, meeting and talking to many different 
              customers each day.</p>
              <p>I also began to wear different hats for different purposes – tour 
              guide, listener, consultant, counselor, story-teller, adviser, food 
              expert and motivator.</p>
              <p>Eventually I treated every day as a learning journey, sharing my life
               experiences with my customers while learning new skills of engaging 
              customers on a wide array of topics.</p>
              <p>Smart taxi driving is also about good time discipline and management,
               good local knowledge of roads as well as being able to take advantage 
              of new technologies such as using GPS or iPhone apps. While on the road,
               I also take charge of my own health, listening to “new age” music to 
              de-stress while trying to exercise regularly, eating a proper diet and 
              having sufficient good rest.</p>
              <p>I now try to maintain a positive and honest attitude, empathise and 
              manage my customers’ expectations, as well as provide good customer 
              support and services. “Driving is my business, communication is my 
              hobby” is my new personal motto.</p>
              <p>In this column, I will be sharing more about my daily encounters with
               my customers and my own personal reflections about life in Singapore. I
               hope to have your support. See you in my next column.</p>

              in life or in work , which does not have up and down

              i am a so so happy cabby even it is not really the choice i want
              
              but since we are in it, then we learn to do it better to reduce the down side by listening
              
              and learning, 
              
              out there so many driving taxi i have met a number of happy cabby more than just a few
              
              unhappy type
              
              only those " cha tau" who still stongly continue to self believe driving taxi or other type of 
              
              job is no life will continue to have have more down than up
              
              have positive thinking, think of more happy things and life will also change with it and
