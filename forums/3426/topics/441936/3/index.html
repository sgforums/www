              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>It has been about 2 months since my one and only post. During
              this period i have encountered many many things. All the things
              that i have encountered have been GOOD!</p>
              <p><span>I have met and gotten to know 7 persons with each
              a Heart of Gold. They have helped me tremendously in making my no
              direction and aimless life less miserable. They have motivated me
              to start the engine instead of "throwing rental" and idle at home.
              I have also been more inclined to start the engine and be on the
              road because I have the morning break with them to look forward to.
              Most importantly, I have learned to be more humble.</span></p>
              <p><span>Khoon 2580: A patient, sincere, humble guy who is
              always looking out for others and has no temper whatsoever.
              Everyday I will receive his sms “ otr or idle”. I have become
              afraid of replying idle to him because I will Kenna F by him.
              Hence, nowadays I will guai guai start the engine and be On The
              Road. haha <span> </span>Khoon is A Helluva Driver unlike me
              who is a pirate driver.</span></p>
              <p><span>Slpun: Father to a soon to be born Dragon Baby.
              All in all a simple and humble guy who just wants to provide for
              his family.</span></p>
              <p><span>EP77: Extremely soft spoken and nice guy who just
              like Slpun only wants to provide for his family.</span></p>
              <p><span>Auntie Jade: Always “unfashionable late” for
              morning breaks. The reason why it happens, I’m sure I don’t need to
              elaborate (hint: slow movement cum send people to Holland gps).
              haha She kenna suan also laugh, zai bo liang also see open, reject
              3 calls kenna scheme b also bo chiap. I admit I am the most black
              hearted when I told her she drive “city shuttle cab” (like ippt
              shuttle run). Bring pax go up and down but never to destination.
              She good heart treat us eat Hoy Fatt roasted chicken also kenna
              question by me why chicken no umbrella like in GL.
              <span> </span>She tell hammerhammer and me story we orh orh
              but our eyes look at a chio bu opposite us. Hammer whisper to me
              the chio bu “bak chai” he like, I whisper back the chio bu look at
              “AV idol”. Then Auntie asked what we whispering, i say man talk,
              woman mai chiap. haha</span></p>
              <p><span>Hammerhammer8888: Auntie ever told me a person in
              a cyber world (forum) is different when you meet and get to know in
              real world. This is most true when I meet hammer. Until today I
              have no doubt I am a much worse pirate driver than him. One example
              is recently, after lunch time which normally he is resting at home.
              He helped Auntie to detach her “bo standard” CD Receiver without so
              much as a thought.</span></p>
              <p><span>Cash Lee: He is the most cool, calm and friendly
              guy I have ever met.</span></p>
              <p><span>Punno365: He is also known as the secret admirer.
              Like me, he peeks a lot in forum. A very humble guy.</span></p>
              <p><span>I am sorry for this long post. Just wanna share
              with everyone how blessed I am.</span></p>
              <p><span>More importantly, if any taxi commuter ever read
              this. I hope they will think. This is because ever since the fare
              increment, most if not all of the 7 persons above have been
              drowning. 7 persons who just wants to provide for their families,
              who are trying their best in earning a decent living (coffeeshop
              standard not restaurant standard). Why are they facing OBK days?
              Why morning peak or even after peak hours zai bo liang? Who can
              they complain to???</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Sorry everyone. This would probably me my last post. Even though everyone has bear with me for countless times in the past. I do beseech everyone to bear with me one more time.<br><br>I have been in quite a number of trades in my short life time. I am proud to say. This has been my happiest period so far in my work life.<br><br>As I mentioned before in my first post, I actually spent a year peeping through this forum. Before I “peh” the steering wheel. Even after I started to “peh” the steering wheel. I still continue to read past postings from selected few (TCL, Poolman, ALN &amp; Komade).<br><br>Some people “stalk” people. I “stalk” people’s postings. Here’s the thing. From day one (1st June) until today, I have NEVER had an OBK day nor earn peanuts. Dream start it was. But by the end of the 1st month, how many dead (yusof ishak) I had at the end of the shift, didn’t matter to me. Everyday, I remind myself how fortunate I am (no parangs &amp; very little liabilities).<br><br>There are times the first half of my shift sucks, drive until pek chek. But I will tell myself when Komade said before “Relax &amp; Do No Give Up [Komade Trademark]”. So I bite the bullet and soldier on. True enough, until today when that happens, during the second half of my shift, I always press meter and MDT until finger “sung”. Thus, end of shift still huat.<br><br>My happiest day on the road was Ah Khoon’s Day 142 OTR Sunday. No surcharges at all! I am guilty as charged of persuading Ah Khoon to do 2 days work in one day. I was so Happy [Poolman Trademark] that day, not because that day huat. Of course, i got huat (Sunday still Huat big time). But because of 2 things that made me happy and kept smiling during that day, got buddy (ah khoon) to talk and tease (my paxs onboard hear me tease him also laugh non-stop) while driving and also willing to break with me (Chinatown Astons…steam [ALN Trademark]). Second thing was, after returning to base and parking at the 3rd storey of the MSCP, I forgot to off the MDT. While filling up the taxi log book. PING! Tio Call Liao!! [TCL Trademark]!!! Yes, I gian peng and no discipline. Picked up pilot to AP. Fare plus tips more than covered our dinner at Chinatown Astons. Si beh Steam…..<br><br>My happiest day not on the road was the YCK makan session. I met and become even more humble after talking to so many “lao gui”. Only thing I regret is not doing my best to know their nicks or names (especially the humble guy who drives an i30 wearing a pink polo t shirt).  Everyone was so forthcoming in sharing their views and experiences. I worked for quite a few blue chip companies in my life. Not one company has ever remotely offered me such an experience.<br><br>My happiest incidents/sightings on the road was sounding my honk like a mad man at 2 taxis on different occasions. First occasion, CKtan (along Eu Tong Sen Road). My paxs onboard see my so happy at honking and waving at him until they actually asked me should they wave at him too. I replied them “Yes, please do so”. Second occasion, BCL (along Hougang Ave 3). I flashed at him, he moved to his lane. I go head to head with him, he wave to say pai sei. I started to honk at him. He turned and see me wind down the window and tease him. I moved forward, my pax asked me “your friend huh?”. I replied “No!”. He is my taxi school principal. My pax then replied “no wonder he drive so steady”. People flashed, he quickly reacted and waved to gesture sorry. Pax say he first time see driver so courteous and considerate. On both occasions upon seeing them, immediately, I like macham meet “fortune god”. I press meter and MDT until finger “sung”. The worst was after meeting BCL, I remember when I met up with the day shift gang for break. They see me very “pek chek” and I never say hello to them. I quickly queue up to buy coffee. After a sip of coffee and a smoke, I slowly cool down and told them “Not OBK but zai buay liao!” Please stop saying “school principal idle”. When I saw him, he had eagle eyes with  one hand on the steering wheel and the other hand was “romancing the dead “yusof ishaks” nor did he have a messy hairdo.<br><br>My most unhappy day was one of the days last week. I went to a Caltex station to deposit money at the OCBC atm. While doing the transaction, 3 day shift “lao gui” of the same taxi co as me were blasting their earnings away. It was so loud that the nearby private car drivers actually stopped to look and listen. I felt so disgusted! Here I am, having just met with 4 gloomy faces with each having a big OBK morning peak during my morning break. There they are blasting their jiak buay liao earnings. No, I did not have an OBK day too. On contrary, I was tempted to print my “receipt” and stamped it on their faces!<br><br>I come to this trade as a nobody and newbie. I will leave very soon as a nobody too. Like Mercabs say : Why don't i give others a chance". The reason for my post is that I just wanna tell everyone to try to be happy and see open. The days when I was happy, was the days I most huat. I never had a strategy; I only just drive and try my best to be happy. I never had a fare runaway or an OBK day. Countless times I had to play taiji with paxs who tipped me because the only money I ever wanted is the amount on the meter.<br><br>Lastly, please trust me when I say that a person in a cyber world is totally different when you meet in the real world. My classic example is hammerhammer8888. Clementi after peak hour easily can find someone along the way to his base. But he put busy and "turbo” to bedok to meet us for morning break. Please try to get to know a person in real world. You never know how much difference it can be, rather then slamming each other. Many paxs do “look down” on us, does it do anymore good to “look down” on each other? <br><br>P.S. The pax I picked up that morning i sighted BCL on the road, he actually threw his smoke and ran across a junction to get into my taxi. He kept thanking me for stopping even upon reaching his destination. I can understand it is a mundane job, an unappreciative job. I totally agree that the biggest injustice is how this group of multi- talented cabbies who I have come to respect over time end up in this trade? But you know what? A nobody like me and my pax still respect you a lot. It may not mean much. But it is not nothing.<br></p></div>

              <p>Sorry everyone. This would probably me my last post. Even though
              everyone has bear with me for countless times in the past. I do
              beseech everyone to bear with me one more time.<br> <br> I have been in quite a number of trades in my short life time. I am
              proud to say. This has been my happiest period so far in my work
              life.<br> <br> As I mentioned before in my first post, I actually spent a year
              peeping through this forum. Before I “peh” the steering wheel. Even
              after I started to “peh” the steering wheel. I still continue to
              read past postings from selected few (TCL, Poolman, ALN &amp;
              Komade).<br> <br> Some people “stalk” people. I “stalk” people’s postings. Here’s the
              thing. From day one (1st June) until today, I have NEVER had an OBK
              day nor earn peanuts. Dream start it was. But by the end of the 1st
              month, how many dead (yusof ishak) I had at the end of the shift,
              didn’t matter to me. Everyday, I remind myself how fortunate I am
              (no parangs &amp; very little liabilities).<br> <br> There are times the first half of my shift sucks, drive until pek
              chek. But I will tell myself when Komade said before “Relax &amp;
              Do No Give Up [Komade Trademark]”. So I bite the bullet and soldier
              on. True enough, until today when that happens, during the second
              half of my shift, I always press meter and MDT until finger “sung”.
              Thus, end of shift still huat.<br> <br> My happiest day on the road was Ah Khoon’s Day 142 OTR Sunday. No
              surcharges at all! I am guilty as charged of persuading Ah Khoon to
              do 2 days work in one day. I was so Happy [Poolman Trademark] that
              day, not because that day huat. Of course, i got huat (Sunday still
              Huat big time). But because of 2 things that made me happy and kept
              smiling during that day, got buddy (ah khoon) to talk and tease (my
              paxs onboard hear me tease him also laugh non-stop) while driving
              and also willing to break with me (Chinatown Astons…steam [ALN
              Trademark]). Second thing was, after returning to base and parking
              at the 3rd storey of the MSCP, I forgot to off the MDT. While
              filling up the taxi log book. PING! Tio Call Liao!! [TCL
              Trademark]!!! Yes, I gian peng and no discipline. Picked up pilot
              to AP. Fare plus tips more than covered our dinner at Chinatown
              Astons. Si beh Steam…..<br> <br> My happiest day not on the road was the YCK makan session. I met
              and become even more humble after talking to so many “lao gui”.
              Only thing I regret is not doing my best to know their nicks or
              names (especially the humble guy who drives an i30 wearing a pink
              polo t shirt).  Everyone was so forthcoming in sharing their
              views and experiences. I worked for quite a few blue chip companies
              in my life. Not one company has ever remotely offered me such an
              experience.<br> <br> My happiest incidents/sightings on the road was sounding my honk
              like a mad man at 2 taxis on different occasions. First occasion,
              CKtan (along Eu Tong Sen Road). My paxs onboard see my so happy at
              honking and waving at him until they actually asked me should they
              wave at him too. I replied them “Yes, please do so”. Second
              occasion, BCL (along Hougang Ave 3). I flashed at him, he moved to
              his lane. I go head to head with him, he wave to say pai sei. I
              started to honk at him. He turned and see me wind down the window
              and tease him. I moved forward, my pax asked me “your friend huh?”.
              I replied “No!”. He is my taxi school principal. My pax then
              replied “no wonder he drive so steady”. People flashed, he quickly
              reacted and waved to gesture sorry. Pax say he first time see
              driver so courteous and considerate. On both occasions upon seeing
              them, immediately, I like macham meet “fortune god”. I press meter
              and MDT until finger “sung”. The worst was after meeting BCL, I
              remember when I met up with the day shift gang for break. They see
              me very “pek chek” and I never say hello to them. I quickly queue
              up to buy coffee. After a sip of coffee and a smoke, I slowly cool
              down and told them “Not OBK but zai buay liao!” Please stop saying
              “school principal idle”. When I saw him, he had eagle eyes
              with  one hand on the steering wheel and the other hand was
              “romancing the dead “yusof ishaks” nor did he have a messy
              hairdo.<br> <br> My most unhappy day was one of the days last week. I went to a
              Caltex station to deposit money at the OCBC atm. While doing the
              transaction, 3 day shift “lao gui” of the same taxi co as me were
              blasting their earnings away. It was so loud that the nearby
              private car drivers actually stopped to look and listen. I felt so
              disgusted! Here I am, having just met with 4 gloomy faces with each
              having a big OBK morning peak during my morning break. There they
              are blasting their jiak buay liao earnings. No, I did not have an
              OBK day too. On contrary, I was tempted to print my “receipt” and
              stamped it on their faces!<br> <br> I come to this trade as a nobody and newbie. I will leave very soon
              as a nobody too. Like Mercabs say : Why don't i give others a
              chance". The reason for my post is that I just wanna tell everyone
              to try to be happy and see open. The days when I was happy, was the
              days I most huat. I never had a strategy; I only just drive and try
              my best to be happy. I never had a fare runaway or an OBK day.
              Countless times I had to play taiji with paxs who tipped me because
              the only money I ever wanted is the amount on the meter.<br> <br> Lastly, please trust me when I say that a person in a cyber world
              is totally different when you meet in the real world. My classic
              example is hammerhammer8888. Clementi after peak hour easily can
              find someone along the way to his base. But he put busy and "turbo”
              to bedok to meet us for morning break. Please try to get to know a
              person in real world. You never know how much difference it can be,
              rather then slamming each other. Many paxs do “look down” on us,
              does it do anymore good to “look down” on each other?<br> <br> P.S. The pax I picked up that morning i sighted BCL on the road, he
              actually threw his smoke and ran across a junction to get into my
              taxi. He kept thanking me for stopping even upon reaching his
              destination. I can understand it is a mundane job, an
              unappreciative job. I totally agree that the biggest injustice is
              how this group of multi- talented cabbies who I have come to
              respect over time end up in this trade? But you know what? A nobody
              like me and my pax still respect you a lot. It may not mean much.
              But it is not nothing.</p>

              <p>Dun like that say. There are people who drove cab until stay in chiak hong chu. It is not so bad a profession if u love the job.</p>
              <p>I enjoyed being a limo driver very much. I hate driving normal cabs, sonatas, etc. But not as a limo driver.</p>
              <p>So jynt please dun like that say what is wrong with me. Actually nothing wrong. I really love what I am doing. Its quite fun compared to what I used to do, and will be going back to do. My previous job very sang nao jing. Drive cab different. Its a no brainer. No need to think one. Auto pilot mostly. End of trip just collect $50 notes, sometimes a stack of them. </p>
