              <p><br> Union gas was set up by a group of temasek high end executives,
              with today technology in induction, not much people use gas, and
              when you say temasek, you also talk about GIC and all those GLC
              including city gas. Going into CNG taxis is there an alternatives
              to bring back gas business since many household now start to use
              induction cooker. However, gas is not as lucrative a business as
              Oil, therefore it start to deviate it core business back to epica
              with diesel operation.</p>
              <p>NTUC is up as a union by the PAP chief, our LKY, it is mean to
              stop all strike and harmonise the industries so as to create
              a peaceful enviroment for industrial, during the 60s and 70s,
              there are lots of price takers, you take a ba wang chia (private
              cab), the price can be anyhow ranged, end up, lots of problem, and
              many drivers choose their patterns to drive.</p>
              <p>That time a TD can owns 3 private house and can hv 3 wives,
              seibei yaya papaya with their Morris, ford and bendford taxis. LKY
              see that inorder to control the price, taxis must be in control, so
              he order NTUC to start a cooperative on taxis, get the hirer in
              with proper fares and system, end up all those private cabs who had
              been enjoying their life woke up and see their pax gone.</p>
              <p>This apply same to NTUC fairpirce, another cooperative
              initiatives, it is to kill the provisionshop towkay prices which
              they had been doing the price setter and become so rich. Now, you

              <p>On this point , i agree totally . Comfort was quite welfare when it was a stand alone Co. After merging with citycab and that cb kia yang ban seng crossed over , its hell for the drivers.</p>
              <p>Now with all the xia lan kias running the show , its very different from what it used to be</p>
              <p>But think and think , best of the worse isnt that bad afterall especially after wasting my precious time at transcab.</p>

              <p>Btw Rasa no suspension. Unless you bid job liao then take another current job from elsewhere. But ok mah. Suspension 3 days nia, if no takers you still can take. So no matter how many times you cancel still 3 days suspension. Buay tio pok mah....</p>
              <p>Aiya to be fair to the pax also. People pay advance fee book taxi to AP. Then you cannot suka suka fly aeroplane right? If you fly aeroplane then the pax aeroplane really fly away how? Then who dare to call LV for AJ in future? Then all other paying member how? Join liao bo AJ to bid?</p>

              <p>Times have change now I believe. If I am the CDG taxi head I also will pok old driver and recruit new ones. Can have higher rental yield and new drivers especially newbies not so many pattern. 1 stone kill 2 birds and end of the year my KPI will look better with higher rental revenue and lesser complains.</p>
              <p>But at least they steady never up existing rental. Tio kong Prime got up their rental for their existing hirer and the hirer all on contract so lan lan suck thumb. Anyone can verify this?</p>
