              <p>KNNBCCB this one from the horse mouth!!!! Not heresay!!!! Just got another CDG driver bite the dust. Reason is high cancellation of advance booking job. SMLJ!!! Last time I drive CDG Limo....every month cancel at least 2-3 normal JOB. Premier job also can cancel a few. They only SMS me to remind me not to cancel or else suspension. Then finally I got suspended for Premier job because of another Arrival job cancellation. But normal advance bo tai chi. Cos I hear from fellow drivers 1 month cancel 2 job is ok one.</p>
              <p><br>But now times has change!!!! They straight away terminate you for 2-3 cancellation. I think the reason is they want to pok all the existing hirer for the slightest mistake and rent out the cab to new hirer at the new rental rate of $11X.XX</p>
              <p>Imagine 1 lao pok Sonata rental $9X.XX can rent out $1X.XX more a day. Sibeh laku right!!!</p>
              <p>So beware....CDG driver....better behave yourself. Dun let them have a chance to pok you. Dun anyhow interview, dun pick and choose, dun anyhow take pax for sight seeing, dun suka suka change shift Chinatown, dun suka suka treat pax NO SHOW...pax late better wait...the list goes on and on...hahhaa</p>

              <p>Malaysians and PRC can speak better English than most Sinkie taxi drivers, nowadays got GPS, foreign drivers have no problem finding their way and they are keen learner. In Australia, 70% of the taxi drivers are foreigners.</p>
              <p>TDVL can be adjusted to accept foreigners.</p>
              <p>As for tourism, the foreigners can relate their experience much better than locals, dun believe, go and ask 100 taxi drivers. have they actually step onto merlion park? 99 of them will say, "huh? merlion simi ho kua?"</p>

              <p>Foreigner taking over TD was once a consideration, most developed countries in the west are driven by foreigners, that is because their locals are super lazy and now most in debts. For asian developed countries like Jap, Korean and Singapore, still a very much local domain when it come to taxi driving, not that we are more hardworking and able to work long hours, but politically speaking, the govt of these countries knows the consquences if TD is sublet to foreigners.</p>
              <p>However, unlike the korean and jipoon, we are facing not only a greying population but also a diminishing ones, if our young like hammer or komade still do not want to produce then I will call it as a self destruction of our own, once that reach it apex of no return, perhaps we might see the first kind of foreigner taking over, but it will come from a traditional source rather than a non traditional ones (NTS). And that will be the Malaysians..</p>

              <p>There are many stories to one issue lah, what we see and hear is alway from a Taxi perspective or so called horse mouth. High cancellation could be he no shows or that last minutes cancel and pax missed the plane. Then end of the day taxi companies tell him, you drive smlj taxis, aiya best is that if you cannot hold advance job, dun anyhow press or take lor.</p>
              <p>Like you sweep after the morning peak, no people liao, then suddenly one adv to bid, out of boring press and you get the bid at 6.00pm from sunset to airport, but by 6pm, alot of paxs, peng bay hu, end up at AP with pick and go...then last minutes make a cancellation, operator also cannot get another taxi for the pax even with current call, then how?</p>

              every company have their set of operating procedure
              
              if you choose to be part of their team, follow their rules and requirement that need
              
              to be fullfill
              
              last time police wear short, but things can always change
              
              example like garden by the bay, last time no location charge, does it mean it is wrong 
              
              to impose location charge now?  or last time advance booking $5 only etc
              
              remember all taxi company have set of standard to achieve which if not could be fine
              
              by LTA or do you want to share the cost of the penatly?
              
              rules and regulaton only being set when something happen, normally it is the result 
              
              of our own action. if don't know who to blame, blame the 60.1% lor

              <p>KNNBCCB this one from the horse mouth!!!! Not heresay!!!! Just got another CDG driver bite the dust. Reason is high cancellation of advance booking job. SMLJ!!! Last time I drive CDG Limo....every month cancel at least 2-3 normal JOB. Premier job also can cancel a few. They only SMS me to remind me not to cancel or else suspension. Then finally I got suspended for Premier job because of another Arrival job cancellation. But normal advance bo tai chi. Cos I hear from fellow drivers 1 month cancel 2 job is ok one.</p>
              <p><br>But now times has change!!!! They straight away terminate you for 2-3 cancellation. I think the reason is they want to pok all the existing hirer for the slightest mistake and rent out the cab to new hirer at the new rental rate of $11X.XX</p>
              <p>Imagine 1 lao pok Sonata rental $9X.XX can rent out $1X.XX more a day. Sibeh laku right!!!</p>
              <p>So beware....CDG driver....better behave yourself. Dun let them have a chance to pok you. Dun anyhow interview, dun pick and choose, dun anyhow take pax for sight seeing, dun suka suka change shift Chinatown, dun suka suka treat pax NO SHOW...pax late better wait...the list goes on and on...hahhaa</p>

              <p>Understand, that is why it is important for govt to understand that to increase birthrate, the condition and enviroment must be right, just like any animals, they will produce if the condition and the enviroment permit, like a nice trees, can built a nest and can be ensure of food and safety, birds will lay eggs and produce.</p>
              <p>Therefore, everytime the govt said why and howcome we not producing, it is all because of the enviroment and condition that do not induce producing babies, and in the last few decades, govt is 100% focus on growth thru education and $$, this indirect lead citizen of both genders to move in toward an individual with self interest mentality of $$ thru education that support one self than to think of the social aspect of having decendency.</p>
