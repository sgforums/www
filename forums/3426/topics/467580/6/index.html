              <p>So last time you are Comfort driver or CityCab driver?......</p>
              <p>Got different hor, they only merge in 2003, before that we are competitor hor.......</p>
              <p>With the background of Singapore Technologies Kinetics, CityCab was no push over those time, heard about commuter taxi, that's way before CityCab was formed somewhere in the 90s, a combination of 3 company, the other 2 I can't remember liao.......</p>
              <p>Comfort those time still using old Sapphire set, although their calls still consider power, but with the threat from CityCab, which both are semi-government company, they agree to strike a deal and merge........and call themselves Comfort Delgro until now.......</p>
              <p>Currently the MDT CDG was using originated from CityCab hor, initially CityCab damn cb, push all those Gen 3 set to Comfort, whereas their own drivers using the Gen 4 set........that's why a lot of rumours saying that CityCab drivers tio call faster........</p>
              <p>And some poor Comfort drivers still had to use the conversion Sapphire set, which tia gong a lot of limitation.........</p>
              <p>If you originally from CityCab which I'm not(I'm pure Comfort driver), than you are talking about the Gen4 set, but if you like me, pure Comfort driver, than I seriously don't know what you are talking about........</p>
              <p>This whole MDT system is baby of CityCab, Comfort just tag on to their system, of course later part, nobody will bother again whether Comfort/CityCab, but it use to have a history on everything..........</p>
              <p>Looking at the way they are moving, I guess, just guess hor, very soon, Identity of CDG will be just 1 colour, blue or yellow? You all go guess lor........<span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  "><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></span></p>

              <p><br>I started with Corona , no MDT type .</p>
              <p>Later they compulsory put Sapphire on every taxis , POWER set ! First few taxis to use Sapphire , initially very power , late stage , sucks , cos too small memory ram , they instal too many screen saver , affected the speed of the MDT . I quit .</p>
              <p>Join another Comfort's NC2000 MDT , used very long .</p>
              <p>Change hirer , also NC2000 MDT , powerful analog MDT .</p>
              <p>Then i OMO with Yellow Top Cabs operated by Comfort subsidiary Yellow Top Cab Pte Ltd ...... started with NC2000 .</p>
              <p>Later was selected to trial Wo738 MDT , all same , except roof top is 6552-2222 ,  not 6552-1111 .</p>
              <p>Presido also 6552-2222 , later stage they merge Premium Division and created a new number 6552-2828 until now .</p>
              <p>That's why all along i said Citycab and Comfort call , it's different .</p>
              <p>I had the time of my life using Citycab call , just fantastic , Comfort members see my MDT all phui one .</p>

              <p>Citycab were the first to migrate from analog system to windows , we were put on trial .</p>

              <p>Then chaotic , too chaotic , server cannot handle massive demands for taxis , they change and overhaul taxi flag down at 2007 .</p>

              <p>Hardware and software, we had to be clear on this........</p>
              <p>738 or 738a is just a hardware ie the model of the system, all along was develope by CityCab........</p>
              <p>As for the software, ever since merging, there's no different in term of programming between Comfort and CityCab, the old system use by Comfort was totally a different system, by co-ordination, which in later part, they integrated into the current system.........</p>
              <p>Suspension system already in place way before they had merge.........</p>
              <p>Anyway not meant to argue on their history, trial and error never was done by Comfort, Gen 4 set is develope by CityCab as well as Gen 3...........</p>
              <p>As for the call center, you believe they are separated? 6552 2222 already so long in Sg, they simply cannot just allow this number to extinct over night, it takes time, bro, to make sure public will forget this number, not easy but they achieve that..........</p>

              <p><br>Yes lah , Citycab develope those programmes , for Citycab first , always Citycab first , but they trial it with 100 taxis , from several drivers from Citycab , Yellow Top and Comfort . May be Top-100 call takers . Most OMO .</p>
              <p>And mine was , for some funny reason , 6552-2222 was used instead of 6552-1111 .</p>
              <p>Cos they have different server , analog desptaching server , old type , can no longer sustain the demands , have to change .</p>
              <p>And the new technology , they have plans to migrate to Comfort , upgrade version base on the trial 100 sets .</p>
              <p>Step by step , migrate pieces by pieces , into Comfort's server .</p>
