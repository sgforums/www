              <p>Went down to CDG recruitment center. I want to go full time after my 
              relief driving for the few days and found out it suits my style to me a 
              TD. Sick of my current job with a low pay. Can't advance far because I 
              only a diploma.<br><br>The queue for a less then 1 year old Sonata is 
              1-2 months. More then 1 year old Sonata is 2 weeks. Mercedes Limo 4 yrs 
              old is immediate. I am thinking of getting the Limo. Heard from others 
              the difference of $20 of rental can be make up by the better fuel 
              consumption. So my question is the Mercs Limo is really more fuel 
              economical then a Sonata? How about the condition of the car? 4 yrs old 
              car will give problem? And also is it more difficult to get street job 
              from flag down because of $0.20 difference flag down fare? How about 
              Limo booking? Easy to get or must wait long long? Cos I know there is a 
              Limo counter to queue for job at airport right?<br><br>Any old bird here
               drive before Limo cab can share with me the experience? Thank you</p>

              <p><br>Just a piece of advice....</p>
              <p>1) 4 years cab = abt 9 cents per 1km on CDG pumps.</p>
              <p>2) conditions on cab depends on the previous users lah.... who can tell how problematic the cab before ?</p>
              <p>3) should be allocated 62xx to 63xx plates' cabs (euro4 engines).. 630x is from June-July 2006.  If you get 2xxx or 3xxx (euro3 engines).. better don't take.. high fuel consumption for sure. lots of mechanic problems too.  (the mentioned plates numbers are for Mercedes cabs under Sovereign (ex-Yellow Top Dept, direct Comfort Mercedes).</p>
              <p>4) ex-City Cab Limo (Presido) 4 years cabs = 8xx series. (also euro4 engines).</p>
              <p>5) Flag down at $3.20.</p>
              <p>6) Limo Jobs ? have lah... but see if you lucky or not.... now that there are about 600(approx) Mercedes cabs in Comfort.  Better Go join a Limo Group = Limo2000, Royal or K-Limos...</p>
              <p>7)Limo Counter at Airports (needs lot of patience). Not only CDG mercedes, there are also SMRT, Silver Mercedes, SMART, Dynasty Unions.  Per Trip is $45 (less $7 for airport counter).  Midnite +$10. ( DON'T Waste time there, unless you f**king free and tired ).  Some time waiting time can be easily 2hrs ( for $38 nett, don't worth it ).</p>
              <p>8) Ocasionally, CDG Premier services do have events = like Airshows, Expo events, Swiss Club (Meter+$10) etc.</p>
              <p>9) wear long sleeves white, black pants, leather black shoes.  (if you get Limo jobs - have to be smartly dress).  if you sweep floor... wear watever you like.. nobody bother.  (if you sweep floor.. go drive a sonata).</p>
              <p>10). Must drive with a right attitude.. be it Limo or normal... Limo drivers <span style="color: #ff0000;">no</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>big F</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>just my 2 cents of advice.</p>
              <p>good luck.</p>

              <p>me a 2 mths newbie but driving a CDG merc limo.....my opinion, the cons in merc is the rental... the pros cant think of any..... my number plate is 62XX.....it is a 5 yrs + merc &amp; recently hit 800,000km........</p>

              <p>knew about 95% of the old timers...i can say.. most night limo guys knew my previous cab number too (we normally recognise cab nos either than names of drivers.. lol).</p>

              <p>Thanks to bro Bluenut from Taxiuncle forum. After having a kopi session with him. I have come to a conclusion. I have decided to 
              take a Transcab Wish. Be a full time OMO and holding on to my current 
              job. After some calculations I just need to drive $290 during my off 
              days to cover the rental for the whole month plus fuel cost. Then on my 
              actual working days I just have to drive around $50 a day and that is my
               takings. And still have the $700++ rebate from Transcab. Best of both 
              worlds. Anyway my night shift job mostly is relax+sleeping+surf net. 
              Only once a while need to work a bit. Below are my calculations. Please 
              feel free to comment on it if I have made any miscalculations.<br><br>Rental
               of cab : $105 X 30 days = $3150<br>Fuel cost : $60 X 15 days (Driving 
              OMO for my off days) = $900<br>Fuel cost : $20 X 15 days (Working days 
              driving from 8am-1pm) = $300<br><span style="color: #bf0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Total overheads : $3150 + $900 + $300 = 
              $4350</span></span><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #bf0000;">Average takings during off days to break 
              even driving OMO = $4350 / 15 = $290</span></span><br><br>I work from 
              7:30pm-7:45am and usually I go home CBL until afternoon 3pm then Zzzz 
              cos at work Zzzz liao so during this time I still can drive a bit to 
              earn extra pocket money. So this way I still can drive and work my CBL 
              job at the same time and wun get sick of driving too fast. Because in 
              order to take back $150 a day I also need to drive around $290 like that
               without taking the rebate into consideration. Cos my daily wages for my
               CBL is about $170++ a day. So during my working days I can take a break
               from the wheels and relax at work place. Is there any flaw in this 
              plan? Can expert care to share with me? Thank u</p>

Comfirm can go 220++km 1 full tank of gas. At least can tahan 1 peak hour of running and refuel and go back rest to drive another peak hour. Planning to drive from 6am to 12pm and 3pm to 10pm stagger shift. But uncle advise me go Mandai since I stay AMK cos the Serangoon North station very lousy.

Wanted to go FULL TIME OMO but scare if cannot tahan or become sick of driving so choose this option to drive PART TIME OMO until end of year. Something like an OJT to see whether I can tahan the driving. If ok after year end take AWS and bonus and bye bye my full time job and go FULL TIME OMO.
