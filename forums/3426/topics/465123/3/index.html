              <p>The white paper release today indicate the govt planning a population of up to 6.9 million by 2030.</p>
              <p>Coincidence?</p>
              <p>The previous PM fault?</p>
              <p>Its was already part of the PAP grand plan to do this long ago regardless which PM was there at that time.</p>
              <p>The problem is PAP didnt tell us the whole truths to this population planning back in the 90s....untill our island grew too crowded and awkards.</p>
              <p>And by the time we citizens realised, its was already too late, cos the numbers have already swell up by almost 1/3</p>

              <p>Thats why 1991 general election they lost 4 seats to opposition.</p>
              <p>Another reason they lost 4 seats could be the by election strategy played by oppositions by returning the PAP to power on nomination day.</p>
              <p>Imagine PAP telling us in 1991 we need a population of almost 7 million when our population than was only 3million plus.</p>

              <p>your article on ponzi scheme is good. we should forward to others so that they understand the mechanics behind population growth and the methods being used to justify their greed. </p>
              <p>Ultimately, it is the common Sinkerporeans that have to pay to rebuild the infrastructure. FT can just beat their backside, go home and buy land and houses from the monies they earned here.</p>

              PM Lee: Social media cannot be completely left by itself
              
              At the â€œSingapore Perspectives 2013â€³ conference held at Shangri-la Hotel today (28 Jan), PM Lee also dealt with sensitive issues that are brought up online.
              
              Replying to a question on why there is a need to moderate social space, he said, â€œWe donâ€™t believe the community in the social space, especially online, moderates itself. It doesnâ€™t happen anywhere in the world.â€�

              <p>So many of us still strong on sticking to Singapore. I'm in my 30s, By time I die, PAP still going strong and governing S'pore.</p>
              <p>Wats that term GCT use? Forget already. By time I reach Poolman current age, I'm out of here semi retire other SEA countries. Good thing bout TD, cash rich biz.</p>
              <p>Use to think go other country be 2nd class citizen, but here got much difference any more meh?</p>
              <p>Went thru most of the SEA countries 2 years back, realise by speaking their language you already blend in, cos we already look like them. The difference is really the living cost.</p>
              <p>Most countries you don't go out, you don't spend money. Here, even at home, your wallet still being squeezed.</p>
              <p>What I spend here in a month, minimum can use 3 times at our neighbours. With inflation, very soon can hit 4 times. And I only see it going up.</p>
              <p>Oh ya, they call me quitter. Another name is global citizen.</p>
