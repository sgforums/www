              <p>there are nice really good TDs, there are horrific ones who give the rest a bad name...</p>
              <p>btw... from Orchard Road to Clementi Central, his way = go to River Valley Road, towards SGH then to AYE then to Clementi Central.. or my way, right through Orchard Boulevard, through to Botanic Gardens, to Holland, to the old Provost, to Clementi?</p>
              <p>and no one is telling you to charge through red lights.. if anyone does, they're just being a danger to themselves and everyone else around them... driving safely does not equate to slowing down intentionally to get stuck in red lights...</p>

              <p>just a question, it seems that whenever passengers suggests a route, (which may not be the best), TDs are not too happy, given it may insult their experience/intelligence or etc.Why can't the TDs calmly advise/suggest?

              <p>I got encountered twice that cab drivers purposely drive a longer route to the destination.</p>
              <p>so can complain against the cab driver? I can understand why they do it, as longer route will mean extra few dollars, but as a passenger, I dun like the idea of taking me for a ride.</p>
              <p>Did u read the word COMPLAIN...he's not here to discuss, he's asking how to complain...</p>
