              <p>I got encountered twice that cab drivers purposely drive a longer route to the destination.</p>
              <p>so can complain against the cab driver? I can understand why they do it, as longer route will mean extra few dollars, but as a passenger, I dun like the idea of taking me for a ride.</p>

              <p>something should be done to the fare structure for day drivers really. they work more for lesser fare, need to withstand heat , traffic jams etc etc. and also i heard day pax all sibeh knn one esp morning ones , all in a rush , they late they will chase the TD to drive faster. not to forget those market aunties , one time put some smelly fishes in the boot , the day is gone liao.</p>

              <p>If u chose to keep your mouth shut , pls bear with those consequences .</p>
              <p>All drivers has got different knowledge of Singapore roads , all our fingers different length , so u dun expect all cabbies to do the same route everytime u say it .</p>

              <p>Maybe the taxi driver is new and dont know the shortest route. Maybe he knows the route. It is your duty to direct him if he seems to be going the wrong way. Going a round about way is really not the best way to earn more. It is the wrong method actually.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For me, I only pick up passengers where there is at least a $3 surcharge. The flag down fare is too low. Garment increase every fuck bill and bus fare except taxi. They want to earn more but assume its ok for TD to earn less. Flag down fare of $2.80 or $3 with no surcharge to anywhere in Singapore is too cheap and not worth my time at all except for the old unker taxi driver who needs enough to eat, drink, smoke, toto, 4d and newspaper.</p>

              <p>Come on lah, so many white collars retrenched in the last few years and ended up as TD. That guy might be 1 of them and really don't know the route well. If you're not happy, tell him and see if he offer you a discount. I always tell this kind of pax to "pay what you normally pay" and take it as school fee to learn the new route.</p>
              <p>BTW OMO is One Man Operation. It was used in the late 70's/early 80's when SBS buses started to take away the bus conductor from their buses, leaving the driver to do all the shit alone.</p>

              <p>Maybe the taxi driver is new and dont know the shortest route. Maybe he knows the route. It is your duty to direct him if he seems to be going the wrong way. Going a round about way is really not the best way to earn more. It is the wrong method actually.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For me, I only pick up passengers where there is at least a $3 surcharge. The flag down fare is too low. Garment increase every fuck bill and bus fare except taxi. They want to earn more but assume its ok for TD to earn less. Flag down fare of $2.80 or $3 with no surcharge to anywhere in Singapore is too cheap and not worth my time at all except for the old unker taxi driver who needs enough to eat, drink, smoke, toto, 4d and newspaper.</p>

              <p>strange.. maybe we should do what the UK does for people applying for TD licenses...</p>
              <p>and with that, TDs will also have the clout to go and demand for higher fares...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>TD's also human, maybe at that point of time brain not working liao, imagine having to drive 9 hrs on the road, could have gone wrong way. Well the customer have the right to be piss, honestly as a TD I dont think we need to cheat extra $2. Drop off a pax fast chances of another pax up at 2.80 better??? Pax like to think we take them for a ride but seriously, I dont think any TD thinks a pax well especially LOCAL pax is stupid being taken for an extra long ride. Oh well yeah Cheapos we met a lot.</div>

              <p>poolman is actually condoning the driver for a blatant attempt to cheat? because i've actually told a driver before and i ended up being nagged and nagged for the whole trip... i was pretty pissed off but left it at that...</p>
              <p>just coz being a cabbie is a tough life, doesn't mean that the world owes you a living and you can cheat to earn a few dollars more..</p>
              <p>that being said, i've also come across another type of "cheat"... driver sees a traffic light, he purposely slows down drastically so that the traffic light turns to ember then red by the time he reaches the traffic lights.. so much so that a 15 minute trip turns into a 30 minute trip..</p>
