              <p>SBC hold is a very useful feature, which allows you not to press handbrake or leg brakes, it comes with older models Benzs, I think after 2008 models don't have for E200 petrol, maybe diesel models have.</p>
              <p>If got cruise control even better. I dunno how you compare between Wish and Benz and come out with Wish winning. Maybe diesel Benz diffferent or yours very old already based on mileage.</p>
              <p>For 1, Benz seats especially new ones, very comfortable, road holding or gripping is very good, try Benz on uneven or bumpy road, see how it grips or adjusts.</p>
              <p>Consumption should be lesser too if you drive normally. (Based on compressor engine)</p>
              <p>Turning radius Benz beats almost every other car, even tightest angles, it can manuever.</p>
              <p>If I stay with my weekday hirer until January, he will change his Azera for the new benz, so lets see how that works.</p>

              <p>Aiya boss pool, you not used to driving RWD car lah. It is harder to drive a RWD because the steering wheel and power wheel is different. But one good thing is RWD can drift if you turn off the ESP so can cup corner faster. Actually very easy, when you free go and practice at Tuas South Ave 1X there. Becasue RWD vehicle suffers from over steering as the power is at the back and the front wheel just purely for steering. But this disavantages also in a way is an advantage. You will have more precise control of the steering when you CUP corner. The ESP of MB is very solid, when CUP corner KAR KAR LAI, step hard on the pedal no problem. When system encounter a lose of traction it is cut power to the affected rear wheel.</p>
              <p>Trust me, last night I was driving in the heavy downfall whack 120kph down SLE with some puddles of water at the side I also zai zai. Then I test the brake at YCK Road. From 80-0kph only about 1 1/2 or less car length.</p>
              <p>Why people prefer Wish is because the rear seat have a higher head room so entry and exit is easy. Also is the lack of a drivetrain for FWD Wish so middle pax will have more leg space. But ideally the MB E Class is mean to be a 4 seater with only 2 pax at the back.</p>

              different. But one good thing is RWD can drift if you turn off the
              ESP so can cup corner faster. Actually very easy, when you free go

              suffers from over steering as the power is at the back and the
              front wheel just purely for steering. But this disavantages also in
              a way is an advantage. You will have more precise control of the
              steering when you CUP corner. The ESP of MB is very solid, when CUP

              <p>oh ya, forgot to mention braking.</p>
              <p>1 day when I was limo driving, 1 youngster trying his best to race with me along Upp thomson in some new Japanese car (forget what model). Normally I don't bother, i drive fast for a reason - usually because I am late. My merc that time quite old, coming 5 years.</p>
              <p>Anyway Upp Thomson coming down, I know where got camera etc, so I driving, he happily alongside, suddenly reach SLE junction got camera, light turn amber, I braked (not jam) a bit harder, Merc swee swee stop well before line, our friend brake at same time, car cross the line, kena snap!</p>
              <p>I have driven BMW, Merc, Volvo and Lexus (unfortunately never try Audi) during Limo and car jockey time and for this luxury car range, I prefer the merc best, maybe Lexus is equal.</p>
              <p>Benz is a realible car, easy for small repairs, consume less, driving and handling is much easier and best of all a certain level of comfort.</p>

              <p>huh? 4 WD become R WD, too much RWS liao, in most premier car, the rear wheel also turn when steering turn, but not to the extend of the front wheel, if you notice merc, when they turn, not only the wheel turn but it also tilt at a angle, a calculated angle to hold steady the vehicle, other may topple, but merc and most premier car will hold the groundÂ and with rear wheel also turning, they are the best in cornering radius.</p>
