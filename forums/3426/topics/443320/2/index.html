              <p>1 thing I always do if I take call and I very special one, only take call if I like the sound of passenger name, the timing after midnight, the distance is within range (no traffic jam, roundabout way to get there) and not in an area where many street hire cabs are available depending on time (if say AMK Ave 3 at 815pm, and you are at AMK ave 10, by the time you come there in 3-5 mins, passenger already find another cab).</p>
              <p>The 1 thing i do is always press 3 min, even if i am far away, because if you press 5, 7 0r 10 min, you go there, pax already ciao or never come, you gonna have to wait another 5 min before system will let you cancel.</p>
              <p>Also I never call pax on my hp, unless really absolutely necesarry, you call on your hp and he answer, you committed to wait for him. Just go and press 3 min, wait max 5 min and then leave, no extra extra unless after midnight in some ulu place where you know pax cant run away and you cant find another fare for next 20 mins.</p>
              <p>If you reach and press arrive and call, and suddenly pax cancel, no need to waste time, put busy and dont take any other pax from same area. Some very cunning think very smart and cancel so can hop on taxi without booking charge. Never mind let him win by cancel, but you dont lose by taking for nothing in same area.</p>
              <p>Thats my advice.</p>

              <p>Also I dont take call where booking say VIP. I work service industry, VIP usually means pax is a complain king or very fussy. You little late or take wrong route, get ready for explanation either to company if lucky or LTA if suay. Plus for stupid comfort VIP means must wait additional 5 mins before no show (total 10 mins).</p>
              <p>Thank you, I say when see VIP call, but my taxi is ordinary Sonata very old and always breakdown, got no standard for VIP. VIP should take Mercedes or Chrysler, got standard one.</p>
              <p>1 time I take booking at Rivergate (I hate Rivergate, outside CBD) but I think that day I good mood, just take booking fee can. Go there and wait for abt 4 min, screwrity guard come and tell to park straight, my cab in waiting area, no other vehicle, no obstruction but he want my cab choon choon in the yellow box. No problem, I reverse and exit the condo, thank you very much! Then I press no show, suddenly words come out , pls wait 5 more mins, VIP pax, but when I take the call the booking never say VIP. I call comfort and tell them, very sorry hor, I wait 5 mins, pax no show, your booking never say VIP, I already leave, I also got family to feed and need to find pax fast, cannot afford to wait, you please cancel, and no way will I go back. Opeartor not happy, not happy not my problem, it's you and your VIP problem, my time not rubber time, VIP got no courtesy to come within 5 min, dont come to me looking to be a stupid fool.</p>

              <p>Haha, I kena 1 time. This is what happen when you try to be nice guy.</p>
              <p>Like most once come River Valley, I will only stop at Clark Quay. But 1 Fri nite, my backside itchy, 1 pax flag just before Md Sultan, everyone else had avoided him, those days i like to put changing shift, so I ask him where he go at 11.40pm, he say bedok, i say sorry I going Newton.</p>
              <p>So I carry on, but of course my mistake to cancel the change shift after midnight and re-log on. This mf later complain to LTA and of course I got a nice invitation. Comfort of course very helpful, go and download the data from my MDT etc and give them (my stupid hirer also neevr tell me this).</p>
              <p>So I go LTA, but lucky I kena a reasonable officer. I tell him, sir, yes I got put changing shift because that day I take over at 6 then put yishun CS because gonna meet my son and that day got religious affair (really got that day) which i must go Novena, thats why i put Cs to newton. After Yishun I got go Novena and then wanna go Tank Road also for praying, thats I put CS, but why I ask pax because I realise why other cab never stop, he was waiting at River Valley near the bend, double white line, very dangerous, when i stop I realise that and wanted to move so I just make excuse ask where, say cannot and quickly chow.</p>
              <p>Officer say this serious $200 + 2 weeks, I say very sorry never do on purpose. I say I accept whatever you say and wanna do, but if can give warning or reduce fine to just CS when not changing ($50) I am grateful. He say okay, see how, he tell pax give me warning.  Few day later I call him, he say pax not happy with warning, i say never mind, you do what you have to do. So far until now, no letter or call from officer, so i think pax never go down LTA or whatever. If still kena bo pian. But for me, no more Mr Nice Guy, pax waiting before CBD, no need to stop, very dangerous behind got car, I never see, consentrate fully on the road. Only inside CBD, I filter to the left and drive slowly.  No more CS, but I will study pax first from now on, if got group or I suspect whatever (pay Nets etc), never mind I drive long enough to know what kind of pax I want to pick up.</p>
              <p>Sometime, I guess wrong for sure but bo pian just take but most time I can get it right. Thank you LTA, now I follow your rules, no bus-stop, no near junction, your pax all before CBD like to wait near bus-stop or at junction what! So I follow traffic rules and keep safety first, you want to summon me, summon la, summon what I very interested to know. So when pax complain got no taxi like Mr Conrad Raj the Today Editor, I laugh and laugh, dont blame me hor, blame your super LTA for their wonderful rules.</p>
