              <p><br>Taxis will never be a hit, remember what I said before, if you feed a slave too much, he will get lazy with full of ego and pride. Govt knows that if taxis driving get too huat, too many will come in, and most will become proud with a yaya papaya lazy attitude.</p>
              <p>The ideal situation will be not so huat, yet not so bo huat, half alive, half dead type, like this, TD will have to slave for a living and at the same time, got time to rest and be fed.</p>
              <p>And this had clearly been show by rental increases and more taxis on the road, this translate to taxis companies and govt huat big time, we still hv to peng.</p>

              <p>Long long the chinese had been doing business with europe, they hate the american, but have to buy their bonds to keep the dollars afloat as chinese had invested too much with their reminbi.</p>
              <p>During the communist period, audi, BM and VW were already there, but more for the elites and the leaders, as china liberalised, citizens become rich, they also want to feel like elites and leaders style, and at the same time, Audi BM and VW become cheaper and cheaper, with operation in china, spare part is easily available, in big cities alone, the like of guangdong, shanghai, bejin, chengdu and so on, Audi on the street is like out toyota here.</p>
              <p>Coupled with the dislike of japan due to sour relationship and island dispute, control of koreas goods to satisfy her stubborn ally, the North korea.  Conti cars in China become a norm. In Bejin alone, 1.6cc is for kids, almost 3/4 of the car population there are 2.0cc and above with europe brand, from citiroen to opal, skoda to Audi, the chinese alway like big and spacious thing, road big, car big, house big,..a sign of rich.</p>

              <p>suspect the mas curbs will mean more biz for us td's within next 1-2 mths.</p>
              <p>we seem to have fewer taxis on road at night from 2-3 weeks ago.</p>
              <p>Last night bus on fire at PIE end up shenton many people zero taxis at 9pm. Normally need 2 expressway to screw up then get to zero.</p>
              <p>From seeing employers scream bout no people to hire recently suspect the 7k who become hirers last year have gone back to jobs this year.</p>
              <p>The way the curbs play out, odds very high fare will increase this year.</p>
