              <p>But brother, to be frank, taxis had give you and your family a living all these years, you can go fuck your boss or taxi companies or LTA or Govt, but do not fuck the taxi, it is the most important tool of your trade. Sayang it, it will bring more good luck and fortune to you. Like it or not, you spend the time with your cab more than with anyone, it is a part of you, treasure it.</p>
              <p>Again, I give a true experiences I got when I was a seaman working under the dock master, we called ourselve the Dockers, laymen call us sailor. Every country we go, we put a tattoo to remember it, that is why seamen got lot of tattoos, some of course for the love girls we met while sailing,</p>
              <p>I was a playful young man, we take care of the cargo bunkers, loading and unloading and other ship deck issues, anything on deck is under the Dock master, anything in engine room belong to chief enginneer, and anything on top of the deck belong to the 1st officer who can also be the captain overlooking all matters, and only he is allow to carry a gun incase of mutiny. (meaning crews going against captain and took over the ship, which happened in south america, africa, and so on). At the international water / sea,  a merchant ship got no rules, no police, no army, no TP.</p>
              <p>This master once taught me how to open the cargo bunker, you need to know how to use the  hydraulic function to open the cargo bunker big cover doors, when it get stuck due to rust or sea corrosion or frozen cargo, you need to push it abit with a crowbar to release the ice, or whatever rust and dirt. We also hv to maintain the mechanism by oiling, painting or cleaning, at sea, corrosion happen very fast due to salty envronment. I used his crowbar and play with it, then I throw the crowbar one side, and forget to bring back into the ship store, later the evening, the old master asked me for the crowbar, I told him I might had lost it, I will try to find for him in the morning, he told me that crowbar had been with him for last 25years, it is a part of his working tool wherever ship he went, so I told him, no big deal, I can buy one or draw out one from the store for him. Then he lectured me for an hour. He said, alway remember to take care of the tool who fed you, from allen key to spanner, he had never once change them, he take care of them like soldier take care of his rifle in war times, because these tools helped him to survive all these years, a good mechanics take care of his tools, a good docker take cares of his crowbar, a good cabby take care of his cab. </p>

              <p>u must be joking right? watch prem league at 100 mph on tv is anytime better than s league at 15 mph (!?!?) even at the stadium.</p>
              <p>but if it's like the previous malaysia cup ties, 75,000 in Nat stadium, "Ref kayu!!!" n u can feel the whole stadium shake....ah!</p>
