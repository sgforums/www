              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Hallo my dear cabby uncle friends, how are you all? From the postings here seems that all are doing well. </span></span><span style="font-family: Wingdings;     "><span>J</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I am back online and will try to pick up from where I left and continue sharing my experiences with you all. Sorry if some are a bit outdated or irrelevant now. Actually looking back at<span>  </span>it, I am amazed at how different a person I am now compared to just over one month ago. Not just different at the way I ply the trade, but also at how I look at life. Driving taxi sure is an eye opener to me, almost like seeing a parallel second universe that I did not know before.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Anyway, before I bore you all more to death, as they all say, let’s the story continue……..</span></span></p>

Near Novena got a PRC flag my cab “Ma Li Si Tar”, wahlau eh this continues for the whole night. Even when I decided to heck care and just drive to CBD, from LP the girl throw me Hougang. On second thought, maybe I should have driven further and join the queue at 1RQ rather than LP, and maybe it is better. But it was 8+ nearly 9pm and I was afraid the office crowd have all already gone home by then.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>So far my biggest trips are only $36+ and $38+.

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>It was just before midnight when I picked up a young girl at Elizabeth Link. Destination : Cineleisure. I was like, HAH??? Wow, teenager nowadays sure got a lot of money to spend. Anyway the next trip is the interesting one.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>As I dropped the girl in front of Cine, suddenly two teenage girls and one boy jumped into my cab (Honestly, I don’t have intention to sabo all those uncles who queued there, but since they jump in, it is pantang to reject my luck right?)</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>One of the girl said: “Uncle, three places, AMK, Woodlands and Punggol. Whicever one first is up to you” Ha ha ha, if up to me like that sure I will go Punggol then Woodlands then AMK &lt;evil grin&gt;, but I said”Ok AMK first then you toss a coin Wdl or Punggol next” Then I asked the boy where he stays, since he stays at Punggol, I suggest Punggol to be last stop. Anyway either way is dead place and I have to cruise back empty to town. Started the trip just before midnight (got CBD surcharge, shiok) then after a few minutes the midnight surcharge kicked in (lagi shiok!). Reach punggol :$38.80. “Biggest trip I had so far”</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>It was after midnight on a weekday when I took a 50+ y.o. uncle from RWS to Hougang (Avenue 8 block 600+). During the trip I asked whether it was his first time there, he just laughed at me and said it was his fifth (and this is when the casino is opened for just less than two weeks ??!!). He said he still need to work the next morning so he has to go home. He seems to be cheerful so I knew he was winning.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>After further talk he told me first time he lost a few hundred, then second time earn back few hundred, third time win one thousand, fourth time two thousand, and that morning he won nearly four thousand playing roulette !<span>  </span>WTF, some people got all the luck. At that time I nearly ask him to be my godfather and bring me along next time he go casino, but on second thought I am scared later I got addicted then how??</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>Anyway, when reaching destination, meter was $24+. He gave me some $10 notes and said “ You keep, you keep”. At that time I thought he gave me $30, after he got down I counted it was actually $40. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>So this is my largest tip so far. Narrowly beating the previous record of US$10.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>That one was from a late fifty ang moh I picked up from T3. He was a nice guy, chose to sit in the front passenger sit and chit chat with me during the trip. A consultant for the LV IR coming down here for biz trip.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>When reaching the hotel at the Marina area he whipped out his corporate credit card and then also said “If I give you ten bucks will it be any good for you?” Of course it is!. Any kind of appreciation of our hard work is most welcome </span><span style="font-family: Wingdings; color: blue;    "><span>J</span></span><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'> Thank you sir!</span></span></p>

                      juicy PRC MMs? whatever!)</span></p>

                      MM to tell. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>I picked up a woman pax (around mid forty) from Science Park 1(along the Sci Pk Dr) wanting to go to Singapore Casket (Lavender) at around 20.30pm on a weekday.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>Me : “No problem. Let’s go through AYE then CTE then through Balestier”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>Pax : “ Why are you taking a big round to go there? The last time the driver go through Holand Road, Orchard, then Newton there”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>In my heart I thought “WTF?!?!<span>  </span>Going that way will take through at least one hundred and twelve traffic lights!!” <span> </span>But what came out from my mouth was “Sure can…. No problem”. Damn. I am such a hypocrite (correct spelling??) bastard. </span><span style="font-family: Wingdings; color: blue;    "><span>J</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>To be frank at that time (and even up to now) when a pax tell me a destination, I could only connect from pick up point to destination, and if there are few options can only <em>agar</em> which one is the best way to choose. I still don’t know exactly which way is shortest<span>  </span>(see further comment <span> </span>below)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>Moving along Buona Vista she blurted out “ Maybe we can go down Portsdown….”<span>  </span>WTF?!? Just now did not want to go AYE now want to go Portsdown. But I just pretend I didn’t hear that and continue.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>Then this is the best part. When reaching Holland Rd, she said “Do you know. If we go down Clementi Rd and then Bukit Timah there (she meant Dunearn) will it be faster?” I nearly say “You want to go through KJE Mam?” but managed to say “Don’t think so lah. I think last time the taxi driver uncle got the BEST way”.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>You know how sometimes we get a little bit of delay at the traffic light in front of the Shaw House? We wouldn’t even call it a jam, but from the backseat suddenlay came “Uncle, just now if we went straight to Grange Rd and come down here maybe it is faster?” Wahlau, honestly at that point of time I nearly say ”Mam, shall we stop the meter here and then I let you drive my cab to Lavender?”. But of course, all drivers in Poolie group here are courteous drivers one and will never loose temper like that.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>Coming to Newton Rd she said again “Do you know how to go to Balestier from here? I can’t remember how the driver go the other day” Of course lah. It is just straight and you get there what. I was thinking, maybe the uncle driver brought her through Thomson Rd and then the brighter side of Balestier before continue down the dull side of Balestier and Lavender?? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>Before reaching the traffic light in front of Singapore Casket (I was in the right lane, mind you) she told me to just stop before the red light. I wonder why is that woman so control freak and stingy???<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans"; color: blue;'>So guys, remember. If you happen to pick up a bespectacled, straight short haired, mid forty 75%<span>  </span>woman pax from along Science Park Drive, you have been warned. This woman had been trained by the best uncle driver in Singapore !</span></p>

              with books, sure it won’t sell well, because they don’t have
              stories of juicy encounters with PRC MeiMeis (or should it be

              <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I drive taxi for nearly
              two months, so far only pick up PRC MM three times. KNN that
              celebrity uncle TD drove taxi for six months, got so much story
              about PRC MM to tell.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">He must have been
              studying very hard and doing a lot of homework at the right
