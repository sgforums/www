              <p><span><em>Started by joining the queue at AMK office area, got there about 6 cabs in front of me. Waited abt 3 mins but only move up one cab, then I get scared loose, so I left the que thinking of picking up road side pax at an MNC office nearby. Pass through there, not a single pax waiting, then slowly cruise down AMK until saw another queue at Lor Chuan. Up to then I spent nearly 20mins empty and was starting to feel that driving cab is not easy as I thought.</em></span></p>
              <p><span><em>Join the queue for about 5mins+ and one gentleman get on my cab “Uncle Lucky Plaza please”.</em></span></p>
              <p><span><em>Bingo, not bad my first pax ask me to go in CBD, drove him in and he paid by Charge card.</em></span></p>
              <p><span><em> </em></span></p>
              <p><span><em>At LP got 2 philippino ladies got in and ask to drive to boat quay, another CBD! From CBD one girl ask me to drive her to Red Dot house on Maxwell. From Maxwell cruise down along Robinson but saw the taxi stands full of cabs, so tried 1 Raffles Quay instead.</em></span></p>
              <p><span><em>While waiting on the queue at 1RQ, I read the notes again and noticed that CBD surcharge is not auto, must key in manually!!??!!$$%% WTF,<span> </span> I didn’t charge the first two CBD pax (LP and BQ) and lost $6 income!!???!!$$!! Ah, new lesson learned.</em></span></p>
              <p><span><em>A jap pax got in asked to drive to 28Scotts. I thought nmv lah, a bit out of CBD just learn to see all those flagging along Scotts as transparent and get to LP queue again. Reached 28 scotts, got a young pretty jap lady waiting for me at the lobby (ha ha I wished, but she was waiting for a taxi lah). She got in and asked me to drive to Paragon taxi stand, not bad, got pax and at same time save on ERP. Dropped her off at taxi drop off and joined the CentrePoint queue. A young Indonesian girl got in and asked me to drive her to, guess what, Red House Maxwell rd again. What’s happening at Red House?? :)</em></span></p>
              <p><span><em>Drop her off there and join the taxi stand along Robinson. Got a black French guy got in and asked me to drive him home to Anchorage. By then already 8pm, drive into CBD and que at 1RQ again.</em></span></p>

              <p><br>It could be anybody's guess ..... that Wish could be heading into Suntec .</p>
              <p>Pax paid ERP and sent that Wish driver into CBD .</p>
              <p>Remember some time last week i told you i was at St 65 ?</p>
              <p>Yeah , i got a trip into Suntec Tower 1/2 .</p>
              <p>So u think u are unlucky that u got Nathan Road ?</p>
              <p>I was lucky to get Suntec ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Given that u got a Suntec , if u dun get a good connection , bad luck ?</p>
              <p>Given that i got a Nathan , and i can create another connection into CBD , am i lucky ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nope , i am some kind of shrew here .</p>
              <p>U could be blindly shooting into any taxi stand , not me bro .</p>
              <p>I judge potential paxes .</p>
              <p>if taxi stand is local , i normally would give this taxi stand a miss at Suntec .</p>
              <p>I would prefer to head into Millenia Tower instead .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It will take a bit of time for you to understand what i meant .</p>
