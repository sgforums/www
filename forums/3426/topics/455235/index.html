              <p>Join as relief first, there are many relief driving whole day weekend, sat and sun, or only sat, cdg have the most hirers looking for relief. Can bargain from $90 to $80, then take is as $50 drive taxis and another $30 spend on bringing family outing transportation on a sunday morning, then later drive all way till 10 or 11pm, cos you need to work tomorrow. By the way, Sunday nite, after 8 or 9, can beat mosquito liao</p>

              <p>You mean until monday nite, that is 48hrs for $95, not bad, must be 1.8cc.</p>
              <p>Can lah, knn, sat nite, within 3 to 4hrs, all earn back liao, including CNG, must be steady, do not get excited, end up go toilet many times <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> with anxiety urine and shitting.</p>
              <p>What you should do is get a smart phone to be your GPS, if you really need one, than no choice, have to invest one, now very cheap.</p>
              <p>Starting from saturday nite, the town is full of peoples clubbing, pubbing and dinning, so, you need to know the city well, at 11 and 12, most clubbers are changing venue, and also come CB kia going to budget hotels with hookers, also there will be people going for supper and end of wedding or company D n D function at hotels.</p>
              <p>Next, you need to know all the expressways well, how they are connected and how you can get out from the nearest exit from town. Sat night driving must also do interview so that you stay close to city, because going into HDB town or private estates, you most properly will hv to head back to city for another pax.</p>
              <p>Set your periphery in and from the city, to north, CTE KPE, the most ang mo kio, east side, PIE, ECP or nicoll, most Bedok, to the west, PIE, ECP, most Commonwealth or clemeti, it is all up to you, so if a pax said , uncle Yishun, you can reject.</p>
              <p>Sunday morning many going airport, workers going to jurong and people going to church, afternoon, all going shopping or attending birthday, or malay weddings or other functions, nite is all those returning from shopping, if you want to stay at your town, go to the shopping centres to pick up like shutter service, then about 9 to 10, lots of army guys, bf sending gf home and those chinese wedding ending.</p>
              <p>Monday, all working class on the road, monday blue, all sleepy, tire and late, most expect taxis driver to know the road, cos they no mood to talk so much<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">, this is where you go wrong, you get fark siong siong. For this, you must know the financial centres well, the taxis stop and ERPs</p>

              <p>Alamak Tzarh, do not worry, there are 28 thousand cabbies + about 20 thousand reliefs, even my ah gong former army buddy can make it to do a decent living out of it, you no problem one lah.</p>
              <p>You see brother, drive taxis is like you rent a stall to sell foods, you can alway tell people, no more fish soup, all sold out, if want fish head, still have, but more expensive.</p>
              <p>As a customer, you also lan lan go other place and eat, same goes to TD, you are a businessman  renting out a vehicle to do a commercial trade, you are the boss, the hirer, the worker, the planner and at the same time, the financial controller.</p>
              <p>If you are not putting on changing shift on top, just tell people changing shift soon, not in the way, sorry. Be polite abit, no harm done. Heavy alcohol smell also avoid, those cannot walk properly want also avoid. Uncle me carried many girls out of my cab, called police many times that I know a few of them who attended my calls. Only girl I carry them out, for guy, I call police to carry him out. Paid me and I fark off, knn waste lot of time.</p>
              <p>For nite shift, you can control your destination better than in day shift, even those regular nite pax also know the trick TD play, most will ask you before boarding, they do not wish to end up you not going and they hv to come out again then, fuck here and there.</p>
              <p>Lock your cab door, roll down side window, ask or being ask by people, then decided yourself if you wish to go. Must have some 6 sense on the people and smell them.</p>
              <p>At nite, transcab not much call, you need to look out for pax at hotel, look out of sirens<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">, must be abit more alert, cos lots of vulture like pool, komade and many other around, if raining or certain eve of holiday, you Huat big big, cos whole city street full of pax, you are king, some may flag with $50<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">, some waiting for you at the expressway exit, especially CTE.</p>
              <p>Finally, the most important is be safe, I called it Bizsafe, meaning both business and you are safe, business meaning your cab also must be safe, therefore you need to avoid accident as much as possible, from those senior of former TC, TC never give chance on whether you are right or wrong. For a start, less business nevermind, take it as a start up, it will be very interesting and yet exciting and worrysome, but just make sure you go home in your cab, and not in my casket van.</p>
