              <p>I was accused of being a Dishonest Taxi Driver. Picked up pax at 
              Upper Serangoon (near Kovan)  wanting to go to Flora Road. I was like 
              huh!.Then he said go by TPE. OK. Only TPE connection I know is by Seng 
              Kang &gt; TPE.I told him the route and he said OK.</p>
              <p>When I pased 
              Tampines Road, he asked why I never turn. I told him I can U-Turn and go
               back but he said it is too long and go by my way. My way is GPS. I told
               him GPS shows 2km++ to TPE. U-turn to Tampines only few meters. He said
               go my way.</p>
              <p>My way to TPE is by Sengkang until TPE. Half way pax 
              make noise. Then he call me dishonust Taxi Driver. That is where I 
              dropped him at Seng Kang and told him to take another taxi. With all my 
              dis-honesty, I did not collect a single cent from him.</p>

              <p>Meter Fare vs Non Meter Fare.</p>
              <p>Let's compare the pros' and cons'</p>
              <p>Meter Fare, pax eyes on meter when they should be concentrating on route TD is taking. Even if pax tell TD which route to take and end up in jam, they still blame TD because Singapore Law is by meter and TD should know which routes are jammed. TD take jammed routes based on pax instructions, TD gets warning letter if pax complains.</p>
              <p>Non Meter Fare. Pax and TD agree on a fixed amount from point A to B. Pax like Chriss Reed will have nothing to complain about.</p>
              <p>But tihis will lead to Accounting problems in Singapore. How to know how much TD uncles really earn???</p>

              <p>The only way to prevent such unpleasant encounter is to brush up on route knowledge , and through experience, no short cuts, once pax say the destination, within 1 to 2 seconds taxis muz move, within 3 to 4 seconds, in your mind muz know which is the best route to take, when reaching the first  approcaching junction, your taxi head muz point towards the correct direction, where got time to key in this and that, or check dis or dat ?</p>

              my only advise
              go find a map, hard copy or online type
              sometime after finishing your driving, recall some trip taken which  not sure (pax kpkb or not)
              look at the the map ,see beside the road you took, any other route available or not which could be a better route.
              look at area you not familar, study a bit on the area, it would help you in your driving
              faster and cheap route can translate to faster income
