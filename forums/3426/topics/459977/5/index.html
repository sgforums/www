              <p>Actually, after a while plying as a taxi.........</p>
              <p>Everybody will come out your way of driving, way of queuing, way of cruising on the road.........etc.......</p>
              <p>Like if you happen to be in Tampines, my style, head straight to Airport, street got pax also won't stop........</p>
              <p>Will never queue at any neighbourhood shopping mall, because I hate trolley of plastic bags.......</p>
              <p>In CBD, I only pick up from ORQ or Battery Road.........</p>
              <p>And many many more patterns created by myself..........</p>
              <p>So after a while, kind of pax you are fetching is already more or less fixed........</p>
              <p>And what it actually imply?.......meaning chances of getting nasty pax is lower, because you are so use to those places that you had picked up, once pax on board, turn left, turn right, hit which highway, hit which small lane is within your finger tips...........</p>
              <p>If pick up place not familiar, like on call, don't take la.........because you will ended up creating a problem for yourself..........</p>

              <p>I still ask : " Hmm , which side of PIE ? Upper Serangoon ? or Sims Way ? "</p>
              <p>I can only think of this two routes , he think think and say go straight after Nicholl Highway . He not even sure , but we must be sure !!!</p>

              my experience tells me
              
              never ask "which way is your preferred way"
              
              normally NCNL pax will have a preferred way and they will automatic tell you
              
              Normally I will ask "Sir / madm ...could I go via XXXXX "

              <p>True. Most shop assistants will ask "Can I help you?". Very good. But they cannot help you if your question is too difficult. They must call their supervisor or manager. TD call who? CDG CEO ah!</p>

              <p>Taking ourselves as pax, if a TD ask us for any prefer road, naturally, we would help, because at the end of the day, we also want to reach our destination swifty and the cab driver also want a smoother journey. That is a win win situation.</p>
              <p>In all mattters, be it personal or working or driving, frist and foremost is to search for a win win situation, not i lose and you win or you lose I win situation, and certainly, not a solution that we all lose.</p>

Of course I can go by my own way, but let put it these way, both of us might have a bad day, let not make it more bad, so if you are happy, I drive on, if not, then, we should end our relation at this point and let part forthe good of both of us, it an honour serving you.</p>
