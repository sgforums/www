              <p>Hougang residents is dam lucky to have a second chance.</p>
              <p>Whatever result this time, they really deserved it!!!</p>
              <p>For reference, look at the past result, go take a look at Potong Pasir just after a few months.</p>
              <p>For a good 11 years, I lived in Bt Gombak under Ling How Dong, the whole place like shit. The moment I moved out, the MP changed and now look at the whole estate.</p>
              <p>People here can stir shit, can talk only, cos they not the stake holder. Even that Yaw guy, one hand standing for election in one area, himself vote Teo Ho Pin in Bt Panjang. Why? he not stupid hor. cos his interest is at stake.</p>
              <p>It's ok if u choose to be sacrificial lamb. to be matyr. As long as MP in Bt Panjang is Dr Teo, other area not my business, (that was in Yaw's mnd right?)</p>
              <p>If one uses his brain to think and not his heart, which one is a better candidate? Who can do a better job?</p>
              <p>That Png guy u think he can? "you xin wu li". Limited resources. At most can make some noise. </p>
              <p>The whole WHITE squandron can be out to be sure Desmond fulfill wat he promised. They got so much at stake at the next election if he did not.</p>
              <p>What stake has the other side got? If cannot achieved, at most send a sms or a email from dunno where and just say "sorry". That's all right?</p>
              <p>This comments from a "guo lai ren". If there is someone of better quality standing there, say Chiam See Tong, I would say a different tune.</p>
              <p>Png is consider 5th or 6th best in his own party. The rest in already in NCMP liao. Technically a reject for NCMP position. Reason? at the time the reason given was they want young blood right? Png is consider TOO OLD.</p>
              <p>Had WP know of such result today, they could put him in NCMP and keep Gerald Giam for today. Then maybe u can say he is the "best" man right?</p>
              <p>Your own stake or be sacrificial lamb? U decide! Dun ever hope for a 3rd time ok!</p>

              Lee Kuan Yew did not brought in any foreigners and we survive and grow from third world to first world , why do we need that now?

              if they are to bring in foreigners to keep sporeans on their toe , we likewise must do our part to keep them on their toe .

              <p>Look around Singapore, foreign companies came in to invest, they pump in the money, create jobs for local. Just imagine, all pull out from Sg, what will happen? </p><p>
              
              </p><p>When foreign companies came in, of course they look around globally for expertise, when jobs was offer to locals like us, what's our reaction? Low wages is the reason, so what can they do? Close shop? </p><p>
              
              </p><p>Without foreign investment in Sg, just depend on local companies to feed the people, wait long long, local companies is the worst among the worst to work with, especially so for family business type. </p><p>

              <p>In business, when there is competition, the businessmen will never want to compete on price.  So the conusmers will never enjoy that.  They will compete by dishing out complicated packages of products or services(bundling) to differentiate their products/services or offer diversity of choices.  Actually I call this strategy confusion to entrap consumers.  Most consumers are in no position to evaluate these packages properly or too painful to evaluate and so just 'te cum te cum' select theirs.  Those few who could evaluate can only choose the package that best suits their needs' patterns.  For this reasons, firms under competitive mkts still make good profits.</p>
              <p>Same thing for politics.  For western countries, not more than 2 parties because electorates can never know all the contestants well.  But 2 parties are not much of a competition really.  They will behind the scene not compete but offer differentiation of packages like businesses.  Depending on the majority, they trade your policies with one another , spending money which the states could not afford to launch their respective pet policies.  This results in the sovereign wealth problems of today of US/EU/Japan!  The worst is when it is nearly 50 50, because there will be lots of stalemates.  These means that the voters are paying them for no service at all!</p>
              <p>The best for any democracy is to have one strong professional party to be the ruling party and have a couple of oppo in parliament.  So these oppo could just offer different views and compare clearly whether the ruling party is offering good service or not.  Once we have equally strong parties, they will have to take party interest first and voters' interest last because if they are out no matter how good they are they cannot serve at all.  Also the ruling party will not have the sole responsibility to govern well because they have the other to blame.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>We already see that there are so many putting forward all kinds of assertions, policies etc to confuse electorates.  In politics, they are allowed in western countries to lie and mislead without legal consequences unlike businesses.  This is why I said democracy or autocracy or communism all do not solve problems and that is why the society is facing the same problems since civilisation.  However, if we have an technocratic govt it will at least deliver if the mission given to them is that of the citizens' . This is the same as businesses where GE could last hundreds of years delivering because they are govern by technocrats that has the mission to exist and prosper.  GE can exist not because of democracy you know.  Many businesses cannot survive is because the leaders do not have technocrats to fulfill the mission.</p></div>
