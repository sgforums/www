              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">To you what is slave?  We must recognise all govts' revenue comes from taxes and fees.  Sg is the leading one with some investment income to help.  Paying for useful service is what is considered fair. If you are another country, you pay taxes for those who cannot trace US$2b cash in Saddam's palace missing without a trace.  They also cannot account for most of the US$100m budget for the rebuilding of Iraq.  Welfare money keep flowing to the beneficiaries when they already no need them or dead.</span></p>
              <p>We cannot expect any govt to give citizens wealth - they are not able to do that because govt is not business.  As long as some of us make it rich, some so-so with 20% not so good thru our efforts , given the opportunities offered by the govt policies, this is normal.  We want the govt then help the bottom 20% to live reasonably -  If only govt could do this it is already doing a good job.  We do not want people to without much effort expect bacon on the table because this is unsustainable</p>

              <p>There is still a long way to go before opposition has the chance
              to become govt, but opposition will surely gain more votes as the
              years go.</p>
              <p>If you observe, the percentage of voters voting for PAP has been
              gradually going down over the last few elections.<span style="color: #ff0000;">Yah, 60% is low enough as I already shown you
              having 52 48 will unddermine electorates' interests.  I am
              happy with current arrangement because the experienced team will
              try not to make mistakes - that does not means they will not make
              mistakes but at least we are already extracting maximum benefits
              from employing them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">We want oppo to be in parliament
              to be the alternative voice and so leave it as such - no changing -
              if we change we are being foolish to be manipulated by the oppo to
              further their party interests.  Having some loud voices will
              be best but having too many loud voices with end up not conducive
              govt conditions and we, voters become the idiots to pay them to
              challenge each party's interests and paying for all their parties'
              interests and no work due to stalemates.</span></p>

              <p>Last General Election , spoke with one of mine taxi colleague .
                                      . . he stayed Hougang Ave 5 .</p>
              <p>He has got a Vietnam wife .</p>
              <p>He said he doesn't like the people from white corner , but have
                                      to vote for them .</p>
              <p>Why i asked ?</p>
              <p>He want to apply PR for his vietnam wife .<span style="color: #ff0000;">Your colleague's cannot be taken as right because his wife's application has no no bearing from the voting for white.  He could still vote for wp and apply - no bearing.  So he voted for white because he wanted white policies but just being diplomatic  to tell you that  because he knows you are fervent wp supporter.  All your WP's candidates trust that the ballot box is secret - I heard them declaring during the last election.<br></span></p>
              <p>I am very sad .</p>
              <p>Personal interest ahead of national interest .<span style="color: #ff0000;">How sure wp is for national interrest?  It has done its job in parliament.  Even if they make it to parliament their policies will have to be the same if they are doing for the good of spore except for more spending on welfare which is dangerous.<br></span></p>
              <p>I have to accept it .</p>
              <p>Accept that regardless of which country u staying in , "kelong"
                                      still exists .</p>
              <p>U vote the white u might get PR easier , u voted for the blues ,
                                      u just gotta wait .</p>
              <p>Sorry i lousy in English , i dun know what word to use other
                                      than "kelong" .</p>
