              <p>with blue drivers (some, because my dad is also a blue :P)...Yesterday night I went with my family to Kallang Way for 7th month dinner..The dinner ended about 2300 hours. My father drank a little too much and was a little sleepy. As you know, Kallang Way, being an industrial area, there were little cabs around that area at that time. So, I took bus 125 all the way from Kallang Way to Geylang so that we could hail a cab to head back home. By the time we reached Geyland, it was already 2330 hours. We tried to wait for a cab, and after a few minutes, we saw a blue with the green "TAXI" on. When we raised our hands and tried to hail it down, the stupid driver immidiately switched to "BUSY". Of course, my Father and I got so pissed off that we pointed our middle fingers at him. Since he sped past, I couldn't see if he was trying to say sorry or if he pointed his finger back at us. Anyway, lucky for us, a white/blue taxi stopped and picked us up after a few minutes. We reached home at 0010 hours.</p>
              <p>Are blues really that greedy for a $3 midnight surcharge? My father nearly died because he couldn't balance himself and almost fell off the road :(</p>

              <p>with blue drivers (some, because my dad is also a blue
              :P)...Yesterday night I went with my family to Kallang Way for 7th
              month dinner..The dinner ended about 2300 hours. My father drank a
              little too much and was a little sleepy. As you know, Kallang Way,
              being an industrial area, there were little cabs around that area
              at that time. So, I took bus 125 all the way from Kallang Way to
              Geylang so that we could hail a cab to head back home. By the time
              we reached Geyland, it was already 2330 hours. We tried to wait for
              a cab, and after a few minutes, we saw a blue with the green "TAXI"
              on. When we raised our hands and tried to hail it down, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the stupid
              driver immidiately switched to "BUSY"</span>. Of course, my Father and I
              got so pissed off that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we pointed our middle fingers at him</span>. Since
              he sped past, I couldn't see if he was trying to say sorry or if he
              pointed his finger back at us. Anyway, lucky for us, a white/blue
              taxi stopped and picked us up after a few minutes. We reached home
              at 0010 hours.</p>
              <p>Are blues really that greedy for a $3 midnight surcharge? My
              father nearly died because he couldn't balance himself and almost
              fell off the road :(</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>First off, I already made it clear my Father was drunk. You expect him to stay as sober to think about the booking fee? Secondly, I said SOME BLUES, not all. If you take offense to that, you're probably one of the "SOME". Besides, I said that there was another blue who picked us up. Thirdly, my Mother was there too. I SAID FAMILY. Open your eyes. Fourth, my father and I have concessions, including my Mum too. 70c+70c+50c = $1.90. I know the saving of 60c is retarded but I didn't know the booking fee was $3.50. If you say again that my dad is a cabby and he should know, refer to point 1. Fifth, my Dad was drunk, but please la, drunk =/= drunk like how they act it on TV. Drunk must surely be vomit and annoying and all? @Mercabs, bus drivers do not drive like crazy people at night. You still in the 90's? You guys are saying that I'm saying ALL BLUES are like that, while your dear friend here stereotypes bus drivers? lol</p></div>
