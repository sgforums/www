              <p>If don't talk about route, judging by how foolish wrote, it's an honest mistake. So his issue is more of honest mistake but accused of being a crook, followed by insults and threats. Mistake everyone make la. I ever missed steven road but head to newton circus to bkt timah. I did ask for prefered route but ANG mo pax said whatever.</p>
              <p>So when she made noise about me turning from newton, I replied, saying "whatever" voids you the right to biitch about the extra 10M long route. It's not like it's even going to reflect on the fare. And the speed I drive normally PAX comment my fare cheaper one. I told her she can pay the fare and get off now or I continue with the journey, if there's a specific route she like to take inform me and i will take. I did raise my voice at her, but I did recieve a tip from her, so I think my response wasn't too unreasonable.</p>

              <p>sometimes it's not the physical abuse , but also verbal abuse and threats of reporting u to ur company !</p>
              <p>nowadays it's so easy to call the number to complain as everybody has a hand phone!and they start taking photos of ur license plate , car number and ur face and ask to get down anywhere they like without paying !</p>
              <p>just like last night , i pick up 2 local women passengers fr Lucky plaza , say going 2 places Marine parade and Bedok , thought was an easy journey and quickly punch in CBD charge and go !</p>
              <p>they didn't mention anything of how to go ! just say Marine parade first ,so i song song go by <strong>Clemencea ave </strong>, half way suddenly passenger ask,hei uncle where r u going ? she say "i ask u go cte and exit ecp! "</p>
              <p>then ask me to stop after passing thro ERP gantry at start of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Havelock road</span></strong> and started taking photos of my taxi license displayed ! i say u didn't mention ur destination and furthermore the label display at side window also stated , pasengers should say their prefered destination , she say cannot see cos block by a sunshade !</p>
              <p>they got down without paying and threaten to report to company ! they didn't pay a cent and my IU got deducted $2 fr ERP  charge! see , <strong>we can't do a thing</strong> . these r the threats that most often happen to us ! we can't complain whereas they always threaten us to report to company even for the slightest mistakes or assumed routes taken wrong or long !</p>
