              <p>haha. aunties? dun say cab driver, I also cannot tahan them. u met them in the street, in mrt, in buses. either walk slow and block your way, or anyhow walk. rush to get into mrt before people can get out and rushing and shoving for seats in mrt when they see one. what to do. I have decided when I met or see an auntie outside, just move away from them and dun talk to them. its useless talking or reasoning with them, cos in the end, you will end up getting pissed, so why worth your effort getting yourself angry?</p>

              <p>I wonder if brothers here ever met those aunties that got family
                  problem, especially from unfaithful husband, I kenna thrice, most
                  of them got some psychotic problem, they will board and start with
                  a friendly chat, then the whole journey keep talking and asking
                  this and that about man, about those evil foreigner's girls or PRC
                  girls who took away their husband blah blah all the way.</p>
              <p>The lastest one was last week afternoon, one aunty with an
                  umbrella board my cab at CCK, designation CPF building,  my
                  feeling was, not bad, knn afternoon still got some durian drop,
                  once boarded with all the initial greeting, she start to talk about
                  her family problem, nag here and there, about her husband affair
                  with foreign girls, and her teenager son not supporting her, she
                  felt so lonely, so angry, and some more can said why her husband go
                  for a black thai girl, this and that..asked me what good in foreign
                  girls that sg men go for them and so on.</p>
              <p>Wha lau, I was thinking, bo ho tan trip, nag all the way,
                  reached CPF building Taxi stand still talking, then i told her
                  reach already, she like, oh! reach already, where, get down and
                  walk into robinson, so sian yet so pitiful for her. But really
                  cannot stand the nagging, this one won me over, lucky got a
                  connection to Meyer road, from there go into ECP sleep for a
                  while</p>
