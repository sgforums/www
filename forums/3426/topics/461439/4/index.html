              <p>by saying $2 taxi , will caused a massive demand , lacking of supplies to match that demand , then all call centre will page jobs like mad dogs . That was what happened at 2005-2006 season .That time flag down were $2.60 .</p>

              but again driver must also understand, nothing is bein free in this world
              
              if you are given a higher starting meter, commuter in return would expect better service in return
              
              Service -  what is service?  can we define service for our trade(taxi)? 
              
              what set of service are we tds providing?  base on who standard? LTA? taxi coy? or individual standard.  
              
              e.g - service is also equal to have the knowledge of going from point A to B, by which route, using GPS? street directory? pax advice? or driver discreption?

              should all driver go thru a service class or course before being on the road? 
              
              should taxi coy be responsible for this service education? currently all taxi coy just need
              
              you sign on the hirer agreement letter, pass you the key and the rest is on your own.
              
              so current with so may complain was it driver fault or taxi coy fault? resulting driver being 
              
              terminated with complain from pax. 
              
              why only terminate driver but not taxi coy licence ( current only dine system by lta)
              
              So we must also look into this so call suka suka termination action by taxi coy.
              
              like for new driver, they should be given a probation period, 3-6 month to learn on the road and on the job to get familar with the job, just like other trade, that is given the probation period, any complain  taxi must consel the driver but not terminate. 
              
              For this can NTA do something or the LTA or MOM, cos is like giving a driver a better job security

              currently most tds inculde myself don't like the term self-employed call by one party and 
              
              being our drivers by another party.

              it true,  but here we are just trying, giving a try as well as having some hope for a better future
              
              some war will take years to win
              
              we have all kind of different standard MP
              
              I also know voucher which are donate by NTUC ( who always announce they giving out so much so much) . this voucher are kept so hard and these voucher are like given out like transport voucher.  not that there is no more, it is kept hard inside their drawer, not so easy to take out one,  for this group of people, sorry i can't do much they must think of a way

              <p>i believe setting the current starting meter at $5 (normal
              taxi)with other charges remain would not be have too big a impact
              to commuter. $3.20 is very dirt cheap base on the past year
              inflation here in singapore, now $3.20 may not even buy yo a bowl
