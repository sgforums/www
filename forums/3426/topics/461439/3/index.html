              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>All along , i have been wondering why we as TDs are not allowed
              to own our own cabs and have to be at the mercy of the taxi cos.
              One lame reason they give for taking back the yellow top licenses
              was that a larger fleet will have economies of scale and that cabs
              will be better maintained.</p>
              <p>This is really utter BS , look at the SMART crowns , the TC
              crowns , the beat up silver magentis , do they look even
              presentable even in exterior? Some of the yellow tops still otr can
              beat them hands down.</p>
              <p>Look at Prime , primarily a leasing and a PI, basically what
              they do is to turn their unsold parallel imported cars into taxis.
              They take  5,000 as deposit for them to roll out their fleet ,
              that is using TD's $ to chut chia . whats the difference if we TDs
              were to come out that $5,000 to come out own cab?</p>
              <p>We , TDs can do a better job than them and with our own cab , we
              will definitely take pride and ownership in what we do.</p>
              <p>Now our mindset is taxi co squeeze us , we squeeze commuters ,
              we go where the carrots are , not much compassion in what we
              do.</p>
              <p>Maybe that might change when we are allowed at least a basic
              right to own our cab.</p>
              <p>As for surcharges , lets put it that way , there really needs to
              be a boundary drawn. Otherwise there will be no end to it.</p>
              <p>Implement CBD surcharge at scotts road , balestier and novena
              pax will cry for cabs.</p>
              <p>CBD in sentosa , alexandra , bt merah all die</p>
              <p>Where does it all end?</p>
              <p>Take away surcharges? u all prepared for tat? i think most TDs
              will cry with nothing extra below the meter.</p>

              <p>Actually I started this thread in response to Poolman's answer in another thread where he said he knew of ways to improve the existing taxi industry (or crunch).</p>
              <p>He believed his ideas would be a win-win for both taxi drivers and commuters. Therefore my intention or understanding of it was - here is someone who knows or has some ideas that could resolve some the issues surrounding taxis, but because of the way things are done in Singapore, these ideas would never come to light because taxi driver's opinions are rarely if at all taken into consideration when changes are made by the relevant authorities, be it the PTC or LTA.</p>
              <p>Furthermore Minister Lui has also come out to say he was seeking a way to resolve transport woes for commuters, and part of this included  the taxi industry.</p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>As such, I thought that perhaps the best way for this ideas to raised or presented is by me writing to the Minister, and informing him of this - that's to say, here we have an experienced driver who has some suggestions which he feels can go a long way to resolving some of these issues.</p>
              <p>But I didn't realise until reading some replies, that Poolman has never been keen to be interviewed on his opinion, which of course he's entitled to.</p>
              <p>So it looks that this idea of writing to the Minister, might not be possible since Poolman is unwilling. Similarly, it would not be possible for me to write and offer suggestions because I have not dwelt deeper into this issue since I only drive 5-7 hours on weekdays, therefore I am not unduly concerned by this issue.</p>
              <p>Or if I were to write in and offer Poolman's ideas on his behalf? The problem with this, is that it will become second hand information, I will be offering the ideas and suggestions, but since they didn't come from me to begin with, my understanding of it would not be complete. Any explanation or interview, if the matter is taken up, will become problematic because I would have to keep checking back and forth with Poolman for what the ideas, suggestions and intentions are.</p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Finally there is another suggestion, that we compile a list of suggestions and then submit it in writing.</p>
              <p>That's possible of course, but would be quite tedious, because I would have to compile them, use my own words and present them in an email.</p>
              <p>And since we are writing to a Minister no less, such emails must have substance and offer clear and concise plans, with a proper justification for them. But most importantly in writing any letter or going up to offer ideas to resolve whatever issue, the main criteria as far the Ministry would be concerned has to be the interests of the commuters - ie; the public first and foremost.</p>
              <p>We cannot offer suggestions to improve our welfare, our takings, making life easier for us or whatever, and then as after thought think of the commuters. That would never cut any ice. For sure any improvements has to have some consideration for taxi drivers, but the commuters has to be the primary benefactory of them.</p>
              <p>Currently the system is made to look after the commuters, followed by the companies and then taxid rivers at the bottom. But in reality, it's the companies that seem to enjoy the primary benefits (profits year after year) despite rising costs etc.</p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>So if forum members feel that sending a list of suggestions is the best or only way, since no one is prepared to step up and offer suggestions (with the reasons behind them), or that such a plan would be pointless given how things are done in Singapore, then perhaps I'll consider that.</p>
              <p>I wouldn't mind putting my name behind it as the sender, but as I said, we must firstly draw up a proper list, compile it, back it up with some justification (or show the possible beneficial result), but at the same time ensure it's the commuters who benefit first and foremost.</p>
              <p>And then of course, it will take some time for me to think of the wording of this letter (or email). At the moment such a letter would not be priority for me, as I have to write another letter for a friend on a different issue and then witht he year end, I would be more interested in celebrating Christmas than writing a letter. I foresee only late Jan or Feb, where I would have the time to expend on this.</p>
              <p>Of course if Poolman had agreed as I originally had thought that would be much easier for me, write a letter to the Minister (in my name) suggesting that the views of a certain driver with considerable experience, who has given this issue much thought, be allowed to be presented for consideration, and to offer his explanations why such ideas should be considered. And if such ideas appear feasible, be further allowed to assist in the drawing up new rules.</p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Lastly, even if Poolman had agreed, this would involve some or considerable amount of his time, something which we can only speculate.</p>
              <p>Perhaps he doesn't have the time for this, or doesn't want to get so far involved, other than discuss it here in a forum. That's perfectly understandable and acceptable.</p>
              <p>There's no right or wrong here. After all our primary duty is to go and earn money for our family and ourselves. We achieve that by working with or through the rules, each doing his own thing and own style in reaching that target.</p>
              <p>And it takes some effort (some say courage even) in offering one's ideas which will subject to scrutiny, and may be shot down. Not everyone wants to be the limelight, or be the mouthpiece, especially in a trade that's considered to be of no great importance. I mean who really has cared about taxi drivers? Yeah there's some, but it's always at or near the bottom. LTA, the companies etc, don't really make rules or offer carrots for our benefit. They do it for themselves, the commuters and maybe if there's some thing left over, we can enjoy it.</p>
              <p>So if someone doesn't want to take the step up, I can fully understand that. Myself, I have a friend who's a reporter, he's always asking me whether I want to be interviwed (by his colleagues) to offer an opinion of other like when they had this new fare hike late last year and about some things this year, but I forget what.</p>
              <p>I don't want and don't really care to be interviewed, although I did do an interview on a totally different matter this year and there was an article about me in the ST in March this year.</p>

              <p>So here we have issues like ERP cost at 6.30pm as one example ....</p>
              <p>Another was the Yellow Top Taxis privately owned , which if that goes thru , do i make Singapore taxi drivers happy ? I swear many will be very happy , maybe JDIL might convert his Van into a MPV taxi ?</p>
              <p>And some issue like Location Surcharge to be impose to curb those complaints ..... Garden by the bay , outside of CBD , Bird Park , Zoo , Night Safari , Checkpoint , Tenah Merah Ferry Terminal etc ....</p>
              <p>And question of surcharge should be taken out altogether ?</p>
              <p>And up those taxi flag down to a more reasonable rate like $5 for normal cabs , and $8 for Limousine ? Discard all surcharge away , except AP .</p>
              <p>And should there be a standard ERP charge for taxi ?</p>

              <p>During 2011 , mid June .... we had people hearsay taxi price going up soon .....</p>
              <p>After many discussions , we had mention peak hour surcharge should be extended .</p>
              <p>Instead of 5-8pm , extend til 12mn .... with a lower surcharge .</p>
              <p>They actually adopt similiar price structures .</p>
              <p>But instead of 5pm to 12mn i mentions , they delay til 6pm to 12mn .</p>
              <p>And instead of the 30% i suggested , they do it for just 25% .</p>
              <p>And we did not say $0.22 , we said remain that way .</p>
              <p>But they did it at 400m @ $0.22 , which lead to all $0.01 confusions .</p>
