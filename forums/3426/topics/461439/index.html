              <p>I read your response in the thread about the taxi crunch:</p>
              <p>http://sgforums.com/forums/3426/topics/461323</p>
              <p>In it you said:</p>
              <p>You
                       can fix the taxi problems and make cabbies and commuters both happy, if
                       of course you were in a position of authority to do so.</p>
              <p>Personally
                       I feel that you should have some really good ideas, hopefully some 
                      workable ones that can improve tings in general and maybe even 
                      specifically.</p>
              <p>I do of course realise, that some of your ideas are 
                      bound to be disagreeable to LTA and to CDG - the biggest operator, which
                       incidentally is owned directly or indirectly by the Govt, and as such 
                      by ourselves the taxpayers.</p>
              <p>But before we accuse both the Govt and
                       LTA, maybe even CDG of being the main obstacle to the solution, we must
                       at least, make that case to them and see what their response is.</p>
              <p>What
                       I am saying, with your permission or agreement, is that I will write a 
                      letter to Lee Tuck Yew - the Minister responsible and offer your 
                      services (or ideas).</p>
              <p>LTY has said that he wants to find ways to resolve the taxi issues in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Going
                       by past methods, that would result in LTA drawing their own report and 
                      suggestions, followed by some by the taxi operators (with CDG having the
                       most influential say) and lastly by a few members of the various taxi 
                      associations, some of whom may or may not be tds. And of course 
                      sometimes, the Govt invites and considers feedback from the public.</p>
              <p>In
                       short, what we normally will get is the same old thing with a few 'new 
                      tweaks or ideas' on improvement. This will go on for a few more years 
                      before the same problems crop up and another review is done.</p>
              <p>Now 
                      you, for better or worse, have come out boldly to suggest that you know 
                      how to resolve these issues. Whether it's workable or will meet approval
                       is another thing altogether. But before we jump the gun and say, no way
                       the Govt will agree or perhaps we ourselves might disagree to your 
                      ideas, we must at least allow you to put your case and try to offer it 
                      to the authorities.</p>
              <p>If they say no or whatever, then that's 
                      another issue, but first we must try, we shouldn't just dismmiss or 
                      expect a negative response from them.</p>
              <p>I have actually written to 
                      Ministers and some influential people in Govt in order to seek 
                      assistance on certain matters for my friends and family. While not all 
                      would get the result I wanted, I can safely say that some have resulted 
                      in that assistance. At the very least, there is a reply to my 
                      correspondence.</p>
              <p>Since we rarely or hardly see a taxi driver (s) 
                      involved in the decision making, perhaps it's high time, we allow 
                      someone (like you) to be part of that process or at the very least, 
                      offer your input to the problems and solutions.</p>
              <p>I am prepared to 
                      draft (eventually write) a letter to LTY in my own name, offering or 
                      informing him of your existence, experience and views on this matter. 
                      Since you have come out to say you know the ways to fix these problems, 
                      then I feel that at least these should be considered fully or offered 
                      for consideration, before they are implemented or rejected as the case 
                      may be.</p>
              <p>Obviously I am aware and I am sure you as well, that 
                      there's a high chance it might not even be considered and rejected 
                      outright, but we won't know the answer unless we try.</p>
              <p>So this 
                      question now lies with you, are you prepared to come out in the open (to
                       be named in a letter to the Minister) and offer your views (meet 
                      whoever or which ever officer or dept (likely LTA) in person, or in 
                      writing (if they want to go that route).</p>
              <p>Before sending this letter, I will of course send you a draft for your approval.</p>
              <p>What would be your views then to this idea?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Now before we even consider this, let me put your mind at ease at some issues or maybe perhaps, ponder about some of the possible negative outcomes to this idea.</p>
              <p>a) This has nothing to do with being pro or anti PAP. This is a legitimate issue and wouldn't make any difference whether or not the PAP or another party is in power. The problem exists and needs to be looked at.</p>
              <p>b) How you voted is also not an issue. Whether you like or dislike them is also of no concern. The fact remains they are the ones in authority and as such it's a decision only they can make. To clear you mind, I can guarantee you with 100% certainty that your voting record will never be scrutinised when you send a letter to the Govt and it's Ministers. You vote is secret and can only be retrieved by an order of the High Court in a special case brought by you. The opening and checking of the seals, is always done in open and all parties involved in that election will be invited to be present. You can check with any opposition MP or meber to confirm this.</p>
              <p>Anyway your votes has already been burnt (6 months after the polls unless there was a challenger). There has never been any challenge in our history. Don't listen to rumours or conspiracy theories about vote monitoring.</p>
              <p>c) Nothing will come out this to make you marked man. No ISD or police officer will start monitoring you or you activities. You won't penalised for writing or coming out.</p>
              <p> If you start admitting that you 'interview pax, reject certain locations', then maybe LTA will not take kindly to these infringements and then only may you become a subject of interest.</p>
              <p>But if you stick to the facts and explain the problems with the rules and offer suggestions, even those critical of LTA or CDG, then you should have no worries.</p>
              <p>d) This is not a challenge by me for you. To make you 'put up or shut up'. It's a genuine belief that if you have solutions or ideas, they should at least receive some attention.</p>
              <p>This is also not challenge for you to get back or to prove that you 'know everything'. This is an exercise to offer meaningful ideas, if any.</p>
              <p>e) Finally, if indeed you are called upon to give your views, you must be prepared to accept that it might not be feasible or practical for the authorities to follow or implement, no matter how legitimate or right it is to you. You may be questioned as to your ideas and receive negative responses in that interview. Some might disagree with it. This is something you gotta face.</p>
              <p>I have made this an open topic not a PM, because I would like to see how others think of this suggestion, people like komade, bowah etc who also have some experience and ideas, not just about taxis but other things as well. Their experience is across a number of fields and it might be good to hear their responses.</p>
              <p>Of course, it's your decsion in the end, and it has to respected. As I said this is not a challenge, it's a suggestion for want of a better word.</p>
              <p>But feel free to ask anything of me, in regards to this idea and I'll try to answer as best I can.</p>

              <p>For moderator - I think not. I am not very frequent, sometimes you me post for several days, then sometimes I disappear for weeks.</p>
              <p>I got a lot of things on my plate. Heck even Deepavalli I never go my friends' houses - got good makan also never go. I got a lot of invites for other stuff, that too I do not go.</p>
              <p>Yes I log on the net every night, but got go many sites for many things, so promising to be on 1 site daily is something not possible.</p>
              <p>If this was a football forum, then for certain I can confirm, that's my favourite hobby. And I got lots of knowledge as, I could recall off hand all the League Champions, CL Winners and FA Cup Winners at 1 time. Now may be I forget a few but the Euro/CL no problem back to first in 1956.</p>
              <p>But I'm happy to assist from time to time. Also I think this forum needs very little moderating or supervising. Let anyone talk anything, quarrel also doesn't affect me much.</p>
              <p>I mean we shouldn't let things said or posted in the net get us worked up. Yes commenting or criticising also, just say my piece and don't really bother whether it's agreed or disagreed.</p>

              <p>Firstly , u want to ask me how to make drivers happy ?</p>
              <p>Lower down the rental will never made them happy , neither going up .</p>
              <p>But by imposing more perks during demanding areas , certainly would make them hunger for the perks .</p>

              <p>LIke Sentosa island ..... very demanding during sometimes of the year , sometimes of the month due to events going on inside , like Barclay Golf last week ?</p>
              <p>But who the fuck wanna go inside for $0 ? Where i can Q and get a $3 at RWS 24 hours ?</p>
              <p>For some , like me , i would empty into CBD .... for the $3 .</p>
              <p>However they can flag me , block my way , pay me 50 points , i also bo chap one .</p>
              <p>Now , Beach Station has got private bus operating illegal pick ups , why ?</p>
              <p>Cos no taxis wanna go inside ? Go inside for fuck ?</p>
              <p>If i were the Chief , i would impose $2 location pick at all taxi stand inside Sentosa ! </p>
              <p>Beach Station , all hotel and resort lobbies , Siloso Beach , Palawan Beach and Dolphin Lagoon etc etc tourist area .</p>
              <p>If there is nothing for us ?</p>
              <p>I swear to Singapore and Toursim Board of Singapore , i will let them rot , good enough to give Singapore a bad name ....... mind you , they can enjoy for 3 days in Singapore , by 1 hour of waiting for a cab , good enough to tarnish the image of Singapore .</p>
              <p>Sentosa is one place , cannot afford to have bad reputation .</p>
              <p>Where tourist going back to their country , and write on the facebook : " Singapore everything was nice , but i have to wait 1.5 hours for a cab to Bay Hotel , just outside of Sentosa , that's how bad there in Singapore ." </p>
              <p>" I dunno why ? The taxi drivers just drove out without any passengers , doe no reason ."</p>

              <p>Taxi companies should impose them to rewards their drivers without the intervention of PTC and LTA .</p>
              <p>eg TransCab , SMRT , Silver and Prime to impose $3 at Zoo , if Comfort want to follow , they may follow .</p>
              <p>Zoo and Checkpoint and Turf clubs are some places .... where there should be rewards . </p>
              <p>or i just make sure when time to come ..... if given a chance , i let them rot .</p>
              <p>When there is a perk , like AP , i really lan lan , just cannot dun pick .</p>

              <p>Again , places like AP area .... all taxi stands must be in line with AP surcharges ....</p>
              <p>CBP , Singapore Expo , T Merah Ferry ........ </p>
              <p>Must be fair .</p>
              <p>This round , must be fair to commuters inside T Merah Ferry .</p>
              <p>Without surcharge , prepare to be rot .</p>
              <p>Now my strategies .....</p>
              <p>If Airport cannot make it , Plan B , straight away "find" paxes , they will have to go to where i wanna go , not where they want to go .</p>
              <p>If they want save $3.30 , have to follow my way .</p>
              <p>If wanna to follow their way , spent $3.30 can call 65521111 .</p>
              <p>In fact , all my Silver counterpart , after pumping at Changi South , we have ways to get our ideal pax . </p>
              <p>Left those to others .... we are out of Changi .</p>
              <p>It's that what they wanted ?</p>
              <p>Then come out with something to solve those issues .</p>
              <p>What more than to impose a surcharge .</p>
              <p>The best , create a Central Changi Bus Park Taxi Stand , those pick and go at taxi stand , $2 extra surcharge , in line with Expo .</p>
