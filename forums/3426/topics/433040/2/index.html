              Fly Budget Tiger or Jetstar to Macau. Cross to to Zhuhai then take a 90 mis bus ride there.
              Return airfare about $250. Bus one way to Dong Guang or surrounding areas less than S$20.
              Average single room hotel S$30 a night.
              Another option is fly Tiger Airway to Shenzhen and then take a cab or bus there.
              
              Try go there first alone or with your male friends.....You will forget about her after the 2nd day.

              <p>I believe singapore ladies are also good, after all, some of us here are father of singapore girls. Some are materialistic and proud, these are all due to an afluent society created here, cannot really blame them. Govt educated our ladies to be career women and not career wife. But again, not all are money minded.</p>
              <p>One good thing about singapore women is that they help us financially, they are very independent, educated and able to settle thing or problem systematically, good for kids with their advices and tutoring, however, for men, you have to reduce abit of your ego and pride with singapore girl, because they can be very commanding. As for foreign gals, easier to tackle, although more caring in a motherly way, you need to support them financially ending up with one earn, 3 or 4 mouth to feed.</p>
              <p>Certainly, for TD with a working wife, you will be more relax in term of $$, and also, your future can be more acertain.</p>
