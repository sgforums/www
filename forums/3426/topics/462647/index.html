              <p>I think most TD will not take...  No price were agreed and how i going to charge him.  I actually regretted.</p>
              <p>At 6.16pm, i was at Kallang. I sms him, "U confirm need my service ?"  he said Yes. Go down pick him, press meter (with peak hr) + $6.50 (advance bk) + $3 (City). He never ask me what is all that.  Reach CPF building, knn...only $20.40 (Thinking really not worth).  He look at meter and pay me $40.  Think think...ok lah for a 40 min job from 6.16pm and ends in CBD and i can collect CBD charge again.</p>
              <p>Some will say not worth to take the risk. But i think differently.  If he not steady...the most i m "stupid" for one time.  BUT If he is really really steady... I would have secure a "A Grade" pax. </p>
              <p>He told me he needs to do this on every Friday........ I say Ok lor.</p>

              <p>Thanks for all the pointers.  I also think 40 pts is the min rate to accept such job. But what i like about this pax is ---- He give me a window of about 20 min from the stated time and just call him when i reach.</p>
              <p>I'm also a road sweeper and will only take "Good" advance job either with good pts or the time slot is my liking. However, "Good" job will never come to u freely, you got to try out and test water yrself.</p>
              <p>Chief's point is valid, u need a network to work well. I do have pax that is willing to pay a bit more during peak hr and sometime they sms me n try their luck. I will pass them LakeView number.  If possible, i can get some LV name card during next gathering will be better.  </p>
              <p>Ct2220, if you send pax to Geylang..... u eat frog leg or ????</p>

              <p>In TD, you see many thngs, as a seaman, I have seen most of the ports in the world, most around the sea, not the inner land. But domestically, as TD, you see how Singapore culture, tourist, visitors and local lifestyle evolve and interlink itself.</p>
              <p>Many TDs have many tales to tell, some talk non stop, some just be simple and life goes on. I even have a hotel free buffet lunch with businessman while waiting for him to complete a short lunch meeting. Send a aussie lady to eat chicken rice and end up have to eat with her as she insisted. So, it all voice down to individual, if you think the amount is right, the atmosphere is good, why not.</p>

              <p>Thanks for all the pointers.  I also think 40 pts is the
              min rate to accept such job. But what i like about this pax is ----
              He give me a window of about 20 min from the stated time and just
              call him when i reach.</p>
              <p>I'm also a road sweeper and will only take "Good" advance job
              either with good pts or the time slot is my liking. However, "Good"
              job will never come to u freely, you got to try out and test water
              yrself.</p>
              <p>Chief's point is valid, u need a network to work well. I do have
              pax that is willing to pay a bit more during peak hr and sometime
              they sms me n try their luck. I will pass them LakeView number.
               If possible, i can get some LV name card during next
              gathering will be better.  </p>
              <p>Ct2220, if you send pax to Geylang..... u eat frog leg or
              ????</p>

              <p>Sometimes it's not so much the money thing, but a good pax. Sometimes we meet pax who can gum with us, or appreciate us.</p>
              <p>So just a little extra effort for them is no problem.</p>
              <p>But I rarely do this, because my timing like Ct2220, I got many things to do, plus I restrict my driving to the minimum, so I will always tell pax, i'd like to but I doubt I will be drivinga t that time.</p>
              <p>The last time I did something like this was the presidential elections. Picked up 1 angmoh from Padang to his house near 6th Ave. He asked whether could fetch him to airport at around 3.30 am, gave his card and said just sms if you cant make it.</p>
              <p>Any way i went and sms, he came down within 5 mins. I didn't even tell him about the advance booking, just on meter, we were talking all the way about sports, he's a rugby player.</p>
              <p>Anyway reached airport he gave 50pts, more than the booking cost if included.</p>
              <p>So yeah, if you like a pax, whom you know is not out to calculate and try to get a discount off you but because appreciates you, then why not?</p>
