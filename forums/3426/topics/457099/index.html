              <p><strong>Taxi companies will nevertheless be encouraged to consider optional safety features in new cabs: Minister</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE - Taxi companies will be encouraged to consider vehicle models with optional safety features such as air bags when they register new taxis.</p>
              <p>Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said this in a written reply on Monday to a question by Ang Mo Kio GRC Member of Parliament Ang Hin Kee.</p>
              <p>For the time being, however, air bags will not be a mandatory safety feature for new taxis, as Mr Lui noted the "significant technical and cost hurdles" in retrofitting taxis with air bags.</p>
              <p>Mr Ang had tabled a parliamentary question on whether the Land Transport Authority (LTA) would consider making it mandatory for all taxi operators to equip their new taxis with air bags.</p>
              <p>Mr Ang also asked if the authority is "assessing whether similar additions can be made for existing fleets".</p>
              <p>In his response, Mr Lui reiterated that, while seat belts are mandatory for all motor vehicles - including taxis - that are registered for use here, air bags are not, because they "serve only to supplement seat belts in enhancing the safety of vehicle occupants in the event of a collision".</p>
              <p>He added: "If seat belts are used properly, the injury risks would have already been greatly reduced. There are also significant technical and cost hurdles in retrofitting existing vehicles, including taxis, with air bags."</p>
              <p>The issue of airbags in taxis surfaced in May after a high-profile accident on Rochor Road involving a Ferrari and a taxi.</p>
              <p>Following a report by TODAY about how many taxis here are not equipped with air bags - despite the fact that taxi drivers spend most part of a day in their vehicles - several parties, including the Automobile Association of Singapore, called for the authorities to do more by possibly mandating seat belts and air bags as standard requirements in all vehicles.</p>
              <p>When contacted, Mr Ang, who is also an adviser for the National Taxi Association (NTA), said that the LTA has given him the reassurance that "seat belts are more critical".</p>
              <p>The authority also told him that studies have shown that seat belts are an adequate safety measure.</p>
              <p>"The NTA feels that, since we have been given this reassurance, we will not be pursuing the matter further," said Mr Ang.</p>
              <p>Expressing his personal view, Public Transport Council Chairman Gerard Ee told TODAY: "They have a point that seat belts are adequate protection but I would like to see air bags for the drivers ... as they spend so much time in their vehicles", while "passengers are there only for short distances and seat belts should be adequate"</p>

              <p>If you find that it is tedious and costly to install on existing fleets of taxis, then you should fit in on new cabs and as time goes by, slowly all cabs in near future would had airbags. It is not a matter of mandatory or not mandatory, it is a matter of cultivating a safety society base on justic and equality?</p>
