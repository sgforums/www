              <p><br>Answer is no. As long as it is not the cab you call and another cab pick you up u dun have to pay.</p>
              <p>Even if another on call cab come and his customer happen to go same place as you and his customer failed to turn up, he cannot charge you booking.</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Seriously, the problem we have today is 2 ways. First we have idiots who did not bother to wait for the cab which they book. 2ndly, there are cab driver who bid for the wrong job, for eg after bidding then they realise it is not the place they want. Instead of calling call center to cancel or honor them even when call center is busy, they simply press the meter to remove On Call and pay the levy imposed by taxi company and don't bother to turn up.</p>
              <p>Come on, you want to complain you need to be fair. Some of us here are not unguilty of such things. Sometime, we have good trip sometime we have bad. Dun expect good things to happen all the time. If not we would be CEO and our ^%^&amp;% ex-bosses should be driving taxi.</p>

              <p>Sometime it is not cut Q, i understand TD bros feeling, there are some road and places that are designed in a funny way, I was in Meritus Mandarin dropping off people, those Q up sonatas TD are Quening up at Orchard link unless the doormen ask them to come in, cos the place was very jammed up. As I dropped my pax off, the dooman signal for me to get into the pick up lane, lowering down my window, I told him to get the next taxi in Q, he shouted " Our house guest cannot wait for them to come in, you come now!!" so I moved in and took some ang mo gals. As I drove out, i feel quite remorseful, those Q up at Orchard link will loose out to this sending paxs in..</p>
              <p>Same goes to ICA, the taxi stand is at the end of kallang road, goodness, there are lots of paxs just waving outside the ICA building without going into the taxi stands, most dun even bother about the taxi stands or know where the hell it is..so beside those yao gui who cut Q, and paxs who just wave down a cab before a taxi stand, the design of the drop off, pick up and stands is also an issue.</p>
