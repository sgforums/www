              <p>STOMPer <strong>Marj</strong>'s phone was returned to her within less than two hours of leaving it behind in a cab, thanks to its honest driver and Comfort's prompt service on their hotline.<br><br>She says that this is an experience that she will always fondly remember.<br><br>Said the STOMPer:<br><br>"On the morning of Apr 9, I took a cab and left my phone with my loaded passion/ez-link card in the backseat of the car.<br><br>"Unfortunately I couldn't remember what was the cab company I took and I didn't even get a receipt as I was rushing for my appointment. My phone was also on silent mode.<br><br>"I was hopeless, so I went immediately to Singtel Comcentre to deactivate my SIM card.<br><br>"While I was waiting, I used their landline to call the cab companies to report my lost phone.<br><br>"First, I dialled Comfort's lost and found hotline. I waited patiently as the call volume was high.<br><br>"After awhile, a customer service agent picked up my call and asked me a few questions to help me find my phone. He asked me: 1) What was the item lost; 2) What was the model of the phone, its color and other details; 3) What was the time of journey; and 4) Where is the pick up &amp; drop off point?<br><br>"After I gave the details I have got, he put me on hold. Then he came back to me and said, "Good news, the cab driver has your phone."<br><br>"He gave me the uncle's phone number and I immediately called him after the agent told me the good news.<br><br>"The uncle picked up my call immediately and asked me for a convenient place for me to pick up my lost phone.<br><br>"I'm so happy and thankful. I appreciate the office staff who were very prompt, professional and friendly. The claim was fast and hassle-free.<br><br>"I'm also grateful to the driver (SH 8451 L) for taking the effort to drive back from Changi Airport to Singtel Comcentre at Somerset.<br><br>"He could've easily said he did not see my phone and another passenger might have taken it away. He deserves to be rewarded. <br><br>"I lost my phone between 10:30am to 11:00 am and I got it back exactly at 12:30pm.<br><br>"Wow!!! Kudos Comfort Cab and Cabbie Uncle Ng!!!"<br><br>"As a foreigner here in Singapore, I will forever remember this in my life and spread this great experience whenever and wherever I am."</p>

              <p><br>Take mean take lah, what feeling this and that, alamak. Money, if it is yours, just take, you deserve it, not that you point a knife or gun at someone and demand for it, you did a good job, that is the reward, you dun take, pax might just use it to call a bak bak one.</p>
              <p>Anyway, to most paxs including all of us, losing a hp is not very much the matter of the cost of the phone, I mean it is still a cost, but the long list of friends, relatives, and other phone nos might be lost, and with smartphone, all msgs, smses, and many more information will be lost, and these can be quite frustrating.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Wow..so fortunate for the cabby who returned the phone. I returned one iphone on on of the Sat late afternoon. Unfortunately there isnt't any passanger going towards Woodlands so 2 hours before I changed shift, travelled from Whampoa to Woodlands to return the phone. Just a small thank you from the owner with a cheeky grin and smile. Fortunately beside him there were 3 passangers waiting for cab (Woodlands to Queenway Shopping Centre). This is my first lost and found and I wanna make sure it will be my last. I always ask pax to check all belongings before disembarking my cab. Next time lost and found again, I will sent it all to nearest Police post.</p></div>
