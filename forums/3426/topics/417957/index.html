              <p>STOMPer <strong>Melissa</strong> is outraged by the behaviour of local cab drivers these days. She
              claims that they are becoming increasingly rude and choosy: preferring
              to pick up passengers only at certain locations and time. This is based
              on two separate incidents that she faced recently.<br><br>She writes to us:<br><br>"Not
              too long ago, cab drivers made their views known that they were afraid
              of their rice bowls being affected with increasing fares.
              Unfortunately, it seems to me that whilst our economy is doing well,
              cab drivers are getting cocky. I'm writing as feedback towards my
              unpleasant experiences on Sunday (Dec 5) and Saturday (December 11) at
              Marina Barrage and Jalan Sultan area respectively.<br><br>"On 5 Dec, I
              was at the Marina Barrrage for an event. When my friends and I were
              leaving the area at around 6pm, we noticed that the cabs dropping
              passengers off, did not pick up any new ones. We decided to walk out
              and flag for one along the way. Strangely, many cabs, without
              passengers, drove past us with the green 'TAXI' sign brightly lit!
              There were some who saw us waving and accelerated away.I strongly feel
              that these cab drivers wanted to pick passengers from Marina Bay
              Sands,in order to charge the surcharge and maybe earn some tips from
              casino patrons.<br><br>"On 11 Dec, my family and I waited for an hour
              for a cab at night, walking from Ophir Road to Jalan Sultan. At least
              10 cabs drove past us, without any passengers inside. However, a cab
              driver driving a 'Comfort' cab along Victoria Road really takes the
              cake. At the traffic light junction, he had 'TAMPINES' flashed on his
              sign. We flagged the cab and asked him to bring us to Bedok Road. We
              even told him the shortcuts. Without muttering a word, he stepped on
              the accelerator and stopped 25m down the road to pick up two ladies.
              That was extremely rude of him. Of course, I need to add that the taxi
              hotlines are always busy! Are they under-staffed?<br><br>"When I
              grumbled to my friend about the local cab situation, he highlighted the
              exact same thing he experienced on the night of ZoukOut.<br><br>"Are
              cab drivers openly displaying their arrogance by choosing their
              passengers? How is it that rude cab drivers are allowed on our roads?
              Will I continuously be disadvantaged because I don't hail cabs in the
              city and don't have blonde hair?"<br><br>"I hope that Comfort cab will
              provide us with a satisfactory answer. I believe that I'm not the only
              frustrated passenger around."</p>

              <p>That's very subjective.I have come across both good and atrocious taxi-drivers .But I try to understand that they drive all the time on the road and it is inevitable that some may experience nasty customers or other drivers thus affecting their mood the whole day.</p>

              <p>I think because of the 2 IRs, the demand of taxi ridership had driven up and the supply is short just after the peak hours.</p>

              <p>I think because of the 2 IRs, the demand of taxi ridership had driven up and the supply is short just after the peak hours.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, taxi companies should think of scrapping the CDB charges and raise the flag down fare in order to prevent eneven distribution of cabs.</p>

              <p>This problem would never end, i guess.</p>
              <p>Better than LTA ask taxi companies to put more taxis on the road to meet demand right?</p>
