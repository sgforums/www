              <p>Even as the National Taxi Association (NTA) urged parties to sort 
              things out for the sake of consumers, the Association of Banks in 
              Singapore (ABS) has come out in support of Visa.</p>
              <p>Last month, payment company Visa told ComfortDelGro it would pull out
               unless the cab operator removed a 10 per cent surcharge for fares paid 
              with Visa cards.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>According to Visa, ComfortDelGro replied that its cabs will stop accepting the cards by early June.</strong></span></p>
              <p>NTA adviser Ang Hin Kee, who is an MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC, urged the 
              parties to find a solution. He told The Straits Times yesterday: "If a 
              commercial deal does not work for you, work out a cost structure that 
              does."</p>
              <p>As it stands, commuters and taxi drivers will get the short end of 
              the stick, he added. Consumers because they are worse off with one fewer
               payment mode, and taxi drivers because they will need to explain to 
              passengers why they no longer accept Visa.</p>
              <p>Other cab companies like Premier Taxi, TransCab and SMRT also levy a 
              10 per cent fee on card payments. Visa will be approaching other taxi 
              operators as well, and has formed a 20-man team to conduct spot checks.</p>
              <p>Other payment companies, including MasterCard Worldwide and American 
              Express, did not want to say if they would follow Visa's lead, but they 
              opposed imposition of surcharges by merchants.</p>
              <p>Banks, including DBS, Citibank and OCBC Bank, also shared the same view.</p>
              <p>"We understand and support Visa's decision to remove 
              acceptance from ComfortDelGro taxis," said ABS director Ong-Ang Ai Boon.
               "We do not encourage the practice of surcharging because it unfairly 
              passes the cost of acceptance onto the consumer."</p>
              <p>OCBC Bank said it sent a letter to merchants late last year to remind
               them not to surcharge. The bank also imposes a US$1,000 (S$1,250) fine 
              for a first violation, and up to US$25,000 subsequently. It declined to 
              say how many merchants have been fined so far.</p>
              <p>"The banks must be firm in penalising errant retailers. Some even 
              allow the bigger merchants to bend the rules," said Consumers 
              Association of Singapore executive director Seah Seng Choon.</p>
              <p>He pointed out that DBS Bank, through which ComfortDelGro receives Visa's services, had allowed surcharging to go on for years.</p>
              <p>Cabbies were worried that Visa's pullout may affect business.</p>
              <p>"If customers ask if we accept Visa, and we don't, they may choose 
              the cab behind us." said Mr Thomas Teo, 45, who has driven a 
              ComfortDelGro cab for 18 years. He added that 10 per cent of his 
              customers pay by Visa.</p>
              <p>Several consumers The Straits Times spoke to were worried about not 
              being able to use Visa cards in cabs, but some considered the bigger 
              picture.</p>
              <p>Real estate agent Cecilia Cai, 30, said: "I hope this will push shops
               to rethink surcharging. I don't think it's fair to us, especially when 
              they are not allowed to (surcharge)."</p>
              <p>ComfortDelGro did not respond to queries, but other merchants that imposed a surcharge on credit card transactions did.</p>
              <p>CTC Travel charges customers an extra 2 per cent to buy an air ticket
               by card - the same amount the company has to pay banks for the service.
               Said its spokesman Alicia Seah: "Should consumers wanting to use their 
              cards mean that merchants should be penalised for it?"</p>

              <p>To be fair, this is a commercial issue, what transpired here is each business entity wants a pie of the Visa transaction, Visa want a gain of it card popularity and usage, end of the day, the TD plying the road will face the music, so are the consumer.</p>
              <p>It is not that pax do not know the 10% surcharges required, as TD, when pax paid by visa, I will alway said, Sir, 10% surcharge apply. If silent or said it is ok, then swipe. So, I believe it is a mutual agreement that consumer are willing to pay that 10%, and TD, providing all the facilities, from GPS, to cashless equipment, to adminstration will certainly need revenue to operate and at the same time, to gain as a service provider.</p>
              <p>Therefore, I believe Visa is out of the equation between the service provider (TD and TC) and the consumer (pax). It is merely a mode of payment.</p>
              <p>TD are alway at the expense of commerical disagreement, any changes one way or the others will ultimately affect our livinghood, but then, who cares, any conflict of interests in business or social and economy politics will end up mostly TD losing out. SO if company is charging us 7% GST, can we charge our fare with 7%GST?</p>

              <p>I think so too, but maybe they might yaya a bit because of Mastercard. Most ppl who hv Visa hv Master as well.</p>
              <p>But if master issue same demand then CDG sure lan lan back down.</p>

              from the last 2years . I can see that the number of passenger using
              
              master card to pay for taxi fare has increase
              
              the other card which is American express Corp card also
              
              also can be seen in recent months
              
              Maybe visa feel the thread . that's why.
              
              just hope can standardise mode of payment for
              
              taxi, if not we see more passenger interview us
              
              whether we accept this or that card. than this scene will
              
              be mistakenly translated we taxi driver interview passenger

              <p>But most companies have millions of revenue turnover every years, so if you are driving for them, you are representing them in a way, and moreover, they are charging you GST for the rental, so how come you, (some wearing CDG shirt somemore) in the capacity of cdg, TC or any other companies cannot charge the pax to defray the GST?</p>
              <p>Hawker rent stall from town council, no GST leh, so they can sell without GST, you rent or lent out a room also no charge GST mah, so how come TD have to aborb the GST, and as rental of taxis get higher, GST certainly goes higher?</p>
              <p>Just a food for thought</p>
