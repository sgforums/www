              Due to multiple incidents with the latest happened hours ago, i sweared to myself it would be the last time i would pick up an indian pax at night spots (drinking)....For my safety, for my health, for my happiness, I will do that. Earn less nevermind..,,,
                  
              Before i continue, i will like to state that i am not a racist, i have many frens including my best pal who are indians.  please dun treat me like another amy cheong... thanks
                  
              Parked my taxi near the mcdonalds at clarke quay to catch my last pax for the nite. (changing shift back to sengkang). This indian chap knocked on my window saying going to hougang ave 8. i replied ok. Boarded my taxi with a mcdonald bag. He was drunk but still sober to make his way home type.
                  
              So i took the route (CTE-&gt;AMK 3-&gt;HG AV 8). He fucked me when i drove pass concorde hotel that i should turn right to orchard road, serangoon road and all to way to hougang. Kept scolding me useless, mother fucker..I told myself to keep cool and ignored him as i was already in the CTE, just endured him for minutes.
                  
              He then kept quiet for awhile and started eating his big breakfast. I turned n told him to stop eating. He replied loudly that he did not eat, he just opened the cover only. Assured me he would not mess up the taxi.
                  
              I was thinking whether i should chase him off my taxi on the expressway. I decided not to as i was already at braddell.  
                  
              Bad move. Along the way, he then continued his vuglar trail.....useless, CB, mother fucker. I endured again
                  
              When i reached his block at the car park, i turned around to collect my fare. Saw my taxi was in a mess. He yaya papaya said " He messed up my taxi and would pay me double the fare. He taunted me again and again saying he was a customer, always right and he was paying for the cleaning..
                  
              Then i lost my cool liao, left the meter on. I alighted and reached for my wheel lock for self defence, the baseball type. (I left it beside my seat as a safety precaution)
                  
              I walked to his side, opened the door, replied that i dunwan the extra fare, just wanted him to clear the mess. He ignored me at first and kept waving his money at me
                  
              I said firmly again and again "Cleared the mess". Must had said too loud that 2 passerbys stopped at their track and look towards us. 
                  
              He knew that i was serious.. He got scared, said sorry repeatly.. He then begun to clean, using my wet tissue, cloth, water.  After he cleared the mess he created, I stopped the meter and then collected the fare from him. 
                  
              What a way to end my shift..
                  
              I must say i am not proud of my actions.. I am not happy that things have to turn this way. . But then i have to defend my rights... I have my dignity too.

              <p>Due to multiple incidents with the latest happened hours ago, i
              sweared to myself it would be the last time i would pick up an
              indian pax at night spots (drinking)....For my safety, for my
              health, for my happiness, I will do that. Earn less
              nevermind..,,,</p>
              <p>Before i continue, i will like to state that i am not a racist,
              i have many frens including my best pal who are indians. please dun
              treat me like another amy cheong… thanks</p>
              <p>Parked my taxi near the mcdonalds at clarke quay to catch my
              last pax for the nite. (changing shift back to sengkang). This
              indian chap knocked on my window saying going to hougang ave 8. i
              replied ok. Boarded my taxi with a mcdonald bag. He was drunk but
              still sober to make his way home type.</p>
              <p>So i took the route (CTE-&gt;AMK 3-&gt;HG <span>AV
              8</span>). He fucked me when i drove pass concorde hotel that i
              should turn right to orchard road, serangoon road and all to way to
              hougang. Kept scolding me useless, mother fucker..I told myself to
              keep cool and ignored him as i was already in the <span>CTE</span>, just endured him for minutes.</p>
              <p>He then kept quiet for awhile and started eating his big
              breakfast. I turned n told him to stop eating. He replied loudly
              that he did not eat, he just opened the cover only. Assured me he
              would not mess up the taxi.</p>
              <p>I was thinking whether i should chase him off my taxi on the
              expressway. I decided not to as i was already at braddell.</p>
              <p>Bad move. Along the way, he then continued his vuglar
              trail…..useless, CB, mother fucker. I endured again</p>
              <p>When i reached his block at the car park, i turned around to
              collect my fare. Saw my taxi was in a mess. He yaya papaya said ”
              He messed up my taxi and would pay me double the fare. He taunted
              me again and again saying he was a customer, always right and he
              was paying for the cleaning..</p>
              <p>Then i lost my cool liao, left the meter on. I alighted and
              reached for my wheel lock for self defence, the baseball type. (I
              left it beside my seat as a safety precaution)</p>
              <p>I walked to his side, opened the door, replied that i dunwan the
              extra fare, just wanted him to clear the mess. He ignored me at
              first and kept waving his money at me</p>
              <p>I said firmly again and again “Cleared the mess”. Must had said
              too loud that 2 passerbys stopped at their track and look towards
              us.</p>
              <p>He knew that i was serious.. He got scared, said sorry
              repeatly.. He then begun to clean, using my wet tissue, cloth,
              water. After he cleared the mess he created, I stopped the meter
              and then collected the fare from him.</p>
              <p>What a way to end my shift..</p>
              <p>I must say i am not proud of my actions.. I am not happy that
              things have to turn this way. . But then i have to defend my
              rights… I have my dignity too.</p>

              <p>Not necesarrily la, gals when drunk are more likely to puke than guys, their tolerance level lower.</p>
              <p>Rather your tip, should be - Fri/Sat CQ - always keep your door locked, wind down very little enough to communicate with your prefered last pax destination. Interview time can observe subject.</p>
              <p>Just because going same location doesn't mean can take, must observe. Kwai Lan, yaya, drunk, pax holding food, all should be rejected. Instead look for happy looking pax, not drunk but happy and grateful that you will ferry them. These pax will be cincai about routes and very nice to you because you agreed to fetch them.</p>
              <p>Then only unlock your doors and admit them in.</p>
