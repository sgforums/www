              <p><br>I bet the policeman will ask you, where is the pax? Please write a statement, the description of the pax and the exact location, time, and action.</p>
              <p>Then the police will sit there and wait for the next TD to come and make another report, if the description is the same, then they will call out to all taxis companies to take note, once note and fit the description, please inform the police.</p>
              <p>Once the pax get caught, the TDs will have to attend court as witnesses and prosecutor, if the pax plead not guilty, TD will have to attend a few court session, end up, pax found guilty, get fined, TD get nothing.</p>

              <p>Not that we want to waste time, i got pax who run away when you stop, how to chase, how to really get a description at nite? sway lor, what to do? go police station, police also sian sian give u a piece of people and ask you to write statement, then will just said, "we will contact you once we caught that person you described", until now, no news?</p>
              <p>Laws is mend to deter people from doing it, and it is make by people, just like you said littering is $500, if someone on the park you see throw a cig butt, you go report? It is of great blessing that singapore do not have much of pax who dun pay, most will pay, the laws is set to protect it, but if the laws can said that the pax must compensate the taxi driver for his lost of time and compound the unpaid fares to triple and so on,...I do not mind going to court. Just $20 per hour for my time will do. However, the laws do not look into the TD, if you look at it clearly, it is going to charge the pax the same as shoplifting, where you take thing without paying. But then, a shop can still going on with it business be it if the boss attend court or not, but for taxi driver, a sole bread winner and properiorter, the one and only person who is the manager, the worker, the driver, the service and general worker on the street, cannot afford to lose time just for a pax how do not want to pay a $15 fare??</p>

              <p>This type of laws are pass by the associate of taxi Association, and it is a pity that there is no benefit for the poor TD who report for it. You ask any TDs on the street if they lose a day or two, or spent 2 hrs in police station, how much it cost them, I am not saying that the laws is no good, or that we should not report, but the action and the police work done is minimals and the laws is silent on the compensation on TD, imagine a laws consenously pass the bill at the parliament thru the Taxi association committee suggestion but end up not benefit a single sympathy on the poor TD is totally ridiculous.</p>
              <p>As a sole bread winner of a family, tell me, do i want to waste a few hundreds dollars of my time just for a lost of a fare??</p>

              <p>Its not a matter of who take the fine. If you reported the case to the police and if they happened to catch the person , they can proceed to charge him . That is not all. The important part is if they are charged, it will at the same time send out a strong signal to those who had been doing such tricks that all these will not be tolerated.</p>

              <p>I am sure the culprit will deny it, saying that the Taxi did not bring me to the place I wanted and all those nonsense, the twist of words can kill. As I said,  in singapore, not that there is many who do not pay, most will pay, so you hardly come across such unreasonable peoples, police will only be able to catch the culprit if he commit such crimes often, a repeater, I am not saying I will not report, but the last time i reported, get nothing out of it, and that time, there was alots of people at the neighbourhood police station over a family issues, so it took me more than 1/2 hour to get interviewed with my statement. I did report, so far nothing come back, so in such sense, if i got such pax, as most taxi driver will do, phui phui!!! and shout sway Sway!!! knn, seibei sway!! and then drive on, I think I cannot chase that teenager with muscular legs.</p>
              <p>Income tax?? how much relieve can you get from it, and then you need all the document to prove it, maybe end up having to go IRA office to drink kopi with the officer, mai lah.  Just Phui and move on.</p>

              <p><br>Hello bros, you do not have to get personnal right, this is a good post you posted, and you also have to accept comments and critics, I am just giving my own opinon, not against anyone or anybody. I would said, it is the society that makes me act this way, on a personnal note, I will report, and I did. But i would relook into it if this Sway sway Knn thing happen to me again, touch wood.</p>
              <p>Why? 1) I went to police station twice, once to report, write statement and then get an interview, which cost me an hour ++ due to crowd, then police called me up to clarify my stand, i went to see them again, from east to west, just to identify a picture they took, which was not even near what I drew and described. After 2 weeks, I called them, they asked for report nos/ref nos, i check my copy and told them, they said, no news.</p>
              <p>2) As a only earner for my family, I told my wife I lost $15 fare to a teenager, she scolded me, siao ar?? forget it, go drive one more hr can get back, police for what?? everytime go police, police got give your bread or butter or not?? Next time be more careful, see those people lock door before they leave, and if got into a fight, let go, you think you still young, people just poke you with a knife, you gone nevermind, but handicap, we sure to suffer all our lifes.</p>
