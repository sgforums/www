So whatever they're doing in poly, it's actually relevant to work," said Lee.<br><br>"I believe for employers, they can see that, and it's much easier for them to integrate and help the company, rather than the company having to guide them along in the first probation period," Lee added.<br><br>T Thamyrajah, who works as a registrar at Nanyang Polytechnic, said: "I think with the economic downturn, it becomes increasingly important for companies to look for this kind of skilled manpower to help them improve their operations, increase productivity." <br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1246845/1/.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1246845/1/.html</a></span></span></p></div>

              Even better news? ...Poly grad earns $12,000 a month
              
              
              
              
              
              
               
              
              January 10, 2013 - 12:21am 
              
              He has been at his job for only two years.
               
              Yet his monthly earnings, including commission, hit $12,000 in June and July last year.
               
              Mr Tan Xi Liang, 25, graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with a Diploma in Banking and Finance in 2009.
               
              He joined Prudential Singapore as a financial consultant in 2011 after completing his national service.
               
              Like him, polytechnic graduates are earning more these days.
               
              According to the Graduate Employment Survey jointly conducted by the five polytechnics last year, the median gross monthly salary among fresh poly graduates was $1,950 compared to $1,850 in 2011.
