              <p>I hv read a few threads abt drivers worried abt molest allegations when they get into disputes with female pax.</p>
              <p>Of course la, you musn't molest your pax, male or female. If you do that, you will for sure 1 day get into trouble that you deserve. And don't think if you got away once, you can get away again. Most molesters that are caught are not first timers, it's only the first time they are caught. </p>
              <p>Now I only wanna focus on wrongful allegations. First of all, it's not just her word against your word, or that the Singapore Law favours women - Woman's Charter etc. All of that has nothing to to do with outraging modesty.</p>
              <p>A molest allegation will have to involve making a police report and a proper police investigation. This is not China, arrested today, comvicted tomorrow and jailed the day after. Our courts don't just take the allegation at face value, they look very deeply into the circumstances of the case.</p>
              <p>Accidental touching is not mloest unless you intended to outrage the persons modesty. You touch a woman's hand is that molest? Of course you touch the breast or privates, when you have no business, that's different. </p>
              <p>If the female pax sat infront alone, that does not make her case very good in a molest allegation. Even if got 2 or 3 females like the school girls at Katong, that case also very suspicious. The Courts will consider whether the TD was so stupid or daring to molest someone with witnesses present.</p>
              <p>Then the police also looks at the circumstances, did the TD suggest anything sexual prior to the 'molest', did he drop hints. All this never do, then suddenly he groped a woman? Very strange.</p>
              <p>What did the victim do, go home, watch tv, talk to her friends and then make a report? or did she act shocked, was her demeanour fitting with normal cases of molest - outraged?</p>
              <p>Finally there is always the option of volunterring for a 'lie detector test' - this cannot be used in court but it helps in investigations. If the TD volunteered for the test and passed, that will favour his case tremendously, or if the victim refuses to give one or gives conflicting statements.</p>
              <p>So don't be afraid of these allegations if you're innocent, always insist on calling the police, making a report or the very least inform your company.</p>
              <p>Remember if you're innocent, you needn't worry.</p>

              <p>The link was a recent case of molest, where the accused asked a 'mildly retarded' woman for permission to touch her breast.</p>
              <p>She being retarded had nodded her head although what she actually meant was to say no. But the accused naturally mistook the nod to mean yes and promptly squeezed her breast. Thereafter he gave her $4. </p>
              <p>He was charged in court for molest but was found not guilty because of what the woman did. </p>
              <p>I am not saying by this, there is an excuse to exploit but rather, the court does not suka suka convict people accused of molest, the circumstances before, during and after the alleged molest is viewed very carefully before a conviction.</p>
              <p>It's not just a case of she said-he said, this or that.</p>

              <p>I guess taxi driver need to install more camera in their cars as there are more fare cheats nowadays.</p>
              <p>This will allow the taxi company to share the fare cheat information among the taxi drivers.</p>
              <p>Saw the youtube on two teenager gals trying not to pay their fares and the taxi driver wanted to drive the taxi to police station.</p>
              <p>The taxi driver need to keep cool, keep quiet and keep their hands on the wheels and drive the taxi straight to the police station.</p>
