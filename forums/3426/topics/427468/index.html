              <p>one of our trainer is from LTA. He showed us the various fines for all the offences</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now LTA is quite strict in their enforcement and recently they have upped the fines. Some of the offences have been upgaded with fines from $100 to $200 and demerit points increased from 3 to 5.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I remember correctly, that MBS taxi has not breached the rule if the spot where he picked up the passenger is 9m away from the Taxi stand. Only in CBD area, taxi drivers are only allowed to pick up passenger from the taxi stand during the CBD operating hours.</p>

              <p>From the clip , you are able to see the driver interviewing the pax. Probably pax is going to a good location thats why he took, If lousy location he push to the front.</p>
              <p>I dont see anything wrong , its like Pax ask : Uncle got nets? 05 ask go where? Pax : Woodlands, 05 say take comfort behind.</p>
              <p>U cant fault people for interviewing since it is one of those tactics that u taught right in here in sgforums.</p>

              <p><br>I wouldn't want to entirely blame TD for being Yao and fast today, look at today cost of living and oil prices, more and more TDs will become more Yao and Yao, govt and Taxi companies do play a part. Especially those younger TDs with small school going kids and old parents to take care for, there is a pressure and stress in them and that translate into their fast action. Afterall, we are all bros and sisters, fast also got a price to pay, but there are some who are fast and skillful, like some of you here.</p>

              <p>I am kind of pity that TD on your cam, he may lost more than half of his income for that day, I think as we are all TD earning a living out there, we might be killing ourselves for such video to come out, this may help LTA more, make more paxs take taxi out of Taxi stand, and some may laugh at us, and our own bros suffer. The mentality of the public is when one TD make a mistake, the rest are consider the same, TD are alway blamed as a whole.</p>
              <p>My view is that if we could put it in a way of not naming or showing the license plate, will be more good in term of our good self.</p>
