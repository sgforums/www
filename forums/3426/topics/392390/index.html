              <p>Let me share mine....It was in 2007 &amp; I was still a green horn.  Got a call from one of the condo at Cairnhill Rd.  They were Indo Chinese, mother &amp; 2 kids.  The daughter is quite fat &amp; lots of pimples on face (teenager).  Hopped in &amp; said go to tampines st 84.  Asked them which is their preferred route, daughter said any way as long as no jam.  It was about 8 am in the morning, </p>
              <p>So,I took CTE, saw that there was a very long queue at slip road to PIE.  Decided to go by TPE.  Reached Punggol side, also jam, then the mother KPKB, say normally go by Bedok.  I was still pretty new and not familiar with roads then.  I replied saying I've already asked which way to take &amp; your daughter mentioned as long as no jam.  I then asked the daughter to clarify.  Instead, she showed me a fuck up attitude and told me I should have used my discretion.  CCB.  Fucking du lan already.  Cut story short, I circle around till I ended up in Paya Lebar.  I then told the mother I will alight them and get them another cab.  She KPKB again say where got such thing.  Anyway, managed to reach destination.  The fucking daughter when alighted, slammed the door so hard.  The mother only wanted to pay $10 but I told her forget it, treat it that I sway.  In my heart, I was cursing &amp; swearing.</p>
              <p>Some might say I'm dumb for not taking the money even though it's less than the metered fare.  But in my heart, I was thinking, don't want to earn your fucking money......</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>There was once I took this cab. End up short of $4+ And the uncle like want to beat me sia. Raise his fist somemore. I tell him I'll call my father to come down and pay the rest of the $. In the end he just tell me to go. I dont have the $4 but actually I dont want to pay him also, he take his time during peak hours. I calculate zhun zhun the fare will not exceed so I bring just nice. Who ask him take his time end up fare +$4+ more. So I also take my time lah.. Knn then he got angry and say what petrol expensive, taxi very hard to earn $$. Knn want to squeeze my $$ think very easy? The trip at most $20 I calculate already. He go and make until $24+. Go eat shit lah.</p></div>
