              Hello,
              
              one hour ago, i boarded a taxi from Geylang Lot 15
              When i was in the taxi, the meter was already on
              so I told the taxi driver that you should not ON the meter before i direct you to my destination.
              I wasn't very particular about the extra 20 or 30 cents extra charge
              Just jokingly told the driver abt the rulings (LTA)
              To my surprise, abt 30 meters on the road, the driver request that I alight from the taxi
              
              Time : 11.17 PM
              Location : Lor 15 Geylang
              Date : 18 July 2011
              Taxi Number plate : SHB 8606U
              
              So, should I report to LTA

              <p>decent02 is a relief taxi driver himself. Why behave like that? This profession already is not the most respectable one, and he still want to spoil a taxi driver's day by making stupid comments? He drives on weekend, so maybe have not kenna worse nonsense from pax yet.</p>
              <p>You want to earn extra by driving on weekends, so do you report those extra dollars u made to IRAS? I believe IRAS closed both eyes if your annual income is under reported by 20 cents, perhaps even 200 dollars they also closed both eyes. But you want to complain about 20 cents? Something is seriously wrong with your upbringing.</p>
