              <p><br>As we move along our TD life, we tends to like to please others and slowly forget ourselves, remember that everything start from self, when self is disciplined, wife is happy, childrens will be happy, parent will utlimately be happy. With a happy family, you drive more happy, once you are happy, pax seeing a happy cabby, will most likely to be happy taking yr cab.</p>
              <p>Therefore, it is critical to please oneself, pamper oneself with good foods or a good massage to respect oneself for a good work done, if nobody gives you a pat on yr back, you can alway give yourself a pat.</p>
              <p>What bring about unhappiness in TD is the external factors, from govt policy, to paxs, to the society at large and companies rules and regulations. Day in a day out, you see those TDs keep saying knn, that new rules, this new rental fees, knn, this govt fark up design or policies, all these are external factor trying to make you unhappy.</p>
              <p>However, most of us are unable to affect the external factors, so to speak, but as long as we are aware of it, like we get a lousy fark up pax, we should not be influence and tackle it with care as not to make ourselve unhappy out of their fark up policies or character pax.</p>
              <p>As saying goes, you can die pleasing people.</p>

              As I am just driving part time .... 2/7 weekdays night and weekend day shift .. 
              
              I see it as a oppty to earn extra income. 
              
              With regardings to chatting with pax ... I usually dun .. unless they start the conversation 1st. 
              
              one of the pax I fetch recently commented that he will always chat with the taxi uncles to ensure they are awake ?? lol 
              
              during the conversations .. he says that he is a private tuition .. $100/ 1 hr session.
              
              Teaching the FT's children, he also say that he always see a regular taxi fetching his students ... machiam got private arrangement... as the taxi  uncle told him that the FT pays him $2000 per month to fetch his children to and from school ... or run errands ... (fixed schedule) then he still can sweep the road outside of the hours ... 
              
              Good idea hor?? but I supposed this is only applicable for full timer OMO drivers

              <p><br> Fly kite? now fly kite also need skill hor, and kite also not cheap
              cheap hor.</p>
              <p>The way the public looks and view Taxi drivers is a culture, and
              depend on which country you are cultured from, you look at TD at
              differently, however there is only one common view on us, and that
              is sorry to say, cheap.</p>
              <p>Like it or not, you can be a manager, GM, businessman, or like
              me former casket supervisor, once you hold the steering wheel of a
              Taxis, you don the image of a taxi driver and therefore considered
              in most common view as cheap.</p>
              <p>However, being a common view does not imply that all look at it
              that way, some paxs are real understanding and respect TD as an
              honest and hardworking job.</p>
              <p>If pax from india, you know how they look at us, if paxs
              are from china, viet or any other countries imported into
              here, they will view us in a way of their motherland TD until
              someone like me or Hammer or Rbs teach them a lesson, then maybe
              they will get enlightened and be more meadow in the way they look
              at Sg Taxi driver.</p>
              <p>As for Locals, TD was cultured out of no option because during
              the 80s and 90s when economy was booming, driving TD is a last
              option, meaning you must be someone who cannot make it even at a
              booming economy, and that culture had in a way transmitted down
              till now, coupled with those born with silver spoon si gina (kids),
              we are still very much under the scope of being the lower rung of
              the society.</p>
              <p>But then, now matter how peoples perception on us, the most
              important is still yourself, and that is ME, Me must have
              confident, discipline,steady, smile often and be happy, care for me
              family and good buddies. Once that is reached, we are no different
              or even better than a CEO status, because CEO is still a labour, we
              are the boss.</p>
              <p>As for paxs, try to appreciate and remember those goods ones and
              forget those bad ones. Some cabbies alway like to have durian type
              of fares, but for me, I will anytime take a $6 fare good paxs then
              a durian fares of $30 with a fark up pax, because, a good pax
              can really light up our day.</p>

              <p>nice break down</p>
              <p>i believe human nature has this mentality</p>
              <p>expensive = good</p>
              <p>cheap = lousy</p>
              <p>just like cars, mobile phones, have an expensive one means got status, can make it, top of crop, whether can sustain or really make full use of it is another issue, least is 'already there'</p>
              <p>high excutives can downgrade to be a hawker/taxi driver(irregardless successful or not), but the reverse hardly happen</p>
              <p>taxi drivers some times protray their poor image as well although there are better ones too. even between different company, some say the drivers attitude is different too. most will see it as a trade for uncles than for young men.</p>
              <p>service trade here is usually regard as lower grade profession, and therefore at times get pushed around. same as being property agent in its earlier days, any tom dick harry can be one over night, close a few cases and disappear. lost a job, be a property agent, job market rebound, they left the trade. tdvl, got basic qualification, just pay and go through it first, get licence first and then decide later.</p>
              <p>although is important to have a right mindset is considered half battle won, but the other enemy is how people see u from outside. but at least for sure, when taxi transport is much sought after(peak hour, rainy day,etc), the passengers are usually more appreciative of our presence.</p>
              <p>all in all, its still a HONEST LIVING..</p>

              knn, that new rules, this new rental fees, knn, this govt fark up
              design or policies, all these are external factor trying to make
              you unhappy.</p>
              <p>However, most of us are unable to affect the external factors,
              so to speak, but as long as we are aware of it, like we get a lousy
              fark up pax, we should not be influence and tackle it with care as
              not to make ourselve unhappy out of their fark up policies or
              character pax.</p>
              <p>As saying goes, you can die pleasing people.</p>

              <p>this part is a little tricky.</p>
              <p>we have daily cost to cover, then we see income</p>
              <p>unless u don't mind making sacrifices -  a smaller income, with lesser driving hours, and therefore u can have own personal time, then its good to let go, a couple of days each week for own time. no income, u are like working for the company. lower income, do not let yourself fall into trap of being lazy and lazier.</p>
              <p>cabbies are no different from hawker stall, got overheads to take care. once that taken care of, then is profit. just that hawker stall stays there for walk in customers, we are mobile. we all need to work least 6 days a week or even everyday, esp, weekends and PH because its the more crowded time. at least cover the cost, to make how much for that day, u can decide</p>

              <p>Teaching the FT’s children, he also say that he always see a
              regular taxi fetching his students … machiam got private
              arrangement… as the taxi uncle told him that the FT pays him $2000
              per month to fetch his children to and from school … or run errands
              … (fixed schedule) then he still can sweep the road outside of the

              <p>chatting with pax, depends on individual.</p>
              <p>chatting sometimes can distract a driver too, so do it if your pax can engage in <span style="color: #ff0000;">healthy casual conversation</span></p>
              <p>private arrangement got its pros and cons, so manage it properly</p>

              <p>there's always a price tag to everything.</p>
              <p>whether being a TD is bad for health, long hours of sitting, confined to a car cabin of different passengers, germs, long hours on the road to make a decent living, <strong>all boils down on how u manage and sometimes must learn to let go</strong></p>
              <p>u drive hard, make sure u do relax and unwind too, exercise, healthy lifestyle, give up some time on the road(= to income) to relax and pamper yourself and family.</p>
              <p>some are hardcore, for the passion of $$,longer hours on the road, they end up with poor health and broken relationships.</p>

              <p>ironically we can never earn enough or finish earning $, but we can finish spending them, earn less, spend less</p>
              <p>so always keep it at the back of your head, <strong>health is more important than wealth</strong></p>
