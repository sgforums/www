              <p>Last option jobs means nobody wants, right? Consider the following stats:</p>
                  <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
                  <p>1.  There are about 45,000 active taxi drivers.</p>
                  <p>2. There are more than 90,000 TDVL holders. Although it could be argued that half of these people hold the licence precisely because it could be their last choice option, then why did they choose taxi licence? Why not go for the bus driver's licence, or other class 4 or 5 licences?</p>
                  <p>3.  Every year, more than 9,000 people apply to take the TDVL course, which represents an increase of some 30% over the last 3 years. And this number is expected to rise in the future.</p>
                  <p>4. LTA  has increased the minimum fleet size for an operator by 100%, from 400 to 800.    They must be quite confident that there will be demand for this increase from the TDs.</p>
                  <p style="display: inline !important;">The  minimum requirement is an O or N level pass in English. This has raised the bar somewhat. There are quite a number of people who simply could not pass the exams despite numerous attempts. They make many attempts to retake the exams, paying for each retest. They can easily be a security guard or a cleaning supervisor or a bus driver. There are many other options for these people, but why die die want to be a TD?</p>
                  <p>I dun think all 45,000 active TDs are desperados. The huge numbers hardly suggest that it is a last option job.</p>

              <p>The way the public looks and view Taxi drivers is a culture, and depend on which country you are cultured from, you look at TD at differently, however there is only one common view on us, and that is sorry to say, cheap.</p>
              <p>Like it or not, you can be a manager, GM, businessman, or like me former casket supervisor, once you hold the steering wheel of a Taxis, you don the image of a taxi driver and therefore considered in most common view as cheap.</p>
              <p>However, being a common view does not imply that all look at it that way, some paxs are real understanding and respect TD as an honest and hardworking job.</p>
              <p>If pax from india, you know how they look at us, if paxs are from china, viet or any other countries imported into here, they will view us in a way of their motherland TD until someone like me or Hammer or Rbs teach them a lesson, then maybe they will get enlightened and be more meadow in the way they look at Sg Taxi driver.</p>
              <p>As for Locals, TD was cultured out of no option because during the 80s and 90s when economy was booming, driving TD is a last option, meaning you must be someone who cannot make it even at a booming economy, and that culture had in a way transmitted down till now, coupled with those born with silver spoon si gina (kids), we are still very much under the scope of being the lower rung of the society.</p>
              <p>But then, now matter how peoples perception on us, the most important is still yourself, and that is ME, Me must have confident, discipline,steady, smile often and be happy, care for me family and good buddies. Once that is reached, we are no different or even better than a CEO status, because CEO is still a labour, we are the boss.</p>
              <p>As for paxs, try to appreciate and remember those goods ones and forget those bad ones. Some cabbies alway like to have durian type of fares, but for me, I will anytime take a $6 fare good paxs then a durian fares of $30 with a fark up pax, because, a good pax can really light up our day.</p>

              Yes sirâ€¦agreedâ€¦see open lor
              
              Td is my 1st option lehâ€¦ but tats after I was sued for bankruptcy. Yah, last time was over aggressive in investing (mostly in properties), then things went wrong like in the movie â€œmoney no enoughâ€�, financial crisis, etcâ€¦ when creditors started calling at my office to chase, I made decision to resign (even tho doing well in my job) and chose TD cos very hard to find meâ€¦hahaha.
              
              I owe creditors over $600K, my declared income from TD $1600/mthâ€¦So OA deduct $80-100 /mth. If I get higher paying fixed salary job (apart from the embarressmt in the co) I will hv to pay higher amt to OAâ€¦ Where got meaning?â€¦
              
              When declared â€œBâ€�, the banks hv to stop charging interest on the loans I defaulted on. Then the CPF I used to service my private property loan hv to return to me. So its also one way to â€œclearâ€� your debts lorâ€¦ Now pay abt $90 per monthâ€¦ in 10 years pay back $10Kâ€¦wu hua bo?  I really canâ€™t think of a better option.
