              <p>Lawyers? Only few can make it to the top, most become script writers for corporate or government bodies.</p>
              <p>Doctor?? so many foreign doctor at polyclinic, young at 24 to 28yo, Singapore Doctor, after six year on medicine, go housemanship (hospital apprentice) at hospital, tackle pinoy nurses, all in all, by 32yo, then graduate as a GP and when you want to go further as specialist, another 3 to 4yrs oversea, by that time, half life gone liao.</p>
              <p>Engineers??, its no more a grand job after foreign engineers are willing to take 1k to 1.2k paid or even 2k to get an employment pass. If you are singaporean, worst is engineer, hard to find a job, and yet paid get stagnatated by foreigners.</p>
              <p>Lecturers, go ask Sylvia Lim why she come out as a politician, so many foreign lecture in poly and U, the worst is U, 70 to 80% foreign lecturer, talk cock sing song only. Do you know that NUS and NTU was downgraded from 23 to 54 place and 65 to 174 place respectively in the world because the certificate is lost its weightage.</p>
              <p>IT programmers, you drive taxi, ask any indian expatriate, those proud ones, you can pick them up at balestier or bukit timah cricket ground, more proud one will be at city hall cricket club. They are either IT programmer or Banker. Now you go poly and Uni, who take IT?? the bulk that took IT in the 90s due to forseen IT market blooming are now mostly working in other industrial including TD, ah neh programmer at shenton way is only $1.2k, you ask for 5k???</p>

              <p>Everyone view it differently. Some of you might have heard of the following story:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Two salespeople were sent to Africa to open up new shoe markets. Two days after arriving in Africa, one salesman called the office and said, "I'm coming back to the U.S. on the next flight because I can't sell shoes here. Everybody goes around barefoot."</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto;">On the same day, the other salesman sent an E-mail to the factory saying: "The prospects in Africa are unlimited. Nobody wears shoes here!"</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Taxi driving is a job, but can be a career if you view it differently.</p>
              <p>The optimist says the glass is half full. The pessimist says the glass is half empty.</p>
              <p>Optimist will see taxi driving as a stepping stone and upgrade himself constantly to be a successful private Limo Cab Driver like Brother JDIL who bought a S$150k Mercedes-Benz Viano with 100% CASH.</p>

              <p>In term of optimist and pessimist, the best is that you hv both of them, some are born with ah kong's fortune, some got better luck, some really work hard to achieve it, some, too bad, from broken or poor family, so have to built from dirt and pieces, and some given opportunity, but choose to ignore it and spent their lives as time goes by, some real family man, some just pass time or do not even know which direction they are going.</p>

              different asshole, it is up to individual to absorb or
              reject the advices so as to suit himself.</p>
              <p>In term of optimist and pessimist, the best is that you hv both
              of them, some are born with ah kong's fortune, some got better
              luck, some really work hard to achieve it, some, too bad, from
              broken or poor family, so have to built from dirt and pieces, and
              some given opportunity, but choose to ignore it and spent their
              lives as time goes by, some real family man, some just pass time or
              do not even know which direction they are going.</p>
              <p>But then, as long as you earn a honest living with an honest
              paid, owe no one, cheat no one, be passive and yet friendly, you
              are the master of your own destination</p>

              <p><br>I am not present, cos got work to do, so much so that I wanted to attend,  I do not want to promise brothers but end up not attending, I hope all had a fruitful gathering, making more friends and brothers got nothing to lose but more to gain.</p>
              <p>I did 3 sending off that day, even I had the time gap to meet up with all brothers/sisters, I would had not wanted due to my position and condition, not being supertitious, it can bring bad luck to brothers if I attended without bathing with flowers. And that can hurt me.</p>
