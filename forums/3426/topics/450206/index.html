              <p>Wonder if you do not mind driving casket van, now need peoples, drive taxis very tire, long hours, and somemore got lots of fark up paxs, LTA enforcers, on the road summons and end up with fark up taxi companies, higher and higher fuel prices, more and more competitives, no life and after hours of working, look no different from a zombie.</p>
              <p>Casket driving, one day two trips only, close at 3pm, wash and clean and park at allocated lots, paid $60 per day, tips from deceased family not included, free foods and drinks. All fuel pay by company, many night operation job, $50 to $80 per trip disposal, per trip meaning pick up and sent to destinated place. Night supervisor will arrange the trips for you, most 1 to 2 trip extra income, sometime, 4 to 5 trips on high seasons.</p>
              <p>High season meaning more people died, huat for us</p>

              <p>I super relief only, mostly fri, sat and sun, cos those day, mortuary close, unless you want to do the sending off with mobile escort which I also do when got no super relief job.</p>
              <p>Class 3 can mah, but be prepare to become the lowest grade in your life, taxis already consider low by some, imagine casket driver, not even recognised in the society, like my relatives and some proud friends alway look down on me, knn, drive casket van talk so much, some peoples do not like to get near me once they know I drive casket, cos these farker damn pan dan mah, sway to them.</p>
              <p>Unless your family or whatever relatives do not mind, you can consider. Actually there are many thing to drive, not just taxis. Water taxis also need singaporeans</p>

              <p>Your mind slows down , your body gets weak, the world moves ahead but YOU especially the night shifters.</p>
              <p>u call that a career? 3 years u are in this trade and if u still dont get out , you are FARKED.</p>
              <p>Dont think of it as a career pls , makes me wanna laugh :D</p>

              <p>Do take this as an interim job but be on a look-out for a permanent career. Because being a TD is the lowest and also the highest, there's no junior td and there's no senior tds. Years down the road, your income will still be the same.</p>

              <p>I do believe in taxi driving being a career.</p>
              <p>A career is defined as a progress through life or occupation. Though taxi drivers might not be the most lucrative occupation compared to other industries, it offers a person flexibility in working hours and personal development in certain areas. Quick thinking, communicating with strangers, patience...and the list goes on. To clarify these attributes can be honed through working in other jobs as well, but thats beside the point.</p>
              <p>Ultimately one must find meaning and joy in his work in order to enjoy a fufilling career. Work your sums for your monthly expenditure and follow your heart. Does it make you happy even if you are holding the highest office in your organisation or being a taxi driver?</p>
              <p>Our average life expectancy is 79.3 years for male singaporeans and we can only live once in life.</p>

              <p>A job with cpf is, I feel, still your best option. Got forced savings to pay for your hdb or medical bills, even when sick, not working or if unlucky get warded because of injury or illness.</p>

              Bro, hang on to ur job (if any).
              
              TD fulltime is no joke. If monetary wise, a bit more better than ur present career, don't jump!
              
              TD zero benefits, income stagnant &amp; must commit everyday. Health will deteriorate faster. 
              
              My age also quite similar as urs. Made wrong choices, hence ending up as TD. Thinking back, i realli miz my cushy job back then. 
              
              I'm still driving is due to financial commitment (can't find a job that pays the same previously).
              
              Think thrice ba...
