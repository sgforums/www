              in the early day yes, many see taxi very different but ut was different than and most
              
              who drove taxi are normally unskill and lowly educated
              
              today, things are not the same anymore, just look at the intake and the newbie OTR
              
              average age who started as TDs now are getting younger as a result of the MIW policy
              
              but this new group of people are not what passenger can bully. including myself

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Actually, my situation is interesting. My family were happy that I started driving taxi. I am retired and was living in Vietnam wt my new wife. But then 8 months ago, my ex-wife father got health problems. Came back to Singapore to look after him, wanted to buy a car but was $140-150k. So just used my ex-wife car to take her father around. I didn't want to go back in the oil and gas industry cause I want total freedom in my time. Was boring in Singapore so went to casino to burn time. Had lost 40 times of Poolman's debt. My new wife wanted me to bar myself from casino before I got my enbloc money from one of my condos. After driving for 5 months, I quite enjoy driving. But I drive 7.30-10.30am then go home and come out at 4.30-5pm and drive to 10-10.30pm. Like that got car to use and freedom of time. Met lots of interesting people. Dun earn much but at least happy. Best option is to drive as relief, can cover costs in 3 hours but only get to use car for 12 hrs. I respect those that drive to feed family since I experience how tiring driving taxi can be. Now I visit Ship once or twice a week to enjoy my hobby and make a little more income. </p></div>
