              <p>Wife's reaction is go, do. see can or not.</p>
              <p>Now after a year she also realise I move around kind, this type of job good for me.</p>
              <p>Every job has risk, even you good td, also know other drivers can be screw up kind.</p>
              <p>You just have to be very aware of surroundings. That means you don't drive too many hours and have enough rest. Just like poolman, my hours max 9-10.</p>

              <p>For my family, they said, at least better than casket driving. he hehe</p>
              <p>Therefore, the perspective from family is more of 2 kinds of view.</p>
              <p>Top down or Down up.</p>
              <p>Top down: If you said you are a former CEO, manager, or whoever earning around the 10k region or above, driving taxis is definitely going to be a bit hard for the family to view it as good or best option.</p>
              <p>Down up: Like me, a former casket driver, driving taxi is a upgrade for me, from primary sch to secondary sch like this, family also happy, at least now go shopping or market to buy groceries can sit on a cab instead of a casket van...knn</p>

              <p>Happy is easy to said, but to achieve it, few can do it.</p>
              <p>You can do see all kind of happy slogan, but at the end of the day, deep inside you, you must truly ask yourself, Am I happy? really Happy?</p>
              <p>Happy arrives not thru internally (intrinsic), it arrives from externally (extrinsic) that transform into internal happiness.</p>
              <p>One gain and other lose is not happiness, one achievement and other suffer is not happiness, one great and other suffer is not happiness, one lack of care and other care for is not happiness</p>
              <p>Happiness is about making other happy, once other are happy (external), you will be happy (internal). But world do not like to work this way, you notice people like to make other unhappy and seeing them unhappy, some thought they can gain happiness, which might be, but only temporary happiness.</p>
              <p>You can try it yourself, you do not have to do big thing or spending big money to make other happy, tell you wife, I love you can make her happy, and you become happy, tell your children you love them, and they become happy, you also happy. It is not entirely about money, but the feeling and emotion.</p>
              <p>A normal example will be you give seat to a old person and he or she said thank you to you, you feel happy for the whole day out of nothing.</p>
              <p>And when you are happy, naturally you will be healthy and lucky</p>

              <p>They, like pool or komade can be happy is because that is only the way to be happy for them, for them, it is not totally about money, it about freedom that one get and the freedom to help others within one willingness. Money is a temporary happy icon, and it can kill. Not everyone can hold large amount of money, it can bury you alive at times.</p>
              <p>Nobody in this world is born laughing, all are born crying, why, because this is a unhappy place to be in, the day you were born or conceived, you suffer, because it is the begining of struggling, struggling for foods, money, sex, flame, intergrity, face, ego, pride and so on.</p>
              <p>Be it you are rich or poor, you struggled, and as you struggled, you suffered. Struggle to be winner, the best, the richest, the easiest life, struggle to win your peers or at least match them, struggle with rentals, fuel, paxs, and so on in all walks of life.</p>
              <p>But then, the biggest struggle is ultimately, you, you yourself. If you are alway anguish with yourself, which I agree most TD do, then you are not doing yourself any flavour.</p>
              <p>If you keep comparing yourself with your peers who are now GM or rich business people or more sucessful then your life, then you are not forgiving yourself, and if you cannot forgive yourself, how can your forgive others.</p>
              <p>So, the self thinking is therefore important in determing you want to be happy or sad, as said, life is not long, why be sad if you can choose to be happy. Compare not the rich or the higher but people lower than you, help them if you can, forgive oneself instead of keep cursing one road map goes wrong in life and that is why still a TD. But TD very sia sway meh? still better than many others, still able to bring up a family with foods, clothing and education provided.</p>
              <p>Once you look down on yourself, you can never find happiness. For life is a choice, the options might be more or less, it is up to individual to seek their own happiness in their own unique way, but if you choose to keep cursing and kan here and there, then it is your choice.</p>

              <p>They, like pool or komade can be happy is because that is only
              the way to be happy for them, for them, it is not totally about
              money, it about freedom that one get and the freedom to help others
              within one willingness. Money is a temporary happy icon, and it can
              kill. Not everyone can hold large amount of money, it can bury you
              alive at times.</p>
              <p>Nobody in this world is born laughing, all are born crying, why,
              because this is a unhappy place to be in, the day you were
              born or conceived, you suffer, because it is the begining of
              struggling, struggling for foods, money, sex, flame, intergrity,
              face, ego, pride and so on.</p>
              <p>Be it you are rich or poor, you struggled, and as you struggled,
              you suffered. Struggle to be winner, the best, the richest, the
              easiest life, struggle to win your peers or at least match them,
              struggle with rentals, fuel, paxs, and so on in all walks of
              life.</p>
              <p>But then, the biggest struggle is ultimately, you, you yourself.
              If you are alway anguish with yourself, which I agree most TD do,
              then you are not doing yourself any flavour.</p>
              <p>If you keep comparing yourself with your peers who are now GM or
              rich business people or more sucessful then your life, then you are
              not forgiving yourself, and if you cannot forgive yourself, how can
              your forgive others.</p>
              <p>So, the self thinking is therefore important in determing you
              want to be happy or sad, as said, life is not long, why be sad if
              you can choose to be happy. Compare not the rich or the higher but
              people lower than you, help them if you can, forgive oneself
              instead of keep cursing one road map goes wrong in life and that is
              why still a TD. But TD very sia sway meh? still better than many
              others, still able to bring up a family with foods, clothing and
              education provided.</p>
