              <p>hi, just to share,</p>
              <p>for me, whenever I take a taxi, and I have $50, I will tell the driver. Some will say okay, some will moan. if they moan, I go off.</p>
              <p>However, there is one that said okay, later, at destination, he found he has no change. Drove me to coffeeshop, take my 50 and went to get change, and the meter was running the whole time. And at my destination, he charged me full. is that morally right??</p>

              <p>I rely on my intuition and 6th sense. If my instinct tells me the passenger is genuine, I will just wait. Otherwise depending on the situation and my mood, I might just fuck them up, send them to the police station, or if it is just a few dollars, consider it charity if I am in a good mood.</p>
              <p>Maxing out my $$/hr is my primary motivation most of the time. I usually dont get into a foul mood unless it helps to increase my $$/hr.</p>

              <p>HI fatboy,</p>
              <p>Actually you can say settle the bill with the taxi driver on the fare. Dun forget our income is based on time and doing this a service it takes time wastage . If you are not so generous with taxi driver , next time my advise to you bring smaller change like coins. Coz we taxi drivers need coins coz no use of you to deposit coins in the bank as they charge you see.</p>
              <p>Also remember if you are not happy with the meter running, next time  tell the taxi driver," Uncle pls keep the change .". It really brightens our day .</p>
              <p>We the taxi driver will say " HUAT AHH" and many good fortune will come to your way.</p>

              <p>well, I did not dispute the fare, nor did I make any remarks such as, "why did you not have change?". Rem, I paid in full.I am just questioning.</p>
              <p>Yes I do know your income is based on time, and rem, as I shared, I did state earlier when I entered the taxi, "I have a $50 note".  And if the driver does not have change, I won't take the taxi. I am doing my part as a consumer which I think should be appreciate and encouraged, right? </p>
              <p>Do note, consumer's time is precious too, else, most would have taken other modes of transport, so it should be a win-win for both drivers/consumers, and not just a "our income is based on time".  That just doesn't sit nicely with me. </p>
              <p>I don't feel it is morally right to tell the driver to keep the change in this case, when evidently, I did my part. I did not try to make things difficult. and I felt the drivers may let the meter run, but maybe just take some fare off when he returns the change. And gladly, I would have given a tip for the consideration/effort.</p>
              <p>Yes, giving a tip/keep the change may make both ends happy, provided, the consumers had had a pleasant ride.</p>

              I feel that regardless of what, the onus is on the taxi drivers to find the change for the fare without the pax being shortchanged. But often, the very notion of customer service just fly over the head .Honestly, it irks me that some taxi drivers think that their time is money and therefore take it as their divine right that everyone should make concessions for them. Its that sort of me-only attitude, profits as the be all and end all as they drive like maniacs without due care for other motorists that make them perfect fodders for ST Stomp, and quite possibly add to the unfair perception that most are just unruly and uncivilized. Then again, it's easy for me to criticize.
              
              For the most part, there is little emphasis or incentives for drivers to be customer-oriented (beyond greeting you) except when coming from their own heart or they are in the business of taking regular bookings. Whether u've had a good or bad experience, the chance of taking the same cab is remote. As a job, driving a taxi is pretty much self-governing. Without any supervison and fear of reprisal, sometimes it's easy to lapse into moments where you would take the option which gives you the most benefits, even at the expense of others. No excuses, however i do empathize with drivers who constantly have to deal with difficult paxs.It's not easy to be all happy and smiling. Alongside that, I'll take the assumption that the stress of paying rental, maximizing their earnings during peak hours and often being the sole breadwinner to be the reason for them tipping over.
              
              So where customer satisfaction is concerned, i set a very low threshold for myself when taking a cab. 
              
              And it's probably only right that you should hand over your IC/traceable identity or something of value to put the cabby at ease when you need to return back to pay the fare since in the first place one should have enough cash. Unless you inside got ghost.

              <p>Ah-Bickle, i think the perception of the uncivilised taxi driver is passé. one outcome of the economic crisis is that the number of highly educated sgp'reans taking up taxi driving has increased significantly. throw a stone and you're likely to hit 2 or 3 drivers who have been retrenched from their PMET jobs. even among the older generation, many cabbies with 10 or more years of experience do provide very good service. granted, there will always be black sheep, young or old. but they should be in the minority.</p>
              <p>a common failing of us asians is that while we frequently criticise sub-standard work or service, we do not praise or show our appreciation when we get good work done or receive good service. so the reports of errant cabbies in stomp,ST, or any other media far out number that of cabbies providing good service. or any other service staff for that matter. Singaporeans and FTs EXPECT good service without realising it takes 2 hands to clap. a real life example...a few months back..it was raining cats and dogs when i saw a lady frantically flagging my taxi from a sheltered walkway. there was no shelter that i could pick her up from and a grass patch ran parallel to the walkway. my only umbrella was in the back of my cab, so i stopped my taxi, got out and retrieved the brolly from the back seat and then sheltered the lady to my cab. PTW! rite? by then i was drenched. back in the cab...not a word of thanks, instead..Taxi Driver, send me to xxx. CB rite? i'm not desperate to earn that few dollars, but because it was raining heavily, and she look to be in desperate need of a taxi, i obliged. talk about graciousness. not abnn hor, poolie, sgp chinese.</p>
              <p>it is ok to expect good service, but be nice in the first place and i dare say excellent service will be forthcoming. Will we even ask ourselves..do i deserve good service?</p>
