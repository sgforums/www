              <p>When in doubt of passenger's ability to pay for the fare, you could ask for proof of ability to pay before you allow the passenger to board your taxi. But you need to do it politely and tactfully.</p>

              <p>better not to accept hand phone. my friend's relief agreed to wait while the chick went up to take money after she agreed to leave her hp. never came back, never mind. went to report police taxi driver stole her hp summore. kena go police station. how to explain?</p>
              <p>lucky he dam experienced chap. recorded the conversation on his hp. got evidence. otherwise 99.999% treated as guilty.</p>
              <p>Home Team, how will you handle such cases? especially if the cabby doesn't have any video/audio recording and it's one person's word against the other. BUT the fact is...poor cabby IS holding onto the phone.</p>
              <p>i'd guess if really stuck wif the hp and pax never return, just bring to comfort (or any other cab co.) wif the receipt. let them handle it.</p>
              <p>occupational hazard lah. if pax run away without paying, not much we can do. run after them? report to the police? the opportunity cost is actually very much higher than a few measly bucks taxi fare. likely to take up 2 or 3 hours of your time going to the police. and there goes your earnings. is it worth it? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"></p>

              <p>As what Kelvin had said , not a bad idea to record those conversations , or even those images while we are conversing .....</p>
              <p>Anyway , we shall see case to case basis .....</p>
              <p>I really dun suggest we let go free ...... it's no good for the whole of the industry .</p>

              <p>1.Usually they will talk for a long time on the phone ... with nobody maybe , just to calm herself down .</p>
              <p>2.When they ran out of conversation on the phone , they will start chatting with cabbies .</p>
              <p>usually they first will ask how is business ?</p>
              <p>Maybe is to test and judge how far they can stretch those cabbies .</p>
              <p>......</p>
              <p>Finally how i deal with it .....</p>
              <p>I will changed my face expressions when they approach us about waiting .....</p>
              <p>They usually will say : " Don't worry , i will come back ."</p>
              <p>If they really say that , ask for assurance ..... dun let them go , test them : " Let me talk to your family ." See what they response .....</p>
              <p>if they responsed by saying house no people , this is a potential jalan taxi fare people .</p>
              <p>Ask for their NRIC ..... if they dun give , ask for Assistance from nearest police post .</p>

              <p>Cos CitiBank has got all her declining datas !!!!</p>
              <p>It is to justify i am a neat guy , making a neat report .</p>
              <p>I ask them to call the pax to collect the card .</p>
              <p>The pax returned .... without any money !</p>
              <p>She suggest i go to her friends place to take some money , her reason is her mum and family all at Tampines Mall , house no money .</p>
              <p>I did got all my money , for $28 .</p>
              <p>Imagine what will happen if i gave her Visa Card back ?</p>
              <p>Will she return with the money ?</p>
              <p>Nope , i doubt she will return .</p>
              <p>I can imagine , she was thinking how to deal with me as i am holding her Visa card ?</p>
              <p>I already anticipated that , that is why i call up Citibank , to protect myself .</p>
              <p>Yes , i make it very hard for her to execute her begining intentions .</p>
              <p>Lastly , i recall back .....</p>
              <p>I am in control of the whole situation ....... always must be in control , dun let them control you .</p>
              <p>Still simplest way to hold on with their NRIC ......</p>
              <p>If they genuine , they dun scared we take one .</p>

              <p><br>If the passenger simply tells you, he or she does not have the money to pay the fare, what will you do ?</p>
              <p>Drive the passenger to the police station to make a police report ?</p>
              <p>After the report is made and the passenger or the relative of the passenger brings the fare to pay back and request the report to be made null and void. The police is unlikely to press charges against the passenger especially if the fare is being paid back otherwise the police will be very busy to make all these non-paying fare charges.</p>
              <p>The policeman then called you and asked you to turn up at the police station to collect the fare.</p>
              <p>You have managed to collect the fare but what about the time spent to make the report and to return to collect the fare especially the fare is a few dollars.</p>
              <p>Of course, as a matter of principle and to shame the passenger, you can choose to do so.</p>
              <p>It is to be noted that taxi driver has no legal right to demand and retain the IC or credit card even if the passenger does not have the money to pay the fare. The passenger is not legally bound to hand over the IC or credit card or handphone to the taxi driver even if the passenger does not have the money to pay for the fare.</p>
              <p>If the taxi driver resorts to threat or physically snatch these items from the passenger, the taxi driver can be charged in court.</p>
              <p>So, currently it seems that the taxi driver is always at the losing end if the passenger does not have the money to pay for the fare.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>just forget it bro. Its of no use . I tried everything under the law but the law is not strong enuff.You must get the cheater particulars b4 you an try to report police . Otherwise the police will tell you you got no case . Even if you have the particulars the judge will help you get the money but to pursue the matter further you have to engage yr own lawyer to punish the cheater. This is how I experienced it bro . I am a working class citizen and got no time to spend money on this unnecessary thing . Better earn than to waste.</p></div>
