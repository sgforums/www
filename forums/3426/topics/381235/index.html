              <p>If your dad is a OMO ..... Wish pay good money to be an OMO , the best in the market , without being tied down by long contracts .</p>

              <p>Some are hard core , no way u can convince them to switch .</p>
              <p>Tell your dad , his next new vehicle still a Crown !!! KNN he will know la , but i heard rumour Sonata still in for another year for Comfort .</p>

              <p>usually just roam around streets looking for business. ( i asked him before )</p>
              <p>im sure my dad knows whats going on the market, as he have lots of other taxis bro outside. lol ! as for the next vehicle that he will be changing, no news yet. so dont know if its sonata or crown. and my dad likes bigger car, so sonata most probably he wont like, as he is quite tall. </p>
              <p>nope, no relief for my dad's crown, driving alone. and we stay on the central area, tpy. </p>

              <p>if ur dad is a Comfort hirer , he should know what is NCB and Free Rentals , TransCab gave whatever Comfort gave , and reverse , Comfort cannot give what TransCab can give , ie $716 each month .</p>
              <p>$716 , if u are not too calculative about CNG and petrol usage , and take it as cash $716 , it is about $76 rental only ....</p>
              <p>$100 x 30 = $3000</p>
              <p>$3000 - $716 = $2284</p>
              <p>$2284 divide by 30 days = $76 .</p>
              <p>If Comfort can tell their hirer : " We got call ma , 1 day guaratee 3 calls ."</p>
              <p>If one call the revenue is $3 before GST , to get $716 of calls , comfort must give their hirers 238 calls per month , and that is solid peak hour call .</p>
              <p>If non peak , $2.50 , revenue $2 , Comfort must give you 358 bookings each month .</p>
              <p>We take average , Comfort must give 298 calls per month to their hirer if they want to fulfill that same $716 revenue for cabbies .</p>
              <p>Per day , Comfort must swee swee give the drivers concern , 10 bookings each day , everyday .</p>
              <p>Which hirers here got 10 calls everyday , smooth smooth ?</p>
              <p>And if Comfort did their part ...... swee swee as promised 300 bookings for you , at the end of the month , u need to return them $120 for CabLink Adminstration Fee average @ $0.40 per bookings .</p>
              <p>There u go , $120 x 12 months = $1440 .</p>
              <p>Hey , wasn't that ur Yearly benefit ???? of $1200 ??????</p>
              <p>Now u know why i left Comfort ? And many left Comfort like me ? And more will leave Comfort ?</p>
              <p>Many hardCores will still stay at Comfort .</p>
              <p>I still finding out why ? </p>

              <p>My cost for fuel is about ... take $30 .</p>

              <p>It's a joke that day Ah Lam told me one SMRT Azera driver drove $600 collection in 18 hours ???</p>
              <p>On a weekday ?</p>
              <p>Let me tell u this ... whatever luck u can have , $22 per hour <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>average</strong></span> collection is maximum one can get .</p>
              <p>Well he start at 6am , ended at 12am ...... $33 per hours consistently ?</p>
              <p>Maybe he should say 600km maybe , reasonable . Earning about $400 okay reasonable .</p>
              <p>But die very soon to drive 18 hours a day , 365 days .</p>

              <p>According to the Singapore Safety Driving Council Officer ( Defensive driving ) when i took my taxi course , 14 hours is the maximum duration a driver can drive <span style="text-decoration: underline;">continuously</span> , and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">safely</span> on the road .</p>
              <p>Anything above that , is consider a hazard on the road .</p>
              <p>Til today , i strongly believe that duration .</p>
              <p>Anyway , i drive no way near that 14 hours mark .</p>
