              <div>Dear Presca</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>May I know what warning and disciplinary action is taken? Can you be more 
              specific? In my opinion this bus captain should be taken off the road. Do you 
              know if I am not alert and how bad the consequences will be? He is driving a 
              vehicle several times the size of mine. A collision of this scale might result 
              in some form of disabilities or even death. And not to mention the bus is fully 
              loaded at that time due to peak hours and what will happen to the commuters on 
              the bus?</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>No monetary punishment is suffice because I view this matter very 
              seriously. I think with the character of this bus captain and his style of 
              driving without and regards of other road users and his recklessness I think he 
              should be removed from the job.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Please let me know in detail what is the action taken and I shall see 
              whether it is appropriate.  If not I will not hesitate to escalate the matter to 
              your higher management and other relevant ministries and authorities. Thank

              <p><br>I think we hv to look in 2 views, the hardway or the leniency views.</p>
              <p>The hardway is that we think of the particular driver, if he didn't repent and still drive recklessly, then it will be a danger to the public.</p>
              <p>The lenient way is more on compassionate view, lost of jobs, lost of income, family sad, driver not even given a chance to prove himself that he really repented and take his mistakes as a strong learning curve of life.</p>
              <p>Both are right, but of course, within both of end of this extreme, lies the middle solution. And in my personal opinon, this middle solution should end up with a win win situation, that is the public will be safe and he drive more carefully, and that our Hammerhammer will cool down and life goes on.</p>
              <p>Now in every day of our life, be it football, some traffic offences, some poor working attitude or disciplinary problem, there is a room for 2nd chance, from yellow card to warning letters to suspension, we as human, unlike computer that have no feeling for anything, need to allow people a chance to improve himself.</p>
              <p>Day in and day out, as a TD, if you said you never get fined or booked, then I would say, you are not a Taxi driver, because like it or not, you are bound by all these rules and regulation, cat and mouse game from parking to Q to speeding to red light to bus lanes or change shift to cut lanes, we are sure to get some lesson out of it, either summon or deposit gone.</p>
              <p>And then, we learned and strive on, drive on and know how to evade this and that which sown experiences, but we are still given a chance to drive on until of course kenna red card then no choice, but even red card is only a suspension, we still can come back and drive on.</p>
              <p>I know that I write alot, but base on all the above, you decide, as judge, not as a prosecutor which is our bro HH, or the defendent, the bus driver. In a neutral thinking, do you think this bus driver deserve a 2nd chance (yellow card) or a straight out of job (sacked).</p>
