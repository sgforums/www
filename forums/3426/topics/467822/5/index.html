              <p>Very true, lucky HH used commonsense and let the bus pass. There is no such thing as 100% win case (got some some but very very very rare, that also for very serious injury or death) in court case involving traffic accident claims.</p>
              <p>Just say for eg: the judge rule that HH had the chance to slow down and wait, or by way of actions suspected the bus would pull a stunt - which has a point, buses go 1 route unlike us, we can switch lanes and roads, buses must ply the same route, he cannot turn left. And because he didn't allow it and stood his ground, his passenger got an injury which could be avoided, or somebody in the bus also suffered.</p>
              <p>Like that can be bus driver 85% fault HH 15%, the victims claim from HH or his insurance company, who loses out? HH still yes or no? $2140 fly away bye bye, cannot claim from bus insurance, if can also Transcab sapu first.</p>
              <p>If you can avoid an accident, you must, that is the golden rule, no such thing as you hv right of way, who in the right or wrong. You hv a duty to avoid an accident where possible.</p>
              <p>In simple terms, no injury accident, langgar backside, that one all ok can settle swee swee, insurance can claim, damages can be repaired and reimbursed, but when there is an injury or death, then things are not easy to resolve.</p>

              <p>But CDG accident department steady. As long as got video proof you stop liao people kiss you and you kiss in front bo tai chi. The only take longer time to process your loss of income, 3 months like that, but no need pay any excess as it is a good case. They only need to verify all the statement of all parties involve then they will pay you the loss of income. This one I kanna before while I driving white for them.</p>

              just a few days back,(daytime) i was on the same turning lane &amp; there's a bus in front of 
              
              me and this bus driver also committed  this reckless driving act of driving straight thru' .
              
              luckily no vehicle on the next lane intends to turn left.
              
              my reaction when i saw tis was "walao-eh, ah ni kuan poon aye sai"
              
              hammerhammer, if u want to give all tis bus driver jilat jilat, there's one thing u can do.
              
              Mount n conceal a video cam just b4 traffic light to capture their act, do it for a whole day &amp; u probably see those same driver making the same mistake.
              
              Then sent it to Lta , bus company, news paper , stomp  etc
