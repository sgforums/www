              <p>The basic rule is must signal more then 3 seconds before your
              intention to switch lane or turning. Not suka suka signal liao can
              switch lane. But the problem is here when you signal people dun
              want to give way. So lan lan loh. See who right of way. Simple. The
              bus last min signal I dun give way nothing wrong.</p>
              <p>But the root of all these problem is the BUS LANE....it is drawn
              too close to the stupid junction. Same at the junction of the old
              fire station opposite Funan Centre. When want to turn left also got
              BUS LANE all the way until the junction.</p>
              <p>How come cannot draw -------- BUS LANE when the junction is very
              close to each other. One good example is Bukit Timah Road from
              Mckenzie Road junction to Cavenaugh Road junction opposite KKH. The
              BUS LANE is ------- all the way despite a bus stop in the middle.
              At least we can slowly follow the bus if we want to turn left into
              Istana. Dun tell me that strech of road not jam during peak
              hour?</p>

              <p>Initially I slow down just before the yellow box when he signal as behind no car, but after a while he dun seem like accelerating and so I thought he want to filter in behind me because as I said behind no car. But I think when we approach the junction the bus infront slow down because in front of the bus got a car turning left slow down then I also slow down. Maybe that's why he cannot filter in liao so suddenly change his mind and make a dash.</p>
              <p>That's why you see when he cheong straight pass me that time the right signal is already gone. So that means he filter right halfway when turning his steering right then last min straighten his steering so the signal is cancel...make sense?</p>

              <p>Since you said bus lane is the issue, and I don't see a reason

              then. From what I've said, the signal part(I didn't hear it on
              video), and I believe LTA goes by evidence(so that they will solve
              the issue), so my views is still you didn't signal, not because I'm

              <p>Stop being an asshole trying to cover up for SBS Transit or whatsoever. Even if taxi driver so happen to ignore the yellow box, the driver still used the wrong lane and didn't slow down. Why didn't you even say that along? </p>

              <p>See properly initially I give way he dun want so I speed up loh...So many times I use the junction the bus captain all give way and form up behind me if there is no car. But of cause if got car then I block the car and let the bus filter in from the front so I can filter to the left because usually there is no car due to the red bus lane. Even red light I also can turn because got left turn green arrow. I use the junction every day same time for years so I know the "law" there. But today the bus captain gila...maybe he is new I dunno. He still insist he is not wrong he can go straight and still challenge me to a fight after we stop at the junction in front...KNN</p>

              <p>Yellow box cannot be ignored. I learn it the hard way after an accident with an SBS bus 2 years ago...So yellow box no matter SMLJ situation when stationary must give way to any vehicle. Even front move off liao you also lan lan must give way. Because yellow box really is TUA KEE....Lol</p>

              <p>Like what others said, at yellow box, stationary must give way.</p>
              <p>But now both the vehicles are in motion. You can't expect the car driver to stop just because of 1 bus turning? It would also affect the rest. Even if the bus driver needs the 2nd lane, he have the right to wait and turn? Afterall, he's in the bus lane/bus stop still and there's a yellow box. </p>
              <p>If the car drivers behind horned the bus driver, the bus driver is still right what? He's following law, and this is a shared lane(there's still bus lane marking).</p>

              just move off... you can still slow down cos it's low gear, heavy engine brake... which is why ppl say never go heavy on acceleration...
              
              if this kind of freak incident happen, can still siam... and this kind of yellow boxes are literally traps... it's bus stop or filter lane yellow boxes [more applicable in Hong Kong].. 
              
              cos before moving off, you gotta check what's going on, esp on the left... in most cases...

              <p>Afterall, it's still a bus lane and the lane is for bus to stop(due to a bus stop). I don't think it's road hogging just to stop there and waiting to turn, since the front already stated for turning ONLY.</p>
