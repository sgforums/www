              <p>I lke the term in general, because everywhere in whatever industry, you will always find the very good, the outstanding, the very bad and the downright awful. That is true with Taxi drivers here in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, what we usually see reported are the very bad cases, sometimes even the really awful ones, whereas the very good and outstanding are less likely to be reported.</p>
              <p>Most good drivers or good people, find it their automatic duty to do good and would feel embarrassed if they are highlighted. Good people normally don't need to be rewarded for doing good deeds. I'm not saying that those who are highlighted are doing a disservice, they deserve to, but I think all of them would rather not be mentioned unless by doing so, it can spread a message or improve a cause.</p>
              <p>For me I thinkt he best way to judge taxi-drivers in general is to look at a few factors:</p>
              <p>a) The past</p>
              <p>b) Comparison with other countries</p>
              <p>c) Society in Singapore today</p>
              <p>d) Finally, drivers themselves.</p>
              <p>A) The past, those who had the 'mis-fortune' of experiencing pirate taxis in days gone by, would immediately tell you, how much we moved on today. Or even drivers from yesteryear, who how shall I put it as ' were not given the tools to improve service standards'.</p>
              <p>In this aspect, taxi-drivers in 2012 Singapore can be easily said to be much better than those from say 20,25, 30 years or more before.</p>
              <p>B) Other countries.</p>
              <p>It's also very hard and I think pointless to compare taxi drivers in other countries to Singapore, but inevitably that's always the case that always get mentioned.</p>
              <p>Generally speaking in countries where the taxi industry isn't policed well, you get a lot of complaints, even crimes committed by drivers. In countries where it's policed well, you'll find they are better maybe in service standards than us, but the price to pay for that is much greater - literally. In Australia and the UK for instance, the taxi license is extremely hard to get and closely monitored, but fares are easily 4-5x or more than it is here.</p>
              <p>So in effect, you get a sub-culture, mini-cabs and the like in the UK and Australia which isn't policed as much. They would be the better comparison to drivers here. I think you'll find this sub-gruops, fares are still more expensive than us, and service standards rarely higher than us.</p>
              <p>Simply put, the higher the fares are, the better the service gets. If you pay $70 for a basic fare here like you would in Tokyo or elsewhere., I can gurantee that the service would be outstanding 90% of the time.</p>
              <p>Fares here are lower, but generally speaking, for getting from point A to B, the basic service standards by the vast majority here meets the requirements. So long as your driver gets you there in the most obvious route, which is the norm, I think you'll find we meet up to that.</p>

              <p>C) Society in Singapore today</p>
              <p><br>Society today is much more educated and savvy than at any time in the past. However, just as in the past, they always seem to be in a hurry. Well that's the norm in any major bustling city.</p>
              <p><br>As such, they are more demanding and also most knowledgeable of their rights in regards to service standards. This cuts both ways, on the 1 hand, it compels the modern driver to ensure good service because of customer knowledge and the avenues available for complaints, it also on the other hand, makes them to go beyond what can be reasonably be expected.</p>
              <p><br>Eg: Traffic conditions are worse today before, so drivers may arrive late or get stuck in jams, through no fault of their, yet they bear the brunt of customer dissatisfaction.<br>Many newer roads, routes and buildings are built, and drivers take time to cope with these changes, but are deemed expected to know all of these, with the availability of technology cited as a reason. But technology however helpful, and it is, can never replace the true situation on the ground.</p>
              <p><br>It's also not helpful, that rules are made in such a way not to solve issues but rather to punish offenders. It's correct that certain rules must be mandatory for certain offences, but other rules rules need more to encourage and help first, and punish last.</p>
              <p><br>Eg: The rules of picking up at designated stands in the city. Stands come with barely room for 1-4 taxis to wait, some totally don't allow to one to wait, yet there is a long queue of passengers. A driver is left in a conundrum. Wait and he is booked, don't stop, and he's accused of not wanting to pick up fares?</p>
              <p><br>A driver who drives alone, is never allowed to put changing shift to hisdestination and is not allowed to ask passengers their destination. Drivers who have other matters, be it personal or professional (a later pick up) are similarly not allowed to 'interview' passengers for their destination. This doesn't help, because passengers will still not be picked up, which would not have been so, if he could do so, that way at least a portion of the passenger back-log or waiting time would be cut.<br>But that's how society and the rules that are in play, forces drivers to take measures deemed unfair.</p>

              <p>D) Drivers</p>
              <p>Despite the number of complaints, I think it's fair to say, most (well over 90% in my opinion), are as the TS said - generally positive in ALL aspects.</p>
              <p>To begin with, drivers are better educated. Drivers undergo mandatory courses that teach basic rules, not just operational laws, but things like service and road knowledge.</p>
              <p>More and more drivers are using technology to help them serve customers better.</p>
              <p>Most drivers are polite. Even those who are slow to return a greeting or appear unfriendly, do not end up being rude - they will still send to your destination in the best route available in the conditions, just that they maybe silent or not go the extra mile.</p>
              <p>But not going the extra mile should never be taken a wrong or as a right every paying should expect. The bottom line, is that you pay for the service of transportation, if that service is provided adequately whatever is not given in excess, should not be seen in a bad light.</p>
              <p>Many drivers drive long hours, are troubled by cash flow needs and sometimes in all of this, extra service is not rendered. Drving continously day after day, is not easy, and can easily wear the body down, yet most drivers still provide a reasonable level of service and are polite.</p>
              <p>The point to note, is that all taxi drivers also are passengers themselves when they are not driving. Most of us, seldom have anything bad to say about other drivers and feel the level of service provided meets and even exceeds the minimum requirement - ferrying you from point A to B.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Well that's some of the factors, and there are many more I'm sure.  Just because taxi drivers don't blow their own trumpets doesn't mean they are all black sheep or should be seen in a negative light.</p>
              <p>The silent majority are the ones that really reflects on the overall picture, and the absence of complaints against them, is far more telling than those against a minority of them.</p>

              <p>I think the Taxi Drivers in SIngapore are truly magnificent. In courtesy, they are number one. When you board their taxi, they ask you "Where would you like to go?" (with a smile).</p>
              <p>They are knowledgeable on the roads, knowing where the traffic jams are, and suggesting alternative routes, and will only execute when you give the approval.</p>
              <p>They are hardworking, I believe most of them work more than 12 hours everyday. And they always go for courses in Service Excellence.</p>
              <p>Taking a Taxi in Singapore is really a great experience.</p>

              <p>Well , i thought Singaporean's nature is never rude ? Unless provoke ?</p>
              <p>That to me applies to not only cabbies , to all local people , right ?</p>
              <p>So i think generally , local cabbies are quiet type , work more talk less type , they are more possessed in thinking how to make quicker money .</p>
              <p>And i thought singapore cabbies can get familiarised with routes once they are on the job for more than 3 months .</p>
              <p>Cos Singapore is such a small city .</p>
              <p>Due to the simple fact , from Point A to Point B , never will be more than 1 hours if no congestion , there is nothing much to dispute about taxi in Singapore .</p>
              <p>U take , u pay . U take i despatch , meter fare u pay , simple business .</p>

              <p>As for Good Service .... same story from me .</p>
              <p>U pay peanuts , u get monkeys .</p>
              <p>Singapore taxi fare are far far to low compared to any First World City like New York , London , Paris etc ....</p>
              <p>U put me into Tokyo , i'll treat you with red carpets .</p>
              <p>Bow .</p>
              <p>Irashi Ma Say ..... Konichiwa , etc .... it's worth it providing Super service .</p>
              <p>With Singapore's rising cost , rise in standard of living , rise in oil .... it makes wages earned from taxi driving even lower .</p>
