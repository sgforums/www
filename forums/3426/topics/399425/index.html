              <p>Singapore is a democratic country. Government has spent lot of resources seeking views and consult pple on certain policy.</p>
              <p>As such, may I suggest that, since so many pple are against extra surcharges, to remove the $3 surcharge on the Marina Bay sand.</p>
              <p>For wad I can see, it is only during Mon-Sat 5-8pm that there will be little taxi queuing at the Marina Casino. Have u guys see the midnight taxi crowd? Tons of taxi around.</p>
              <p>So I say the surcharge should go. These pple has more than enough money to give to the casino operator and indirectly government revenue. As such, they should not spend more as it is already.</p>
              <p>Remove $3 on Marina Bay sand pls!!!!!</p>

              <p><br>Well, the govt and IR operators want to have ample supply of taxis within their taxis stand... (24 hours)</p>
              <p>It may (in the begining) chase away some passengers as the $3 location surcharge is a turn-off... but.. I reckon what is the $3 additional compared to all gamblers waived so much $$ on the gambling tables...</p>
              <p>Let those Pax go (can't afford the surcharges).... Just like those who walked to the Main Rd of Upper Changi Road East at Singapore Expo Hall One to flag a cab rather than taking one from taxi stand that cost $2 more....</p>
              <p>The authority wants to promote the IRs to the world, which also means ample supply of taxis w/o waiting too long to leave the premises.  ( World class IR - No taxis - funny right ? )</p>
              <p>Therefore, we, Singaporeans(cabbies or passengers), like it or not... can only adopt to the changes... not the other way round...</p>
              <p>Really nothing much  we can do about --- besides complaint, complaint &amp; complaints...  You want better actions...write to ST Forums... may have "some" replies.. but they will be similar to the one you are reading now......</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">BUT...</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Govt</span></strong> best &amp; often respond to complaints..... ( <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">KEEP QUIET</span></strong> )... lol</p>

              <p>yes this is the most effective way to solve this situation. Pax will no longer be entitled to cheapo fares in the outskirts , TD also wont be so tulan to kena far away places as outskirt pax will also pay the same rate.</p>
              <p>everywhere around the island , there will be taxis coz the fare will all be the same. simple things like this they cannot think ... haizzzzzz those scholars. i think we should recommend our very own phd cabby into their ranks la.</p>

              <p>This is my analysis of the fare structure.</p>
              <p>1. Assume we remove all extras and leave only a standard fare like what other countries do. Now if the minimum fare for Cedrics and Crowns is $5.00, then Chrysler starting fare must go up proportionally. If this happens, heartland passengers will kenna screw because suddenly it becomes more expensive to do HDB town transfers, or even short hops.</p>
              <p>2. CBD surcharges do not affect most people because most office workers can claim taxi fare if got overtime. Those CBD workers who cannot claim taxi fare usually will not bother with cabs at all, unless it is those "uncle 4 stops please (MPV 7 stops)" kind of pax. For those people who complain about expensive taxi fare, I really wish to see how often they take taxis. They complain so much but only take taxis once in a blue moon. If the CBD surchare was removed, the end result will be that CBD workers will not have any taxis during ERP operational hours. All the taxis will suddenly have no incentive to come into town during peak hours. Now the town passengers kenna screw.</p>
              <p>3. If we remove $3 MBS surcharge, it will be fine even if we got a flat fare taxi structure. But bear in mind the 2 problems above.</p>
              <p>4. If we remove $3 RWS surcharge, the gamblers there may have to call taxi because taxi uncles will PNG from Vivo, Harbourfront and St James. In the end, solve one problem, create another problem. We call that lampa pa lan.</p>
              <p>5. If we have a flat fare structure, I believe all extras must be removed, including airport, expo, seletar, 50% midnight and 35% peak hour. Otherwise what justification is there to jack up starting fare from 2.80 to 5.00 ? If that happens, there will be very few taxi drivers in airport, seletar, expo. After midnight, taxi uncles might as well go home and sleep unless they want to chiong SATS vouchers. Peak hours might as well go lim kopi to avoid jams. In the end, heartland and town passengers kenna screw again.</p>
              <p>6. So in the end, do you think Raymond Lim or Gerard Ee will agree to a flat fare structure? Based on my analysis, they will face a massive public protest if they give green light. So like it or not, this taxi fare structure is here to stay. Uniquely Singapore!</p>
