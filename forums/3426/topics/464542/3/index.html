              <p>Hi bowah, my situation is pretty similar to Poolman. Being business for almost 15+ years and now cannot possibly go into emplyee state as salary will be merely $1500 to $2000. Age wise also pretty similar to Poolman. Most important, I am not the person to work for a boss. It is pretty a straight forward concept of my principal all these 15 years i.e. how much you want to enjoy depend on how much effort you place in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have tried property, insurance before Nd mowsday, Govt always want to chap ji ka and makes life difficult to living being. I may have some other lobang too currently but time are very flexible. Instead of kiao ka at home during free time might else well do something meaningful. My youngest is only 3 yo and i cant afford to stop dreaming but action. That's why I have choose TD. </p>

              <p>So, in another words, TD was once your contingent plan that is going to be realised soon.</p>
              <p>I would say that TD does not imply that there is no boss, but just that the boss keep changing. At a state of 1.5 to 2k income, it is wise to drive taxi better, nevertheless, if given options, there are better jobs that you can undertake provided you are able to change to adapt and evolve, in long run, its certainly pays better than a TD, I have to be blunt here as a TD myself.</p>
              <p>However, the choice is alway up to the individual, you can alway take up some courses, go thru those train and place program that might ultimately put you in a better position against a vicious society we are facing.</p>
              <p>Of course working, in the begining will start at 2k or 1.6k, with all benefits, CPF and bonuses, but in a long run, you move up, become the supervisor or head and that can stablise you income better.</p>
              <p>For taxi driver, no doubt you get cold hard cash upfront which is more than a beginner in whatever structured jobs. But in a long run, it remain stagnate, fares increase will be cut off by rental and fuel increases, long and irregulars hours of working, and you still have to abide to LTA and companies rules and policies, any violation could take you a day or a week income off the mark....meaning drive for free.</p>
              <p>If you ask me, I can tell you that 90% of those old birds or so called lau jiaos including me, the lau lan jiao, would said that if you are still young, try not to drive taxis, unless you are something like an education of Sex 2 like me. Only that 10% who cannot or do not want ot lose face will tell you, ok lah, drive taxis ok mah. But then, deep inside all these lao jiao, if given a chance to go back to our 30s, we would had choosen some other jobs, even a storemen would had become a supervisor by now. 5 days works, 3 months bonuses, AWS, CPF, 21 days leaves, and so on.</p>

              <p>Let look into a job call, Marine worker, since I am also a kind of hokkien fitter in marine. But I am too old for it.</p>
              <p>The initial start is to apply for a Marine trade with Learning Hub at Benoi road, former Hitachi cable, just next to Joon Koon Mrt. Training inside on all kinds of marine trade for 6 months at a pay of 1.5k. Thereafter, 3 months at shipyards at 1.8k, after 9 months you get yr Nitec Cert in marine trade, then you can go on to take a year on marine trade diploma fully sponsor with your paid of 1.8k intact, after that, you will be come an enginneer, drawing a paid of 2.5k to 2.8k and so on, that takes only less than 2 years, thereafter you progress with the yards like keppel, sembawang or jurong or ST marine or keppel fel.</p>
              <p>And let me tell you their bonuses for the last 5 years consistently, minimum 8 months, max 10 months. So if you paid is 3k....</p>

                              <p>Hi all, I am a newbie wanna be TD.</p>
              <p>Was reading through the forum and yes, you guys rock! Lots of
              information and it help to prepare those who really seriously have
              no idea how or what to anticipate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I was reading and picking up alot of information here, I
              noticed some of the information are pretty quite sometime back.</p>
              <p>These are few updates I wish I can get some lights to it though
              there maybe answer in the forum which is quite sometime back and in
              general discussion which is . So, I hope this will show a clearer
              picture to where I can begin the next phase in this TD journey.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ques: So far realise the CDG is good as their largest company
              and support etc. SMRT and Transcab comes into the picture as next
              choice. Honestly, for a newbie which is more ideal in the learning
              aspect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ques: I understand most recent medical examination and x-ray
              before going for the STA course, it is priced around $30+ posted
              sometime last year. Any idea if the price still remain or has
              increased? I am thinking to go SATA or any recommendation coz, I
              hope to get the X-ray and medical report result quickly so I can
              quickly book the course dates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ques: I have called all the 3 training centre and their next
              available date of training for Express aka Full-Time is 18 Feb
              2013. And from what I have read, there are 3 training centre. STA,
              SMRT and CDG. Which one do you prefer or recommend?</p>

              Hi TS, 
              
              my personal experience is learn to sweep the floor and find ur personal favourite taxi stand n sweeping ground â€¦ focus on that first â€¦ calls dun take first till u familiar with routes n buildings. Cdg got more calls compared to other taxi company but forget abt this first â€¦ sweep! If no calls u can sweep, won't die. Btw most good drivers no take call and their income also good or better than those took calls â€¦
              
              Another is speed â€¦ I'm a slow driver so I lose out to driver who drive fast n steady â€¦ simple math, I go 90km/h another go 100km/h, I do 10 trips, he extra me 1more trip or so â€¦ maybe explanation no good but something liked quickly drop pax n get connected fast â€¦ 
              
              I went STA Cox dun wan to be hard sell by anyone â€¦ hehhee

              <p>Let look into a job call, Marine worker, since I am also a kind
              of hokkien fitter in marine. But I am too old for it.</p>
              <p>The initial start is to apply for a Marine trade with Learning
              Hub at Benoi road, former Hitachi cable, just next to Joon Koon
              Mrt. Training inside on all kinds of marine trade for 6 months at a
              pay of 1.5k. Thereafter, 3 months at shipyards at 1.8k, after 9
              months you get yr Nitec Cert in marine trade, then you can go on to
              take a year on marine trade diploma fully sponsor with your paid of
              1.8k intact, after that, you will be come an enginneer, drawing a
              paid of 2.5k to 2.8k and so on, that takes only less than 2 years,
              thereafter you progress with the yards like keppel, sembawang or
              jurong or ST marine or keppel fel.</p>
              <p>And let me tell you their bonuses for the last 5 years
              consistently, minimum 8 months, max 10 months. So if you paid is
              3k....</p>

              <p>Hi Poolman, thanks for the rename. You guys rock! This place is kept tidy for the hard work despite of the work TD need to commit in.</p>
              <p>I have began to feel the tense of TD lifestyle. Especially reading what StriveOn Journey, Koon Blog and evaluating some or the possibilities. I told myself, I have not read through enough in this place and shall continue reading as much as possible to absorb more info while waiting for my course to start.</p>
              <p>I sincerely thank LV22 also for offering his help. Really appreciate despite he was not feeling well. Hope you recover soon brother. Take care! In the meantime, I am pretty free and if your health gets better, I am available day time to coffee and exchange some info, if you can.</p>
              <p>I am so grateful all other bro and members here has contributed valuable information and details of how a newbie can start off with this career. Indeed, it is an eye-opener for me to learn these, otherwise I will surely bang corner and walls till bleeding blood, vomit shit to get this info in a longer time frame than what has being shared here.</p>
              <p>As the process of the TD life is taking me quite a while to it, I bet this post is not really needed to be updated until I have attended the course and complete course. In the meantime, I am still contemplating with the choice of TC to choose though I have signed up for SMRT which is likely my choice to go for.</p>
              <p>I hope I have not created a nuisance to repeating posting from a newbie aspect. If so, my apologies. Otherwise, pls accept my gratitude and thanks to your assistance and advice.</p>

              <p>Hi everyone, it has being a long time haven't being login to the coolest place for chat.</p>
              <p>Firstly, Gong Xi Fa Cai - Friday $10M TOTO.... Huat Ah!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have started my TVDL course yesterday at SMRT - Woodlands and it feel like going back to school after so many donkey years of lag. The experience makes me feel as if taking a Degree course... Hahaha :) - till now, having complete the Module 1, I have felt the tense of the rest :p</p>
              <p>i guess it is not nice to mention who is the trainer. But one thing for sure - can really feel the TD life is not easy and takes a lot of patience, courage, efforts and many other importance factor to sustain. Importantly, all TD need to watch out their productivity ($ in pocket), watch out for "Uncle Sam" (avoiding demerit point), maintain calm and handle all kind of pax and road user from complaining etc....</p>
              <p>I assume there are lots of "Blog" in here describing how their TD lifestyle changes and individual experience. I guess I need not to describe what I have gone through. Perhaps, a little social networking to make friends rather than describing my itinerary.</p>
              <p>Hopefully I could get through the test and pass in one single attempt though I may not be borne to be that lucky... Hahaha... Hope I am not sounding to you I am that negative type but least, I don't wish to be over confidence.</p>

              tat day overtaken by other cabs ,,, pax beh song say â€� bro, I tot this type taxi can go very fast one? You look so young,, just drive taxi ar?â€� I hv a standard answer prepared for tat lahâ€¦
              
              And then the new I40 looks nimble, tat day saw one yellow near Vivo overtook alot other cabs including sonatas, epicas.  I heard some TDs toggle the manual gear to get extra acceleration when need,,, but this will make gearbox spoil faster...
