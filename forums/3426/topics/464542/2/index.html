              <p>Oh btw, I noticed that CDG charge $345 for the course, SMRT
                  $362.50 and STA $365. (Including Material, Test Fees and Admin
                  fee).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for SATA, X-ray result will take 3 working days before I can
                  go to any training centre to sign up for the course. SATA do offer
                  Express service at $20 to get the X-Ray on next working day.</p>

              <p>Thank you Ah Guan Bro. Your post came at 6 plus which I had already gone for SATA screening. Cost me $37.45 + $19.27(For express service of X-ray report).</p>
              <p>Otherwise, I don't mind go down to East side to save up the difference. Haiz...</p>

              <p>Since I am staying in the West side, I will go SMRT @ Woodlands to sign up the course although the price is $362.50. Difference by $17.50. I treat this saving as the transport distance if were to be at Comfort or STA.</p>
              <p>Anyway, as per the senior TD here. Study the course anywhere first and decide which TC to join later.</p>
              <p>Currently, I am still not deciding which TC to go for. But have shortlisted CDG and SMRT so far. Wonder if any input opinion from any?</p>
              <p>During my health screening, I met an uncle (retiree Taxi driver). He actually shared about the deposit of $1000. In the event of accident, this $1000 is confiscated no matter if you are in the right or wrong.</p>
              <p>Is this true? Pls advice. TQ TQ TQ VVVVVV Much........ Arigato.!</p>

              <p>Hahaha.. so much warning on SMRT. Mr Pool hate them very much because MRT always pi cha lobang and always MRT track/train breakdown. :)</p>
              <p>Anyway, I will take note of their hard skill. I am currently contemplating the different cab available. In the meantime, while registering and getting through the course, I am sourcing for the type of car to drive, pre-requisite got to be rental low, newer series model (not crown definitely), can save fc(but not priorty. I sound silly though knowing where got such good lobang. Ma chiam - Ai Qi Ai Pi, Tua Liap Ni. Hahaha</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, my priorty utmost concern is attend the course at the soonest date and get it pass in one attempt, if possible. Time is money... I don't want to waste time in un-necessary stuff. </p>

              <p>Although I stay at West side. But the overall travelling distance and time from home to training centre, Woodland is the nearest.</p>
              <p>I have heard all and will becareful of SMRT hard selling. My main concern is to quickly get to the course and TVL. Coz I don't like wasting time on things otherwise, I might sit on it for a long period. Also, I can't afford to waste anymore time since I have decided to go into TD.</p>
              <p>PS: I am not the Gan Jiong type but don't want to waste time in things I decided to do. Cheers :)</p>

              <p>Hi bowah, my situation is pretty similar to Poolman. Being business for almost 15+ years and now cannot possibly go into emplyee state as salary will be merely $1500 to $2000. Age wise also pretty similar to Poolman. Most important, I am not the person to work for a boss. It is pretty a straight forward concept of my principal all these 15 years i.e. how much you want to enjoy depend on how much effort you place in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have tried property, insurance before Nd mowsday, Govt always want to chap ji ka and makes life difficult to living being. I may have some other lobang too currently but time are very flexible. Instead of kiao ka at home during free time might else well do something meaningful. My youngest is only 3 yo and i cant afford to stop dreaming but action. That's why I have choose TD. </p>
