              <p>First of all i'm not siding anyone in this matter. Just refering to what i was taught in TDVL, only 3mths+ since pass so still can remember ah.</p>
              <p>Instructor told me about this type of case before, technically even if u waiting for someone, engine running hazard lights on and you in vehicle, vehicle not in motion considered parking.</p>
              <p>Since you not moving with the taxi queue and waiting for your booking pax, it's considered parking. That is why officer initially say "you cannot park here"</p>
              <p>When officer ask u move on, he actually give chance so that u move with the taxi queue so look like not parking, so hopefully before u reach front of queue your pax come down liao. My guess is cameras are watching.</p>
              <p>The rules stupid actually, but sometimes have to give face to those LTA guys. They in uniform so public constantly watching and with so many cameras around now, even their boss are watching sometimes.</p>
              <p>I got friends in LTA and Traffic Police sometimes talk to them pity them also, they sometimes have to do things just so "people" can see they doing something.</p>
