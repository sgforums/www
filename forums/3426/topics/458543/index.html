              Ya lor normally people won't do that out of the blue, unless you did something earlier to offend him without knowing, sometimes as TD we too busy talking to passenger we might cut into people's lane without realizing.
              Sometimes finger show change shift sign to pax other drivers might think we gave them middle finger.

              <p>ts this is my opinion, a few possibilities:</p>
              <p>first) you might have done something to that driver that he mistook you as an insult or challenge. there was one time i was on ecp and i realise i might be late so i step on the gas, the engine start to roar and the car accelerate. but suddenly another car next to me engine also roar and start to accelerate like trying to outrun me. then i realise he think i am challenging him to a race! so i quickly let go gas and let him run far far. then he roar the engine a few more times like he think he won and flew off!.. or maybe earlier you block him at some corner turn or traffic light so he want to show you he can block you screw with you anytime in his supercar, its whether he wants to or not.</p>
              <p>second) i know some drivers in their supercars they see other modified cars no up. they think you buy cheap car trying to make into expensive. but they are pure breed expensive car. so they want to show you no matter how much more you spend modify, they can still outrun you. they want to make you go back to that feeling cheap.</p>
              <p>third) they have a bad experience with another car like your model or looks like your plate number, so they want to take revenge. even if wrong car, they also feel shiok. becos they feel they miss that chance last time, this time they want to make you pay..even if you are different. but to them, same car different driver is good enough for some fun!</p>
              <p>four) just like that Ferrari Taxi case. sometimes the driver is trying to impress show off to some friends, especially one or two new girls, that he can play around in his supercar. this happen to me before also. one time at telok blangah, this small but stylish convertible that suppose to sit only 2.. inside seated 2 guys..then on top them sit 2 more long hair girls! so total 4 pax in a very small open car. and they play loud music and laughing and pushing around inside the car. can tell the cars around them all quite worry if that driver can actually see the road around them, but that driver dont care, he just drive any lane anytime he like, zip here zip there. so end up more and more cars drive slower jam behind that single convertible car, but i think that made the driver and his friend and 2 girls even more shiok becos they think people envy them, when actually they are blocking everyone, but no one can do anything about it until they turn off later.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Life is like that.</p>
