              <p>ts this is my opinion, a few possibilities:</p>
              <p>first) you might have done something to that driver that he
              mistook you as an insult or challenge. there was one time i was on
              ecp and i realise i might be late so i step on the gas, the engine
              start to roar and the car accelerate. but suddenly another car next
              to me engine also roar and start to accelerate like trying to
              outrun me. then i realise he think i am challenging him to a race!
              so i quickly let go gas and let him run far far. then he roar the
              engine a few more times like he think he won and flew off!.. or
              maybe earlier you block him at some corner turn or traffic light so
              he want to show you he can block you screw with you anytime in his
              supercar, its whether he wants to or not.</p>
              <p>second) i know some drivers in their supercars they see other
              modified cars no up. they think you buy cheap car trying to make
              into expensive. but they are pure breed expensive car. so they want
              to show you no matter how much more you spend modify, they can
              still outrun you. they want to make you go back to that feeling
              cheap.</p>
              <p>third) they have a bad experience with another car like your
              model or looks like your plate number, so they want to take
              revenge. even if wrong car, they also feel shiok. becos they feel
              they miss that chance last time, this time they want to make you
              pay..even if you are different. but to them, same car different
              driver is good enough for some fun!</p>
              <p>four) just like that Ferrari Taxi case. sometimes the driver is
              trying to impress show off to some friends, especially one or two
              new girls, that he can play around in his supercar. this happen to
              me before also. one time at telok blangah, this small but stylish
              convertible that suppose to sit only 2.. inside seated 2 guys..then
              on top them sit 2 more long hair girls! so total 4 pax in a very
              small open car. and they play loud music and laughing and pushing
              around inside the car. can tell the cars around them all quite
              worry if that driver can actually see the road around them, but
              that driver dont care, he just drive any lane anytime he like, zip
              here zip there. so end up more and more cars drive slower jam
              behind that single convertible car, but i think that made the
              driver and his friend and 2 girls even more shiok becos they think
              people envy them, when actually they are blocking everyone, but no
              one can do anything about it until they turn off later.</p>
              <p> </p>
