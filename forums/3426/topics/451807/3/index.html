              <p>Govt are elected and designed to serve it people, provide people a decent livinghood and a shelter on top of people's head. As simple as that is consider a good govt.</p>
              <p>But if you look at our elected PAP govt, are they elected and designed to serve us? Most TD you ask them will PHUI X10000 times.</p>
              <p>The way our elected govt work is like a corporate management whereby profitability $$ is their main objective, not the citizen and their welfare.</p>
              <p>They are the main contractors, and every sub out jobs, it must bring in profit, and these profit increase yearly with new targets or KPIs, once the head of the govt set the targets,</p>
              <p>Have set targets, the ministers will work on it, bring in as much investment as possible, to the extend of allowing investors to bring in their own peoples, get cheap workers that set an imaginery minimum wage which in this world, is the lowest in term of comparative advantage of cost of living vs earning power.</p>
              <p>So, do you want a govt that is designed and care for $$ and its economy, or do you want a govt that is designed to care for it citizens, providing adequate income that can sustain their livinghood and at the same time, inclusively, provide them a family bearing enviroment that can sustain in the years to come.</p>

              <p>My views :</p>
              <p>If u are a master's , phd or watever atas degree , your talents are seriously being wasted on taxi driving.</p>
              <p>Those who glorifies taxi driving being honest, wat down to earth blah blah blah are juz consoling themselves.</p>
              <p>Nothing can be as miserable as taxi driving esp if u are highly educated , used to living a high life.</p>
              <p>Just out of curiousity , degree holders , have u guys attended any of your uni reunion? :D</p>

              <p>Tell you a story, not exactly related to this thread.</p>
              <p>In China, a long long time ago, a rich merchant invited a wise
              man to his house because he wants him to write a few sensible verse
              on a screen.</p>
              <p>After having good food, fine wine, and a luxurious life for a
              few months, the wise man did not come up with anything.</p>
              <p>The Merchant became impatient and enquire about the scroll.</p>
              <p>After 3 more days, the wise man invited the Merchant to view the
              Scroll.</p>
              <p>On it was written,</p>
              <p>"Grandfather die, Father die, Son die"</p>
              <p>The Merchant at first curious but slowly start to anger.</p>
              <p>The wiseman quickly explain,</p>
              <p>Death is a certainty that we cannot escape,</p>
              <p>this is the best that you want it to be, and you do not want it
              to be in any other order.</p>
              <p>The Merchant was suddenly enlighten, and he thank the Wiseman
              profusely.</p>

              My personal opinion:
              
              I am a MBA holder. I can understand and concur with both Bro onewaytransfer and Bro BCL point of views. Take a scenario, If we are a successful own boss or a Cxx in a highly recognised company, then likely we will comment that we based on our capability not certificate to be successful. Even senior manager (with MBA), their basic salary also tagged with MBA market value. So why am I driving taxi? Because I was first to go when come to retrenchment. I had been in the top and bottom of my career. But what can I do? I still need to put food on the table everyday. I need to pay water and electricity bill.... and HDB instalment... etc. Sometimes during driving I will start to reflect why am I driving taxis after studied so hard for a MBA and was a AVP before. Then will start to feel demoralised and regretted with negative thinking. It is really miserable for a ex-high-flyer to drive a taxi. 
              
              To think it positively it is taxi driving that help me bring food home for the past few months. I appreciate taxi-driving because it keep me afloat when I am at the bottom of my career. Thru tax-driving, I see and learn the dark-sided of human beings (pax) which I never visualise before in my corporate world other than office politics. I had improved in my defensive driving, thanks to our hungry drivers' driving behaviour and many "ninjas"(jaywalker wearing black) running across the road from nowhere at night.
              
              I am still looking for a suitable job because I need CPF to pay for my HDB loan and medisave for my parents/family. Meanwhile I hang on to taxi-driving and appreciate every single food I bring home everyday.
