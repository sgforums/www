              <p>Alamak u blind issit?</p>
              <p>Maybe your wife company is a rare case. But look at the bigger picture.</p>
              <p>PAP if really so pro the people they wont have their vote share drop from 66.6% to 60.1%</p>
              <p>And they know its serious? Why? Becos they have factor in the New Citizens that have voted for them cos without the new citizens support their vote share is defitnitely below 60% mark.</p>
              <p>And lets not forget the ruling goverment is the Biggest Landlord and also the Biggest Employer(directly and indirectly thru GICs and temasek holding) in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Of cos its does make perfect sense for them to squeeze every bits from the people by surpressing wages while increasing land prices.</p>
              <p>Which idiots doesnt know?</p>
              <p>Give me the Big Cane in my hand to rule singapore i also know.</p>

              <p>@ericgo, I won't take you on as it don't pertain to taxi issue, your knowledge and my knowledge on certain things might not be the same, is clueless to argue on this issue over here.</p>
              <p>If you decided to put words like, 'blind', 'idiots', on your post to me, than don't expect me to give you any face next time when you post something pertaining to taxi.</p>
              <p>Lastly, I can post something like what Poolman had post pertaining to my wife company, is the other way round, sensible? I don't think so?</p>

              <p>In the past, when you are a senior manager, chances are you can still find a place in the job market. Due to lack of talent in these areas. And for those few who could not get a job, they became dependents.</p>
              <p>Today, there are too many professionals who lost their job and could not re-enter the job market. Out of these big group of people, some are at their wits end, while some are entreprising. And they became TU.</p>
              <p>Why they cannot re-enter the job market, no point to discuss here. I am one of them.</p>
              <p>With my talent, I can easily contribute to a company to turn around their accounting numbers or improve it to an admirable level. But if they dont even call me for interview, how can I show them my capabilities. What happened? Why am I in this situation?</p>
              <p>(Just for info, my sister is already 60+ and she can easily find a job in America. She migrated over 3 decades ago)</p>
              <p>No point to discuss or talk about it now. You have to achieve the first Objective before anything else can be discussed or implemented.</p>
              <p>YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT 39% BECOME 51%.</p>
              <p>Then we can brainstorm how to improve our lives.</p>

                              <p>In the past, when you are a senior manager, chances are you can
              still find a place in the job market. Due to lack of talent in
              these areas. And for those few who could not get a job, they
              became dependents.</p>
              <p>Today, there are too many professionals who lost their job and
              could not re-enter the job market. Out of these big group of
              people, some are at their wits end, while some are entreprising.
              And they became TU.</p>
              <p>Why they cannot re-enter the job market, no point to discuss
              here. I am one of them.</p>
              <p>With my talent, I can easily contribute to a company to turn
              around their accounting numbers or improve it to an admirable
              level. But if they dont even call me for interview, how can I show
              them my capabilities. What happened? Why am I in this
              situation?</p>
              <p>(Just for info, my sister is already 60+ and she can easily find
              a job in America. She migrated over 3 decades ago)</p>
              <p>No point to discuss or talk about it now. You have to achieve
              the first Objective before anything else can be discussed or
              implemented.</p>

              </p><p>But...school high high still should not enter TD industries.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Whether 39% or 51%, don't make any different to your plight, unless TD required a master degree holder to hold that steering.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>And that is my point, nothing else...good or bad government? Don't really matters to your plight, when downfall, people like you turn to lower grade jobs and kpkb to government, how about us? School low low type...who can we turn to? </p><p>
              
              </p><p>Imagine though is possible, with 'O' level like me, become a CEO climbing on top of all the others in the related field, who's fault? Government again?</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Bro bowah enlighten us with valid point, read his post, appreciate his analyst, than you will understand the result of down falling by individual is not due to Policy changes or a better government.</p><p>
