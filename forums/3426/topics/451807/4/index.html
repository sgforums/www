              <p>Your chilren's future? Like in other parts of the world when a country is overwhelmed by foreigners, your children will be called "orang asli" or original people. Maybe the time comes the government will hav a special place for them to be tourist attraction. I see major flaws in our governance years ago. The trouble is, people don't realise or don't care it until the get one tight slap right in their face. Years have passed already, to hope for opposition party to make a change is false hope in reality. Or a faint shade of hope.</p>

              <p>Truth #101 Really saddened about what's going on. To have such weight on the shoulders to care for parents is indeed a true test of faith. Many experienced men here will know how many parents have been deserted or "managed"  in a way the child's own lifestyle is not compromised. A very miserable old age for many Singaporeans.....</p>
