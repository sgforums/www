              <p>In the past, when you are a senior manager, chances are you can
              still find a place in the job market. Due to lack of talent in
              these areas. And for those few who could not get a job, they
              became dependents.</p>
              <p>Today, there are too many professionals who lost their job and
              could not re-enter the job market. Out of these big group of
              people, some are at their wits end, while some are entreprising.
              And they became TU.</p>
              <p>Why they cannot re-enter the job market, no point to discuss
              here. I am one of them.</p>
              <p>With my talent, I can easily contribute to a company to turn
              around their accounting numbers or improve it to an admirable
              level. But if they dont even call me for interview, how can I show
              them my capabilities. What happened? Why am I in this
              situation?</p>
              <p>(Just for info, my sister is already 60+ and she can easily find
              a job in America. She migrated over 3 decades ago)</p>
              <p>No point to discuss or talk about it now. You have to achieve
              the first Objective before anything else can be discussed or
              implemented.</p>
              <p>YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT 39% BECOME 51%.</p>
              <p>Then we can brainstorm how to improve our lives.</p>
              <p>Today, just shut-up and do whatever you can to put food on the
              table.</p>
              <p>By the way, I have a Master too. And I used to manage Subsidiary
              Factory of over 300 headcount.</p>

              <p>As Poolman has said å‘½ä¸­æ³¨å®š.</p>
              <p>But how many people really understand it?</p>
              <p>By saying a Master or PHD will guarantee big bucks is wrong.</p>
              <p>But how many rich man don't even have a Degree?</p>
              <p>Alot of successful people will say they can predict the future.</p>
              <p>But how many will guarantee it?</p>
              <p>One thing I can guarantee will sure happen to everyone.</p>
              <p>Lawyer can sign and chop, sure happen one.</p>
              <p>That is everyone will die one day.</p>
              <p>When and how...that I don't know.</p>
              <p>I know some people can say suicide can choose.</p>
              <p>But you sure will die or not.</p>
              <p>Got case that don't succeed.</p>
              <p>Just be contended.</p>

              <p>Hi OWT, before I start, just want to make sure this is just a discussion, and everybody have their own views. I state my 2 cents worth. We learn from each other. Your statement followed by my comments.</p>
              <p><strong>"Singaporean professional turn TU is just a minimum percentage, these are the people concede to life. (sorry if I offended anyone here)"</strong></p>
              <p>I am a Professional turn TU, and I know of quite a few like me. We do not concede to life. We are the ones who, as long as have hands and legs, will keep fighting for our livelihood.</p>
              <p><strong>"But...school high high still should not enter TD industries."</strong></p>
              <p>Why? Dont steal, dont cheat, good industry to enter. Does Education differentiate us? I can relate to a general worker digging a trench for PWD just as well as talking to a CEO of a Multi National Company. I am no different in that sense.</p>
              <p><strong>"Whether 39% or 51%, don't make any different to your plight"</strong></p>
              <p>I have analysed this for 8 years, and I believe it WILL make a difference. For your info, I used to support them 8 years ago. Perhaps I will live to see the change, perhaps not. But probably you will see the change. And I can tell you that at the point of change, there will be confusion and havoc, before it settles down to a better lifestyle.</p>
              <p><strong>"unless TD required a master degree holder to hold that steering."</strong></p>
              <p>Again I ask, Does education make the difference? How about Attitudes, Culture, Shared Values. This is also in Brudder Bowah's write-up.</p>
              <p><strong>"Imagine though is possible, with 'O' level like me, become a CEO climbing on top of all the others in the related field, who's fault? Government again?"</strong></p>
              <p>I believe you are a person who does not blame others for things that happen to you. Good, because you accept responsibility for all things happening to you.</p>
              <p>I look at things in a wider perspective, the country in general and all the older people who could have been gainfully employed, and how other countries are managed successfully. Plus ridiculous salaries for ministers when the people are suffering.</p>
              <p>Myself, cannot get a job, luckily still got Taxi driving to support my family. If TD community reject me, then I am just being pushed to the wall.</p>
              <p><strong>"Bro bowah enlighten us with valid point, read his post, appreciate his analyst, than you will understand the result of down falling by individual is not due to Policy changes or a better government."</strong></p>
              <p>Bro Bowah have always written sensible things. This is what they call "see broken already". My life goes on, I still need to provide for my kids. I know when to do something, and when not to do anything. But for the betterment of tomorrow, and for the kids who is going to grow up, and they include my kids and Bowah's kids. I need to make a stand. And I will scruntinize Policies. I myself may not make a difference, but together with other like minded people, we can make a difference, and when the difference comes, people who did not do anything will also enjoy the benefits too.</p>
              <p>Note: Please do not mix up with people who fail in life. They are the ones heading for Bedok Reservoir.</p>
              <p><strong>"And I still want to stress, to be a better TU, forget your past because TD don't really need that."</strong></p>
              <p>I believe if you have read up to this point, I have never at anytime, shown that I am more superior becuase of my past. Instead, I use my past to understand the present, and try to make it a better world for all of us.</p>
              <p>This is my Mission Statement</p>
              <p>"To ferry my client to his desired destination in a safe and economic manner which will delight him".</p>
              <p>This is using my past, to work in the present for a better tommorow.</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Apologize for this long write-up, but just want to clarify because your point of view is quite different from mine. And I did not want to be mis-understood.</p>

              <p>By saying a Master or PHD will guarantee big bucks is wrong.</p>
              <p>But how many rich man don't even have a Degree?</p>
              <p>Alot of successful people will say they can predict the future.</p>
              <p>But how many will guarantee it?</p>
              <p>One thing I can guarantee will sure happen to everyone.</p>
              <p>Lawyer can sign and chop, sure happen one.</p>
              <p>That is everyone will die one day.</p>
              <p>When and how...that I don't know.</p>
              <p>I know some people can say suicide can choose.</p>
              <p>But you sure will die or not.</p>
              <p>Got case that don't succeed.</p>

              <p>Tell you a story, not exactly related to this thread.</p>
              <p>In China, a long long time ago, a rich merchant invited a wise man to his house because he wants him to write a few sensible verse on a screen.</p>
              <p>After having good food, fine wine, and a luxurious life for a few months, the wise man did not come up with anything.</p>
              <p>The Merchant became impatient and enquire about the scroll.</p>
              <p>After 3 more days, the wise man invited the Merchant to view the Scroll.</p>
              <p>On it was written,</p>
              <p>"Grandfather die, Father die, Son die"</p>
              <p>The Merchant at first curious but slowly start to anger.</p>
              <p>The wiseman quickly explain,</p>
              <p>Death is a certainty that we cannot escape,</p>
              <p>this is the best that you want it to be, and you do not want it to be in any other order.</p>
              <p>The Merchant was suddenly enlighten, and he thank the Wiseman profusely.</p>

              <p>Thanks again for enlighten me as good as Bro Bowah...</p>
              <p>Like what I had said, we won't be able to understand people like
              you guys to come into our industry with low esteem, no doubt you
              guys are fighting for your own livelihood.</p>

              <p>Really, how I wish last time, I had study hard and secure a good
              career that can last ever long, we really had no choice, but you
              guys still stand a chance, that's my ultimate points.</p>
              <p>Judging from our England already make a different, and this is
              the best I could pen down my thought...hahaha</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, let me share with you this statement which I had
              came about in another forum, agree or not, that's the direction
              Singapore is moving forward...sad but true...</p>
              <p>In an interview last year with National Geographic magazine,
              Singapore’s octogenarian leader Lee Kuan Yew said it is a “good
              idea” that Singapore has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants as
              they are more “hard-driving” and “hard-striving” than the
              locals.</p>
              <p>“If native Singaporeans are falling behind because “the spurs
              are not stuck into the hide,” that is their problem,” he was quoted
              as saying in the article “The Singapore Solution.” by Mark
              Jacobson.</p>

              variables more but less fix increase.</p>
              <p>Any man above 40s, by right, the career or whatever he works on
              should be the height of his working life, if you are a banker, u
              confirm banker till retire, a hotel bell boy, should be there,
              maybe on the way, promote to captain or senior bell boy, and if you
              are a TD, so be it, most likely that will be your job till
              retirement, by 40s+ if you call for job interview, after revealing
              your age, the lines can go dead suddenly, and when you call
              again, it get engaged.</p>
              <p>In social life, 40s to 50s, lots of people experience midlife
              crisis, and most do not even know they are suffering from it,
              sudden poor eyes, suddenly cock cannot perform, suddenly see mirror
              growing old, suddenly ask oneself, what hv I achieved, I failed in
              life and as time goes on, depression set in, you are no more as
              garang as you are 25 or 30yo, even 3rd storey also take lift, and
              the hormone change add on to the crisis.</p>
              <p>But not all are out and done, at this age, family happiness
              bring joy and help to you, kids would had be in JC or Uni or
              working, your support to them is still very much needed, love wife
              dearly, filial piety to parents of both sides, be discipline and
              jovious as alway. Life is not about future, it is about purpose,
              what is your purpose in life, with a family and lovely kids, your
              purpose is to support  and love them thru thick and thin, and
              with that purpose, no matter what you work, be it a TD cum casket
              driver like me, you alway feel happy and look forward to be with
              your family</p>
