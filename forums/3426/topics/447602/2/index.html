              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">For me, the best thing I have as a hirer is I can choose the time-slot I want to work in, and the rest, pass on to my relief.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">My days of taking LRT to the hirer's place is over. Everyday drag to spend at least 30 mins travelling to and from his place. lots of downtime wasted.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Now, everynight I come back, just park at my place and go home. Can even go home anytime I want. Got once, as a relief, decide to go back at 3am. Return cab and thought of walking back as no LRT or bus at that time, the thought alone can kill. Ended up taking a cab and cost me $7plus for a 2 mins ride.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">As a hirer, I can decide on the terms and conditions, whether to pump diesel or pay money and use what rate, general, the relief would just accept la. I also decide who wash car and who do what.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Most important, the real feeling is that this is MY CAB, relief cannot feel that right? I can put anything I want in there, video cam, GPS and whatever. As a relief, I still need to ask permission and see his face.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">But must always be tactful and humble. My relief always says that I am the boss but I always call him my morning partner. I always use the term OUR cab to give me certain sense of belonging and buy refresher to his taste or rather smell. I also said I install the radio just for him as I myself is not a radio person.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Of course all these comes with a price, but if u control it well, the "damage" can be reduced to a minimum.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Hirer as OMO is "shiong" but if he can maintain his quota everyday of xxx, shouldn't be a problem right? In another word, got to work hard la! On the more positive side, it's good motivation to earn more. The feeling of putting a few blues and lots of reds in the cash deposit machine everynight and the ability to clear my debts faster is "shiok".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Hirer with a relief seems the best option as we can "have the cake and eat it"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">With a relief, I now take 3 half day off, just take back my share of expense and keep liao. Need to recuperate for the weekend "piang".</p>

              <p>As for the thread title, OMO or relief</p>
              <p>my suggestion is both if u with CDG.</p>
              <p>I applied as hirer and it would take some 3 months wait for the cab so in the mean time, I work as relief to gain experience lor.</p>
              <p>I applied for a "less than a year old cab" and the waiting time is longer.</p>
              <p>There after, due to my problem with the taiko hirer and to get my cab faster, I had to bring down all my requirement:</p>
              <p>can take cab of any age, even with advertisement above also can. Hopefully can get cab faster.</p>
              <p>Not a good ideal as later I found out that Sonato after 3 years got to go workshop more frequently. But I must say the guys at Sin Ming is doing quite a good job and most problems has since been settled.</p>
              <p>If given another chance, I would rather work longer as a relief while waiting for a younger cab but for me I dun mind as my fate with this cab is only for 6 months, 4 more months to go.</p>

              <p><br>So the logic here is, for newbie, best is to start as relief, for seasoned ones or those who had driven cab in the past, you can start as OMO, it all up to indivdual, however,  the equlibrium must be perfect inorder to create a hirer and relief atmosphere.</p>
              <p>In another words, too much relief driver but less hirer, relief cannot get a hirer, relief die cock standing</p>
              <p>Too much hirer and no relief, hirer omo until die cock standing.</p>
              <p>By default, there  should equal nos of hirers and relief on each side inorder for perfect match.</p>

              <p>As for the thread title, OMO or relief</p>
              <p>my suggestion is both if u with CDG.</p>
              <p>I applied as hirer and it would take some 3 months wait for the
              cab so in the mean time, I work as relief to gain experience
              lor.</p>
              <p>I applied for a "less than a year old cab" and the waiting time
              is longer.</p>
              <p>There after, due to my problem with the taiko hirer and to get
              my cab faster, I had to bring down all my requirement:</p>
              <p>can take cab of any age, even with advertisement above also can.
              Hopefully can get cab faster.</p>
              <p>Not a good ideal as later I found out that Sonato after 3 years
              got to go workshop more frequently. But I must say the guys at Sin
              Ming is doing quite a good job and most problems has since been
              settled.</p>
              <p>If given another chance, I would rather work longer as a relief
              while waiting for a younger cab but for me I dun mind as my fate
              with this cab is only for 6 months, 4 more months to go.</p>

              <p>Some OMO can make it without relief, good luck to them, but they will grow older faster, may hamper their health too, there is price to pay from everything excessive.</p>
              <p>Some hirer are those saddist type, like no one can touch their cab, only they can use it, fark lah, this one also not your car, it is the taxi companies one, you just the hirer.</p>
              <p>However, we respect each other preferrances, relief will  alway seek for the lowest rental, they can drive for up to 8 or more hirers depend on each companies rules, therefore it is a good market for them, like me, super relief, call here call there, this hirer need to operation, that hirer needs to go tour, the other one needs to rest, and this one visiting his son in oversea study. For all these, you can alway cut a good rental price, most are using their free rental days, so you make a cut, they will glady take it, afterall, better than nothing to collect.

              <p>This is a communication problem here too.I remembered my 1st hirer (few years back)even told me he will normally close shop early most of the times,and that i can start early if i want to(sounds nice).I always SMS him when i am back,which car park lot nos. i park the taxi daily without fail(for 2 years).But he never sms even once to notify me when he is back,so how i gonna start early???We don"t stay at the same block which i can look down to the car park from my unit to check if he is back.So "wu kong kanna boh kong",though he really do close shop early before the official change shift time but the timing is so irregular.In the end,i also always start my shift at the official time.</p>
