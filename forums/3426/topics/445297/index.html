              <p>For cabbies who dun talk much when driving like myself, I found the best way to impress an ang mo family man with kids on board is to drive slow. Whenever I drive at 70km/h on the expressway, the ang mo behind is usually very happy. End of journey, my chances of collecting extra is very very high.</p>
              <p>But when I speed or even go at just 90km/h, my chances is almost zero, unless he asked me to rush in the first place.</p>
              <p>So remember, when you at airport and kenna angmo pax, drive slowly, brake gently, let people cut you nevermind. End of trip, be ready to collect your ang pao. This is especially for limo pax paying flat fare lah. I am not sure if it works in a normal cab.</p>
              <p>Share your experience.</p>

              <p>By the way, tipping for me is not referring to rounding off $10.20 to $11.</p>
              <p>Tipping means like $50 give $55. At least an extra paper note lah. Not some spare coins. Giving me $5 worth of coins at the airport also not tipping lah. That is disposing of 'useless' currency.</p>
              <p>But your $75 trip to changi naval base was impressive leh. Crown is the best tool for this lah. Why? When u speeding, everyone can hear it. No need go super fast, already felt fast and loud and shaking. So pax can see that you are trying your best.</p>

              <p>Greeting is important in ang mo culture, unlike our culture, we said good morning for the sake of it, for them, a good morning mean a good morning wish and that morning must be good, they take it more indept on this, afterall, they are the one who created most of the greeting. Apologise and appreciate words such as sorry, thank you, my bad, forgive me are also good in way to be use, they really except your apologise, unlike some local, apologised  still want to hoot, complain or scold you.</p>
              <p>I would said, Ang mo takes words more seriously and sincerely than our typical asian people. So, you hv to be careful with your words, when and where to use, if not, just greet, drive, thanks them will do.</p>

              <p>@<a rel="nofollow" href="/users/259243">f1taxidriver</a>, I HATE ANGMOS. I love Indians, Malays
              and Chinese who are more geniune. The ang mos LOOK genuine but it
              is only a fascade (so they will encounter a smooth ride)</p>
              <p>However if u want to flatter an ang mo:</p>
              <p>- 'U're from California. Isn't that one of the richest state in
              the US? Wow, u are so lucky. And u are so near Hollywood. Wish I
              could change places with u'<br> - 'NEW YORK! I've always wanted to go to New York to watch all the
              Broadway musicals. In Singapore, the musicals are by Australian
              casts which are 2nd rated'<br> - 'London!' I admire your royal family very much. I'm so sorry for
              Diana but I never felt Prince Charles was compatible for her'. I
              think Camillia suits him best;'<br> - 'France gets the most weather privileges. U get the warm in d
              mediterranian sea as well as the coolness of Strasbourge'. No
              wonder President de Gaulle referred to Great Britian as an Island
              and France as a legitimate country. French are definately better
              than the English.<br> -  'I've always wanted to go to the Eiffel tower. I heard it
              is a manificent structure'<br> - 'You're from Sweden. I always wanted to see the midnight son and
              the fiords, U are so lucky to be living there.'<br> - 'I admire your country. In Singapore we don't have welfare at
              all. But your government is so caring. You can have welfare, take a
              few years off, and travel round the world. What a privilege!'</p>

              <p>Frenchmen aren't likely to give tips. Brits and Americans are the most likely, also Germans. For British, if you follow football, then thats always a good topic. Locals too who follow football, make an interesting ride and tips.</p>
              <p>Australians depends. For me I have the advantage of being able to guess which country an Ang Mo hails from by the way he speaks. Germans and Dutch sound alike, but there's a difference. Dutch words for yes and no and Ja and Nay, differrent from Germans.</p>
              <p>Americans are quite global and can talk a range of topics. But there's always a few Ang Moh who are very atas. Recently i took a call, Ang Moh husband, wife and older son from Keppel Bay, less then 300m there's a flat hump, I wasn't going fast, but these humps there's always a slight bump, suddenly the wife started screaming. I ask her why, she said you going too fast, I got a bad neck, I said you must tell me beforehand and I wans't going fast, no need to shout, she said I deserve it!.</p>
              <p>I did a 3 point turn and returned them back to original location, get down or I call the police, your screaming and shouting is too dangerous, I will get involve in an accident. LPPL they got down. Deserve it, anyway I hate this Keppel and Vivo locations, so just another scratch from my list.</p>
              <p>Ang Moh nice you treat nicely, they very atas don't give face. Scared what, this is our country, 1 time 1 changing shift, Ang moh ask to go somewhere, I say cannot, he said fuck off. I shouted back, Fuck off? You come to my country and tell me to fuck off, why don't you fuck off to your shithole country you white piece of shit! So good why come here, arsehole? He lan lan, keep quiet.  1 to 1 no need scared of Ang moh, of course in any situation when you outnumbered, you must exercise caution.</p>

              <p>Ang Mohs can be the best and worst customers. My LTA complaint also from Ang Mo, who I reject after interview, they are very tech savvy, so be prepared for complaint.</p>
              <p>For the lady I mention, she also call comfort, as usual they will side with them I know, so I immediately call driver hotline and explain. Next day morning, got call from Comfort but i ignore, idiot call at 9am, I work night why must answer, until now never call back.</p>
              <p>But still Ang Mo give best tips, once I got 1 pax ask to go from Boat Quay to Tg pagar, offer $50, I thought he joking, arrive fare around $7-8 with surcharge, he give $50 say keep it. But I think being honest is also best, i may choose pax or location, but I never overcharge, if they give tips or make an offer themselves thats different.</p>
              <p>Another way is to play good music, most Ang mos who work here are in their 40s and 50s, so they like me are 80s kids, so play music or have some Cds fro that era. Anyway I play not for them but myself but they like it and good music usually gets you tips. Slow rock like Scorpions. Eagles, Deep Purple are also sure bets.</p>
