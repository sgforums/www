              <p>Fully agree, if taxi stand states the no of taxis and my presence there is within the limit, I will never entertain private car that cut in to wait for pax. They must wait for me to get my pax 1st.</p>
              <p>If I am exceding the required number, then maybe I will reverse and let them out. Taxi stand is for taxis.</p>

              <p>Weehu, Maybe I not on the road enough. I have not seen Chrysler go in Single queue lane. Those Black car brothers also I don't think dare try. They themself know they different league, I have seen them queue only when Taxis behind can pass. If the chrysler want to wait at Golden mile pick Thai people go Geylang or waiting for coronation drive residents go Golden mile shopping for tom yam , the driver must be noob. Many of us have stated the correct ethics as a TD. Please ponder over it. Ethics takes time to comprehend, otherwise just behave like many other Singaporeans, everything must give specific instructions. But on the road I see I sure have to fcuk one. As a TD I cannot watch and do nothing when another fellow ricebowl kenna knock so hard.</p>
