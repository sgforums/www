              <p>The rules of the game is you bad, I more bad than, you good, I double good to you.</p>
              <p>So, for your situation, sit tight, ask them what is the problem, do not get hot up or scold vugalarities until they said first, do not fight until they start the fight, if they scold vulgarities, I scold them 10X, if they want to whack me, I make sure either they or me end up at block 9 SGH, waiting for disposal.</p>
              <p>Do not let Pax tell you what to do, especially a Foreigner, it is the taxis driver duty to talk to other taxi driver.</p>
              <p>But I thought your cab also accept CC, the blue cab should advise that farker ah neh to take yours. If that ah neh insist, then he should tell him that he will have to wait till the front move off, not push people out, knnccb.</p>
              <p>Once I was in such situation, I went down talk nicely to the front cabby, then to the back cabby, after the front move out, I move out, then the back await the front to reverse back, like this nice nice talk, no problem, why need to horn and shout! </p>

              <p>since u can't accept credit card, pls have the courtesy to move out. although, u are first in the Q, your case are just like rejecting a pax. pls choose a cab with cashless facilities and avoid similar incident.</p>

              <p>Is this a case of Cab got no cashless facilities, or pax dont even carry $20 cash?</p>
              <p>Taxi Stand have a system. First in Q, First to get Pax. That's what LTA meant for the public and Taxi.</p>

              <p>Now you visualise a queue of 1 pax, and more than 10 cabs in Taxi queue.</p>
              <p>If pax ask first taxi whether accept card and he says "No". Pax should wait until the first cab clears before he can ask the 2nd cab.</p>
              <p>But we are not so mean. He can go to the 2nd cab, but the 2nd cab have no right to kick the first cab out of queue.</p>

              <p>Brother Weehu, There are no hard and fast rule about this but people have to use their brain. What about those use NS card can take only cumfuc? Then those use posb atm? Whole Singapore Silver cab street pick only? Cannot go Taxi queue? You comment like that is reaqlly is selfish and also don't apply much common sense. Really must have a rule by LTA then all will understand? Use common sense leh pls! Merc cab also street pick only coz first pax dun wan to pay $3.90? Go think about it please. </p>

              <p>Teksi company imperfect, Don't turn it into a TD's problem. Like Comfuc want monopolise all NSmen, then those non comfuc see NSmen nia all move out from queue liao loh. Bottom line is Singapore is not a cashless country yet. No cash is pax problem. Want to sit only 3.20 taxi? Is pax problem. Use only DBS atm? Is pax problem. Some TDs want to turn it into each others problem, too bad.</p>
              <p>I said before liao. Use common sense can liao. Like at golden mile i ever did the same thing as bowah. But @ 313? I almost come down fcuk the TD upside down. Sunday evening at 313, how long he expect to wait in queue? My case was 3 mins. Because he didnt want to wait 3 mins he want to kick me out of queue? Ai jiak heng le kiak. Mai Jiak Lang Gao Gao. </p>

              <p>When I drive Azera, I used to encounter this. But so far no taxi behind horn or say anything. If they did sure kena fuck. I queue correctly what. Pax got choice who he want to take but have no right to force me out.</p>
              <p>This thing also happens when sometimes, I don't on my MDT, don't want cashless, tell pax sorry machine down, take another. This is my right. If pax cannot wait then hail from the street la.</p>
              <p>This also happens quite often to Chrysler. I see many time stuck in the queue, but I would never discourage or force them to leave. Their rent so high, they have every right to wait for that 1 pax willing to pay or in a hurry. Sometimes at Boat Quay or in town I see chrysler infront, and got pax waiting for taxi, I would overtake and drive past the pax, force them to take the black. I don't like cheapo pax.</p>
