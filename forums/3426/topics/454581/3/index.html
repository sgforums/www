To be honest, behind TD dun want to queue and wait one would want to take. Say last time at woodland chkpt, got extra queue just outside to take short journey one. But last time got less rules so ppl are more resonable.  10:30pm, some like short, some like long, TDs like me dun mind both. Today one I kenna at esplanade. I happy he happy.</p>
