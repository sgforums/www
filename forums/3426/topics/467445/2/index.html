              <p>That's why reading a person"s body language and being mentally prepared is very important... </p>
              <p>let's analyze Hpgin's incident, when there's only 2 fella but one sits in front and one behind, it's already a very strong tell tale sign of their intention. and not to mention 2 si gina flagging a cab 4 am in housing estate going to another nearby ulu estate... </p>
              <p>For me, that will defintely put me on high alert mode immediately by calling my kakis and maintain conversation throughout. </p>
              <p>Next if really kena held at rob, will definitely surrender and say will co-operation with them to lower the risk of injury be it inflicted by them intentionally or accidentally due to them over kan choing while trying to hold me down. Surrendering and letting believe u have no intention of fighting back is most crucial.</p>
              <p>Then must remain calm and tries to take note of all details and features of them.</p>
              <p>Struck back only if you are very confident that you are able to turn the situation around... If not just have to count yourselve sway lor... But, MUST file a report immediately!!</p>
              <p>Anyway, pen knife is not a deadly weapon, a screw-driver is which I've also kept one at my door pocket...</p>
              <p>Of coarse if really kena this situation, I also might not be responding to what I have in mind, becos we have to factor in the shock factor...</p>

              <p>just got back from my shift, after this incident, i now unbuckle before reaching destination for mobility.</p>
              <p>no offence to poolman, but i think this incident taught me that its not what kind of robber or fight feel pain or not.</p>
              <p>this one is a matter of getting hurt vs losing 200 300 dollars(even less if on weekday)</p>
              <p>i mean u fight, very best case you subdue the robber or maybe if very lucky both of them. they will get in a few good stabs and cuts, you get to beat them up, police come, you hand them over. (now i am not sure of the law so this is speculation, any ex police bros here wish to comment?) they turn around and say you beat them up very badly, or if you all keep weapon in the taxi, accidentally(or for that matter purposely) kill one of the useless bum. you are looking at manslaughter? keeping weapon? aggravated assault? i dunno also.</p>
              <p>next step hospital, kenna stab and cuts rest at least 4-5 days if not more. plus all the interview with IO at police station etc etc. monetary loss due to stop work at least 500 bux if not more, and this is factoring you get compensated for loss of rental, hospital stay etc etc.</p>
              <p>you can say for pride, cos you are fighter, cos this kind of thing cannot dun retaliate or what ever excuse, bottomline is we kena rob we are at losing end no matter what worst still we kena injured.</p>
              <p>now look at worst case, if i retaliate, my fucking seat belt jam, i kena stuck. the fucking gutless malay boy who robbed me panic, stab me in my windpipe. the accomplice also panic and stab me in my face or chest or slash my neck, hit my jagular, slash my tigh hit my femoral artery, slash my hand hit whatever artery, now i am bleeding profusely, unable to retaliate, the 2 muthafuckers panic big time, they run away immediately dun even take my money. i am left in the fucking ulu place, now probably fatally injured and still stuck cos my fucking seat belt jam.... for what? 300 bux? for pride? so i can tell my decendents that i fought 2 gutless useless malay drug addicts?</p>
              <p>sorry but i think and this is my opinion. if kena rob, just remain calm, tell them to take the money, take the handphone, take whatever, dun aggrivate them, dun try to be hero. remember their face, remember as many detail as possible and report police at first oppurtunity.</p>
              <p>we are out to make money, we are taxi drivers, not commando unit. end of the day we want to go back home to our families safe and sound.</p>
