              <p>i just got robbed last week. seriously sway. pick up 2 young malay boys about 17 - 18 years old. one sit infront and at the back. pick up at bukit panjang and ask me to go teck whye. when reach teck whye both pull out pen knife, those box cutter type. the one at the back put the knife to my throat the other fella  point knife at my face. took all my money but didnt take my phone.</p>
              <p>seriously all of you who talk alot of cock and gung ho about fighting all i can say is if you get robbed dun even put up a fight. just give the money later go make police report.</p>
              <p>for a few hundred dollars you want to lose your life?? its not a matter of young or not strong or not know kung fu karate 8th dan or not, a knife put to your throat the robber grabra just press a little cut your wind pipe already you bat man or iron man also no use. for a few hundred dollars exchange your life, i say must see open, let them rob and later you try help police to catch them is better.</p>
              <p>not die with pride, if die for a few hundred is die with stupidity.</p>
              <p>sorry if i offend but this is my 2 cents worth.</p>

              <p>imagine your life exchange with some useless drug addict?? seriously? all cos of few hundred? when i was in that situation i was very angry. wanted to hunt the fuckers down and kill them. but after a while i realise how lucky i was. all i lost is some money. didnt get injured or hurt. they didnt even take my phone.</p>
              <p>kena injured next few days no need to work no income. seriously if any of you encounter this, let them rob, dun put up a fight. but report it to police, try to remember their face etc.</p>
              <p>when i was robbed, i was caught by surprise, knife held to my throat, if aggravate the robber, or put up a struggle he could have accidentally cut my throat. all for a small sum of money. lose your life or permanent injury not worth it. i rather just give them the money, see open, tomorrow can earn back. this one is not a matter of principal this one is matter of loosing your life for a little bit of money.</p>

              <p>hammer, i was wearing my seat belt, plus mine got problem not easy to release, press seat belt button still must jiggle then will release.</p>
              <p>regardless, my simple point is this is not a kung fu movie, so many thing can go wrong if you want to retaliate, the robber can panic and start to slash wildly, you can get seriously injured, even if you manage to subdue both of them, end of they day what for??? posibility of lose my life with risk of serious injury vs loss of few hundred...</p>
              <p>your life worth only few hundred??? this is serious real life situation not kung fu movie. gung ho for what, encourage other taxi driver to fight for what?? exchange possibility of loss of our valuable life vs catch 2 low life drug addicts whose life dun mean shit???</p>

              <p>from what i understand from the police, this is their modus operandi, they rob taxi drivers, locations they change change about one. they are very experienced, only steal money, never take handphone, cos they know sometimes handphone got install tracking software.</p>
              <p>my suggestion is if at night wee hours, got 2 youngish adults, a certain race, suspicious looking, better just dun pick them up.</p>
              <p>scared people complain?? scared LTA drink kopi?? excuses alot lar, need to pee pee have to rush to toilet, didnt see passenger too dark, assess road situation dangerous unable to stop, have to cut 2 lanes assess too dangerous to stop, 101 excuses.</p>
              <p>like poolman say, passenger is for us to decide to pick up, go where we want to go, not for them to control us.</p>

              <p>when i kena this incident, my mind is blank cos i was caught by surprise. they ask for what i just give them, lucky i put some of the 50 dollar notes in a small pocket in my pants so i didnt lose everything, they took the rest, about 300 plus in all ba.</p>
              <p>i was very angry when i was being robbed, but i never thought of fighting them off cos 2 of them, and pen knife at my throat. yes, i was scared, scared i would get hurt, both angry and scared, heart beating like hell.</p>
              <p>after the incident, on hindsight i was damm lucky, i only lost some money, no injuries. if had retaliated, surely at least kena some injuries, will not be able to drive for a few days at least loss of income surely more than 300. still have to pay rental you know!</p>
              <p>so my advice is just comply, they only after money, your life is more valuable than that few hundred bux.  Just make sure you remember their face and other details to help the police catch them.</p>
