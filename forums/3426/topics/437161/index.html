            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi Greetings to the "Gurus" of this Forum, I just passed my TDVL Exam and in a nick of time before my current job comes to an end. I am planning to drive part-time and just wondering am I to go to any Taxi Company and if that is the case which Company do you think I should join. Given the fact that I am totally new to this job just need some advise from any of you. Must I go for a another training with a taxi company before I can drive even as a relief besides registering to a Taxi Company or it comes as a package when I register with that company. How do I have to cough out cash advance? Please help me please...Thanks and God Bless</p></div>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Actually not much training requires once you have the TDVL. You can start driving immediately as long you find a suitable hirer. Both hirer and you need to register with the company.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">For comfort, there will be an orientation and MDT course. Actually I attended it after I start driving for two weeks. Get the hirer to teach you how to operate the MDT and some basic rules of picking (i.e. airport and CBD)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">For initial start up cost, Comfort will require $1k as deposit. It is payable in 4 installment of $250. You just need about $280 initially and you can start work. </span></p>

              <p>can go &gt; <a href="http://www.cabby.com.sg">www.cabby.com.sg</a> and start looking for hirers near your place .</p>
              <p>If u not fussy , choices is abundance .</p>
              <p>If u insist on some criterias , like must be very hear home , walking distance , must be auto , must be from vertain company , then choices are slimmed down .</p>
              <p>Open up yourself to any company , and lay yourself a platform to start training yourself .</p>
