              Hi Guys,
              
              Tot of exploring the idea of  a Taxi Challenge among members, not sure if this has been discussed/done before?â€¦ Iâ€™m currently facing â€œ7-year itchâ€�â€¦ getting more idleâ€¦less motivated to chiong etcâ€¦need something to motivate/rechargeâ€¦get back the â€œeye of the tigerâ€� man.
              
              So maybe we can hv a Tds challenge if thereâ€™s like minded members  or interested members (whether sin jiao, lao jiao or inbetween). Rough idea is we choose a period 1mth? 2 mth or longer? Normal fair period for night shift/morning shift/omo. In this period all participants must chiong to get the highest income with your individual kungfu styles..

              I realise our members may not hv level playing fieldâ€¦some co hv more calls,, lv non-lv, sampanâ€¦speedboat and so onâ€¦Maybe we need to split 2 categories 1 shift (12 hrs) and  omo  â€¦ no point if little participantsâ€¦But anyway,,, this is just a friendly challenge to motivate ourselves and maybe hv some funâ€¦One concern is too many taxis otr during this period..lol
              
              At end of period participants submit their daily receipts (with ownself calculated Nett total) to â€œpanel of judgesâ€� maybe two enuf? (mod or volunteers?) for verification, ranking. Actual earnings not to be published,confidential but top 10 ranked to be announced. Maybe mileage can be announcedâ€¦ Participants to pay small admin fee so that top 3 Tds can hv token prize and Trophy ? 
              
              If thereâ€™s interest above details can be changed according to popular demandâ€¦so how about it ?? â€¦on bo ??.

              a challenge or competition is not a good idea over this trade
              
              due to individual driving style. and maybe classify as illegal especially money involve
              
              you may want to ask yourself why you are having  this feel of "7 yrs itchy "
              
              was it due to drop of collection? longer time of connection between pax ? 
              
              was it due to the timing you are driving? how many hour of rest everyday?
              
              any offday you gave yourself in a week or month? and etc
              
              any of these reason could be the cause of it.

              <p>The ultimate challenge shall be quitting taxi driving..........</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Like some had said, each and every day on the road, getting phobia, getting annoy, getting frustrated, getting unbalance mindset, getting irritated by every single thing.............nothing will please a TD............</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Many pax always ask me, you all taxi uncles like to gather at kopi shop big gang and talk non stop, because of the emptiness deep inside every TD heart, whenever got kopi time, is like missing your long lost friends, from taxi, can talk until mother, father, can talk until politic, can talk until men and woman, can talk until blar, blar, blar............</p><p>
              
              </p><p>You will notice, the longest you have been on the road, will stay at the kopi shop the longest............what's does that show?.........LoL</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Using taxi driving as a bet, I personally haven't encounter before.........but if you talk about football, horse, casino..........you will find that, many many TD can talk and engross in it like there's no tomorrow..........LoL</p><p></p>

              Noted thanks and will drop the idea.. I had also separately pm bos poolman and urself..
              
              Basically collection dropped yes but not because cant find pax or business bad whatever,,,simply spending too little time on the roadsâ€¦
              
              I had earlier on suffered a shoulder injury which took long time to recover so had to take things easyâ€¦.later recover liao but cant really get back the momentum..used to being idle hahaha.. Currently doing night shift 6 days  5pm to around 1pm ,, thu/fri/sat maybe bit laterâ€¦inbetween hv kopitimeâ€¦rain siu chiaâ€¦try avoid AP cos shoulderâ€¦mornings go exercise,,,Sun my day relief off so hv to omo but just recover costs plus abit..So income just getting byâ€¦but I know I can do better.
              
              I will find other ways to motivate myself while balancing family time, socializing, health issues, including adjusting shift time..etc.. without getting others involved lahâ€¦cheers

            <div class='col-md body'>Bros, as some may recall, I hv always urged against posting any earnings figures/discussion online in public. Even mod tell me learn to get use to it,,,lol..  In my rough proposal the earning figures is to be submitted to 2 judges with undertaking to keep them confidential. Only rankings will be recorded and the earning figures after verification can be destroyed. Tds themselves will not know wat the others actually earned but they will hv an idea where they stand.</div>

              <p>On legality issue, this is a friendly challenge done like a school sports day (or month), no money involved.. The trophy for recognition don cost much can

              <p>Taxi challenge? Worse on income?</p>
              <p>I 100% anti these things, surely I write long long against this.</p>
              <p>I also very idle, this month by my own calculation 1 of the lowest takings, but that's my choice.</p>
              <p>I got other things on my mind. But yes I did think about challenge but with myself.</p>
              <p>Say I set a target to buy or do something by a certain time, how fast or soon can I make it, or how motivated can I be to achieve my own target.</p>
              <p>I have a target in mind, but not at this time, maybe around April or May I will get down to start this chalenge.</p>
              <p>So by all means have your targets be it income or acheivement, but please don't tell us about it here. In private or in person it's alright.</p>
              <p>A 1 day special takings (high or low) maybe it's ok like CNY, these 1 everyone know is a last cahnce for Tds to make a bit extra before the tough months come, that 1 you wanna post, I got nothing against.</p>
