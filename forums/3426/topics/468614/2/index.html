              <p>Taxis will be next,  Alamak and é£Žæ²¹ wont help, not under police jurisdiction, our TD problems swept under the carpet, familiar? What will u do then, please advise. </p>

              <p>Let be frank here, it might hurt...but then nobody force you to be a TD, you take the job with your decision, you know the consquences if day and nite driving, the hazards, the stress, both mental and physical, there is alway a platform to throw your keys or cards.</p>
              <p>But if you think that all these TD stress, hazards and circumstances is worth to drive on as compare to working class people, thing such as freedom, own time and own target, no supervision above you, a free mode of transportation and more important, do not have to see someone face to work or drive. Then you can drive on.</p>
              <p>But if you keep thinking of these hazard, that illness..transmitting, then best is dun drive,  othewise driving with a worrying heart is never a happy driver.</p>

              <p>Well, this year alone, 3 cases of death in marine, 12 cases of death in construction, 6 motorcyclist gone on the road..we are all aware of the circumstances we face, everything has it hazards, during the sars period, 1 TD died out of other 33 peoples who are doing other hazardeous job such as working in the hospital, hotels and so on.</p>
              <p>Of course, we can try to prevent all these by just quitting, but even that, till today 4 singaporean died at home due to falling down, electrical shock and one burnt. Making our hygience and safe is of course good, but you cannot deny that we all have to face the outside world, interact, get close up inorder to survive and earn a decent living.</p>

              <p>Yes, the Sar's time, there was much emphasis on taxi cleanliness and contact tracing because Sar's was easily transmitted in taxis. Lets not forget that.</p>
              <p>bowah, your early post seem to imply, im just concerned of contracting disease?</p>
              <p>Ok, let me be blunt now, maybe u will understand my post better. I am concerned that the cab can be a bacteria transmission haven among the commuters. And TDs can only clean so much, passengers have the responsibility to keep the space they used clean too, not littering, squeezing pimples, cutting finger/toe-nails, stuffing wet tissues on door handles, in between gaps etc. Then if passenger vomit, they should apologetically and responsibly pay for the cleanup.</p>
              <p>But how much is reasonable? If it can be stated by and via the authorities. There are 2 cases where taxi driver suffered a fatal heart attack, during a scuffle with passengers who vomited and refused to pay for the cleanup, when theres no provision or by-laws stated. And more non fatal cases that went unpublished. Are the authorities doing enough for us ~ TDs and commuters? Its high time, we need a set of house rules for commuters in taxis to abide.</p>
              <p>So those TDs who met responsible drinkers really lucky, but for how long.</p>

              <p>No lah, how can you expect the authorities to step in other than advise people to drink responsibly?</p>
              <p>The whole idea is not to drink and drive and take public transport. Short of putting a bullet proof glass (like they do In NY), there's really nothing much left to do. And I doubt taxi companies here will be willing to put such a glass. Maybe a camera perhaps.</p>
              <p>The only alternative is for TDs to be aware and size up the pax they gonna pick. If someone wants to drink until seh, then just too bad. Until he sobers up, he'll just have to wait to get a cabby willing to ferry him.</p>
              <p>This issue is not unique to Singapore, I'm sure Tds in other countries will also be unwilling to ferry drunken louts</p>

              <p>Yes, the Sar's time, there was much emphasis on taxi cleanliness and contact tracing because Sar's was easily transmitted in taxis. Lets not forget that.</p>
              <p>bowah, your early post seem to imply, im just concerned of contracting disease?</p>
              <p>Ok, let me be blunt now, maybe u will understand my post better. I am concerned that the cab can be a bacteria transmission haven among the commuters. And TDs can only clean so much, passengers have the responsibility to keep the space they used clean too, not littering, squeezing pimples, cutting finger/toe-nails, stuffing wet tissues on door handles, in between gaps etc. Then if passenger vomit, they should apologetically and responsibly pay for the cleanup.</p>
              <p>But how much is reasonable? If it can be stated by and via the authorities. There are 2 cases where taxi driver suffered a fatal heart attack, during a scuffle with passengers who vomited and refused to pay for the cleanup, when theres no provision or by-laws stated. And more non fatal cases that went unpublished. Are the authorities doing enough for us ~ TDs and commuters? Its high time, we need a set of house rules for commuters in taxis to abide.</p>
              <p>So those TDs who met responsible drinkers really lucky, but for how long.</p>

              <p>That is why it is important to be a calm and simple TD, in every trade, there are bound to lost and gain, but of course, the gain must be much more than lost. We as TD, must then ready to set aside some unforseen circumstances, just like any other business,  tends to meet difficult customers, from drunk paxs to unreasonable ones.</p>
              <p>For that, we must be prepare and learn to avoid, but no matter how much you avoid, it will come because you are placing yourself as a TD, and especially so, on a nite shift, be compose and calm, once a while you will meet such people, or some unreasonable aunties or ah nehs.</p>
              <p>it is same as my casket driving, some of these dead relatives are very unreasonable, you do abit wrong only, they will curse you here and there, especially those very patang type, and some even shouted at me like I am their slave/coolie for just placing some part wrong or placed with a heavy thug. And more worst, I am facing a person died of cancer, from colon to skin to whatever. Aren't I more expose to diseases??</p>
              <p>But somebody have to do the job, those working at the shit factory also hv to wash tank and stir shit...and shit transmit the most illness. Those in chemical industrial are more worst, Jurong Island, why many opts not to work there unless no choice? Not just because of traffic problem, but also because of dirt and chemical induced aric atmosphere.</p>
              <p>Then you talk about fine from traffic fines, parking fines, LTA fines...and so on. When I work in yard, I got more fine than driving taxis, from safety boots to safety sock, to belts to helmet to glove to hot work , cold work..every time you turn, a safety officer or managment will be glaring down on you. Forget wear helmet, $50 on the spot, forget pass, $30 and ban for the day, forget belt or hardness set $100 and so on.</p>
              <p>So when look into a certain trade hazard, we must learn to look from a macro level, meaning eagle view, if you look from a mouse in the drain view, you see nothing but yourself and a few mice and you think you are the only one exposed to hazards and the rest are not so.</p>
              <p>By and large, we are all in danger at any one time, and it is like striking lottery, which you can hardly strike, only once a while, unless you are tian kong kia, same goes to unreasonable and badly drunk paxs, you only strike with them once a while, but if you are more careful with experiences, then you might not strike at all.</p>
