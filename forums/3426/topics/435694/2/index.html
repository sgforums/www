              <p>BCL not sure u drove a mercedes and chrysler before, but let me tell u that I get almost daily compliments from pax about how comfy and stable the black car is. The chrysler got the best braking system, suspension, transmission and it got a silky smooth engine, compared to any taxi cars out there. The mercedes E220 does not even come close. I rarely got any compliments from the pax when I drove a mercedes. I hated the ride, my family members complained too. They even said the mercedes E220 was WORSE than a Hyundai Sonata. Unbelievable right?</p>
              <p>The black car is absolutely the best taxi car in terms of ride comfort and safety out there. Ever tried e-brake on a rainy day? This car inspires confidence both to the pax and driver. Excellent road holding even on wet roads. Chrysler brakes are not just good, it is the perfect limo brake. Very gentle yet very powerful. Pax dont feel the jerking. It also got excellent fuel consumption considering it is 3 liters. Very big boot space, do not be deceived by the short rear end. U dont get a better package anywhere unless u talking about a Mercedes E250.</p>
              <p>Dont bring in the jaguar and the bentley. They belong to a more atas class. If these cars become taxis, do not be surprised that I am also queuing perhaps right behind u. :)</p>

              most chrysler drivers sweep lah. In fact they get most their income from sweeping and doing OWN jobs. 
              Jobs taken from group is only small portion of their income.

              <p>Not like earlier around 0020 hrs, when this black beauty came out from MBS tower one and straight wanted cut in the taxi queue of the casino.There were so many taxi behind the queue, and no taxi wanted to let him do the cut.When the lights turn green, he was left stranded in the middle of the road.Angry horns followed.</p>

                              <p>The black car is a beauty. Awesome look ! It's the big brother

              <p>Surely the drivers has to match the high standard of
              the car. Good driving attitude and manner on the road.</p>
              <p>Not like earlier around 0020 hrs, when this black beauty came
              out from MBS tower one and straight wanted cut in the taxi queue of
              the casino.There were so many taxi behind the queue, and no taxi
              wanted to let him do the cut.When the lights turn green, he was
              left stranded in the middle of the road.Angry horns followed.</p>
              <p>Well , there she was right infront of me , so that i could
              clearly see her number plate.</p>
              <p>To the man behind the wheel of SHC 4761A, I say, " young man,the
              image of a car on the road much depends on the driver, don't spoil
              it."</p>

              <p>Sad to say. There are some very taiko black car drivers. Got one confessed proudly to me. He regularly cut airport T2 q at night when nobody watching. I say knnccb and his smiling response was it was standard order for him. Shake my head.</p>
              <p>Another one is known to short cut airport T1 q at night. Straight to the chrysler q. Skin very thick one. Auto-out only after another black car came behind him and told him to rejoin q.</p>
              <p>This black car who tried to cut MBS tower 1 q. Just press the horn and dun release until he auto out. Just because black car face high rejection at MBS tower 1 does not mean they got the right to jump q.</p>

Sometimes it takes one cabby to act, the rest will follow. If the transcab driver wait for me and I wait for him or the cab behind me, nobody want to horn, then he go free to take pax by cutting Q.</p></div>

              <p>Ah tiong bu seldom take black car. But got more than a few chio bu and aunties from vietnam, thailand, mongolia and japan. Seat height is motorised. Up down forward backwards also can. Steering wheel also can adjust.</p>
              <p>As for the q-cutting problem, u must remember that a significant number of chrysler drivers are very taiko. I suspect even more so than the sampan drivers. The issue is that humans just want to earn more. No matter how much u make, after a while u get used to it, and want to earn even more. Money is never enough. You know the famous hokkien song "if I got 1 million dollars, la di da...." So u earn peanuts and dream of your first million. Then u got your first million. Will u be satisfied for long? No.... after a while, u want 2 million, and it keeps going up. Never finish.</p>
