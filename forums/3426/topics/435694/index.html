                                                <p>Locals staying in HDB usually do not take a black car. But there are a significant number of HDB dwellers staying in certain HDB estates who frequently take the black car. As a black car driver, you must know which HDB estates these are and what is the best time slot to sweep these areas.
              
              Many locals staying in condo and landed homes also like to take black car. Many foreign talents also like to take black car. These are the kind of pax you want as a TD isnt it? They already know it is $5 flag down and $0.30 jump. They got cash to pay and tips to spare sometimes.
              
              Frequently I see a sampan stopping behind me thinking the road side pax will avoid my black car and go behind for the cheaper taxi. But no, the road side pax rather take my black car than the sampan. And this happens much more frequently than u would like to believe.
              
              We as TD do not need pax with no money. Pax with no money can always take the bus or train. So the black car acts as a filter. No money types, taxi-cheater types hardly ever prey on a black cab. We get to fetch all the good pax most of the time, and frequently do not even need to interview the pax.</p>

              <p>I started off black car with walkie. Now dont even need walkie. Already know the daily patterns. I suggest better dont join Royal group for long term. They got more than 600 members. Once pressed the button, your walkie bill will be $90 per month.</p>
              <p>I dont take jobs at all. Still ok. If you like to cheong jobs, all the better for it. But just let u know, black car without walkie is very doable. One big black broom is all I need.</p>

                              <p>More members switch to black is good. Dump the sampan and
              'encourage' other taxi companies to introduce their own chryslers.
              Make the black car fare become the entry price for a cab ride. It
              is time to UP the fooking cab fare. Imagine all CBD taxi stand only
              got black cab. What are those CBD &gt; Sengkang going to do? Lan
              lan walk up to a black car and go home with a black eye right?
              Otherwise switch to other forms of transport. We dont need cheapo
              pax. With a black car, no more worries and arguments with people
              saying 'uncle 4 pax going 4 places can or not?' Or course can
              lah!</p>
              <p>But hor, there are quite a few black cabbies who drive with a
              sampan attitude. Drive black still want to interview, still want to
              over-charge, still want to fly back to town at &gt;100kmh. These
              are the ones who will lose their licence one day, but because of
              them, others got chance to drive black too. But hope they dont
              langa the black car until must scrap. Because now 2 drivers got no
              black car to drive, and the waiting list gets even worse.</p>

              <p>How many public holidays are there in sg every year?</p>
              <p>11 days. But this year is special.</p>
              <p>Because of the 2 elections. 13 public holidays.</p>
              <p>In every trade, there are good days &amp; bad days.</p>
              <p>So stop harping about whether holidays Chrysler can huat or cannot.</p>
              <p>If you can get a decent income for the remaining 350 over days, what is a few bad/holiday days.</p>

              <p>As singapore progress,  the rich and poor disparity will ultimately expand, more so is that due to the wealth creation in an unequal basis, the rich will get richer and more getting richer, the poor gets poorer. Naturally, you will see more product created mend for the rich or the lower rich pples, but somehow the poor also wanted to tap on it, and that make them getting poorer, just like no money also want to drive car, eat at nice restaurant, and spend lavishly.</p>
              <p>Standard of Taxis fleet had changed tremendously in the last decade, instead of only crown, now u get different top limo cabs, mid salon like wish, sonata, plus plus and crown become the lower end of the fleet. This is to suit a diverse group of peoples, their different power of spending, their way of seeking luxury lifes and their way of saving.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a small country with shortage of land, that is why you can see and feel the rich living among you, you next block or road can be a luxury condo or a private landed property houses, that is why you do not feel inferior and the agony of this disparity. Unlike some other countries, where the richs lives in some highland or private places and the poors are left to struggle in plastic tent near rubbish dump, they tend to riot when things go beyong their limit. Sociably, our govt is good in bridging this gap thru the society aspect, the rich can take chrysler, but I can take crown, in face value, not much of a different, but in asset and bank account value, it is tremendous.</p>
              <p>As the richs are getting more and flowing in, i believe cab companies will come out with more luxury cab, maybe a jaguar cab could soon come into the picture.</p>
