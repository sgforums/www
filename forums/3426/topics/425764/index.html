              <p>just pay the fine la, lazy to appeal. after that u die die also wont go into bus lane anymore</p>
              <p>just imagine pple on wheelchair, the family member come out into the bus lane to flag u when u are in the 2nd lane.u hao xin go in pick the person in wheelchair, the fking stupid lta big fat malay guy jumps out like a ninja with a cam in his hand n take pic of u. Puiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!! i dulan until i drive infront of him and got down to reason with him. he says his duty is to take pic of any cars that comes into the bus lane, and i can appeal to lta.</p>
              <p>did i appeal? no cos i am lazy and i feel wtf man, why is lta so inflexible. and i gotta go down to appeal and they probably will write something like they will waive it off in view of the situation bla bla bla then say something like its my fault, they are being nice to waive off the bloody fine. maybe i am skeptical, but i damn dulan with that inflexible lta guy.</p>
              <p>i just feel so fk up after that and went home at 6pm. till now i dont care whoever or watever happens in the bus lane. i just steer clear of them.</p>

              <p>In yr letter of appeal, must use words with emotions and words such as UNINTENTION, DID NOT WISH TO VIOLATE THE TRAFFIC RULING ON PURPOSE, SINCERELY EXPRESSED REGRETS, EXECISE LENIENCY, SIR/MDM... etc.</p>

              <p>i also kena before , by a Traffic Police , no photo taken , at Rochor Canal towards Newton , just outside Rex Threatre .... my argument was that i was within the dotted yellow line .</p>
              <p>I want LTA to show me the proof that i was within the bus lane , which i argued i was outside bus lane , within dotted lines .</p>
              <p>The bus lane design also one kind ....</p>
              <p>100m bus lane .... another 100m dotted bus lane ..... another 100m bus lane .</p>
              <p>So i basically go in and out , in and out .</p>
              <p>I knew it when i was caught , i was manouvring in &amp; out .</p>
              <p>I knew the TP do not have evidence , so i emailed them &amp; challenge them .</p>
              <p>They wrote in to tell me the fine was waived .</p>
              <p>I just knew , they cannot provide me evidence .</p>
              <p>That's why they waived .</p>
              <p>But if u really caught pants down without a valid reason , juz pay .</p>

              <p><br>This one i also kena before , stupid Cisco fellow .</p>
              <p>I again wrote in to tell them initially paxes insist on alighting at Emerald Hill , so i keep left to inform them i can't alight them , reason was the bus lane stuff , i kept left or  i'll be obstructing the traffic , but when they snapped me , i was <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">HIRED</span> , they saw it </strong>. And they saw me move out of bus lane and move in within 20 metres , stupid cisco , not flexible .</p>
              <p>Again , they waived the fine .</p>
              <p>I can't blame the Cisco fellows , they are paid to snap .</p>
              <p>Or else LTA will ask them : " Ooi , u working or not ? No photos ? "</p>
              <p>I said the Cisco fellow stupid , cos they saw i was with a pax , and after that , i alight them at centrepoint taxi stand .</p>
              <p>I even criticised LTA , the bus lane cut off point , were so short , about just maybe 10 metre away from taxi stand , stupid design , design in a way , taxi driver surely kena , like a trap . There is no leeway for us , if taxi stand full of taxis Q-ing , and u are alighting paxes , that's it , the chances are , very much u will be photoed .</p>
              <p>They never reply me on this .</p>
              <p>I have confidence , cos i have a pax , if i do not have a pax , then i am doomed that day .</p>

              <p>Kenna photoed by LTA also, i guess. The purpose of the bus lane is to save the bus travalling time, and benifit for more ppl. This one I can understand. But when i am in the lane there is no bus in front or behind at all. Just be captured by some ninja.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can the gov make the law more flexible? If the private car hindle the bus, kenna fined. if not, just let the ppl use it. If the ambulance is behind you, u are force to leave the way to it. Make it the same to the bus lah. Give way to the bus whenever the bus is behind you.</p>

              <p>By doing this, bus can enjoy the fast traveling speed while the road resourse got the maximum ultilized...</p>

              <p>bus lanes are a joke.</p>
              <p>yes, it was with the good intention of letting bus travel faster with less disruption.</p>
              <p>but it is ridiculous when in the peak hour traffic, you have cars all jammed up in the 2 other non-bus-lanes, while the bus lane goes empty.</p>
              <p>not that the bus will not be affected by the jam also. since bus lanes does not stretch continuously, traffic jam at a portion of the road without buslane markings will still result in traffic jams for buses in the buslanes.</p>

              bus lanes, bus turn out from bay... all these are meaningless.... and even dangerous
              
              like trying to make an elephant go faster a bit... but waste a lot of others time...

              <p>bus lanes are a joke.</p>
              <p>yes, it was with the good intention of letting bus travel faster with less disruption.</p>
              <p>but it is ridiculous when in the peak hour traffic, you have cars all jammed up in the 2 other non-bus-lanes, while the bus lane goes empty.</p>
              <p>not that the bus will not be affected by the jam also. since bus lanes does not stretch continuously, traffic jam at a portion of the road without buslane markings will still result in traffic jams for buses in the buslanes.</p>

              <p><br>then you kpkb why bus travelling time so long right?</p>
              <p>The buses are alrdy slower on e fact they've to make stops.</p>
              <p>1 taxi carry 4 ppl, 1 bus carry 130 ppl. Who should be given priority? 3 taxis = length of 1 bus.</p>

              <p>No, but last time, i olso got video by white cloth man, at Victoria before turning into lavendar road, got now and ask him, he said  they are doing survey on how many cars need to turn into the lavendar which need to go into the bus lanes, he also joke that some LTA road engineeers designed some road wrongly, so re-study to put dotted red lane or remain the same </p>
