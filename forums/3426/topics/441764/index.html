              <p>other company show a little bit more humanity by not offering merc to newbies, they know failing rate is high for newbies.</p>
              <p>thou you can join a limo group, but limo customer generally have a higher expectation from a limo driver, good knowledge on route and location is basic. let those limo driver tell you more. And all this only worth an extra of $0.20 per trip. </p>
              <p>Walkie player require a good knowledge of routes/building/address and timing, there are many competition and no much mercy shown for newbies.</p>
              <p>A brand new cabby the best is keep your liabilty low for a start.</p>

              Merc for newbies ?
              
              So far only seen one very brave one .... he quitted Merc in one month and now dunno go where ?
              
              Remember sillyegg ?
              
              I always tell newbies .... learn to crawl , stand , walk , jog , run then sprint .
              
              Unless one was born was a silver spoon , never be slave for taxi companies , but hor when u born with silver spoon , u dun need to drive a cab .
              
              Got another one , with some funny fruit names .
              
              Merc got repossessed by taxi company .
              
              Why repossess ? Cannot pay rental mah , why cannot pay rental ? Newbird dunno how to drive a taxi before , how to drive a Mercedes , no business , no income , slave for taxi company , how to pay rental ?
              
              Unless TS can accept becoming slave for taxi companies for a few days each month , then go on .
              
              Taxi is my slave , not i slave for my taxi .

              <p>An experience driver, all rounder,  know what is best during that particular timing. For booking, know which booking to take. To sweep, know what type of location to aviod. Most importantly, stepping on the line and never get fines.</p>

              <p>Frankly, Uncle here also do not understand the logic of watches, certainly, by wearing branded stuff like watches, you get much respect and deal done with trust if you are skrew businessman.</p>
              <p>Money and cost aside, some bosses I took to AP told me, actually said they prefer a Getz or a smaller car to go around singapore, more easier to park and suit our small lanes, but due to business, the showcase have to be there, they have to drive big merc and other luxury cars, in business deal, people look at your appearances and wearing, so I guess a rolex stand a much different from a Casio. And certainly, a merc will outstrip a altis in any carpark</p>

              <p><br>I want to eat, but my stomach cannot take it, one time went eat lots of raw seafood including sashimi, next day, driving, go toilet 5 times, pax also not happy half way stop, like this lor.</p>
              <p>I am a freelancer, do only super relief job, now waiting for ship to call at port before go up and service, sometime ship park at eastern anchorage(ECP) sometime western anchorage (sentosa and tuas side) sometime batam side, if batam side, huat liao, oversea allowances, but end up spending at batam KTV and all those nonsense, then po kia liao, come back here post and wait for the next ship on call lor, if no ship, or contractor cannot get the job, then drive taxis lor, singapore also got water taxis leh, not the blue red or silver, their is York, penguin, Senoko, etc etc, you book them at either west coast pier, Marina south or penjuru pier. Wave during this period very strong, sometime bowah have to jump ship and use the monkey rope to climb up the tanker or merchant ship, not easy, once drop, good luck, you swept under the wave and when go up, it could be at the base of the ship, 3 accidents happened in my life, 2 buddies lost their life, one serious injured. Anyway, you got to be fit to do the job, and also any taxis drivers who want to throw keys can try water taxis job, permanent paid, also got tips if people or engineer are happy, now most boatman are indonesian, they want singaporeans, can train up and get a licence, then you can drive taxis on the road and water, old already can join the duck tour pte ltd as their duck driver.</p>
              <p>FYI, from marina south to eastern anchorage at ECP, per trip is $100 per person, waiting will be charge differently and return another $100. Water taxis or so called lounge can take about 8 peoples. Those never take, prepare to be Merlion, no need plastic bag, the sea just beside only </p>
