              I didn't teach him how to drive a Limo , i taught him how to do marketing job , not teaching him to tag "Limo" and go to any 6 stars hotel with a $8 plus meter prices hanging on his head . I don't do that .
              
              I taught him the meaning of marketing himself , sell himself , to expose more to selling . whether or not he listen , i dunno .
              
              Marketing his service . Marketing himself to gain those trust his personal customers can rely on .
              
              How to throw name cards ? Who are those power potential paxes ?
              
              He need to be polish to be more service orientated .
              
              Now he is just getting disposals . Enough i ask him ?
              
              No lar , personal customers is more important . 
              
              After so many years in CNB , i understand sales n marketing is not freemanisa's specialties .

              <p>He is one success story to come out from diving a merc cab.</p>
              <p>From crown ( t shirt and sandals ) , took a merc , establish his
              base . Went to Transcab merc OMO then came out own pte limo.</p>
              <p>The customers a merc cab interact a normalsine will not get to
              see. Even if normalsine were to get such pax also wont get the merc
              cab type of fare.</p>
              <p>These are called quality paxes. Where to find em? depend on your
              own calibre.</p>
              <p>For me , Driving a merc cab is a lot of hassle . U can never

              And i was contemplating a switch to Mercedes as relief ....
              
              Until one fine , one chap told me , new Benz rental $160 , no more cdi , all 2500cc diesel .
              
              Walan eh ..... $160 ?
              
              Start engine at 5pm , min $130 rental + diesels .
              
              Quite steam i think .
              
              So i went on to do survey on strength of different groups , those head counts , those potentials ..... 
              
              And more or less , except for Royal Group with near to 600 members , the rest more or less the same .
              
              I analyse , base on my style .... cannot lar , too lazy to do it .

So i help him understand more about Limo now , so when and where , he need to start driving a Merc , the software is there . So those infos not true , fake ? Tell me if i am wrong .</p>

              <p>Currently all Benz rental at average $123-$127 .</p>
              <p>This is price of current fleet of Benz .</p>
              <p>It's good to decide to sign on Sonata first , and see what future Benz's rental lies ahead ?</p>
              <p>If it is $160 as speculated , are you ready for the differences ?</p>
              <p>It will be interesting to see what's those reactions will be , from those Limo drivers once it's announced the new prices .</p>
              <p>Very soon Comfort will announce cos they tender out for new tender of Limousine taxis .</p>
              <p>In layman terms , u dun need a professor to explain to you , COE is about $60,000 now for the next 24 months at least  .</p>
              <p>Old fleet's of Benz , COE maximum $35000 .</p>
              <p>So who is going to pay for the $25000 differences ?</p>
