              <p><br>This allow him the choice, in life, you must have choices, most of you go buffet at sakura should know it, make yourself more choices, look for ways, be creative abit and not just die die must drive a cab, die die must wait for durian drop or call to come in, then 20 years down the road, same old story, maybe different cab, hybrid one, higher rental, more demanding pax, and you getting older.</p>
              <p>Frankly, you do not need a master to drive taxis, and most of us like are master of none, so be jack of all trades, from selling durian, to cook fish soup to service marine engines to taxi driving to delivery driver to partime merc or jaguar wedding driver I also do, people use to call me kiam chai ah wah, simi lanjiao also can, because, personally speaking, I cannot stay in one job and do the same, I find it very boring. And also I am those type who do not like someone looking at me while I work, or someone because having some cert or a blue eye boy of the company to give order which he or she do not even know a shit of it.</p>

              <p><br>I did not tell him not to drive a Merc .... he is a newbie . I adviced him to start driving a normal Crown , then so on , compared to Merc .</p>
              <p>A brand new cabby to start driving a Merc , sweeping floor , is like driving a Crown !</p>
              <p>So like a watch , they delivers the same thing , if u are sweeping floor .</p>
              <p>Does it earn more with Merc sweeping floor ?</p>
              <p>From start i stated u crawl , stand , walk , jog etc ......</p>
              <p>MerCab u are different , u sweep floor with skills .</p>
              <p>U dare do things i don't even dare .</p>
              <p>U don't expect everyone can sweep floor like you .</p>
              <p>U have been driving a Crown , then upgrade to Merc .</p>
              <p>He is trying to sign on straight away a Merc , i don't think my style , encourage him to fo that .</p>

              lots of raw seafood including sashimi, next day, driving, go toilet
              5 times, pax also not happy half way stop, like this lor.</p>
              <p>I am a freelancer, do only super relief job, now waiting for
              ship to call at port before go up and service, sometime ship park
              at eastern anchorage(ECP) sometime western anchorage (sentosa and
              tuas side) sometime batam side, if batam side, huat liao, oversea
              allowances, but end up spending at batam KTV and all those
              nonsense, then po kia liao, come back here post and wait for the
              next ship on call lor, if no ship, or contractor cannot get the
              job, then drive taxis lor, singapore also got water taxis leh, not
              the blue red or silver, their is York, penguin, Senoko, etc etc,
              you book them at either west coast pier, Marina south or penjuru
              pier. Wave during this period very strong, sometime bowah have to
              jump ship and use the monkey rope to climb up the tanker or
              merchant ship, not easy, once drop, good luck, you swept under the
              wave and when go up, it could be at the base of the ship, 3
              accidents happened in my life, 2 buddies lost their life, one
              serious injured. Anyway, you got to be fit to do the job, and also
              any taxis drivers who want to throw keys can try water taxis job,
              permanent paid, also got tips if people or engineer are happy, now
              most boatman are indonesian, they want singaporeans, can train up
              and get a licence, then you can drive taxis on the road and water,
              old already can join the duck tour pte ltd as their duck
              driver.</p>
              <p>FYI, from marina south to eastern anchorage at ECP, per trip is
              $100 per person, waiting will be charge differently and return
              another $100. Water taxis or so called lounge can take about 8
              peoples. Those never take, prepare to be Merlion, no need
              plastic bag, the sea just beside only </p>

              <p>How do you convince people to take up your service ?</p>
              <p>Although Limousine groups are not license and are  fixing
              illegal prices , still many Benz drivers make it , because Mercedes
              if u can make it with your own customers base , u will do well
