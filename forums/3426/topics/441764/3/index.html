              <p>Still have many many friends in the limousine cabs (in Chryslers, Mercedes, Maxis) &amp; Pte Limo.</p>
              <p>SMRT Limos are a <strong>OLD FLEET</strong> liao, <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>very thirsty</strong> on diesel</span>.  No news that they will replace it with new ones.... Likely they will concentrate on their Black Chryslers.</p>
              <p>Pray hard that your cab don't break down..... If they out-sourced it out to other workshops, you may have a "<strong style="color: #ff0000;">Long, No Pay Leave Break</strong>".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>Wah,</p>
              <p>this forum damm hot man! so many warm replies. friendly, spontaneous  and not sarcastic esp to newbies like us.</p>
              <p>as I am looking at OMO which means driving at least 12 hours a day, comfort is my top priority. As such, I not looking at the Toyota Crown which involves changing of gear how many thousand times a day. My choice of Merc is, honestly, out of vanity too.</p>
              <p>Most companies apart from SMRT don't offer Merc to new cabbies and I wonder if that is really for their own good. Being newbie, most likely, I would have to start with "sweeping", haha, learning your lingo now. So maybe the startup will be alot more uncomfortable comparing with a $80 plus rental.</p>
              <p>Infact, I have more or less make up my mind but just trying to give myself better justification in my decision.</p>
              <p>I was thinking of just getting my Sonata and drive for 6 months first before getting the limo from CDG.</p>
              <p>Reason I not getting SMRT limo now is mainly due to the age of the cab, minimum 6 years old and that they do not have NETS, only VISA and of course the call network. Also read abt their "so many return taxi" and their slow deposit return worry me too.</p>

              <p>Wah,</p>
              <p>this forum damm hot man! so many warm replies. friendly,
              spontaneous  and not sarcastic esp to newbies like us.</p>
              <p>as I am looking at OMO which means driving at least 12 hours a
              day, comfort is my top priority. As such, I not looking at the
              Toyota Crown which involves changing of gear how many thousand
              times a day. My choice of Merc is, honestly, out of vanity too.</p>
              <p>Most companies apart from SMRT don't offer Merc to new cabbies
              and I wonder if that is really for their own good. Being newbie,
              most likely, I would have to start with "sweeping", haha, learning
              your lingo now. So maybe the startup will be alot more
              uncomfortable comparing with a $80 plus rental.</p>
              <p>Infact, I have more or less make up my mind but just trying to
              give myself better justification in my decision.</p>
              <p>I was thinking of just getting my Sonata and drive for 6 months
              first before getting the limo from CDG.</p>
              <p>Reason I not getting SMRT limo now is mainly due to the age of
              the cab, minimum 6 years old and that they do not have NETS, only
              VISA and of course the call network. Also read abt their "so many
              return taxi" and their slow deposit return worry me too.</p>

              <p>Actually, i don't think you need to drive 12+ hours as an OMOã€‚The only problem is you will make less than one shift drivers but then you can still survive.</p>
              <p>It is a marathon, not a sprint. Taking care of your body and mental state is more important.</p>

              It's not a discrimination , they do screening or interviews before accepting new members .
              
              all those members i knew that joined limo groups , are with some really good experiences .
              
              Didn't know that ..... something new .

              <p>There is many Limousine groups in Singapore taxis .</p>
              <p>They all started with Limo-2000 as the Pioneer for Mercedes Taxis .</p>
              <p>Then breakaway with K-Limo .</p>
              <p>Then small groups , active ones are Classic Limo , Limo Express , U2 , Rainbow , Limo United , Central Limo plus some not popualr ones , all if i can remember .</p>
              <p>All was a breakaway setting up Limousine Groups .</p>
              <p>Then after SMRT launched Chrysler , Royal Group was set up by their Chrysler team . Currently strongest so far .</p>
              <p>Some smaller Limo averagely has got 100-300 members .</p>
              <p>Royal has got nearly 600 of them .</p>
              <p>Imagine 600 members throwing their personal jobs out ?</p>
              <p>Will be defintely more than those thrown by 100-300 members , right bo ?</p>
              <p>There is where Quality jobs came in .</p>
              <p>Again , quality jobs also became competitive within those 600 members .</p>
              <p>Limo groups how they operates , are more or less the same .</p>
              <p>The only problem , they are no recognised by taxi company .</p>
              <p>Not license by LTA .</p>
              <p>Thus pricing wise , very sensitive .</p>
              <p>Any fare disputes , once got into Court , that Limo driver will be in trouble .</p>
              <p>It happens to Fullerton Hotel and Roxy Mercure Hotel within this 2 years .</p>

              <p>Bell boy fined just $2000 for accepting .</p>

              <p>There is many Limousine groups in Singapore taxis .</p>
              <p>They all started with Limo-2000 as the Pioneer for Mercedes
              Taxis .</p>
              <p>Then breakaway with K-Limo .</p>
              <p>Then small groups , active ones are Classic Limo , Limo Express
              , U2 , Rainbow , Limo United , Central Limo plus some not popualr
              ones , all if i can remember .</p>
              <p>All was a breakaway setting up Limousine Groups .</p>
              <p>Then after SMRT launched Chrysler , Royal Group was set up by
              their Chrysler team . Currently strongest so far .</p>
              <p>Some smaller Limo averagely has got 100-300 members .</p>
              <p>Royal has got nearly 600 of them .</p>
              <p>Imagine 600 members throwing their personal jobs out ?</p>
              <p>Will be defintely more than those thrown by 100-300 members ,
              right bo ?</p>
              <p>There is where Quality jobs came in .</p>
              <p>Again , quality jobs also became competitive within those 600
              members .</p>
              <p>Limo groups how they operates , are more or less the same .</p>
              <p>The only problem , they are no recognised by taxi company .</p>
              <p>Not license by LTA .</p>
              <p>Thus pricing wise , very sensitive .</p>
              <p>Any fare disputes , once got into Court , that Limo driver will
              be in trouble .</p>
              <p>It happens to Fullerton Hotel and Roxy Mercure Hotel within this
              2 years .</p>
              <p>Merc driver kena .... fined $20,000 for bribery to bell boy
              .</p>
              <p>Bell boy fined just $2000 for accepting .</p>
              <p>It was on the news last year or early this year i think .</p>
              <p> </p>
