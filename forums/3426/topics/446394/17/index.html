              <p>Mixed some disinfectant (cheaper version of Dettol) with water, put in a spray bottle and use it to clean the interior. Pax bring all kinds of germs into vehicle, must make it safe.</p>

              <p>Oh Yes, I think Transcab reduced the Rental by a few dollars in its latest round of adjustment.</p>
              <p>I thought the staff make mistake, and I untung. But she said adjustment is official.</p>
              <p>Sometimes when got problem, then Management make better incentives for Hirers. But must be careful, and make sure you are not 'the problem'.</p>

              <p><br>Battery can be check by Amperes meter, it must be at least 13A and above, less than that, it is begining to lose power.</p>
              <p>Once you turn the key, if it takes a longer time to crank up the engine, meaning battery is weak, going to be gone anytime, change it.</p>
              <p>If you cannot start your engine, put to neutral and start it, if still cannot, remove the connection wires on the battery, clean it, best with WD40 or other cleaner, fix back, it will start, maybe for the last time, then you can drive to change a battery, all batteries are now make in India.</p>
              <p>But if trancab provide free services, use them, you might just lose out on time.</p>
