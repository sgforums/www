              Bro bowah, very encouraging. Thanks.</p>
              <p>I hope I can overcome the hazards of OMO and be successful in
              it.</p>
              <p>There are benefits in OMO that draws me to this dangerous
              option.</p>
              <p>1.  Complete flexibity in driving schedule.</p>
              <p>2.  No need to fill up at end of shift. Fill up whenever
              (tank less than quarter) near a cheapo Fuel Depot.</p>
              <p>3. No Argument about who cause the dent on the Taxi.</p>
              <p>4. No Argument about cleaniless of inside and outside.</p>
              <p>5. No unhappiness about Driving skill or method that causes
              engine performance to drop.</p>
              <p>6. No Argument on late hand-over</p>
              <p>7. Tired? No need to return Taxi. Go home and sleep.</p>
              <p>Like I say, dangerous option. But if no try, no know.</p>

              <p>To be practical, since you are so wannabe and anxious to drive
              OMO, it is ok to drive first, talk later. Then perhap after a few
              weeks or months, you can then come back here and tell us how is it,
              by that time, we hope you are still driving a OMO crown.</p>

              <p>Must sign up (SMRT) within 2 months from Course End Date. No minimum contract period. If resign withing 6 months, need to pay back some of the incentives they gave me. More than 6 months, just beat back side and go because the last 2 incentives I will not be able to get. But then there is the problem of the $1000 deposit.</p>
              <p>My calculations shows that Transcab can offer a good rental, even without the "Train and Place" Incentives, the daily rental (net) is only $1.54 more than SMRT.</p>
              <p>Maybe I should do some super relief or relief before I dive in. I really dunno. Day by day, I fine tune my decision until I get my TD Licence.</p>

              minimum contract period. If resign withing 6 months, need to pay
              back some of the incentives they gave me. More than 6 months, just
              beat back side and go because the last 2 incentives I will not be
              able to get. But then there is the problem of the $1000
              deposit.</p>
              <p>My calculations shows that Transcab can offer a good rental,
              even without the "Train and Place" Incentives, the daily rental
              (net) is only $1.54 more than SMRT.</p>
              <p>Maybe I should do some super relief or relief before I dive in.
              I really dunno. Day by day, I fine tune my decision until I get my
              TD Licence.</p>

              <p>Check whether they let you pay in instalments. I know relief sure can but for hirer I dunno, I never once became hirer in TD career.</p>

              <p>Nothing to it lah. Everyone starts from zero and after some time, almost everyone knows how to operate. The same in any job.</p>
              <p>Nothing wrong either way being a hirer or relief. If everybody relief, then where to find hirer to let out the cab for 1/2 rent?</p>
              <p>My only concern is that newbies should be a bit more careful and thorough when becoming a hirer and not be swayed by the 'carrots' offered, only to regret it later.</p>
              <p>My friend also before drove cab. Then he quit, go into pte limo line like me. License expire, he retake but then made the mistake of taking a Merc and regretted it. Drove for 3 weeks, didn't pay rent (the last few days) and let the taxi kena tarik.</p>
              <p>So even seasoned drivers can make a mistake. My mistake is thinking Comfort in 2009 is the same as Comfort in 1995-7. Then I got a shock. Not that CDG is the worst company to drive for, but their management sucks and they don't really care for drivers who kena complain or what have you.</p>
              <p>I'm sure other companies also got some drawbacks, but at least Transcab or Silver, I gather they don't even entertain stupid stupid complain, but not Comfort, who takes the pax side in almost every case, except naturally for assault, fare cheats and the other obvious ones.</p>

              <p>There are 2 types of learning,</p>
              <p>One is step by step, slow and steady</p>
              <p>The other one is to throw himself into the hardest and biggest test right from the start, dead or alive, at least know what the end lies, if dead, at least still got time to pull out, if alive, good, he can slowly track back and find the rest as easy as ABC.</p>
              <p>I guess most TDs had choosed the step by step method, that is why, most spent so much part of his life in it, if one is to first step into the fire, he may not be a TD now.</p>
              <p>So, i would say, what bro striveon is doing can both be good and bad, depend on how he go about it.</p>

When I went down to enquire about dates, the counter guy, I think he is foreigner, neber answer me, just asking "you got letter? got medical?" and then he take and photocopy. When I insist on knowing what is the dates, then he showed me. Then I told him,"cannot la, I need to check first".</p>
