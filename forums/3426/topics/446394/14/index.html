              <p>Khoon, don't give up telling newbie to go Relief first because that is the correct path to take. Because of all you seniors saying go Relief first, I have to prepare myself Mentally and Physically before stepping into OMO. If all you seniors never keep saying go relief first, I will think that OMO is a piece of cake.</p>
              <p>Whatever I do, I will plan my backdoor. If things dont work out then I will throw OMO Key and look for Relief Key. That means no contract. Give up driving? No lah, I should not be so easily demoralised.</p>

              <p>Between Crown vs Sonata/ Wish .</p>
              <p>I ever gave one clear cut example .</p>
              <p>One crown , and one Sonata for example .</p>
              <p>Same pick up paxes to Changi AP .</p>
              <p>From say Jurong East Parc Oasis .</p>
              <p>Eg 11pm .</p>
              <p>Starting fare , Crown already lost out $0.20 .</p>
              <p>Ok start the journey .</p>
              <p>PIE ...... Sonata zoomed ... reached BKE , maybe Crown only reach Jalan Anak Bukit .</p>
              <p>Next Sonata reached Lornie , maybe Crown then reached BKE .</p>
              <p>Sonata reached Stevens Road , maybe Crown then passed Lornie Road .</p>
              <p>By the time Sonata reached Bedok , i really dun want to think where is that Crown !</p>
              <p>***********************************************************************************************</p>
              <p>Say Sonata reached AP about 35minutes , i would say it will take Crown another 5-7 minutes late .</p>
              <p>If every 12 hours shift , per trip basis , Crown lost by 5 minutes , meaning Sonata would be ahead by 60 minutes .</p>
              <p>Meaning Sonata would have been at least $30 richer than Crown .</p>
              <p>Can i analyse like that ?</p>
              <p>Logical to anaylse like that ?</p>
              <p>Analyse the possibility thru fundaments , as i've always say .</p>
