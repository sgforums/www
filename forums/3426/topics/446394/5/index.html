              <p><br>It seems that you are very stressed. You have to learn how to de-stress. If you continue like this, you may not last long in ths trade. I will be doing the same thing in 2 months time, maybe I can share what the experience is like when the time comes.</p>
              <p>Meditation, or Yoga can help to de-stress. Simple exercises also can help.</p>

              <p>as a TD, what we want is convenience in refuelling</p>
              <p>15 mins top up fuel and return car</p>
              <p>nite drivers have to spend 1/2 to 1 hour washing car</p>
              <p>minimize the time spent on these type of activities.</p>
              <p>maximize your time on the road to earn money</p>
              <p>so cdg offers you convenience in refuelling coz they have many refuelling stations and also resonable diesel rates.</p>
              <p>These are impt factors to consider.</p>
              <p>If you are idea type CBL type always la kopi tcss with friends, then these factors may not be as impt</p>

              <p>all work is tough, when u think that is tough. tell yourself. you doing this for your family and to make them got a better life, everyday go back home , see them happy and whatever hardwork you done is also worth oledi.unless you are working just for the sake of yourself not for the family.</p>
              <p>Not only being  TD is tough,when u ask a student. they will tell you be a studend is tough, being a boss or employee they will tell you the same thing. Boss( no sale, customer no pay money, worker salary etc.) employee( boss got money to pay salary, no O.T , got bonus?got increment?)</p>

              <p>:p if you find life tired as an OMO, dun be shy and go look for relief. If ya already have one then you just need to learn to relax a little, find some kakis and enjoy a meal together will help too.</p>
              <p>What? no kakis? There are plenty here :p</p>

              <p>In life, you seek the mid way of what you are doing, be it a taxi driver or worker or CEO, be moderate in what you are doing, that is the key to good life.</p>

              <p><br>I think you have to calm your mind first, then go for the exercise.</p>
              <p>If you Buddhist, do Meditation, Christian, do Yoga. (Forgive/correct me if I wrong) If you can clear your mind COMPLETELY for 10 mins a day, you will find inner peace. Then you will start to take control of your life.</p>
              <p>If you driving, park one side (in carpark), put "Busy" then close your eyes and not think of anything for 10 mins. Yes, you lost 10 mins of sweeping, but what you gain is fantastic. Please note that "not think of anything" is not easy.</p>

              <p>Today lesson is Orientation and Rules and Regulations. About 40 students, 30 of them thru' SMRT. Instructor is Joyce from LTA.</p>
              <p>We are learning old materials and will be tested on old materials. PH surcharge $1, Flag-down $2.40, advanced booking $5.20. I think Rules change too fast and not yet update the questions. The key learning point is what surcharges are applicable and how to work them out. Regarding how much to charge, we are supposed to get back to the Taxi Co that we hire the taxi from.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bro StriveOn, your theory is very good.. maybe due to the fact that you have not started driving taxi as a career... once you start, i am sure it is a different story.. what you advice seems easy on the ear.. but i can tell you most drivers if never hit target, never go home one.. hope you won't be like that when you start driving and practice what you preach.. if you able to do that, you can go the distance.. good luck for your course... cheers..</div>
