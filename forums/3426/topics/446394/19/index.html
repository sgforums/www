              <p>Hi StriveOn,</p>
              <p>It will be better if u start a Thread (like what Khoon had been doing) so that the newbie can learn. (No obligation)</p>
              <p>Ur content of each passenger is interesting (I also did it for the first month of my weekend driving but later stop) but need to last as long as Khoon, Ok.</p>
              <p>Need to take note of the $$$ no to be exposed too much, keep to yourself will do.</p>
              <p>If u tired of giving each Trip description, do selective one lah esp those memorable one. I believe u can do it.  </p>

              <p>Waah, your story motivates me. At least I am not alone.</p>
              <p>Yesterday almost make wrong turn to go back into expressway. If turn wrong, will add maybe 15 to 20 mins to the route due to congestion.</p>
              <p>So far lucky, dont have any major mishap yet, but it is just a matter of time before go wrong route.</p>
              <p>Yesterday also got a family go Zoo, took 2 cabs. Got a left turn to go into PIE but my brain says behind got entry to PIE. After U-turn then realised. On the expressway, I went a bit faster, end up I reach 45 secs earlier than the other cab that took the correct entry into PIE. This stunt must stop, no good.</p>

              <p><br>Thanks for the wishes, and encouragement to start a blog.</p>
              <p>But blogging is not my cup of tea.</p>
              <p>I can write GP Essay style. But I dont have the passion to maintain a blog.</p>
              <p>Khoon has great discipline to write. I also admire his determination.</p>
              <p>Like I promise, I will write until 2 weeks into driving. Keeping records of each trip is tedious. I will stop after a few weeks, unless I want to study some Passenger patterns.</p>
              <p>Already being advised not to mention the $. I was thinking my $ is so teruk, no harm to mention. Anyway will keep the info on $$ out.</p>

              <p>Waah, your story motivates me. At least I am not alone.</p>
              <p>Yesterday almost make wrong turn to go back into expressway. If
              turn wrong, will add maybe 15 to 20 mins to the route due to
              congestion.</p>
              <p>So far lucky, dont have any major mishap yet, but it is just a
              matter of time before go wrong route.</p>
              <p>Yesterday also got a family go Zoo, took 2 cabs. Got a left turn
              to go into PIE but my brain says behind got entry to PIE. After
              U-turn then realised. On the expressway, I went a bit faster, end
              up I reach 45 secs earlier than the other cab that took the correct
              entry into PIE. This stunt must stop, no good.</p>

              <p>yup TG48 and above all cross fleet and private is FOC. but the TG28 plan is not. So if khoon's walkie is on TG28 , the charges is like 5 cts per min or something.</p>
