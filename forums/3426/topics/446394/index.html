              <p>Hello to all the "Old Birds" and "Regulars". Just want to open a blog to log down my inspirations and activities until 2 weeks into driving a taxi.</p>
              <p>My Objectives is for Taxi Drivers 'want-to-be' to follow the process and for the Seniors to guide or critique along the way.</p>
              <p>First and foremost, THANKS TO ALL THE REGULAR PEOPLE HERE, especially Poolman. Reading and joining this blog is like putting myself into the TD seat. I can communicate on par with my TD friend who has been driving for almost 2 years.</p>
              <p>Why I become TD? I used to have good job. Then itchy backside, come out to start own business. Singapore do business very difficult, after 3 to 4 years, decide to join back workforce. 3 years on, still cannot get a proper job, I already down my expectations by almost 50%. I think old already, plus out of industry for too many years, plus cheap FT that can replace me, so they dont even call me for interview. Have a good friend driving Transcab, encouraged me to be TD (he knows me well so he is not pulling me into a hole). Got flexibility, no need to see boss's black face when go on leave. What you get depends on how much effort you put in. No problem in paying for roof and putting food on table.</p>
              <p>That is my story, sniff, sniff, please dont cry.</p>
              <p>I will update my status-to-date in the next posting.</p>

              <p>23 Dec 2011. Submitted Application to become Taxi Driver to LTA. Sent out by post with the $40 cheque. Cheaper, only 22 cent. If submit in person, transport cost easily $5.</p>
              <p>10 Jan 2012. Open Mailbox, Yippeee, saw LTA Letter. Wait. Could it Summon? Hands shaking, tear open. "We are pleased..." 2nd YIPPEEE. Immediately rush to do Medical at AMK. Clinic on the right, do X-Ray (AMK X-Ray $12.84). Clinic on the left, do Inspection (Meenara Clinic $18). Too late already, cannot make it to Taxi Academy.</p>
              <p>11 Jan 2012. Went down to STA. Earliest start date for Express Course is 12 Mar 2012. Wah... then between now and 12 Mar, do what? 62 days mann.</p>
              <p>11 Jan 2012. Went back to make some phone calls. CDG also same date, other companies also same date. Then SMRT says 9 Feb 2012. Immediately chiong down to Kallang.</p>
              <p>11 Jan 2012. My head was thinking, faster do test, faster become TD, faster earn money to support leaking roof, and put food on table. So I sign, sign the"Train and Place". Paid $277.50</p>

              <p>From 11 Jan 2012 until Chinese New Year. Find out more about Taxi Companies, Read Blog. Went to CDG "Open House". I saw in their Brochure that Newbies need to sign contract with company. Quickly check the documents I signed with SMRT. They say if don't join, no Incentives, so that means I can still join other companies.</p>
              <p>Incidentally, only CDG and SMRT have "Train and Place Schemes".</p>
              <p>CNY around the corner, Need to do Spring Cleaning. All these must put down first, pick it up after CNY.</p>

              <p>CNY unti present. Continue to read Poolman's blog. My TD experience gaining rapidly (but not yet drive Taxi).</p>
              <p>Start to look at digital and Paper maps. Everytime somebody in the blog mentioned a route. I will also do a research to find out shortest or fastest route.</p>
              <p>Trying to commit to memory some of the Embassies locations. Chealat, like pulling the pig up the tree.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, went to Hougang and Tampines to "orientate" myself. Got lost 40% of the time.</p>
              <p>Will continue to do "Orientation" whenever I have the opportunity.</p>

              <p>Plans that are forming in my head, (subject to changes)</p>
              <p>I need an operation that has low overheards (Rental and Fuel) to maximize my earnings. I am not too concern about being comfortable. So my first choice (for 1st year) is Crown, from SMRT and my 2nd Choice was Wish 1.8  from Transcab.</p>
              <p>In terms of first year Rental, they are half-fight, but Wish will consume more Fuel $$. But with the recent fiasco in CNG, I think I now only have one choice. The Clown from SMRT. It is cheaper because I factor in the Train &amp; Place Incentives.</p>
              <p>And I intend to go (Seniors, don't drop off your seat) O-M-O. Because I want to drive the morning session, 7am to 12noon and the Night 6pm to 11pm. How to relief from others when I take all the best part? This is 10 hours. If I can take it, will extend an hr each session, then become 12 hrs OTR.</p>

              <p>I have been reading the blog and understand that most TD here will put SMRT at the bottom of the list, but there are some who claims to have no problem. I figured that as long as there is no problem, then the Taxi Company will be happy with you. If got problem, they will treat you like enemy. (even though you have been supporting them). I just need to pray and drive carefully.</p>
              <p>OMO, 2 shifts? People who have earned enough will start to think of health, and better lifestyles. I not yet in that category. (akan datang) When I work in the Factory, I am 24 hrs on call. My body work 12 hours but the Factory works 24 hours. Boss dont want to know problem, end up I also 24 hrs. Hopefully those trainings can help me in this career.</p>
              <p>I believe that a person should be happy doing what he does. If he is not happy, even 4 hrs work per day will make him look old and haggard in 6 months time.</p>
              <p>Thanks for your comments.</p>

              <p>Brother, working in factory is very much different driving on the road, I work in factory at the moment, and still can post here and there, can go toilet, can ask my men go buy kopi, can chit chat abit, work abit, eat snake a bit, can even bathe after work, you do not need to be full alert, just carry on with what you are doing.</p>
              <p>As for taxi driving, the physical eyesight, you need to look out for pax, TP, traffic condition, other vehicles, jams, the calls and then the mental side, needs to think, strategy, where to go, how to move, which way, which road shortest, when to eat, where got toilet, where to release, time management, where got paxs, then come to human interaction, the paxs, demanding ones, good ones, nice ones, sexy ones, class ones, siao ones, and so on.</p>
              <p>After 12 hrs on the road, you may look like a zombie</p>

              <p>I have been reading the blog and understand that most TD here
              will put SMRT at the bottom of the list, but there are some who
              claims to have no problem. I figured that as long as there is no
              problem, then the Taxi Company will be happy with you. If got
              problem, they will treat you like enemy. (even though you have been
              supporting them). I just need to pray and drive carefully.</p>
              <p>OMO, 2 shifts? People who have earned enough will start to think
              of health, and better lifestyles. I not yet in that category. (akan
              datang) When I work in the Factory, I am 24 hrs on call. My
              body work 12 hours but the Factory works 24 hours. Boss dont want
              to know problem, end up I also 24 hrs. Hopefully those trainings
              can help me in this career.</p>
              <p>I believe that a person should be happy doing what he does. If
              he is not happy, even 4 hrs work per day will make him look old and
              haggard in 6 months time.</p>

              <p>Bro bowah, BCL, I guess all these are the work hazards related to TD. I am still very positive about it. I am now like 90% positive. Hopefully after 1 month of driving, my enthusiasm drop max 40% and I am still above 50% positive.</p>
              <p>If Taxi company wants to makan my deposit, then I just have to tell myself that I did my best and move on. I am not rich, but I believe in keep moving forward to enjoy life (and work).</p>
              <p>I am also considering Transcab Clown. Even without the Training incentives, net net the Daily Rental is only a $1.54 more then SMRT Clown.</p>
              <p>Tonite got homework... Why SMRT and CDG inspect undercarriage?</p>
              <p>Izit similar to Stand-by Rifle? Surely can find fault, no matter how hard you maintain it?</p>

              <p>Just my 2 cents worth. I was a driver in the 90s and now again for the past 2 years.</p>
              <p>My first advice to you: Don't be fooled by the sales pitch made the various training schools or road-shows. All taxi companies earn their bulk from renting out their taxis.</p>
              <p>Their primary aim to get ppl to lease them, that's why they 'offer carrots' especially to newbies, who don't know much about or anything about their structure and system and also have this new zeal to drive, so they are always targetted first.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself why are the companies so keen to offer carrots of up to 2k a year? Why not offer them to their existing hirers? Ask yourself, is 2k really that big amount? Can you recoup that 2k (in a year) if you don't take up their offer? The answer is invariably yes.</p>
              <p>2nd advice therefore is learn to walk before running. OMO gives you freedom and the keys, but it's a burden around your neck. What happens if you fall sick? What happens if something came up and you can drive for a few days or more? You'll find that in the end the companies main goal is collect rent, if you are arrears, vehicle will be repossessed and for companies like CDG, there will be a blackmark and you can never be a hirer again.</p>
              <p>You have up to 6 months maybe a year where the carrots are offered, so why the rush? A better solution is find someone in your class or a friend/relative and then hire a taxi. 1 of you take the carrots and share between both. Both can drive, both can share benefits, yet neither will be burdened as much as an OMO.</p>
              <p>Lastly, TD is far from what you've experienced in working life. I thought no problem, I was cop, drive patrol car 8-10 hours all shifts, how different can TDriving be?</p>
              <p>First be prepared for some back pain, sitting long hours and driving is no joke, even today after many years, my back sometimes hurts and I feel lethargic despit more than enough sleep.</p>
              <p>But you're young I suppose and can overcome this, but still there will be enormous pressure, to concentrate on the road, find pax etc etc. It won't be easy but not impossible either.</p>
              <p>I forget to add, ditch the crown and go for an automatic. I drove in both eras, auto and manual, but 8 hrs or more of manual is no joke, especialy for people with little experience of driving them. Pay a little more and go for auto, why wear your knees out as well? How many ppl on the road own manual cars these days? Why do you want to be in the minority? There must be something alluring to drive auto than manual right?</p>
              <p>To end, you don't have to follow all the advise given here, choose the ones you think suit you best. Don't be discouraged and yet don't take it as a challenge that you must prove some of us wrong in our advise. Advise is just that, advise. Not an order, so be yourself, yet consider what advise suits you or what that can suit you with some changes to suit your style, or marry some advise given into something you prefer.</p>
              <p>Good luck</p>

              <p><br>CDG got Crowns but have to wait 2 weeks if under "Train &amp; Place", that's what the lady said. If apply direct, I think got to wait longer. Plus their Daily Rental not cheap, $16.35 (No T&amp;P) more than the SMRT T&amp;P Scheme. This calculations is based on my situation.</p>
              <p>CDG T&amp;P Scheme, Crown will be $11.97 more than the SMRT T&amp;P Scheme.</p>
              <p>I think at the end of the day. Vehicle condition, Service and Facilities also have to consider, (which I did not). Some like it cheapo, don't mind the hassle. Some like it easy, don't want the hassle.</p>
