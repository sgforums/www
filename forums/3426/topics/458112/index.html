              <p>no offence to the crown bros in here but this is strictly my opinion of crown drivers.</p>
              <p>They are damn bloody selfish , hog lane 1 and refused to get their slow asses off . Queues of cars can be lined up behind them but they simply refuse to move.</p>
              <p>i dunno if its their ego at play or they are juz out to frustrate other road users. From the SMART to CDG to Transcab crowns all the farking same.</p>
              <p>for heaven's sake man its 2012 , get a faster vehicle pls.</p>

              <p>Agree that engine braking coupled with brakes is more efficient than relying on brakes alone.</p>
              <p>I can't agree with you relying on engine brake alone without stepping hard on yr brakes in an emergency. If you're doing that in a low speed situation it's still relatively safe. anything in excess of 90km/h and if you need to stop in a hurry, engine braking will not be able to bring the car to slow down fast enough. i.e. Car traveling at 100km/h in fifth gear, you can't use second gear as the speed is too high to be able to engage. You will engage third or forth gear but you still need to rely on brakes.Â </p>
              <p>Many a times enthusiast upgrade the engine to gain speed but neglect upgrading of stopping power n handling of car. All three dynamics must be upgraded in unison, ignoring any part of the equation is simply suicidal. You can speed and stop fast but if the car's suspension can't handle, be prepared to hug trees. Since you're driving crown, tell me how is it's suspension like. Very often I see crowns wallowing along bends/corners like a sampan due to its soft suspension, hence I asked if the braking n suspension powerful as well earlier. If a crown execute an emergency braking too fast, its front suspension will dip excessively and weight distribution will be shifted to the front. Leaving the rear end<span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);  ">Â lighter andÂ </span><span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  ">rear wheels with little traction thus leading to fishtailing effects.

If it happens on a wet surface, I dun wanna imagine.Â </span></span></p>
