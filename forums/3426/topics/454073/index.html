              <p>during our times, you hv a problem, you fix it yrself.</p>

              <p>graciousness is accorded by the giver, not demanded by the taker!</p>
              <p>if my daughter vomit in other's car, isn't it PROPER to offer to clean up!</p>
              <p>Pregnant women cannot do minor work like cleaning up? Expect others to UNDERSTAND and also must be COURTEOUS!</p>
              <p>Reflect....I think it is a very serious issue of upbringing!</p>

              <p>If any TDs encounter children crying all the way from pickup to destination soon, high likely they will vomit. I encounter this incident when a ah neh father let his kid with the pinoy maid from Great World City to Costa Rhu. The kid vomited and I quickly get the maid to clean up, too bad the plastic bag in my cab can't help as it gave no warning to me. I too had to get out and clean at the basement car park. Don't ever think they will pay you extra if you demand from them or they will only pay you exact metered fare. So if you have pax with kids, pray hard they fun do monkey stunts.</p>

              <p>Like the other day..some TD got stucked in a small condo carpark and he was trying to get himself out.</p>
              <p>Oncoming car refused to give way, so what happened? TD got outraged and felt he was wronged and where hv graciousness gone, so on and so forth.</p>
              <p>It was obvious TD has got a problem getting out..so was it the other driver's problem?</p>
              <p>If I was the TD, the other car had the right of way and I was blocking him, dun say sorry never mind,I would hv quickly gotten out of the way!</p>
              <p>It's attitude and mentality.....</p>
              <p>If you hv a problem, understanding and assistance from others are privileges which hv to be rightly appreciated, not loudly and shamelessly demanded!!</p>

              <p>Advice to the passenger of taxi, the transport ministry had said taxi is a premium transport. So you have the courtesy to clean up the mess you created in the taxi. As for public transport like bus or mrt, if you purk any place, someone will definately clean for you. You can just pet your backside and go off.</p>

              <p><br>Agreed, at least compensate the TD, taxis is a commercial vehicle mend to make money, it is not a house or a bed where the owner can accept with an apologise.</p>
              <p>But then, holding back the ATM card is not correct, that is personnal, there is no restuarant or shops you go that can hold your ATM or credit cards, they can call police or  guards, but never hold others personnal belonging.</p>
              <p>What I gather is that the connecting pax may had seen the vomit mess and avoided his taxis, not really about the commotion.</p>
              <p>As for her young sweet daughter, one lesson she learned, never mess with TD, hope she grew up more gracious and appreciate other difficulties and more importantly, better than her mom attitude.</p>

              <p>Like the other day..some TD got stucked in a small condo carpark and he was trying to get himself out.</p>
              <p>Oncoming car refused to give way, so what happened? TD got outraged and felt he was wronged and where hv graciousness gone, so on and so forth.</p>
              <p>It was obvious TD has got a problem getting out..so was it the other driver's problem?</p>
              <p>If I was the TD, the other car had the right of way and I was blocking him, dun say sorry never mind,I would hv quickly gotten out of the way!</p>
              <p>It's attitude and mentality.....</p>
              <p>If you hv a problem, understanding and assistance from others are privileges which hv to be rightly appreciated, not loudly and shamelessly demanded!!</p>
              <p>A lot of ppl hv forgotten that....</p>

              <p>A lot of Stomper's articles are about people who  LOUDLY DEMAND PRIVILEGES and SHAMELESSLY EXPECT CURTESSY.</p>
