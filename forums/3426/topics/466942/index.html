              </span></span></p><p>TAIPEI - 
              “In Taipei, <span style="color: #ff0000;">if you can’t get a taxi in one minute you’re damn unlucky</span>,” 
              so said a Singaporean friend who has lived in the Taiwanese capital for 
              seven years.</p>
              <p>I couldn’t have put it better. Ok, maybe I would have said two 
              minutes. The fact is it is ridiculously easy to hail a Xiao Huang - 
              Taiwanese nickname for taxis - in the bustling metropolis of 6.6 million
               people at all hours of the day, even at peak periods like the lunch 
              hour.</p>
              <p>And inexpensive too. A 10km trip costs NT$245 (S$10.30), and there 
              are no surcharges save for an extra NT$20 between 11pm and 6am.</p>
              <p>Indeed, before June 2011 booking a cab with major cab companies like 
              Taiwan Taxi would have helped you save - yes, save - up to 30 per cent 
              off the fare. The perk was removed after the government banned taxi 
              companies from passing off the cost to cabbies.</p>
              <p>But, for all that, the best part of a cab journey in Taipei is the cabby.</p>
              <p>Because if taxi-drivers are the window to the character of the people
               they serve, then <span style="color: #ff0000;">Taipei’s are some of the warmest, honest, and 
              folksiest you will ever encounter</span>.</p>
              <p>Just two weeks ago, I got into the car of a driver who appeared to be
               in his late 50s. During the 20-minute journey he pointed me to various 
              sights in the musing, semi-monologue fashion of a kindly uncle.</p>
              <p>“Look at the red flowers outside that house, so pretty,” he said.</p>
              <p>“Oh, nice,” I nodded, my mind on the interview I was heading to.</p>
              <p>We drove pass a bread shop. <span style="color: #ff0000;">“Have you tried their bread before? I have, it’s quite good,” </span>the cabby said.</p>
              <p>I said I have and it was delicious. Then I told him the place he was 
              driving me to was also a bread shop, called Bu Lie De, the Chinese 
              pinyin for “bread”.</p>
              <p>“Oh, Bu Lie De is also a man’s name in English, right?” he uncle 
              said, perking up now that he had my full attention. “Now which name is 
              it?”</p>
              <p>“Brad, as in Brad Pitt, the famous Hollywood actor,” I offered, amused.</p>
              <p>Moments later, we had arrived at my destination. I paid the fare and 
              alighted - only to realise that the cabby had dropped me at the wrong 
              place. It was too far to walk so I waited by the road for another cab. 
              One came (in under two minutes) and I got in. Lo and behold, it was the 
              same cabby!</p>
              <p>“I discovered that something wasn’t right so I turned back again to 
              look for you,” he said happily, visibly relieved. “Good thing you’re 
              still there.”</p>
              <p>And he took me to the right place this time at no extra charge.</p>
              <p>Another time I was on my way to another assignment, and had a nice 
              chat with the cabby on the trip. When we arrived, he said with a 
              conspiratorial grin: “Look what I’ve got here?” and pointed to a small, 
              black mass in the front passenger seat.</p>
              <p>It was a pug. It had been sleeping quietly in the car and I never would have guessed it was there.</p>
              <p>“I bring it along with me every day,” the cabby said as I patted his 
              co-driver. “And tell only those passengers whom I think are into dogs.”</p>
              <p>Away from densely populated Taipei, the taxis become scarcer, but the <span style="color: #ff0000;">heart of the service stays the same</span>.</p>
              <p>Some time ago I had travelled to the south-western city of Tainan to 
              cover a press conference. When it was over I took a cab back to the 
              train station. During our conversation the driver discovered that I had 
              yet to try my luck in the lotto in Taiwan.</p>
              <p>“Seriously? You must try it then,” he said, and asked if I would mind
               buying a ticket for him as I would have beginner’s luck. I was happy to
               oblige, and he stopped outside a lottery shop while I popped into the 
              shop to buy two computer picked numbers.</p>
              <p>“Good luck to us,” he said when I gave him his ticket. That was my first and only shot at the Taiwan lottery so far.</p>
              <p>Aside from these stand-out encounters, I’ve also met drivers who 
              could wax lyrical about Taiwan politics like professors, those who told 
              me they had visited Singapore and rattled off the names of our tourist 
              attractions, female cabbies who decorate their cars with little pots of 
              flowers and wore detachable sleeves to protect their arms from the sun. 
              They are genuine, unguarded and down-to-earth to a fault.</p>
              <p>Surveys by the Taiwan tourism bureau show that the one thing about 
              the island that consistently leaves the deepest impression on foreign 
              tourists is its <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">friendly people</span></strong>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Taiwanese cabbies doubtless have something to do with it</span>.</p>

              <p>Well, about the Topic, we need to qualify why taiwan taxi driver are happier?</p>
              <p>Driver in taiwan own the taxis or that 10 peoples can set up a taxi company of their own, Singapore is all about hire and rental, no ownership and you need to qualify many points inorder to be able to start a business, either link with govt or thru nepotism.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, can a TD bring a dog or cat along in his taxis? I guess he or she will tio pok on that day</p>
              <p>Because of ownership, this taiwan taxi driver is more relax and happier to provide better services, because he owe no one and no one owe him anything. As such, he take care of it himself, nobody can complain about him thru any companies, except the road authority.</p>
              <p>Therefore, it is unfair to compare TD of one country with another, all are driving in a set of different enviroment and condition, if it is really to compare, than why are our govt taking so high a salary compare to taiwanese govt?</p>

              Based on one person view to conclude the efficiency of Taiwan cabby. On 3rd Jan this fetched one young pax from airport this year. He just came back from Count down in Taipei. Yes, he claimed that he could catch a cab within 10 mins after countdown, but cabby bargained for a price.....
              
              Our car price is much higher than Taiwan besides fuel, and we charging almost the same price based on their 10 km rate. But sometimes, they can bargained for price. Our reporter only just do surface report, not transparent in depth report. Knn , if they really good n transparent, report the politics like Taiwan lah, knn no guts, only free to talk rubbish only,.
