            <div class='col-md body'><p>First I like to thank all bros here. But sad to say quite unhappy with the red engine bro who pick us from CCK to airport think car number SHD9xx. I did not negotiate terms or ask for discount as i want to sincerely support all taxi bros as much as i can especially you bros here in the forum. But it was not so, why.? On the day of the pick my 8 year old drop his mp3 on the rear seat. We did not notice it until we got back to SG. I call the red engine bro, he told me he will check with the hirer. About 15-20 minitues later he call yes "hirer" found the mp3. Had requested him to send it me and i am willing to reimburse him, he said ok .Wow i think on Wednesday he call me at about 4.30pm ask me if i want him to come from sengkang wtf think i rich man, i told him to go about his business first when he is nearer can bring over, by then almost 12am. i call him he say in Bukit Batok filling up. I say ok, come on lah I am a taxi uncle once why take advantage like that. Somemore my son's mp3 music all change to kennyG and other song which my son did not download at all. So bros here, what do think? if you are in my position and what would you have reacted? The issue here is not how much money i paid, is the insincerity. I have been following this forum all these while knowing one day i will be joining you bros and would very much like to be consider as myself a friend to you bros. Where we will be helping one another. That night when he came and rtn me the mp3, i can see on his face the tell tale sign of guilt.</p></div>

              <p>Hi Ty5102000,</p>
              <p>Komade and I are a team, sorry for the incident. About the MP3, will like to clarify...</p>
              <p>Firstly, Komade and I didn't know there's was a MP3 left behind, until much later. I didn't see it when he hand over the veh.  It was small and black, same colour as our seat and car mat or it could be only got shifted out after few pax "sit" and "move it" out.</p>
              <p>Secondly, we don't know whose customer left it, at the instance when I found, it could only think that it was the ang mo whom I sent to airport but I'm not certain. After few days, no claim is made,I pass to him.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, it's common for pax to leave things behind, umbrella, hp's case, bottles and etc.. (never needed nor sought a mp3, thinks it's not ex)</p>
              <p>Lastly, a few days later, you called and told him when you got back to SG that u left one. He returned to you when he can cook up story if he wants to, so consider this and please be fair to him.</p>

              <p>Regarding about the mp3. The kindheart cabby returned back the mp3 to you, you should thank the cabby and not compliant about him.Because he think the mp3 is the ang mo left behind. And the mp3 have been download other song &amp; music, you also have to thank the cabby for the downloading and not KAO PEH KAO BU!!!!!!!!! Put it another way, the cabby can just tell u he never see the mp3 at all you also LAN LAN!!! One more thing,dun ever mention the veh no. plate lah!!!!</p>

              Firstly, Antaosai i did not kao beh bu here. To me the incident happen this way and i see it as it is. True he can keep the mp3, i also lan lan what can i do. 
              Second, i like to apologise to Martin and his hirer for the misunderstanding. Should have called earlier which i did not, only realise it until we got back. I should not have posted the vehicle number sorry.
              Thirdly, thank you Poolman and bros here for your assistance and understanding. Thank You.
