              <p>U booked a normal taxi , for just $2.50 a booking , and you want cabby to wait for another 15 minutes cause your baby need to change diapers , cannot change earlier than the booking time ?</p>
              <p>Must change when the taxi arrived ?</p>
              <p>And instead of informing the drivers , what's going on ? They chose to load up their luaggages and wait , assuming we dare not throw their luggages out ?</p>
              <p>What if that driver late for 15 minutes ?</p>

              <p>I break into 30s, 40s and 50s</p>
              <p>Those who joined at 30s till now should be very good cabbies. However, their exposure to working class is still not there, and they better save, most will not encourage other in their 30s to join as cabbies if possible.</p>
              <p>Those who joined in their 40s, for a person, especially men, 40s is a dragon, and 60s become a worm, by 40s, most men would had stablised their career, less job hopping and more or less, prepare for the old age coming, those who join as cabbies at this age are most likely unable to get a decent job outside, retrenched, in debts, cannot take the order of superior, neglected or simply, a transition period for them to look for another opportunity. And those who 40s who drive since 30s, better stick to driving, even if you get a higher pay job to work, you will not like the system of working anymore than a cabby lifestyle which you have get so used to it.</p>
              <p>Those driving in their 50s, do not even need to think of getting a job outside of cabby, prepare to drive until 75yo. Those 60s and above can said to be passing time, unless you are in debt, married late or having childrens in later part of your life.</p>

              <p>Those who joined at 30s till now should be very good cabbies.
              However, their exposure to working class is still not there, and
              they better save, most will not encourage other in
              their 30s to join as cabbies if possible.</p>
              <p>Those who joined in their 40s, for a person, especially men, 40s
              is a dragon, and 60s become a worm, by 40s, most men would had
              stablised their career, less job hopping and more or less, prepare
              for the old age coming, those who join as cabbies at this age are
              most likely unable to get a decent job outside, retrenched, in
              debts, cannot take the order of superior, neglected or simply, a
              transition period for them to look for another opportunity. And
              those who 40s who drive since 30s, better stick to driving, even if
              you get a higher pay job to work, you will not like the system of
              working anymore than a cabby lifestyle which you have get so used
              to it.</p>
              <p>Those driving in their 50s, do not even need to think of
              getting a job outside of cabby, prepare to drive until 75yo. Those
              60s and above can said to be passing time, unless you are in debt,
              married late or having childrens in later part of your life.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>If u can, visit Taipei and take their cabs... It'd be an eye opener. In Taipei u get a discount for booking a cab. Likely because you won't have a problem flagging one down anywhere. It doesn't matter the weather or time of day or where u r. The fares are reasonable and the drivers are professional, friendly and polite to a fault. Actually other than some strange driving habits (the worst - stepping and letting go accelerator constantly) Singapore cabbies are pretty good. But this forum opens my eyes to what many are thinking or feeling while silently driving me to my destination.</div>
