              <p><strong>Taipei<br>10km fare (late-night surcharge applies from 11pm): NT$300 (US$9.20)</strong></p>
              <p>IN TAIPEI city, passengers wait just two minutes on average for a taxi, even during peak hours. <span style="color: #ff0000;">For a population of about 2.6million, there are 31,580 taxis - about one taxi for every 82 people. Singapore, with more than four million people and about 23,000 taxis, has one cab to 174 people.</span></p>
              <p>Taxi fares in Taipei are among the lowest in Taiwan even after a fare adjustment last November - the first hike in seven years. Companies can review fares every two years but are reluctant to do so, for fear of driving away passengers.</p>
              <p>Drivers work between 10 and 14hours a day and earn between NT$35,000 and NT$40,000 a month. Said cabby Yao Chung-ming, 55: 'I am against raising fares, it scares passengers away, especially when times are bad.'</p>

              <p>Ok, comparing to FIRST WORLD country as Sgp is FIRST WORLD already.</p>
              <p><strong>Tokyo<br>10km fare: 4,040 yen (US$36.70)</strong></p>
              <p>THE average yearly income of a cabby in Tokyo is 4.31million yen, almost 2.5million yen lower than the average for all industries.</p>
              <p>One reason for their lower income is that there is no limit on the number of cabs on the road. In March last year, there were 35,000 taxis, an increase of 2,000 since 1997.</p>
              <p>Most cabbies own their taxis and work for themselves. But some, like Mr Takahiro Furusawa, 48, are hired by a cab company and receive a commission on their earnings, with no basic pay. Under company rules, they cannot work more than 21 hours at a stretch, including rest breaks, and not more than 252 hours a month - that means 8.4 hours a day.</p>
              <p>Mr Furusawa is entitled to 20 paid holidays a year. 'Our income is based entirely on commissions, if we don't work, we don't get paid. So it's not a paid holiday,' he said.</p>

              <p>Taiwan do not just belong to tapei, and tokyo do not just represent Japan. although the population of tapei is less than singapore and tokyo about the same, the influx of their own peoples from outside tapei and tokyo is more than a million per day, together with tourists which both cities enjoyed most, you can expect a daily of 4 millions in taipei and 7millions in tokyo anytime.</p>

              <p>For your info, Tapei taxis ply by on call, their taxis are located everywhere, and the driver just rest waiting for on call, so you call at Taichong and within that place, the call will be despatch to the nearest and the taxi will arive as soon as possible, the amount of people moving in and out of tapei to return to their provinces is a also a lucurative business for both tapei and tokyo taxis, Singapore, what provinces you want to go?? the most changi and woodland or tuas or marina south within an hour ++.

              <p>You try taking taxi at narita airport tokyo and see how much they charge you for a distance between AP to Tuas, which is very common to them, it cost sing a hundred over dollars.</p>

              <p>If u can, visit Taipei and take their cabs… It’d be an eye opener. In Taipei u get a discount for booking a cab. Likely because you won’t have a problem flagging one down anywhere. It doesn’t matter the weather or time of day or where u r. The fares are reasonable and the drivers are professional, friendly and polite to a fault. Actually other than some strange driving habits (the worst – stepping and letting go accelerator constantly) Singapore cabbies are pretty good. But this forum opens my eyes to what many are thinking or feeling while silently driving me to my destination.</p>

              <p>I was replying to this post.</p>
              <p>The influx of foreigner brought about the increase loading of many essential service, transportation included.   The limitation on the growth of vehicle and the human traffic in the MRT or public bus will turn many to take Taxi.   When experiencing the heavy downpour like the one on 2nd Oct early morning, taxi will definitely in short supply, hence all the kpkb like that in the paper today.</p>
              <p>As cabby, this is good because we could have better taking.   As long as there is a paying pax with meter running + mid-nite surcharge, I am happy.  </p>
              <p>As for those ppl trying to flag down a taxi that very night outside River Valley Rd, Clememceau Ave and even at South Bridge Rd and Bras Basah Rd, i could not do anything liao.</p>
              <p>TD will have thougtht of their own, be it due to pax is non-chatty type, concentration on the road, personal thought ..., it depends, but mostly we keep to ourselves.  Golden rule is å°‘è¯´å°‘é”™ and ç¥¸ä»Žå�£å‡º.  Though we do not avoid conversation, we try to be tactful, diplomatic and politically correct as much as we could.</p>
