              There are more suffering from the social economic equivalent of short man syndrome here than anywhere else. All the angst and declaration of hostility against perceived slights from paying customers... Is that necessary? So in memory of Steve jobs, if u r so unhappy being a cabby, go do something else:
              
              "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it."

              <p>Doing what we love and earn a living with it? Not so easy. Very easy to say. Very hard to do. Most people are doing jobs to survive. The lucky ones enjoy it, the less lucky ones find it boring but stick around because they got no choice.</p>
              <p>You want to know what many love to do for a living? Many like gambling, but is there such a thing as a casino license that we can just apply and hope for approval within a month for a token fee here in Singapore or anywhere else? Of course not.</p>
              <p>Many like to pimp and have a stable of hot babes. But is there a straight forward procedure to apply for a brothel license anywhere in this world? Of course not.</p>
              <p>Many if not all taxi drivers wish we could own and run our own taxi. But again this is not possible in Singapore.</p>
              <p>We wish as taxi drivers that we can just advertise and tout our services around without breaking the law. Again it is illegal.</p>
              <p>As taxi drivers, most do not have much education. For many of them, indulging in a few sinful pleasures is how they pass their time. So you tell me, what else is out there that is profitable and pleasurable and nobody realised by now?</p>
              <p>So please do not try and be too smart and write dumb things. Steve Jobs is Steve Jobs. We neither have his brains nor his looks nor his luck nor his charm. I consider myself lucky that I enjoy driving and meeting people already. But there are many who enjoy neither but still got to cope with it. Life is hard for most people. Dun make stupid statements about finding something u enjoy and earn a living with it. It is just a pipe dream for most people.</p>

              <p>TD good what. Only minus point is no CPF, no MC, no leave....</p>
              <p>CPF I no need lah. Even is no CPF house still under loan then pay cash loh. Take it as saving, next time sell house can take back no like CPF must put back plus interest. Put money take money. No leave MC nevermind. If want to take a break just get a super relief one day only lose $30 nia. Every month I get incentive can cover 6 days rental. And plus point is I still got a vehicle at my disposal no need worry about maintanence, road tax, insurance, depreciation etc...</p>
              <p>My friend bought a 2.0 Wish @ $130K++ now paying monthly $1200++ after downpayment $5K yearly still got to pay insurance and road tax $2K+ plus petrol usage monthly $500 so he is like paying close to $1.7K a month haven't count servicing and tyre change, batt change, brake pad change all this xiao xiao pi pi stuff.</p>
              <p>I only paying about $2.4K monthly everthing taken care of. Drive a year contract finish want to change car also can. You try changing car after 1 year haha easily must lose $8-10K.</p>
              <p>This job good no need to travel to work. Once get out of the house start liao. Everyday can see money. Last time I work every month take pay buy this buy that KNN less then a week finish liao still must survive on my rental. Now every day earn at least can spend wisely rental goes directly to FD.</p>
              <p>And yess can watch soccer. Got mood go drive few round no mood keep. Flexible hours. Which job can give me? Do business? Open shop? Worst lah everyday must stay in shop no freedom. Cannot happy happy close shop right? Shop rental more ex then taxi rental leh. And you still need money to buy goods. Need money to travel to shop. Longer hours then taxi. LOL</p>

              <p>There are more suffering from the social economic equivalent of
                  short man syndrome here than anywhere else. All the angst and
                  declaration of hostility against perceived slights from paying
                  customers… Is that necessary? So in memory of Steve jobs, if u r so
                  unhappy being a cabby, go do something else:</p>
              <p>“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the
                  only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great
                  work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If
                  you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all
                  matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.”</p>

              <p>not everyone has the luxury of choosing one's job. not all paying customers are reasonable. as a taxi driver, we are here to make an honest living, not to be abused by unreasonable <span style="color: #ff0000;">paying</span> customers.</p>
              <p>only those who have been thru a taxi driver's daily routine will know the difficulties when unreasonable <span style="color: #ff0000;">paying</span> customer trying to find fault.</p>
              <p>who is steve jobs? to me he is just a shrewd bizman. read from the net, he make $5000 by getting his co-founder of apple, steve wozniak to do the work for him &amp; only pay him $375 &amp; pocketed the rest.</p>

              <p><br>That's not debt lah bro, that is asset, fixed asset. Even if you borrow to buy house, is consider a current asset with an accrued liability, meaning, the house is yours but any default in paying the loan, can end up with the bank taking back as mortage. And as time goes on, when you have finished servicing your loan, it become your fix asset, your property.</p>
              <p>Building house in viet has an advantages over our HDB, cos HDB has a liablitiy of only 99 years, guess vietnam is forever, freehold.</p>

              <p>I am a living example of both working in a company as freelance and also as a taxi driver, in my opinon, TD, may earn lesser, is much better in term of work, and I certainly more happier in driving taxis than those office work which have full of dirty politics, playing taichi, useless meeting, top down control and yet, have to share that piece of profit with those bosses who just give orders, and worst, you get the smallest piece and yet did the most work.</p>
              <p>As i said before, TD is like liang shan for some people here, you hv all kinds of heros coming into it, this trade provide an immediate startup SME business, meaning once you start driving, you are a businessman, beside rental and fuel, you share with no one your profit, you do not go around and play politics, which is unhealthy to the soul and body. More importantly, as many had said, own time, own target, you do not have to report anyone or see the same faces everyday. Day in and day out, you ply the road differently with different peoples, and that is enjoyable in a sense, rather than a norm 8 to 5 job that is so stagnate, non flexible and can get fired without even knowing what hit you.</p>
              <p>So, not to worry, TD are mostly a happy lots, there are more guys died of heart attack in office work than TD, and more died playing golf than driving a taxi.</p>
