              <p>Taxi driving is not a career and should not be treated as such.
              Once a Taxi Driver, forever a Taxi Driver. No chance of promotion
              to Taxi Inspector, etc...Bowah is a good example.</p>
              <p>Taxi Driving is not a Business too. If it is, Taxi Drivers
              should be the ones stating the costs for each trip.</p>
              <p>As long as Taxi Drivers have no say in the fare structrue, but
              have to pay a Fixed Rental! what business is this?</p>
              <p>Let's compare Hawkers and Taxi Drivers,</p>
              <p>Both have more or less the same advantages and
              disadvantages.</p>
              <p>Difference between Hawkers and Taxi Drivers is that Hawkers can
              set any price they want while Taxi Drivers cannot.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, best job to switch to! is a Hawker selling Char
              Quay Teow without Hum!</p>

              <p>Let have some food for thought,</p>
              <p>Whenever a baby is born, he or she alway cry, so, by saying, "cry for what, cry or no cry also already here, let get started"</p>
              <p>So for people who are in taxis trades, those in their 40s, it is best to carry on with what you are doing, cry here, cry there, no use, because you are already here, might as well enjoy and have fun with it. Human nature provide no room for stagnation, people like to move about,  but given not much of a choice, might as well stick with it.</p>
              <p>Seeing other good is not going to please a mind, because no matter what you do, you will tends to see someone better, once you are able to master the thinking of no regret, no lose and no win, no glory and no championing, and instead, help the unfortunate ones, have confident in providing service to others, make a happy family and focus on what you have and what you are doing as a living. That smile will visit your face more often.</p>
              <p>But then, there are choices in life, but as you age, your choices get narrowed, and then, at the end of the day, let be frank, how long can we live.</p>

              <p>and for hotel lines, today it is one of the best and booming, you can get headhunter anywhere, got a PR pinoy friend who work in a local restuarant as captain, with 3k paid, get head hunter by some top up market restuarant, I asked him, say, how much they offer you, and why your old boss never counter offer you, he said his old boss cannot afford to counter offer, because the paid offered by upmarket restuarant is 7k.</p>
