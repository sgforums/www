              </p><p>This government don't turn me to become a TD, my education is low, my type of jobs is limited.........I choose TD out of my own will, because is 1 of the so many jobs that belong to my level, my level of school low low type..........</p><p>
              
              </p><p>People who at my level will understand what I meant........so I'm lucky, I found myself a full time job, but as a CEO? or Director? or General Manager? or Chief Engineer?..........NO!......still a job belonging to my level...........</p><p>

              <p>As I said before, in life there are choices, and once your choices become wide spread like buffet, you will tends to be more flexible and marketable.</p>
              <p>Given many had tasted TD, good or bad, they tends to compare with their former jobs/trade, so it is up to individual to weight for themselves the pros and cons, what suit you and what is best for you, and also how happy you think you will be going into it, and the most important, is how healthy you get, psychologicially speaking, once you are happy  in what you are doing, your health will improve, and once you are not happy with what you are doing, depression set in</p>
