              One basic thing that never mentioned here is inflation.
              
              Pay increment for an employee is basically to combat inflation.
              
              TD does not have pay increment over the years except when meter fare is adjusted or new rules on surcharges are implemented.
              
              Bascically annual income is about the same
              
              A TD that drives over 10 years and a rookie driving two years may have the same income with the assumption that they both have the same driving hours and roughly the same effort.
              
              Is a very montoneous and stangnant job in view of income increment.

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>The TD will alway be in the lower scheme of paid structure against inflation, why? because the increases in rental and fuel will hamper TDs income.</p>
              <p>For last few years, the average inflation at 5.5% is making TD cost of living even harder, so for a real wage increase, which many companies had increase 7 to 10% this years is to first, curb inflation and at the same time increase paid, so given an 8%, which I get increased even as a contractor, you take off 5.5% inflation, our real increment is only 2.5%, this is call real wage increment, if a company increase 3%, it is not an increment, it is actually a lost in term of inflation.</p>
              <p>So for TD to really overcome the inflation, they need to earn at least a 5.5% more per day of their usual income, and that is only the breakeven, they need to do more adding another 3 to 5% more income per day of their normal, totally about 8 to 10% more of the usual daily intake inorder to sustain a real income increase.</p>

              <p>Good, nice to see a happy chief, hopefully what you learned and experienced can translate into wisdom, many of us are actually very experienced and learned people, just that some are unable to express it out or align it in proper sequences, but that is how we are, as herding creature, we tends to herd together in our own sphere of influence, Casket driver with casket buddies, TD with taxis buddies, and so on.</p>
              <p>It is within this herd of our own, we find happiness and friendship and even best friend and brothers, we therefore have to treasure and cherish them as they make us happy and cheerful and more importantly, the only audiences that listen to our stories.</p>
