            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Just curious abt how many would rather like a different job than taxi driving, if given a chance, or actually scout around for one.</p>
              <p>Of course don't start comparing with 'super jobs' that offer salaries way above what you earn now as a TD. Like that who don't want, become a manager, sit behind a desk and draw 5k or more a month.</p>
              <p>No I'm talking about jobs that offer the same salary scale, maybe slightly more, say perhaps say a friend asks you to run his shop at 2-3k a month, or even if you really want a high paying job but very labour intensive - working on Jurong island or similar.</p>
              <p>My friend works there reading oil samples, can easily clock 3k  a month, if really push can hit 4-5k a month (incl OT).</p>
              <p>But that job not easy, must climb up stairs, be very safety conscious and work 10 - 12 hour stretches sometimes.</p>
              <p>Would you rather give up the flexibility that comes with TD driving for a confirmed rice bowl that doesn't have the negative impact or risks that go with TDriving?</p>
              <p>These of course include</p>
              <p>A) Being on the road everyday (thus a possibility of getting into a serious accident is much higher than other jobs - doesn't mean you hv to hit someone, others can also hit you and leave in in a bad way)</p>
              <p>B) Work sitting down for long hours - not healthy for the body. Causes stomach ailments at the very least, to things like diabetes, high blood and heart attacks at the other end.</p>
              <p>C) No Bonus / No Fixed Salary. If the economy stalls, then almost certainly your takings will go down as well.</p>
              <p>D) No Health Policies - If you fall sick you're on your own. Loss of income auto, but if you need to be hospitalised etc, it's your own cash. You hv to buy your own policies if you can afford it.</p>
              <p>E) No annual leave or confirmed paid off days. You want to take leave or off, you don't get paid, sometimes you even hv to pay to take leave/off - rental charges.</p>
              <p>F) Facing All Sorts of Wackos - Being in service industry or serving the public, you'll definitely have your own bad experiences, far more than someone working in an office environment.</p>
              <p>G) No CPF/Medisave - You want, you put yourself.</p>
              <p>H) Summonses - Again being on the road, it's not a question of if but when you'll get one and how many too.</p>
              <p>I) No Job Security / Retirement Benefits - Your ability to remain a TD depends entirely on your ability to drive and the amount of hours you put into it. If you can't drive = No money. If you tire easily and can't drive longish hours, you earn less.</p>
              <p>And of course, if really unfortunate:</p>
              <p>J) Victim of a crime - You hv a higher chance of being robbed, assaulted, cheated and in some cases - murdered, than most jobs in Singapore. As a lone ranger, some criminals see TDs as easy targets. True it's low here compared to other countries but it still happens and there's a small percentage that you could be that unfortunate statistic.</p>
              <p>So it's not easy being a TD, despite what is written and said by netizens, press reports and the general public. Of course they are some benefits/advantages  - if not, one would be crazy to drive a cab, but you have to overcome the obstacles listed above to make this job work for you.</p>
              <p>And of course, any other less taxing job that offers similar types of salary also has it's pros and cons.</p>
              <p>Would you consider them at some point or just prefer to make TDriving your final job in life, unless of course a really lucrative job offer comes that makes it obvious to change professions.</p>
              <p>I'll offer my own observations later.</p>

              <p>so far for me ..... haven't found any special jobs i love besides driving a cab that suits my lifestyle more . </p>
              <p>i drove a cab becos i love soccer , watching them , from EPL , to Spanish soccer , Bundesliga , and every 2 years once World Cup and European Championship .</p>
              <p>Now even better , can see Euro Under 21 Championship on TV as well .</p>
              <p>First and foremost , i love playing badminton .</p>
              <p>No jobs offers me the flexibility to play badminton which did not afftect my work .</p>
              <p>I dun think any job in the world would allow me to play badminton on every Tuesday and Thursday .</p>
              <p>Unless maybe i be my own boss like my fellow team mates , but again being your own boss has got different investments , efforts , commitments and stress .</p>
              <p>Thta's all about myself .</p>

              <p>Hahaha, but the company prefers younger workers la. Need to be fit for that kind of job, my friend is nearly 40 but an exception because he's very fit. Even I cannot get this kind of job, don't have the physical attributes needed.</p>
              <p>Most of the staff are in mid to late 20s and early 30s.</p>
              <p>But if you really wanna make good cash outside driving try finding jobs in the oil sector, island jobs, off shore surveying - these all very good pay, but can be quite risky (thats why pay is high) and involves a lot of effort and physical strength.</p>

              <p>Hahaha, but the company prefers younger workers la. Need to be
              fit for that kind of job, my friend is nearly 40 but an exception
              because he's very fit. Even I cannot get this kind of job, don't
              have the physical attributes needed.</p>
              <p>Most of the staff are in mid to late 20s and early 30s.</p>
              <p>But if you really wanna make good cash outside driving try
              finding jobs in the oil sector, island jobs, off shore surveying -
              these all very good pay, but can be quite risky (thats why pay is
              high) and involves a lot of effort and physical strength.</p>

              <p>For me, I think quite hard to switch. I'm too idle already.</p>
              <p>KNN expect me to get up every morning, struggle in early morning rush to get to work, then after work if wanna go out, must come home by certain to catch sleep for tomorrow work, cannot watch football in peace, only look forward to Saturday for activity - walau dunno how to say.</p>
              <p>Then must budget salary carefully (if pay is once a month), now if wanna or need extra cash, drive a bit longer or become less idle, after achieving targets can auto go into relax mode.</p>
              <p>No need for boss to bark orders or report to anyone, especially if your supervisor or boss is a blur cock, who gives stupid instructions that's not practical, but you gotta to follow because you lower rank. All this agrravation not needed.</p>
              <p>Plus must have fixed time of work, damn sian, now can work 5hr, 6hr, 7hr etc, suka suka one.</p>
              <p>So I am quite content to drive cab for the foreseeable future.</p>
              <p>However there is 1 job I might consider, 2 of my close friends are studying to become lawyers. If either of them are able to have their own practise, then maybe I might be tempted to join them as a paralegal - that is to help them prepare cases, interview clients and assist them in their jobs. Since I like to witness the legal process in action, this job scope would interest me. Moreover it will probably take them another 7 - 10 years before they have the experience and resources to set up their own firm, by that time, I might even too idle to drive anymore, so a desk job might not be a bad idea afterall.</p>
              <p>Of course the pay must be attractive, must at least match my cab earnings at the very least.</p>
              <p>1 other thing I am also giving some thought is to be a hawker. To have my own stall, if I have the resources and cash to invest in say 5-10 years time, I might it give it a shot.</p>
              <p>But all this in the future one, now I am quite happy to be a cabby for the next 7-10 years at least, provided of course I don't kena given my marching orders or red card by the Boss up there, sending off from the Earth's pitch.</p>

              <p>Let's compare Hawkers and Taxi Drivers,</p>
              <p>Both have more or less the same advantages and disadvantages.</p>
              <p>Difference between Hawkers and Taxi Drivers is that Hawkers can set any price they want while Taxi Drivers cannot.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, best job to switch to! is a Hawker selling Char Quay Teow without Hum!</p>
