              <p>So to all commuters , use your brain when make a booking .</p>
              <p>When raining cats and dogs , why bother to wait for a cab by the road side ?</p>
              <p>And when desperate , then call-a-cab .</p>
              <p>And when saw another cab , hop in and never cancell .</p>
              <p>And when taxis never turn up , put all the blames on cabbies ?</p>

              <p>Working in Jurong Island , should try Prime instead .</p>

              <p>Because normal non-corporate CDG customers , u will lose out to Corporate customers of CDG , they are always on Priorities , cab-charge holders have a special hotline , and this hotline is prioritised for their own Corporate paxes .</p>

              <p>Not every time is the TD's fault you know? Do you know pax also
              hi-jack taxis?!</p>
              <p>Don't think the TDs played that pax out, but more like got
              hi-jacked by other pax claiming to be her... These situations
              always happen when calls burst, like on rainny days esp. during
              rush hr...</p>
              <p>So, always good to leave names and destination when booking a
              cab, so no hi-jackers can get in the way! (Oops! Too bad for those
              Taxi Co. that not able to do that...)</p>
              <p>I even encounter a shameless pax just rushed onto my cab and
              claim that she's the one who booked my cab but wanted to change
              destination but her mobile and name dosen't tally with the booking
              system at all, so I told her my booking is $45 airport transfer,
              then she LL got off and let the real pax board my cab...</p>
