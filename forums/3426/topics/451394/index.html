              <p>Chief, fellas...</p>
              <p>I've always felt that this forum is not for those whites who due to some mysterious reasons best known to themselves, think they are superior to nomal cab TDs. Or maybe they have a complex and feel they have to "excel" somewhere.</p>
              <p>Ppl like komade, mercab, JDIL and some others who genuinely come here to TCSS, contribute and not to show off will know what I mean.</p>
              <p>These "Tua Kees" therefore come in here and action here, action there. What know <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EVERY</span></strong> LTA rules &amp; regulations and dun teach him how to run, wage (wager lah, phui) at william hill, etc, etc.. Wake up lah, EVERY...phui!</p>
              <p>Chief, if these cockups wanna pechah their own lobangs, let them. Why let your goodwill be misunderstood?</p>
              <p>Best way to deal with these types is to ignore them...TOTALLY! After a while, they will leave tail-between-legs.</p>
              <p>P/s..sorry chief, feel I really have to start this new thread.</p>

              <p>Techno , cool it , u'll get used to it .</p>
              <p>For some , forum is a form of learning , some treat it as lesiure , some treat it as making more friends , i certainly make alot of friends inside this circle , some serious genuine friends .Some treat it as TCSS .</p>
              <p>I can never never stop anything going thru here , the only thing i can do , it's like a role of a fireman , water when got fire .</p>
