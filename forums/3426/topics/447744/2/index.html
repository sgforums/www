              <p>Map just google it, why need to go cabby sg??</p>
              <p>The most important is not how passenger is, it is how you reflect/prove yourself to passengers, if you had been looking fierce, talk with strength and power, that indian would had to think twice before running fare.</p>
              <p>If you drive nite, you know most are clubbing goers or nite owl peoples with more rubbish than good, you do not need to so polite and nice, the initial asking is very critical, like me, see few ah nehs with tattoo boarding my cab,</p>
              <p>"Hello, WHERE you want to GO!!! one stop ONLY ok!!"</p>
              <p>you see their reaction like blur blur, then politely said, "Uncleee..can, we only need to go to buffalo street", even if they want to rob or run fare, still hv to think twice once I roll up my sleeve to show my Bak kua tattoo.</p>

              <p>Dear onecabby,</p>
              <p>The more you post, the more it sound like a make up imaginary story to me (pardon me if I am wrong), but anyway, let play along with the CSI.</p>
              <p>1. A culprit will always think and plan ahead of the victim, because he knows what he is going to do and act whereas you, the victim can only have suspicious.</p>
              <p>2. When people wants to commit a run fare, what do you expect, slowly open the door, walk like an ah pek? or jog like an uncle me,  he is sure to be ready to sprint. Even if you lock the door, so what, he can also flip the to open at his pax side.</p>
              <p>3. Indian in Singapore are know to be good runner, and who on earth can anyone beat him? if the men from the temple or you were 1st, you would had caught him? Quite a funny statement here.</p>
              <p>There is no mistake in you, for the last half an hour, you are thinking and planning the road with just a wary note on the paxs, but for that same half an hour, the pax is already thinking and planing on cheating you.</p>
