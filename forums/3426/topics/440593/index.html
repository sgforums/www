              </p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">As related
              by a blue sonata cabby friend <strong>(Richard</strong>)
              of mine:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; "> </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Richard
              was looking for a lot in an open-air car park of a hawker centre during his
              lunch break and he noticed a silver Kia on his left preparing to leave. All
              lots on his right are season lots. Judging that the Kia is not ready to leave
              soon, he circled to the other side looking for other lots.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Unsuccessful,
              he returned to the Kia’s lot and as he was approaching the Kia (about 12 lots
              away), a car left its lot about 4 lots away from Richard’s left. Richard
              stopped to allow the car to pass and was pleased that he got a lot as the car park
              was crowded at the time.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Suddenly,
              from nowhere, a driver in a black BMW (<strong>ASS</strong>)
              dashed from the opposite direction and reversed into the lot. ASS, in his
              haste, did not manage to park properly in his first attempt. As the Kia just
              left his lot, Richard inched forward to indicate that he wanted to pass. ASS
              immediately dashed forward again blocking the path of both Richard and the Kia.
              He looked at Richard angrily and refused to reverse back. After several
              seconds, ASS finally reversed into his lot.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Richard
              shook his head in disgust but continued towards the lot vacated by the Kia.
              However, a van was already preparing to reverse into the lot. Cursing his bad
              luck, Richard waited for the van to park. Whilst waiting, Richard noticed from
              his rear view mirror that ASS has left his car and was walking towards his cab
              gesturing to Richard with his index finger insultingly, summoning him. “wtf, u
              took my lot, make me lose another and I must report to u for lecture? Who u
              think u are!” Richard thought. Richard ignored him and continued his search but
              noticed that ASS had angrily took out his mobile and started snapping shots of
              his cab.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">As Richard
              circled around to the other side of the car park, ASS continued to pursue Richard
              obviously wanting a confrontation. Richard was really irritated and wound down
              his window and showed ASS the big BIRD so that he can BACK OFF.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Richard
              finally parked at roughly the opposite side of the car park where ASS parked. ASS
              had followed Richard for 60-70 metres round the car park on foot just for a
              confrontation. As Richard got out and closed the door of the cab, ASS
              approached menacingly and with his face barely 2-3 cm away from Richard’s, yelled:
              “why you show middle finger at me?” Richard thought he was about to get
              assaulted but stood his ground and retorted: “so, you going to assault me for a
              small matter like this? Fxxx you!”</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Realising
              that Richard wasn’t that easy to bully, ASS changed tactics and started
              taunting Richard to repeat what was just said so he could tape down the
              conversation. “I’m going to complain to your company. You all taxi drivers….”
              Richard walked off towards the hawker centre not wanting to hear any further
              insults. On looking back, Richard found ASS still hanging around his cab. Richard
              returned to his cab and fearing for the cab and his safety, decided to call the
              police and report of harassment and attempted assault. ASS continued to taunt
              him and challenged Richard to stay and “settle” the matter and wait for the
              police. Richard ignored him and went to the hawker centre to order food.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Two
              constables arrived in a patrol car about 2 minutes later and listened to Richard’s
              complaint. ASS was nowhere to be found. When asked to identify the car, Richard
              could not as in the lot where Richard remembered ASS parked was a black Volvo!
              “Is this the car, I thought it was a BMW! I’m seldom wrong about such things.
              Maybe he had left” Richard thought.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; ">I
              feel that Richard’s dignity and rights had been violated. ASS obviously thought
              he had the upper hand and could bully someone who he thought could not
              retaliate.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial;    ">Your
              thoughts on this, fellas!</span><p></p>

              <p>Thanx bro for the benefits of yr exp and moral suport. i'm sure richard will appreciate it. According to richard, the 999 hotline asked for his phone no, so he thought no point wasting time waiting.</p>
              <p>Furthermore there could be more taunting and he (richard) may not be able to hold back anymore.</p>
              <p>richard is just waiting for the compliant to come.</p>

              To think in the USA they dun give a fuck about driving tests, morality tests, road rules mugging and all that shit and even allow the age to be stuck at 15, yet Singapore has the world's craziest drivers whose manner PALE in comparison to those of the american drivers. 
              
              tsk tsk. shows you the utter failure of the singapore driving and educational system. what are our teachers telling our kids? its ok to fight as long aas you do well? results are everything right? look what happened here. the BMW driver got his 'result'.
