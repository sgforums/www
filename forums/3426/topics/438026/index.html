              <p>Let me answered that .</p>
              <p>Fatigue is the main cause .</p>
              <p>Tired but earning just so-so .</p>
              <p>Not worth it .</p>
              <p>Some people Ego very strong one , cannot tolerate people scold or criticised or even reprimanded . Ego hurt , quit .</p>
              <p>Some really in need of CPF , regardless of basic salary is good or not . They felt safer to have consistent contribution for the needs like Housing and Children Education .</p>
              <p>Some joined because of severe debt ...... they settled the debt and move on to the trade they love most . Because driving a cab it's unlike being employed , driving a cab can have cold hard cash everyday , being employed is like paid monthly , banks really cannot wait til u got paid , cos the interests keep generating . Pay machiam never pay .</p>

              <p>That is why i say all the time , if u have not got a flat from HDB , and own one , pls stay away from driving a cab , because PAP government do not like to grant loans to taxi drivers , pls believe me .</p>
              <p>Make use of getting employed , and with relevant paperworks like IRAS , and CPF contributions , to get loans from PAP government , when got a flat , fuck your employer ! Sack the bugger ! And drive a cab .</p>
              <p>I believe , if discipline , any cabbies can pay out their Home Loans in CASH !!!</p>

              <p>In the case of retiring ....</p>
              <p>Pls purchase a good insurance , regardless of Payout upon maturity .</p>
              <p>Low payout , meaning lower premium .</p>
              <p>If one can afford $400 premium per month , their payout is relatively good , well , i am so sure now u can get at least $60K until the age of 51 .</p>
              <p>I bought mine in 3 months after i start driving a cab .</p>
              <p>Now i still being covered .</p>

              <p>The Taxi companies are not worrying about dropping out as long as there are incoming, and if incoming can overcome the outgoing, no problem, the more incoming, the more better for them. New vehicle, new rules and new engine is sure to entice peoples to come in, moreover, with an influx of young FTs, most local middle age guys who are outdated or so called full ultilised with a stagnate paid will choose to be born free again, and taxis is the other option open for them.</p>
              <p>Govt, on the other hand, can alway control the intake, if there is a short of driver, input more FTs to the market to get locals out. I for once am was a victim of FTs inputs, an indian FTs become my boss, so I  quit and become a freelance. Many locals do not like a middle class foreign boss, after working for so many years, what is loyalty, not only me, even my most hardworking colleagues is unable to secure a promotion to be our boss, instead, an indian from a india subsidary was call in to rule over us, along he bring his kakis and force you out. Wonder if our govt purposely make it this way, so that we become TDs.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think drive taxi most important is consistent. business market consistent. car performance and costs consistent. driver consistent. if any one not consistent, then things might change and can become problem. hungry or yao or desperate is not a good long term strategy, it is at most for short term can. i also know some people who drive taxi very slow and relax, but they dont quit because they are retired or bored at home but they dont need a lot of income, or some people that quit driving because they realzie they got look down by others, even friends and family</div>
