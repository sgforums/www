              <p>Fellow cabbies,</p>
              <p>Among various jobs, taxi driving is a rather hazardous job. More so if we push ourselves to earn more. I have always told myself that I must be prepared if I meet my fate on the road (choi choi touch wood). As careful as I try to be, one never knows the future because other drivers can make mistakes.</p>
              <p>1. Have u ever wondered what happens if you are a single bachelor TD with no close relatives?</p>
              <p>If your body is not claimed within 24 hrs, it will be used by surgeons to practise on.</p>

              <p>2. If you are a non-muslim, did you know your organs will be forcibly removed and transplanted into a suitable recipient? </p>

              <p>Now I have nothing against helping other people who are dying, but hey taking my organs out even if relatives object can be very traumatic. So I have chosen to opt out here.</p>

              <p>How difficult is it to identify your body? Got finger prints, Singapore citizens bingo in a few seconds. Only unidentified, unclaimed bodies are considered for medical uses.

              <p>i was worried that the old woman would get knock down and also worried for the driver because it was actually the old woman's fault who did not look out before crossing.</p>
              <p>each time when accidents happen, many people will blame the driver which is not true all the time.</p>

              <p>The most common type of organ transplant is the kidney. HOTA only covers kidney, liver, heart and corneas. So as far as organ donor priviledge goes, it mostly applies to kidneys. </p>
              <p><br>If one is poor, one is unlikely to be able to afford the waiting time for say a kidney. For many poor people, early death may be a more attractive option than a prolonged life that results in even more financial difficulties.</p>
              <p>If one is rich, buying a kidney poses little problems.</p>
              <p>The highest chance of finding a good organ donor-recipient match is from one's siblings. For such cases, dont even need to queue up if the sibling or relatives are willing to help.</p>
              <p>Waiting list for a kidney is in term of years. This organ donor priviledge act benefits only a small minority of people. Have you seen the anguish on the relatives faces when their loved ones die, and the surgeon shoos them away and remove a kidney from their deceased loved one?</p>
              <p>Really all these laws are only concerned with helping out the medical community. The surgeons need corpses to practise on, the organ transplant team needs ready access to fresh organs to ply their trade. The plastic surgeons need bodies to perfect their art. But the medical community is not willing to pay for dead bodies. A fresh corpse is worth a lot of money. Why else is the SGH mortuary surrounded by high fences with many red notice boards saying "protected place". The mortuary is actually the most secure place in the whole hospital. Why? Because dead bodies are more valuable than living diseased bodies lying in the wards.</p>
