              <p>Pai Seh, I am culprit : p  Last week pax from Tiong Bahru Plaza ask where all of you Taxi Driver go?!?! I waited half an hr. I told her got la. Many Taxi driver need provide food for the family one, for $7 will still plough like a cow. But small percentage like me need to rest. I know peak period charge la, but turn here turn there fare only $7-9. I might as well take care of my health and take a break. Not say pia already can see money. Pia also see peanut. Straight to the point! If fare is profiting, you no need ask! All TD will rest less and work harder. This kind of CB fare, risk accident, risk illness, risk guai lan pax, risk China Ferrari, Worth it or not?!?! Stop thinking TDs chin ho tan. LJ road tax is $6000. Your ah gong sit down there no need do anything collect $500 off Taxi companies every month! Havn't calculate diesel tax. I got no family to feed. I can drive $140 and stop. Pay rental then pay diesel. $15 dollars I take dinner. I still can keep my health.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pai Seh, I think TD's life quite tough. I always encourage fellow TDs la kopi more. Health and life more important. $8 rob you off a well deserved break, worth it meh? Again the 4 BIG risk i mention is very real. TD's do die from it.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-medium;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Availability of taxis to be
              improved<br> <br></span> Following constant public feedback about the
              difficulties in getting a cab, a tripartite workgroup - comprising
              the Land Transport Authority, the National Taxi Association (NTA)
              and the taxi operators - has been formed to improve availability of
              taxis on the roads, NTA adviser Seng Han Thong told reporters
              yesterday.<br> <br> It is looking into ways to incentivise more drivers to utilise
              their taxis fully, said Mr Seng, who was speaking at the sidelines
              of an event to launch a book about cabbies' experiences.<br> <br> According to Mr Seng, about 40 per cent of the 27,000 taxis here
              are "one-man operations". Mr Seng would not be drawn on the
              possibility of the high COEs leading to more taxi drivers using
              their vehicles as personal transport. "As far as I know, they are
              earning a living," Mr Seng said.<br> <br> Still, there is feedback from taxi drivers that it is difficult to
              find suitable relief drivers, in order to utilise the taxis for two
              shifts a day. To address this, a nationwide data sharing system
              will be set up to better match drivers, Mr Seng said. The workgroup
              is working on the technical details, said Mr Seng, who did not say
              when the system will be ready.<br> <br> When contacted, ComfortDelGro spokesperson Tammy Tan said: "We do,
              of course, encourage our drivers to utilise the vehicle to its
              maximum potential".<br> <br> She reiterated that it is the drivers' prerogative how to utilise
              their vehicles, "especially since they may well end up out of
              pocket if they choose not to ply the road for fares for a large
              part of the day". About 80 per cent of ComfortDelGro's
              16,000-strong fleet of taxis operate on double shifts, Ms Tan
              said.<br> <br> SMRT Taxis director Tony Heng said that his company - which owns
              about 3,200 taxis - consider its cabbies "to be self-employed".
              "Thus, it is in their best interest to put their taxis to optimum
              economic use," he said.<br> <br> Mountbatten Member of Parliament Lim Biow Chuan - who sits on the
              Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for transport - felt the
              issue is a grey area: If a taxi driver needs to, for example, drive
              his wife somewhere, it is "only logical" that he uses his vehicle
              to do so, he noted.<br> <br> Mr Lim suggested that taxi operators track the usage of taxis based
              on the mileage or the fares collected. "The taxi companies could
              charge the drivers based on the desired mileage. If the taxi is
              used more, they could be charged a lower rental," said Mr
              Lim.</em></span></p>

              <p>Apparently they have forgotton about the Sonotas which caught fire recently.Who was responsible?</p>
              <p>Correct me if I am wrong. There is no car which can be driven 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. </p>
              <p>While they keep quiet about the fired up Sonotas, they create a Tripartite workgropup to discuss on ways to keep cabs on the road and the result would always be an increase in rentals for Taxi Drivers.</p>
              <p>Another point I would like to make is that while Taxi Fares are low here while compared with other countries, same cannot be said for the rentals Taxi Drivers pay.</p>

              <p>If rental is lower, fares would also be lower. Maybe we can also get rid of all those confusing surcharges which has led to many arguments especially with tourists who think they are being taken for a ride.</p>
              <p>If rental is lower, passengers would definetely be happy. Taxi drivers may not be happy because of lower fares and no surcharges. Authorities, Govt, NTA, tripartite whatever would definetely not be happy because of less money. Hmmmm...who should we please?</p>
