              <p><em>More may obtain a taxi licence to rent cabs for personal use instead of plying the roads</em></p>
              <em>SINGAPORE - At a time when sky-high Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums are dissuading Singaporeans from owning car, they could, ironically, find it more difficult to get taxis. <br><br>Previously, tales of taxi drivers who worked only a few hours a day, earning just enough to cover rental and overheads, and use their vehicles mostly for personal needs, were not uncommon. <br><br>But these days, more people could possibly be getting taxi licences for the wrong reasons - as suggested by Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew in a press interview published yesterday. <br><br>Noting how, with the exception of those owned by ComfortDelGro, taxis are hired out mostly to cabbies who drive a single shift per day, Mr Lui said the authorities "need to be even more vigilant about this ... because now driving a taxi can, with high COE prices, become a substitute for owning a car". <br><br>Taxi rentals here range between S$64 and S$116. And unlike car owners, taxi drivers do not need to pay for servicing, insurance or road tax. <br><br>Cabbie Eugene Kwok, 45, said he would not be surprised if high COE prices prompted more people to hire a taxi instead of buying a car.<br><br>Another cabbie, Mr Ismail, 47, told TODAY he has heard of fellow taxi drivers who only drive "part time" to recover costs - high COEs or not. <br><br>As a result, commuters suffer: To maximise their earnings in the shortest period of time, these taxi drivers would only pick up passengers at places with surcharges such as the airport or the integrated resorts, or customers on short trips within the Central Business District during peak hours, Mr Ismail said. <br><br>He added: "It is the freedom of being able to plan our own schedules that appeals most to cabbies."</em>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="font-size: x-medium;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Availability of taxis to be improved <br><br></span>Following constant public feedback about the difficulties in getting a cab, a tripartite workgroup - comprising the Land Transport Authority, the National Taxi Association (NTA) and the taxi operators - has been formed to improve availability of taxis on the roads, NTA adviser Seng Han Thong told reporters yesterday.<br><br>It is looking into ways to incentivise more drivers to utilise their taxis fully, said Mr Seng, who was speaking at the sidelines of an event to launch a book about cabbies' experiences. <br><br>According to Mr Seng, about 40 per cent of the 27,000 taxis here are "one-man operations". Mr Seng would not be drawn on the possibility of the high COEs leading to more taxi drivers using their vehicles as personal transport. "As far as I know, they are earning a living," Mr Seng said. <br><br>Still, there is feedback from taxi drivers that it is difficult to find suitable relief drivers, in order to utilise the taxis for two shifts a day. To address this, a nationwide data sharing system will be set up to better match drivers, Mr Seng said. The workgroup is working on the technical details, said Mr Seng, who did not say when the system will be ready. <br><br>When contacted, ComfortDelGro spokesperson Tammy Tan said: "We do, of course, encourage our drivers to utilise the vehicle to its maximum potential". <br><br>She reiterated that it is the drivers' prerogative how to utilise their vehicles, "especially since they may well end up out of pocket if they choose not to ply the road for fares for a large part of the day". About 80 per cent of ComfortDelGro's 16,000-strong fleet of taxis operate on double shifts, Ms Tan said. <br><br>SMRT Taxis director Tony Heng said that his company - which owns about 3,200 taxis - consider its cabbies "to be self-employed". "Thus, it is in their best interest to put their taxis to optimum economic use," he said. <br><br>Mountbatten Member of Parliament Lim Biow Chuan - who sits on the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for transport - felt the issue is a grey area: If a taxi driver needs to, for example, drive his wife somewhere, it is "only logical" that he uses his vehicle to do so, he noted. <br><br>Mr Lim suggested that taxi operators track the usage of taxis based on the mileage or the fares collected. "The taxi companies could charge the drivers based on the desired mileage. If the taxi is used more, they could be charged a lower rental," said Mr Lim.</em></span></p></div>

              they may do reverse rental deduction method, like ezlink
              
              like when you board the bus, when you operator log in start drive taxi, they will deduct a fix highest rental from you operator first (this can be from deposit or advance rent payment). then at the end of the day when you log out, they will refund back part of that rental according to the distance and number of passengers you take that day (or can be that week or that month depending how they set).
              
              but the refund might not be same day, maybe next month, to motivate the driver to keep driving on, or as incentive cashback, or only at the end of contract
              
              if someone says forget to log in log out (they can monitor who is hardworking who is not), then bye bye $! then after X number of times, that person can be penalised or blacklisted or even terminated.
              
              they can break up the distance, number of passengers as well area of pickup, into stages or tiers. like first 250km how much rental discount..first 25 passengers another rental discount..the driver may also need to clock in how many pickup from which specific location thats another how much rental discount...then every next 25km, every next 2 passengers, every next airport or cruise centre pickup another level of discount etc etc
              
              but inversely if you less than for example minimum 200km, less than 20 passengers, less than total 2 pickups from airport and cruise centre a day, then they will impose an additional rental surcharge!
              
              ANY WAY THEY WIN!

I dun think more than 1 percent of the taxis rented out is for own usage, and their figures dun really tally. Hey, you think driving part time can earn your taxi and fuel cost easily, if hire out shift, you can only use the vehicle at your shift, and dun get he freedom to travel around all time day and night. Must get Ah Teo, Ah Seng and Ah Lim to take off at their current duties, and drive at least 1 week of taxi on the road to see for themselves. A week day, a week night. </p></div>

              <p>Bro, sometime we stfu but end up also get screwed and banged by them, these people got no limitation in squeezing the lower rank of the society, the matter that they are rich is because we are squeezed.</p>
              <p>And if you look at the fcuking /news/issue properly, out of no where, no prove, no relevancy, they said taxis become harder to flag down, and all because of a thing they themselve created, COE, what the fuck got COE got to do with flagging in TD???? knnccb</p>
