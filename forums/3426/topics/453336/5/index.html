              <p>If rental is lower, fares would also be lower. Maybe we can also get rid of all those confusing surcharges which has led to many arguments especially with tourists who think they are being taken for a ride.</p>
              <p>If rental is lower, passengers would definetely be happy. Taxi drivers may not be happy because of lower fares and no surcharges. Authorities, Govt, NTA, tripartite whatever would definetely not be happy because of less money. Hmmmm...who should we please?</p>

              <p><br>Up till now, you should know how our govt operate their ever increment of everything, if you said, yes yes, there are some fuel price lowered, and some perks in rental to cover back abit, maybe some 2 more days free rental and so on.</p>
              <p>I called  it reverse cost of expansion.  Govt or business peoples alway work in a way of increasing cost of goods and taxes progressively in silent mode. Progressively and slowly increase the prices of rental, fares and other cost of goods and taxation, each increases will await for the the ground to cool down, then increase again, and when times fuel prices (one of the main agent in cost of goods) goes down, things goes down only abit, and that the govt or Cos give it a big news.</p>

              <p>In working condition we like to use the term real wage to better reflect actual earning of individual against inflation and other higher cost of living. If you said inflation is 5% and wages increase by 5%, it is consider as no increment,</p>
              <p>And if wages increase by 3%only, it is consider a lost, because you lack behind inflation and Consumer index price %, every month, consider it constant, you are consider 2% short of coping with the society.</p>
              <p>Let us put it now into TD fares and income, Taxis companies, as I said long ago, uses new cabs to increase fares, new gadgets, better seats, and more importantly new engine, and as Taxis keep changing, rental will keep raising.</p>
              <p>So they up the fare abit, prolong the peak hours just to lure you out to slog for them further, but your income may not be able to sustain the inflation, even if you make more than last time, it is actually you are working longer hours,</p>
              <p>In terms of taxi driver earning, we are still lacking far behind the current inflation of 5.0 to 5.5%, and even if you earn 3000 and now add another 5% = 3150, you are still breathing just above the water, unless you get 10%, then you can proudly said, I can overcome the inflation. Bearing in mind rental and fuel prices are progressively increasing, but fares and surcharges changes once a while in a long time.</p>

              <p>Yes. You are right. I also noticed that whenever they reduced Direrct Taxes, (the only thing they ever reduce and it is almost like the lowest in the world), the cost of everything else you mentioned and others like GST, ERP, COE, etc... will go up within a week.</p>
