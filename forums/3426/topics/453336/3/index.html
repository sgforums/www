              <p>There is nothing wrong, just that someone cannot flag down a cab, do not want to make an advance or current call, then start to kpkb, end up govt and taxi companies start to take this opportunity to make a fuss out of it.</p>
              <p>End up the solution is that they can have more reason  to get more and more taxis on the road, more taxi = more rental income, more income= more taxation ...same old pattern</p>

              <p>I hope all our next generations are more outspoken.</p>
              <p>We all know what a shit our present system is, but we cannot fight it because of the 60.1%</p>
              <p>Evading real problems for their own agenda. That is why real questions are skipped.</p>
              <p>They are out of touch with the people.</p>
              <p>The present generation that supports them out of fear have to pass on (sad to say)</p>
              <p>And the New Generation that is more outspoken have to grow up and replace the current population. Then only we see a true reflection of what the People thinks about the Government.</p>
              <p>If the current Ruling party adopts a change that is for the better of the people, I am sure these younger generations will support them,</p>
              <p>to support them because of their ideals, not because of fear.</p>

              In 1998, a Government Parliamentary Committee (Communications) was appointed to do a review of the VQS, nine years after its implementation. The Committee presented its findings (published in the Report of the Vehicle Quota System Review Committee)Â to Minister for Communications, Mr Mah Bow Tan, on 2 March 1999.Â  The Committee affirmed the effectiveness of the VQS as one of the key pillars in Singapore's traffic management strategies and recommended that the scheme be retained.Â  The growth rate of 3% per annum will be fixed until 2005 andÂ thereafter reviewed.Â </p>
