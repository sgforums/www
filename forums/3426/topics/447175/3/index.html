              <p>hahaha, that's what i always do when i come back to singapore... i dun like to keep the foreign currencies so i always give everything away to the last person (since i know i won't need it anymore)</p>
              <p>Reason being if the amount is not much, say less than $50, you need to calculate your time. If your time is $20/hour, then if you need to spend more than 2 hours 30 mins on those loose change (find place to store, next time go travel need to find where you stored them, go money exchanger to exchange to other currencies, etc), then you're actually losing money. Not sure if you all understand the rationale but hehehehehehe....</p>

              <p>Tippings is never in Singapore's culture .</p>

              <p>It's very normal for countries like Britian , Aussie , US , Canadians , some part of Europe .</p>
              <p>Why ? Cos they were educated in a way they understood in service line , if 40% of their wages goes to taxes paid , those service line working people left bones really .</p>
              <p>So tippings is one way to help them .</p>
              <p>Not in Singapore .</p>
              <p>That's why F &amp; B have those 10% service charge incur in most bills .</p>
              <p>In taxi , there is no 10% service charge , that's why commuters dun deserve any service from us at all .</p>
              <p>That flag down fare only good enough for us to despatch them home .</p>

              <p><br>Its true that we just take the fares stated in the meter/mdt at the end of the trip, any extra is just bonus, however, it can also brighten our day and give us some motivation.</p>
              <p>Like some good pax would said, thank you Uncle, keep the change, hard on you driving all day, hope you have a nice day. Wha! you hear a already, also happy mah.</p>
              <p>Coming to 10% service charges in Singapore, people use to say, Singapore services not as good as the west, be it restaurants or clubs etc etc. Now, who take the 10%, the waiter, the waitress, the captain, the bell boys, the staffs??? Together with Gst of 7%, it goes into the boss and govt account. So what do you expect the service to be??</p>
              <p>If you say 10% to the waiter who serve me, do you think he will serve you well, for 4 tables he serves, each bill $100, he gets $40 for his services, do you think he is going to be idle and careless? No, he will serve with pride and motivation.</p>
