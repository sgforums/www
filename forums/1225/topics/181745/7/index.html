How can I find it?"<br><br>His teacher answered, "There is a vast wheat field in front. Walk forward without turning back, and pick only one stalk. If you find the most magnificent stalk, then you have found love."<br><br>Domokun walked forward, and before long, he returned with empty hands, having picked nothing. His teacher asked, "Why did you not pick any stalk?"<br><br>Domokun answered, "Because I could only pick once, and yet I could not turn back. I did find the most magnificent stalk, but did not know if there were any better ones ahead, so I did not pick it. As I walked further, the stalks that I saw were not as good as the earlier one, so I did not pick any in the end."<br><br>His teacher then said, "And that is love."<br><br>On another day, Domokun asked his teacher, "What is marriage? How can I find it?"<br><br>His teacher answered, "There is a thriving forest in front. Walk forward without turning back, and chop down only one tree. If you find the tallest tree, then you have found marriage."<br><br>Domokun walked forward, and before long, he returned with a tree. The tree was not thriving, and it was not tall either. It was only an ordinary tree.<br><br>His teacher asked, "Why did you chop down such an ordinary tree?"<br><br>Domakun answered, "Because of my previous experience. I had walked through the field, but returned with empty hands. This time, I saw this tree, and I felt that it was not bad, so I chopped it down and brought it back. I did not want to miss the opportunity."<br><br>His teacher then said, "And that is marriage. You see domakun, <span style="color: blue;">love is the most beautiful thing to happen to a person, it's an opportunity but you don't realize it's worth when you have it but only when it's gone like the field of stalks</span>. Marriage is like the tree you chopped, it's a compromise."<br><br></div></blockquote>If i know the tree is a compromise...i'd never get married.<br><br>It is always a decision to love again and again.<br>But how a person deal with it.
