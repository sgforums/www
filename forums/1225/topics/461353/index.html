              <p>Anyway, yeah. As per the title. I haven't been attached before and I'm just curious. For teens secondary school to JC age, how do the guys confess? Like through text? Or do they just ball up and tell the girl "Hey _____, I just want to tell you that I really like you. Do you want to date?" during one of their dates. Or what.</p>
              <p>I have no idea :D I know my friend texted, but other than him, I don't really ask other friends. It's so personal. :/ But I really dying to know how do people confess! Haha.</p>

              <p>I never text-confess because during my secondary school/JC time, most of us don't have mobile phones! So I always do it face-to-face or through a phone conversation. Sometimes, you don't even need to have a formal confession. Just grab the hand when the situation seems right!</p>
              <p>Personally I think confession through text messages reflects how wussy the guy is. Anyhow, it's not really <em>that </em>personal a question. It is not as if you ask whether they had sex. That will be highly inappropriate and none-of-your-damn-business.</p>
