              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Hey <span class="il">Doc</span>,</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong><br> I bought your book three years ago and it has helped me in meeting many
               women and evaluating relationships. However, I've always been concerned
               that even if a girl has high Interest Level in you, she can still 
              desire other men. I've had girlfriends who planned <span class="il">on</span> marrying me, yet admitted to talking to or flirting with guys they found attractive.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> <br> The most recent example is Krystal. She's a cute girl, but not hot. I introduced myself after seeing her glance at me <span class="il">on</span> the train a couple of times. Within four dates <span class="il">on</span> which we got very romantic, she announced that she loved me. I remembered to remain a Challenge and did not return the "I <span class="il">love</span> you," which is fine with her. Krystal has high interest in me. Her eyes
               light up whenever she sees me, she cooks for me, and she gives me 
              massages. I trust her for the most part because unlike previous 
              ex-girlfriends, she doesn't actively go to clubs and bars to "dance with
               her girlfriends" and meet new men. Additionally, she always lets me 
              know of her activities.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> <br> We've dated for approximately seven months and she plans <span class="il">on</span> marrying me in three years when I'm done with graduate school. However,
               it bugs me greatly that I always catch her glancing or staring at other
               guys (especially shirtless guys in the summer). How can I take her or 
              any girl seriously when they still have physical desires for other men, 
              even when we are at the peak of our relationship and are extremely 
              happy? Once at a restaurant she stared at a guy sitting behind me for 
              five minutes, which really ticked me off. She worked <span class="il">on</span> it and didn't do it for a while before resuming her habit again. Should
               I accept that humans have multiple desires, or should I get rid of 
              Krystal? Some girls are not to be trusted, but my intuition tells me she
               is deeply attached and in <span class="il">love</span> with me. And I 
              am aware that there are lots of girls in happy relationships and 
              marriages who flirt for attention or confirmation of their 
              attractiveness.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> <br> The reason that this is an issue is because I know that if Krystal 
              looks at an attractive, confident guy, he might approach her, and given 
              her attraction, something might happen. If I marry her, I don't want it 
              happening to me!</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> <br> Chandler - who has his doubts</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Hi Chandler,</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Let me correct you <span class="il">on</span> something straight out of the gate. If a woman has high Interest Level in you, she CANNOT desire other men. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A clinically sane woman does not want other men if she's in <span class="il">love</span> with you.</span> PERIOD. The reason your ex-girlfriends flirted with other guys was because they WEREN'T in <span class="il">love</span> with you. Simple. Like my cousin Sal "The Fish" <span class="il">Love</span> says, "Your exes were in <span class="il">love</span> with the three billion other men <span class="il">on</span> the face of the planet."</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Now let me get this straight. After only <em>four</em> dates, Krystal declared that she was in <span class="il">love</span> with you? Now think about this logically, pal. How is that possible? Like my cousin Fast Eddie <span class="il">Love</span> from East L.A. says, "No way, Jose!" And like the great Doctor Freud 
              once said, "A woman who says she loves you after four dates has a screw 
              loose." <em>And this is the key to why she's looking at all these other men.</em> That said, you were smart to not return the "I <span class="il">love</span> you." It shows you have some common sense and that you are learning a little something. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>You don't really trust Krystal for the most part, Chandler. To you Psych majors, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you can't trust ANY woman until after six months and NO red flags</span>. Then and only then can you <em>begin</em> to trust her. A woman has to <em>earn</em> your trust. You can't toss trust out like a used tissue. <span class="il">On</span> the other hand, it's good that Krystal is open with you and lets you know about her activities. But like my cousin Brother <span class="il">Love</span> down in Watts says, "What good is it? She can't stop checking out other dudes."</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Krystal's incessant gawking at half-naked guys with six-packs shows that you have a massive problem. If this babe is in <span class="il">love</span> with you and has 95% Interest Level in you, why is she salivating over 
              other guys at all? Let me explain something to you, my friend. When a 
              woman's Interest Level in you is through the roof, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you're the most handsome guy <span class="il">on</span> the face of the planet</span>.
               Just ask Ringo Starr and Keith Richards. Even those muscle-bound guys 
              in Speedos at the beach can't compete with you when her Interest Level 
              is 95%. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>And let me explain something else to you. Krystal and you aren't over the moon about being in <span class="il">love</span>. <em>You're</em> the only one who's extremely happy. <em>You're</em> the one who's at the peak of the relationship. Krystal isn't so happy. 
              She's in the valley of the relationship. That's why she can't keep her 
              eyes off other men in various states of undress. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Krsytal
               only stared at that fellow in the restaurant for five minutes? That's 
              nothing! You're an uptight guy, Chandler! You're too jealous and 
              possessive, that's your problem! But seriously, of course you were 
              ticked off that she dissed you. Who wouldn't be? And when she resumed 
              her habit of staring at other guys after you called her <span class="il">on</span> it, that's when you should have said "Adios, Krsytal!" </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Girls don't have multiple desires when they're in <span class="il">love</span> with a man. So you have to get rid of Krystal <em>now</em>. Your intuition is not telling you that Krystal is in <span class="il">love</span> with you - it's your big EGO that's whispering in your ear. And like my cousin Rabbi <span class="il">Love</span> says, "A man's ego is the devil." </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>The
               guys married to the wenches who can't stop flirting because they need 
              confirmation of their attractiveness are miserable. Think about it, 
              Chandler. Is that the way you want to live for the next 40 years? 
              Because her "habit" is only going to get worse.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Even
               if something never happens between Krystal and another guy, why does 
              she need the attention of complete strangers? The only way you're never 
              going to get burned by Krystal is if you dump her. Forget about marrying
               her -- are you nuts or something? This girl gets an "F" in LOYALTY and 
              TRUST.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Remember, guys: if she doesn't only have eyes for you, she's out.</strong></span></p>
