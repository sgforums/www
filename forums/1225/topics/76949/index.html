            <div class='col-md body'>Taken from another local forum again. Some good learning values to those nice guys.<br>I tot it's good to have other forums havin some quality discussion.<br>Hope to bring this trend into this forum.<br><br>Type A (Good/Nice Guy)<br>Type B (Bad Boy)<br><br>I was type A too and I lost out to Type B...but I don't blame her because a huge part of it all was my fault - I didn't take control of my life and I paid for it.<br><br>But something bothers me. She's been with B for months now but she takes so much effort in giving me the impression that she doesn't want it to last/he's not the one for her/and she hardly wants to spend time with him unless coerced to, etc.. And I was stupid enough to believe. But recently I chanced upon something(she has no idea) to prove otherwise. She's actually deeply in love with this guy and is having some great sex. I was in utter disbelief, but my nature allowed me to forgive her and I was truly happy for her because she's in love and I've been in love before myself and I know what an amazing feeling that is. But when I told her the next day how I felt happy for her, she didn't want to admit how she truly felt. That bothers me and that makes me very disappointed in her as a person. Does she just wanna use me as a back-up in case something goes wrong?? She's mentioned before how some girls have to do that, even though it's selfish, as a defence mechanism.<br><br>In any case, of course I'm not gonna be an idiot again. I've been emotionally exploited enough! I was pathetic and I cannot allow myself to spiral into a hole like that again.<br>Now, if and when I can muster any energy, I'm just gonna explore the other women out there because I know(or rather, I hope) not everyone's like her.. I know I'm attractive to the opposite sex and I do get my fair share of attention but it's just that for the past year or so I've given so much of my time and energy to this girl that I've almost forgot that other women exist! I have been too nice I feel and maybe I shouldn't be that in the future. That's not gonna mean I'm go all out and get myself the fugged rysty boy image...because I know that is not me!<br><br>I'm just gonna pick up my self-esteem again and perhaps be not too nice in the future, to protect myself if anything!<br>Wish me luck!<br><br>Sometimes, I'm embarrassed at my stupidity and naivety all this while. I've shed many tears.. but I will survive.<br><br>Thank you to anyone who is listening..<br><br>_________________________________<br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=76789" rel="nofollow">18 Signs to show that he's interested in you</a><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=76113" rel="nofollow"> 5 great opening lines for meeting guys</a><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=76538" rel="nofollow">Question and Answer on Holding a girl's hand</a><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=76567" rel="nofollow">Using Women's Intuition to Observe Girls</a><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=76412" rel="nofollow">Introduction to Seduction</a><br><br></div>
