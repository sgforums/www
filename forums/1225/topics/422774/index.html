              <p>How many of us have allowed ourselves to be caught up in the 
              whirlwind of a romance, only to be disappointed when the “honeymoon” 
              period is over and reality sets in? Often, our partner is blamed for not
               putting in the effort to make the relationship work. In every 
              relationship, be it intimate relations, friendship or kinship, it always
               takes a minimal of two people to work at it. A fact that everyone is 
              aware of but rarely practices.</p>
              <p>How then can we maintain strong, healthy and self-fulfilling relationships with a partner, parent or friend?</p>
              <p><strong>Communication – “Two monologues do not make a dialogue ~ Jeff Daly”</strong></p>
              <p>Deep, frequent, heart-to-heart conversations are essential in 
              maintaining any relationship. Relationships fail when individuals hold 
              the belief that: if he/she loves me, he/she should know what to do or 
              what to say. I don’t have to tell him/her what I’m feeling or thinking.</p>
              <p>We have to keep in mind that we are meant to interact, and are not 
              mind readers. If you have difficulty communicating deep issues 
              face-to-face, start off by sharing about your day and build up the 
              confidence gradually by sharing issues closer to your heart. The person 
              on the receiving end of your sharing will usually be appreciative of 
              your trust and honesty.</p>
              <p><strong>Make time for each other</strong></p>
              <p>Set specific times during the week to do something both of you (or in
               a group setting) enjoy doing. Make it a point to celebrate special 
              occasions and if finances permit, why not spend a weekend away from the 
              stressors in life? Recognise that it is equally important to make time 
              for your family.</p>
              <p><strong>Recalling the good times</strong></p>
              <p>Remember why you fell in love the first place. There are always 
              wonderful memories etched in our brains. Reminisce on the fun times you 
              had together with your friends and children. Tapping on such memories 
              will also allow you to be more appreciative of one another.</p>
              <p><strong>Do something nice for your loved one</strong></p>
              <p>Know your partner’s, friends’ and family’s love language and do 
              something they can appreciate. Love languages are expressed by – buying 
              gifts, words of affirmation, acts of service, physical touch, and 
              quality time. Understand how your partner showers you with affection and
               allow your partner to understand how you shower him/her with affection.</p>
              <p><strong>Appreciate the present</strong></p>
              <p>It’s too late for regrets when a love one passes on. There’s no point
               in grieving when the person has passed on or has decided to be out of 
              your life. Learn to appreciate the present. Life is too short to dwell 
              on the insignificant.</p>
              <p><strong>Celebrate and Enjoy</strong></p>
              <p>Celebrate the relationships you have made and maintained over the 
              years. Enjoy the fruit of each journey you walked with that individual. 
              Thank the person for being your partner, friend or family. Be grateful 
              that they are still by you this day.</p>
