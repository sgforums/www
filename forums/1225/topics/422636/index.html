              Malaysia<br> February 13, 2005<br> <br> Insight Down South By Seah Chiang Nee <br> <br> </span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">E</span>DUCATED and
              financially independent, the new Singaporean woman is running into a wall
              of male traditions that is leaving some holes in their relationship, including
              marriage.
              <p>The trend had been building up over a couple of decades. In few other
              countries have women made larger strides in education and careers than
              in Singapore.</p>
              <p>During the past few decades they have caught up with, and even overtaken,
              men in fields they had once dominated.</p>
              <p>In university, women still outnumber men 55-45 with many moving strongly
              into subjects like media, mathematics, law and engineering, among others.</p>
              <p>Recently girls won seven of the top 11 awards for A-level Physics, which
              had long been a boys’ domain.</p>
              <p>Island-wide, women have moved into the highest ranks of the corporate
              world and commanded artillery units or police divisions, as well as trained
              jetfighter pilots. Ten women, aged 20-40, are planning to climb Mount Everest.</p>
              <p>In short, the new female is able, confident and more than holding up
              half the heavens, but not getting equal success in their relationship with
              men.</p>
              <p>This is running smack into a traditional male value of wanting to be
              seen wearing the pants, causing a growing “incompatibility”.</p>
              <p>Better education has also led to the woman being perceived as too ambitious,
              self-centred and materialistic, not qualities that promote romance.</p>
              <p>As a consequence, more men are choosing their brides from abroad, especially
              from China, Vietnam and most of all Malaysia, where historical links remain
              strong.</p>
              <p>I attended five weddings in the last eight months that reflected the
              trend.</p>
              <p>Four of the brides were from Malaysia and China and only one was local.
              I was told this was becoming a trend that government matchmakers have failed
              to correct.</p>
              <p>One groom with a Johor bride said he had found Singaporean girls too
              materialistic and demanding. “One specifically set a condition: no living
              with my parents. She wasn’t happy dating on public buses.”</p>
              <p>The women’s relentless pursuit of a career had come at the expense of
              learning to do simple household chores like cooking, ironing or looking
              after babies.</p>
              <p>“If you want to marry a Singapore girl you must be prepared to eat at
              hawker centres for life,” one male cynic said.</p>
              <p>A marriage agency owner told a radio interviewer how some of the girls
              had, on the first date, plied the men with questions like: What is your
              degree and earnings? Do you own a condo? “And they’re surprised when they
              didn’t get a second date,” she said.</p>
              <p>Others find them picky, untrusting and calculative towards love and
              marriage.</p>
              <p>Results of recently released research have found that one in five Singaporean
              wives is hiding her assets from her husband for fear that he will squander
              them or in case the marriage fails.</p>
              <p>This 20% here compares with France (7.2%), USA (7.6%), Brazil (9%),
              Romania (12%) and Britain (16.8%).</p>
              <p>But there are more hoarders in Japan (38%), Saudi Arabia (32%) and China
              (21%).</p>
              <p>It doesn’t inspire trust. Another sign is the increasing number of cases
              when a private detective is hired to check on the spouse.</p>
              <p>Pre-marital contracts are also becoming more common among people who
              want to keep their assets out of their spouse’s reach in any divorce. Almost
              six out of 10 women say in a survey that they are not submissive, while
              two-thirds believe they could live without men.</p>
              <p>The changing female attitude is, of course, only half the cause.</p>
              <p>The other is the man sticking to a traditional view that it is his right
              as head to leave the babies and household work to his working wife. One
              in two women here have a job.</p>
              <p>The social impact is a growing number of single women, especially university
              graduates.</p>
              <p>A growing minority is marrying Westerners.</p>
              <p>This has prompted a newspaper reader to urge her well-educated peers
              to revisit some the traditional feminine traits.</p>
              <p>Her letter followed reports that more Singaporeans, including young
              professional males, were turning abroad for brides.</p>
              <p>She said she had worked in Vietnam and found the girls there feminine,
              their speech melodious.</p>
              <p>“They work hard without complaining, carrying loads of cloth and vegetables
              in the market stalls and food places. Simple, gentle and hardworking, it's
              hard not to fall in love with them,” she added.</p>
              <p>As for the Malaysian ladies, she finds them “neither loud nor argumentative,
              (but) pander to the boys' needs. Not as doormats, but as cheerful assistants,
              who see it as their obligation to help their men without expecting anything
              in return.</p>
              <p>“Not that they are stupid - oh, no, the Malaysian girls I know are smart
              and hardworking, with careers of their own.</p>
              <p>“But when it comes to matters of the heart, they play the docile, giggly
              girlfriend with as much aplomb as their Vietnamese counterparts. Again,
              it's easy to see where their attraction lies.”</p>
              <p>In contrast, the Singapore girl is twice as likely as her Malaysian
              or Vietnamese counterpart to stride away in a huff or throw water in the
              male's face or hold a public screaming or crying fit.</p>
              <p>“The Singapore girl debates and argues impassionedly. She wants to win
              at all costs and treats her love conquests like those fought in the office
              arena. She may be pretty, yes, smart, yes, but, oh, so demanding.”</p>
              <p>The Singapore girl, in short, is a challenge to love, she added.</p>
              <p>Although she may, at the end of the day, be a supportive and faithful
              spouse, the barbs hiding her soft interior are daunting to the suitor.</p>
              <p>“She is materialistic, and loves being so. Shopping is a major hobby,
              and looking good is absolutely essential. The man is but another accessory,
              a helper, chauffeur, bag carrier.”</p>
              <p>There are, however, some 200,000 men who have a poor education and a
              low salary. Their prospect of marrying a Singapore girl is slim.</p>
              <p>One emotional man said online: “I’m fed up with life. Can’t even find
              a date let alone a wife.” For him and the rest, salvation lies in Vietnam
              or China.</p>

              <p>For the sake of discussion, what on the f***ing world do you see as the problem here?</p>
              <p>As much as the world has evolved, man and woman, one still needs love and gentleness, the other still needs emotional security and financial welfare. Let's talk about duck porridge. Anybody can cook duck porridge. Just grab a duck, boil some water, throw it in with some rice, cook for 15 minutes, nah, duck porridge.</p>
              <p>Marriage also the same. Just a guy, boil some feelings, throw him in with yourself naked, cook for 15 minutes, nah, done.</p>
              <p>It falls back to a fundamental principle which is why marriage as a legal instituion, is being abandoned and perceived as one "for the blinds".</p>
              <p>This principle, which I call the Dilbert's theory is: all bosses (and all governments), are stupid.</p>

              <p>I would not like to touch this comment, but still, monsters are not monsters, they are just called as monsters.</p>
              <p>the baloney thing is that love is an emotion, by calling love in textual format, people already miss the point liaoz.</p>
              <p>nabeiz, i can never get this point right, can't it.</p>
              <p>the point is, love was never a point! nor is it pointless! it is just!</p>

              <p><br>Boss,</p>
              <p>You sound like you come from Singapore system like me. See things so clear for what? In order to see things clear, you need to pay so much every year for Lasik and new glasses, so expensive u know. You talk about f***ing the PAP, but the system in Singapore is the most transparent and clearest in the whole world, well, I never really understood what the opposition talks about all the time, why are u f***ing the clear people, and not the vague ones whose doctrines are bullsh*t?</p>
