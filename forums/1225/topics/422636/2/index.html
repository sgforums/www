              Ur teacher is simply too powerful sia... the thing the prob now is that there's a change in position b/w the male and female and the gaps are only going larger. With the increase in the disparity of earning and spending power between the male and female, the seemed as "weaker" male will jus find it harder to like a singaporean girl.We should not forget that ultimately we come frm a society that started with a traditional asian culture where certain asian values are still being much sought after by the males in terms of love and marriage.Even though much of westernisation has already taken place but i doubt that guys likes spending the nxt half of their life with girls who are preceived as self centered, materialistic etc. While it is totally alright that the females does better than the males but instead of those values that does not promote romance, i believe that guys in singapore wld value much more on things like cooking, chores and household affairs. I believe that everyone who had worked wld appreciate the heartwarming effort of their spouses when they reach home after a day of hard work only to see that dinner is ready with all the dishes they liked. However, how much of that do we see in the ever going stronger singapore girls? Thus, i really feel likeing a singaporean girl is really a challenge.
