Her husband abused her.  She was suffering from depression, attempted to kill herself by drinking vodka and popping pandaols, but she survived.  Her husband blamed her friends for bringing her out to drink.  She tried calling her frens to meet up with her, but no one dared to do that, bcoz of her husband.  She wanted a divorce but her possessive husband didn't want to.<br><br>She attempted suicide again and again and was then admitted to Woodbridge .  She was released few months later.  Friends and family thought her condition was getting better.  Her family brought her home and looked after her, despite her husband's disapproval.<br><br>One fine day, when nobody was at home, she jumped down from the balcony of her home and had a terrible death.
