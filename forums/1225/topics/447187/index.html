              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Men are more open to office romance than women, while
               younger workers are more open about romantic relationships with 
              colleagues than their older counterparts.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>These findings came from a survey by Singapore's online job portal, JobsCentral. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The survey found that 44 per cent of men are open to dating someone from the office.<br><br>Nearly two-thirds (63.9 per cent) of female respondents said they would not date their colleagues. <br><br>A total of 2,281 respondents took part in the online survey between August and September 2011.<br><br>They come from all levels of occupation and income groups. <br><br>The
               survey found out that both genders are most open to dating a colleague 
              of the same rank as they are - 60.8 per cent of men and 49.4 per cent of
               women said they are open to it.<br><br>Men are most averse to dating 
              their superiors, while women are most averse to dating their 
              subordinates - 60.5 per cent of men said they will avoid dating a 
              superior while 75.8 per cent of women said they will avoid dating a 
              subordinate. <br><br>Michelle Lim, COO of JobsCentral Group, said: 
              "Singapore workers are generally wary of potential gossip that may arise
               from office romances, so many will either shy away from it or keep it 
              under wraps. There seems to be an unwritten rule to draw a clear line 
              between work and romance, particularly between managers and those who 
              report to them.<br><br>"However, if you are dating someone in the 
              office, it is advisable that you also socialise with other people in the
               company. More importantly, keep work strictly separate from your 
              personal relationships," she advised.<br><br>"For managers, if you are 
              seeing a subordinate, it is often not enough to just make sure you 
              remain impartial. You should let your boss know about the situation. <br><br>In
               many cases, the company may require one of you to transfer to another 
              team to prevent issues like unhealthy gossips, allegations of 
              favouritism and management difficulties," she added.<br><br>The survey 
              also found that younger workers are open to dating a colleague, with 
              46.4 per cent of workers aged below 30 saying they are open to dating or
               have dated someone in the office. <br><br>Older workers generally 
              disapprove of office relationships, with 64.9 per cent of those aged 41 
              to 50 saying they will avoid dating someone in the office.<br><br>The survey found that office romance does not affect work relationships with others.<br><br>Close
               to 80 per cent of respondents who admitted to have dated someone at 
              work indicated that they were not treated negatively by other colleagues
               after their office romance was made public. <br><br>However, those who dated a subordinate faced the most hostility.<br><br>23.3 per cent experienced negativity at work, compared with 19.3 per cent of those who dated someone of a similar rank.<br><br>Managers
               and directors are most cautious about office romance, while managers 
              and directors showed the most objections against dating a colleague. <br><br>64.3 per cent said they would not date someone from work. <br><br>On the other hand, associate professionals and technicians are most liberal with office romance.<br><br>50.9 per cent indicated they would start a romantic relationship in the office.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
