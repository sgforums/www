As the relationship cultivate growth, you advance up the flight of stairs. Certain issues in love will slow down this growth; this represent you walking up a flight of spiral stairs. Though slow, but you are certain that it will still bring you higher if problems was properly take care of and be enlightened.<br><br>Of course, the easiest way to escape this spiral stairs is to leap out (break) and attempt to start all over again (patch).<br><br>The impact of breaking is represented by how high the flight of stairs you are at before leaping off. You won't die - but the fall will wound you greatly.<br><br>When you decide to patch again - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you returned back to the very first step</span> you took right in the beginning. If this continues, you either bleed to death from the wounds you inflict upon your love, lose all the confidence to try anymore or simply too tired to continue walking the same flight of stairs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Couple that hate to communicate or fail to practice good communication skills and leads to conflicts will find themselves unable to resolve this bitterness or tension within their emotional structure. A violent break is instigated and the couple's bond is severed forcefully.<br><br>When clarify returns, they regret and seek to reconstruct this bond.<br><br>When a break is used to 'solve' a problem - it never served its purpose.<br><br><strong>You merely set them aside</strong>.<br><br>When you patch back, the issue is STILL stack at the side, but couple undergoing vicious cycle chose to ignore and push them into their subconscious. This effect is cumulative and with each new stack on top of the old issue - old issue take roots and make relationship tight and unstable.<br><br>Each of these stacks occupies space and when too many of these stacks is around, it force love out of the picture and even if the couple wished to do something - they wouldn't know where to begin by then.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Love is suffocated and dies like a burn-out candle - no amount of flame can rekindle them.<br><br>P.S: Employing break to solve love issue will trigger an irrevocably  relationship habit &amp; mindset on communication and problem solving. Relationship can survive many issues, but it can only survive that couple of breaks before it is <strong>permanently</strong> shattered.<br><br>Cheers</div>
