This title too general liao and no detail is given. No wonder CuriousOrange don't post.<br><br>Briefly.<br><br>Lvl 1- She shows interest, calls guy and respond very well to guy until one fine day she lost interest. No calls, finding excuses to get away from you.<br>Lvl 2- Like 1, she seemed to lose interest but still respond to you. Though not as enthu like the past. Sound 'can't be bothered' atittude.<br>Lvl 3- She gives you very heavy hints of attraction onto guy, yet she flirts with other guys.<br>Lvl 4- Like 3, additional to that she totally ignores guy's presence or went MIA for awhile and then suddenly pop back into guy's life again repeating the cycle.<br>Lvl 5- She's physical to guy however she never told guy what their state of relationship is. Leaving things 'hanging in the air'<br><br>the list goes on. It could range from innocent tease to manipulation.<br><br>Different lvls different style of dealing. </span><br><br>I'm under the Lvl 2 status..<br><br>How am i going to cont'd to woo her?
