Get to know him better, and see if he is really what you think he is. Then, you can proceed to the second step, which is to let him see you as someone more than a friend. That is the tricky part actually. You don't want to be too "chummy" with him until he starts to consider you as one of his close guy frens (the mistake I made), but yet you also want him to be comfortable with you.<br><br>So before that tricky part gets in, get to know him first. And that will require courage on your part. I think we have all given you that advice long ago in SH, and I suspect you know what you have to do to get him to notice you, but you fear too much to make a move?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> </div></blockquote>how chummy is chummy?  say this guy i was really close with, but i dont know if im already in friends zone, considering he always treat me like a lady, and does make a distinct point that im not one of the guys.  does it mean i still got chance or not?  i dun have like good male buds so i dun know what qualifies <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, my personal advise for the ladies out there :<br><br>When a guy, whom you have no interest in, approaches you for a friendly introduction / chat / acquintance, please at least give him a smile, not shutting him out like ignoring him or gave him this "Ah Sun buey song  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> (The Maid)" look or some salesman trying to hardsell his products. Treat the smile as a charity, like how you gave a quarter to the beggar on the streets, then politely gave him an excuse that you are not in the mood for a chat or something.<br><br>At least this gave him some pride left to go socialise with others and not sitting at the bar(not the 1 in sgforums) by himself all night with a scar, which might post future psychological problems, like being afraid  / hesitant to approach the opposite gender.<br><br>Perhaps this also applies to the guys too. People needs to learn how to be generous and polite abit nowadays. The "Badboy" / "Badgal" isn't what they seems to be btw. They're just a term to catagorise confident, fun-loving, adventurous and daring people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I assume it may be a little late, but can sure try this:<br><br>If you have difficulty going for the initiative to know him more, why not ask for a third party help? Someone whom you think may be closer to him than you.<br><br>If you do not know this 3rd person well, simply get to know the 3rd person better and you can learn more about the guy through the 3rd person. It is a calculated bet because you do not 100% know the 3rd person's character and it may do you more harm than good? But its worth a try. I know I did, my friend is playing 3rd person and is telling me as much as he knows.<br><br>If you think its a bad idea, you just have to show more guts and talk to him. Since he already know you, its all the more easier, you can ask him did he do his tutorial, asking to let you see some parts you do not know. Or ask for his lecture notes, saying you have some parts you left out. Or even simple ones like, "What is the subject today?" to get the chat going. Guys in general like girls to be a little more proactive.<br><br>You do not have to show BIG manoveurs, just subtle notions for him to notice. Take your time, its been months now and I am sure you know him better. And I do not think girls lose out if they do the chasing as long as the guys react and chase back. Its like catching, you catch him, he catch you back.</div>
