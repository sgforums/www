No confirmation from his part yet right? So you need to find out for yourself whether this is true or not. Do it for your own sake as well, so that you can have a peace of mind <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Take a little step at a time...since he has talked to you before, maybe this time, instead of waiting for him to initiate conversation with you, you can talk to him first?</div>
