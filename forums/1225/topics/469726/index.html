              <p>Hi. I'm 21 years old and i finally got my legit first date (yeah i know, im a loser lol). And i know first impression really counts and last forever. I do not want to screw it up... those here on a date before please give me some tips/advices of what to do. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I heard from my friends that guys have to treat the girls they are with on their first and the following date. Ok. is this entirely true? do i really need to take out money and treat my gf to bring out my good side of first impression? other than that, anything else i should look out for? My friends also told me that do not focus on my handphone for too long and do not look at unknown passerby girls. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anything else you guys wanna add on? please help.. because im really nervous here and i freaking scared i may screw this up. Is movies the only good places for dates to go?</p>

              <p>I am probably an uncle to you but I am sure I can cheap in some tips. Paying for a date was quite a norm for man during my time but I understand perception has changed a lot as the status of girls are different too. Anyway, in general girls still like boy to offer to pay. So you should definitely take some iniative there. But I have heard of cases where girls prefer dutch because she is unsure of the development of this first date and prefers zero string attached. You will definitely have to make some judgement call.</p>
              <p>Paying is the smallest part. Communication is always the biggest and most difficult especially with this gadget generation. Movie is always a classic first date choice because it also offer some topic for chatting, an ice breaker to loosen both party.</p>
              <p>Don't forget to bring your humor too and an interest to life! Talk on common soft topics like movies, food, music, computer, etc is what I tried before. Also show genuine keen interest of who she is. When both of you are able to share who each of you are and show keeness at other and kick off common life topics, you will be on route to a relationship.</p>

              <p>If you know her prior to this, then this will be easier.</p>
              <p>If not, then you should take the lead by default and decide the
              game plan. If she has other ideas though, she's likely to let you
              know anyway and then you can let her lead!</p>

              <p>Don't just follow her flow always. U gotta have ideas and stuff where to go and what to do first. Her flow comes during the course of the date. U can't just have a rigid plan, but u gotta HAVE a plan.</p>
              <p>And don't try toooo hard man. Just relax and try not to read in too much on her every move and whatever she says or does. Anyway's its ur first date, it wont go perfectly. There will be 2nd 3rd 4th dates.... or with other people. Soon u will get the vibe. </p>
              <p>Just stick to the basics and you will be fine. Unless she is one demanding princess. lol</p>

              wow I still rem my 1st date was when im abt 24 or 25 yrs young, we went to seoul garden at bugis n the place was playing this song. 
              
              http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY6XrLw2hJk
              
              I think the for any 1st date the duration must not be too long preferably abt  4 to 5 hrs fr late aftrenoon to night.  can consider start off with a buffet dinner, if u all r able to maintain a healthy conversation, then proceed to a decent live pub or ktv where the ambience is conducive for chitchatting, if not, movie would be gd.
              dont overdress esp in this hot n humid weather but not too sloppily also, strictly not red leather pant.
              the rest is all impromptus, not fix formulae...but always rem to send her home, inform her when u reach yrs, wish her gd night n thanks her for her time...
              most importantly, successful or not, treat it as a lesson n dont take it too seriously.

              <p>yep first date pay. you have to set aside a budget for this. tip just be yourself. also observe what character she have, dont be too intrusive when askign question. little things she do you can tell her character alot.</p>
              <p>like go job interview as much as employers reviewing you, you also reviewing your future bosses colleagues and company.</p>
