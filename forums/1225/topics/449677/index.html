              <p><br>if u have a girlfriend, you can also stay together and 'fark' each other everyday too, why must you get married?<br><br>so in short the govt should just ban marriages altogether isn't it?</p>
              <p>and if some people in SG would just be more open-minded and less discriminating abt this, why wouldn't the govt legalise gay marriage? and if the govt legalise gay marriage, wat reasons do they have to not allow gays to have the same rights as married heterosexual couples?</p>
              <p>and pls do not insult another. she is simply putting her stand and reason forward. unlike some who only gives a point without reason/explanation/fact/base</p>

              <p>ur a man or woman? or rather, do you think ur kids are closer to you or ur wife/husband? would you rather they choose one? i think not. all of us love our parents because they brought us up with love and care, not simply becos they gave us life, shld the orphans be grateful becos their parents gave them life and threw them away (im referring to those that are actually thrown away)? so if one day by chance they happen to see their real parents, would they actually love them? if they were adopted by caring loving foster parents, would they still want to go back to their real parents? perhaps. perhaps not. thus, even if im an orphan, i would love my foster parents more, as they were the ones who raised me up. perhaps i would be grateful to my actual parents, for giving me life, but i would detest them for their irresponsible actions.</p>

              <p>ur a man or woman? or rather, do you think ur kids are closer to you or ur wife/husband? would you rather they choose one? i think not. all of us love our parents because they brought us up with love and care, not simply becos they gave us life, shld the orphans be grateful becos their parents gave them life and threw them away (im referring to those that are actually thrown away)? so if one day by chance they happen to see their real parents, would they actually love them? if they were adopted by caring loving foster parents, would they still want to go back to their real parents? perhaps. perhaps not. thus, even if im an orphan, i would love my foster parents more, as they were the ones who raised me up. perhaps i would be grateful to my actual parents, for giving me life, but i would detest them for their irresponsible actions.</p>

              <p><br>are foster parents not parents too? do they lack the ability to provide parental love and care for their kids?</p>
              <p>and gay foster parents tend to be more committed parents than heterosexual parents as they chose to be parents of wateva no. of kids they adopt, than heterosexual couples who have kids as they have too much sex.</p>
              <p>and its precisely becos of parents like you that cause the ppl nowadays to be so close-minded. gay parents tend to raise kids with better values and better mindset. their kids tend to be more open-minded, more creative, and more accepting of others. heterosexual kids tend to grow more close-minded, unaccepting of anything/anyone that is different from them. thats is why there are still racist ppl out there. they have a higher tendecy of bullying ppl, which shows their poor moral values. they discriminate, which shows their lack of understanding.</p>
              <p>not all heterosexual parents have kids like that. my parents are heterosexual, but they don't allow me to look down or criticise ppl for being who they are.</p>
              <p>have you never felt as if, you are the same as everyone else? then thats not you any more. kids of gay parents would most probably dare to be different, dare to be themselves, and not change and alter themselves simply to fit in, until its not them anymore.<br><br>gay couples have the highest demand for ophans, as they can't have ther own. and the only group of ppl contributing to the increasing number of orphans are heterosexual couples who are irresponsible.</p>

              <p>Besides, do you know whether you're gay or not is influenced by a gene? Yes, you could be born with a gay preference if you had a certain gene (the gay gene). It doesn't condemn you to be a gay because as you grow up, you also get influenced by culture/social circle, etc.</p>
              <p>I won't stop people doing something just because they were born a chinese/indian/malay/white/black so I won't stop people doing something just because they were born with a gay gene.
