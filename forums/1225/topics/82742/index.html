When it comes to making the decision about choosing a life partner, no one wants to make a mistake. Yet, with a divorce rate of close to 50 percent,it appears that many are making serious mistakes in their approach to finding Mr./Ms. Right!<br><br>If you ask most couples who are engaged  why they're getting married, they'll say "We're in love". I believe is the #1 mistake people make when they date.<br><br>Choosing a life partner should never be based on love (alone). Though this may sound not politically correct, there's a profound truth here.<br><br>Love (alone) is not the basis for getting married. Rather, love is the result of a good marriage. When the other ingredients are right, then  the love will come.<br><br>Let me say it again:<br>"You can't build a lifetime relationship  on love alone. You need a lot more. Here are five questions you must ask  yourself if you're   serious about finding and keeping a life  partner..."<br><br><span style="color: red;">QUESTION #1: Do we share a common life purpose?</span><br><br>Why is this so important? Let me put it  this way: If you're married for 20 or 30 yrs, that's a long time to live with someone. What do you plan  to do with each other all that time? Travel, eat and jog together? You need  to share something deeper and more meaningful. You need a common life purpose.<br><br>Two things can happen in a marriage. You  can grow together, or you can grow apart. 50 percent of the people out there  are growing apart. To make a marriage work, you need to know what you  want out of life bottom line  - and marry someone who wants the same thing.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">QUESTION #2: Do I feel safe expressing my  feelings and thoughts with this person?</span><br><br>This question goes to the core of the quality of your relationship.  Feeling safe means you can communicate openly with this person. The basis of  having  good communication is trust,ie. trust that I won't get "punished" or  hurt for expressing my honest thoughts and<br>feelings.<br><br>A colleague of mine defines an abusive person as someone with whom you feel afraid to express your thoughts and feelings. Be honest with yourself on this one. Make sure you feel emotionally safe with the person you plan to marry.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;">QUESTION #3: Is he/she a mensch</span><br><br>A mensch is someone who is a refined and sensitive person.<br><br>How can  you test? Here are some suggestions. Do they  work on personal growth on a regular basis? Are they serious about  improving themselves? A teacher of mine defines a good person as "someone who  is always striving to be good and do the right thing".<br><br>So ask about your significant other: What do they do with their time?<br><br>Is this person materialistic? Usually a materialistic person is not someone whose top priority is character refinement. There're essentially 2 types of people in the world: People who are dedicated to personal growth and people who are dedicated to seeking comfort.<br><br>Someone whose goal in life is to be comfortable will put personal comfort  ahead of doing the right thing. You need to know that before walking down the aisle.<br><br><span style="color: green;">QUESTION #4: How does he/she treat other people?</span><br><br>The one most important thing that makes any relationship work is the ability to give. By giving, we mean the ability to give another<br>person pleasure. Ask: Is this someone who enjoys giving pleasure to others or are they wrapped up in themselves and self-absorbed?<br><br>To measure this, think about the  following: How do they treat people whom they do not have to be nice to, such as a  waiter! s, bus boy, taxi driver,etc.<br><br>How do they treat parents and  siblings? Do they have gratitude and appreciation? Do they show respect?<br><br>If they don't have gratitude for the  people who have given them everything, you cannot expect that they'll have gratitude for you who can't do nearly as much for them!<br><br>Do they  gossip and speak badly about others? Someone who gossips cannot be someone who loves others. You can be sure that someone who treats others poorly, will eventually treat you poorly as well.<br><br><span style="color: orange;">QUESTION #5: Is there anything I'm hoping  to change about this person after we're married?</span><br><br>Too many people make the mistake of  marrying someone with the intention of trying to "improve" them after they're married. As a colleague of mine puts it, "You can probably expect someone to change after marriage... for the worse!" If you cannot fully accept this person the way they are now, then you are not ready to marry them.<br><br>In conclusion, dating doesn't have to be  difficult and treacherous.The key is to try leading a little more with your head and less with your heart.<br><br>It pays to be as objective as possible when you are dating, to be  sure to ask questions that will help you get to the key issues.<br><br>Falling in love is a great feeling, but when you wake up with a ring on your finger, you  don't want to find yourself in trouble because you didn't do your homework.<br><br>I've learned that it's not what you have  in your life, but who you have in your life that really counts..<br></div>
