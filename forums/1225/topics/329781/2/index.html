              <div>What Women HATE Most About Single Guys<br> By David DeAngelo<br> <br> Here are a few of the BIG things that single women hate:<br> <br> 1) Giving Up Your Status In Exchange For Her Attention And
              Approval<br> <br> If I had to describe the one single thing that both annoys women
              and<br> DESTROYS a guy's chances, it would be this.<br> <br> It has taken me a long time to see this particular pattern, but
              it's<br> EVERYWHERE.<br> <br> Men, in effect, say "Hi, I want your approval and attention. I'm
              willing to<br> let YOU be the one who's in control... and let YOU call the
              shots... and do<br> anything to please YOU... if you'll give me your attention and
              approval".<br> <br> But the problem is that women DON'T WANT you to give up your status
              and<br> "manliness".<br> <br> Women aren't ATTRACTED to men who act weak and tentative.<br> <br> Women secretly HATE IT when a guy does something to demonstrate
              that he'll<br> give away his power in return for approval.<br> <br> THEY HATE IT!<br> <br> I could literally write an entire book on this one single
              concept.<br> <br> Take a few minutes to think this one over, and maybe write down the
              ways<br> that you make this mistake with women.<br> <br> More importantly, think about how you're going to STOP DOING IT
              IMMEDIATELY.<br> <br> <br> 2) Being Needy, Clingy, And Insecure<br> <br> When one person "clings" to another person "psychologically", the
              person who<br> is being "clinged to" RESENTS and REJECTS the needy, clingy
              emotional<br> parasite...<br> <br> This is WUSS behavior at its worst.<br> <br> If a guy is on the phone with a girl he just met, and she says
              "Hey, I have<br> to go", he might say "Aw, well... um... OK. Um, will you call me
              when you<br> get home?".<br> <br> Or let's say a guy and a girl are out on their first date, and
              they're<br> walking around in a large department store.<br> <br> Most guys will follow the woman everywhere, and not leave her side
              for a<br> minute.<br> <br> If she wanders away, he'll come find her IMMEDIATELY.<br> <br> He'll stay physically close to her, as if he's afraid she'll leave
              without<br> him.<br> <br> And an even worse example is a guy who is so emotionally insecure
              that he<br> actually ASKS a woman to tell him that he's nice, fun, interesting,
              etc.<br> <br> "Do you think I'm interesting?"<br> <br> "Do you think we could ever have a relationship?"<br> <br> "Am I your type?"<br> <br> Women HATE this stuff. It makes them shiver with the
              heebie-jeebies. It<br> makes them want to RUN AWAY.<br> <br> <br> 3) Not Leading - And Even Worse, Trying To Get Her To Lead<br> <br> Women have WUSS-DAR.<br> <br> One of the things that triggers a woman's WUSS-DAR is a man who
              FOLLOWS.<br> <br> The REAL problem is that most women won't try to LEAD
              naturally.<br> <br> So you've got a situation where a man is trying to FOLLOW a woman
              who isn't<br> LEADING.<br> <br> He's looking for little cues so he knows where to go and what to
              do... but<br> he isn't getting them.<br> <br> So what does he do?<br> <br> He ASKS for them!<br> <br> He says "So, I was thinking of maybe taking you to Olive Garden
              for<br> dinner...how does that sound?".<br> <br> Everything about the way he asks says to the woman "I'm trying to
              figure out<br> what you want me to do... please help me know how you want me to
              act, where<br> you want me to take you, and what you want me to say".<br> <br> This is ATTRACTION DEATH!<br> <br> men who don't lead, and even worse, try to get a woman to lead,
              ANNOY THE<br> HELL OUT OF SINGLE WOMEN.<br> <br> They HATE IT!<br> <br> <br> 4) Using Insecure, Approval-Seeking, Low-Status Posture, Gestures,
              Voice<br> Tone, And Body Language<br> <br> There's a term that single, attractive, in-demand women use to
              describe men<br> who use weak, approval-seeking posture, gestures, comments,
              and<br> mannerisms...<br> <br> The term is "NICE".<br> <br> "He's nice... but... there's no chemistry."<br> <br> This is one of those areas that's not easy to talk about.<br> <br> Since SO DAMN MANY GUYS do this stuff, it's almost impossible to
              explain.<br> <br> It's like trying to tell a fish that they're not going to get
              anywhere in<br> life if they stay wet.<br> <br> The fish doesn't even KNOW it's wet in the first place.<br> <br> But let me try.<br> <br> This is important.<br> <br> Go spend a day observing couples.<br> <br> Go places where couples that have just met spend time
              together.<br> <br> Bars, clubs, coffee shops, whatever.<br> <br> Now watch the GUYS.<br> <br> Watch how they lean towards the women.<br> <br> Watch how they raise their eyebrows in<br> exaggerated response to women's comments.<br> <br> Watch how they slump over, let their shoulders fall forward, and
              smile<br> fake-ly at whatever the women say.<br> <br> If you're close enough, listen to how men ask questions and make
              comments<br> with a voice tone that says "I'm insecure and I'm trying to be
              extra nice to<br> compensate for it".<br> <br> You'll see it EVERYWHERE.<br> <br> In fact, you'll see it so much that you'll probably write me back
              to tell me<br> that I'm the one who's crazy, and that since it happens so much, it
              must be<br> "the right way".<br> <br> Well, it's not.<br> <br> If there's one thing that triggers an attractive single woman's
              WUSS-DAR,<br> it's a man's posture, gestures, eye contact, voice tone, etc.<br> <br> It all happens in an INSTANT.<br> <br> Women read this stuff and interpret it as instantly and accurately
              as you<br> read and interpret the cover of Playboy.<br> <br> NO ANALYSIS NECESSARY.<br> <br> I'd say that probably 90% of all men alive today INSTANTLY
              disqualify<br> themselves with women because of this problem.<br> <br> Their voice tone, gestures, posture, etc. TELEGRAPH the message
              that they're<br> a WUSS.<br> <br> They do a thousand weird little things to let a woman know that
              they're<br> uncomfortable and "not being themselves".<br> <br> And you guessed it...<br> <br> Single women HATE IT!<br> <br> <br> 5) Not Understanding That She's A Woman And You're A Man<br> <br> I'm about to get philosophical on your ass, so be cool.<br> <br> When it comes down to it, most men don't understand women.<br> <br> But the REAL kicker is that most men don't understand MEN,
              either!<br> <br> Most guys don't know what it's like to get in touch with their MALE
              NATURE.<br> <br> Combine these two issues, and you get a guy who behaves in ways
              that DO NOT<br> trigger ATTRACTION in women.<br> <br> Women have a "nature". A female nature.<br> <br> Men also have a "nature". You guessed it, it's a MALE nature.<br> <br> Women are coy. They like to play hard to get. They like to enjoy
              the chase.<br> They love anticipation. They love to "let a guy catch
              them"...<br> <br> Men are competitive. Men are dominant. Men like to play rough
              games, win<br> things, and rule their territory.<br> <br> Well guess what?<br> <br> Most men don't BEHAVE like men when they're in the presence of a
              woman that<br> they "like".<br> <br> And since most men don't understand female human nature, they
              don't<br> demonstrate that they "get it" when they're with women that they
              "like".<br> <br> Women like men. Men like women. There are POWERFUL causes at play
              here.<br> <br> When you're around a woman you like, don't act like a GIRLY-MAN.
              It's not<br> sexy, and it's not attractive...<br> <br> And single women HATE IT!<br> <br> <br> 6) Not Being Interesting To Be Around<br> <br> Underneath most behavior that I see most guys acting out is a "core
              belief"<br> that goes like this:<br> <br> "I don't believe that an attractive woman would want to be around
              me just<br> because she enjoys my presence... so I make up for it by saying and
              doing<br> certain things that I hope she'll enjoy... and if she enjoys those
              other<br> things enough, then maybe she'll want to spend more time with
              me."<br> <br> Heavy, man.<br> <br> Well guess what? Most attractive single women KNOW that if a guy
              isn't<br> interesting to be around, they she's eventually going to go CRAZY
              being<br> around him.<br> <br> In other words, no amount of material gifts, compliments, dinners,
              and other<br> "displays" will EVER compensate for a lack of BEING
              INTERESTING.<br> <br> Here's a profound thought:<br> <br> I and several other guys I know have many women who call us
              often... just<br> because they enjoy being around us.<br> <br> These women would be happy just to be in the same room with us...
              and enjoy<br> our company.<br> <br> And yes, these women CALL US.<br> <br> Often.<br> <br> Material gifts, food, flowers, and other "displays" have ZERO
              lasting value<br> to a woman when it comes to how she FEELS about you...<br> <br> An attractive single woman wants a guy who LIGHTS HER UP. She wants
              to FEEL<br> GOOD.<br> <br> She wants mystery... she wants to laugh... she wants a challenge...
              she<br> wants sexual tension...<br> <br> If you're using compliments, gifts, food, and other "displays" to
              get a<br> woman's attention... you need to ask yourself a tough
              question:<br> <br> Is it because you don't believe that a woman would want to be
              around you<br> just to be around you?<br> <br> Because if you don't know how to be INTERESTING to a woman, then no
              amount<br> of compensation is going to fix the problem.<br> <br> If you're boring, predictable, and uninteresting, then you're never
              going to<br> have women calling YOU to hang out.<br> <br> Oh, and women HATE IT.<br> <br> <br> 7) Not Understanding Attraction<br> <br> This is a BIGGIE.<br> <br> You hear me talking about it all the time, right?<br> <br> Maybe now that you've read this newsletter you'll have a better
              context to<br> understand what I'm about to tell you...<br> <br> If you "get it" with women, it's SUPER INTERESTING and ATTRACTIVE
              to them.<br> <br> Women can INSTANTLY FEEL IT when they're with a guy who "gets
              it".<br> <br> <br> Women know very quickly if they're talking to a guy who understands
              himself<br> and women... and who enjoys creating and building sexual
              tension.<br> <br> Women know if a guy speaks the SECRET LANGUAGE of "Sexual
              Communication".<br> <br> If he doesn't, then she stops all communication on that
              level.<br> <br> If he does, then it continues.<br> <br> ATTRACTION Isn't A Choice.<br> <br> Attraction is an emotional and physical RESPONSE... and you can't
              "convince"<br> a woman to feel it with logic, gifts, and NICENESS.<br> <br> Attraction is the result of a woman meeting a man who understands
              how<br> attraction works... and who knows what to do in each specific
              situation to<br> progress to the next level.<br> <br> The PROBLEM with ATTRACTION, and with success with women in general
              is that<br> the things you need to DO to be successful are NOT OBVIOUS.<br> <br> They're "counter intuitive", in many cases.<br> <br> In other words, they're the OPPOSITE of what you'd THINK would make
              sense.<br> <br> You have to do things like CREATE TENSION... stop doing something
              that she<br> likes...give her time to miss you... etc.<br> <br> And if you don't understand ATTRACTION, a woman is going to KNOW
              IT.<br> <br> <br> And guess what?<br> <br> Single women HATE IT when a man doesn't understand ATTRACTION and
              how to<br> communicate on this "other level".<br> <br> Now that I've shared the mistakes, you need the next piece of the
              puzzle.<br> You need to get an education on how attraction works for women...
              and the<br> RIGHT things to do up front to give her those emotional/physical
              feelings<br> inside.<br> <br> Right now you're probably feeling that excited "Ah Ha!"
              feeling.<br> <br> That's because you understand something at a different level...
              you've used<br> your mind to understand something complex... and you feel good
              about<br> bettering yourself.<br> <br> Well this is just the TIP of the iceberg.<br> <br> As educational as this has been, this is only the beginning.</div>

              <p>Ppl like Parn re-assures me that yes, many out there are out for my money. ANd generally makes rich dude's lives easier .And like i said long time ago, with all that money i wont even know if she truly loves me.I can never tell until she leaves my material things behind. I rather be a sugar daddy knowing they are using my money then trying to prove 30K engagement ring when i can give her a 500K house. lol</p>
              <p>Maybe i should write a book about it.</p>
              <p>Should be easy to date Parn. First date i throw everything out for her to see.Impressing n spending money is the easy part, nornally the dumping part is hard. Cause once they get hooked to a big fish , they wont wanna let go withouth doing some damage or until finding another big fish through u. Big fishes hang around big fishes. Thats how they survive, like club hopping.</p>
              <p>Once i get into her panties , i just stop drop n roll. Play before getting played. N pass on the word.</p>

              <p>Ya...somebody very rich here, but can only afford to buy 500k house.</p>
              <p>By the way hor, house cost more than 500k. And you can keep your 500k to buy yourself a HDB flat, barely enough for you to buy one in a prime area....you might still get some change back.</p>
              <p>The problem is, it's easy to brag......still lose to an indian man who says he owns 3000 cows back in mumbai, india.</p>

              <p>Next time remember to brag about your 1000th gf whom you also happened to make her pregnant and coaxed her into an abortion willingly done for the sake of you. And also tell us how you want to love her but she thinks she's not good enough for you.</p>
              <p>Also don't forget to brag about how you potong jalan other people's gf before you also convince them to have an abortion for you before you dump them and return them to their cannot-make-it and poorer bf.</p>
