            <div class='col-md body'><div class="fixed leftAlign">What Women HATE Most About Single Guys<br>By David DeAngelo<br><br>Here are a few of the BIG things that single women hate:<br><br>1) Giving Up Your Status In Exchange For Her Attention And Approval<br><br>If I had to describe the one single thing that both annoys women and<br>DESTROYS a guy's chances, it would be this.<br><br>It has taken me a long time to see this particular pattern, but it's<br>EVERYWHERE.<br><br>Men, in effect, say "Hi, I want your approval and attention. I'm willing to<br>let YOU be the one who's in control... and let YOU call the shots... and do<br>anything to please YOU... if you'll give me your attention and approval".<br><br>But the problem is that women DON'T WANT you to give up your status and<br>"manliness".<br><br>Women aren't ATTRACTED to men who act weak and tentative.<br><br>Women secretly HATE IT when a guy does something to demonstrate that he'll<br>give away his power in return for approval.<br><br>THEY HATE IT!<br><br>I could literally write an entire book on this one single concept.<br><br>Take a few minutes to think this one over, and maybe write down the ways<br>that you make this mistake with women.<br><br>More importantly, think about how you're going to STOP DOING IT IMMEDIATELY.<br><br><br>2) Being Needy, Clingy, And Insecure<br><br>When one person "clings" to another person "psychologically", the person who<br>is being "clinged to" RESENTS and REJECTS the needy, clingy emotional<br>parasite...<br><br>This is WUSS behavior at its worst.<br><br>If a guy is on the phone with a girl he just met, and she says "Hey, I have<br>to go", he might say "Aw, well... um... OK. Um, will you call me when you<br>get home?".<br><br>Or let's say a guy and a girl are out on their first date, and they're<br>walking around in a large department store.<br><br>Most guys will follow the woman everywhere, and not leave her side for a<br>minute.<br><br>If she wanders away, he'll come find her IMMEDIATELY.<br><br>He'll stay physically close to her, as if he's afraid she'll leave without<br>him.<br><br>And an even worse example is a guy who is so emotionally insecure that he<br>actually ASKS a woman to tell him that he's nice, fun, interesting, etc.<br><br>"Do you think I'm interesting?"<br><br>"Do you think we could ever have a relationship?"<br><br>"Am I your type?"<br><br>Women HATE this stuff. It makes them shiver with the heebie-jeebies. It<br>makes them want to RUN AWAY.<br><br><br>3) Not Leading - And Even Worse, Trying To Get Her To Lead<br><br>Women have WUSS-DAR.<br><br>One of the things that triggers a woman's WUSS-DAR is a man who FOLLOWS.<br><br>The REAL problem is that most women won't try to LEAD naturally.<br><br>So you've got a situation where a man is trying to FOLLOW a woman who isn't<br>LEADING.<br><br>He's looking for little cues so he knows where to go and what to do... but<br>he isn't getting them.<br><br>So what does he do?<br><br>He ASKS for them!<br><br>He says "So, I was thinking of maybe taking you to Olive Garden for<br>dinner...how does that sound?".<br><br>Everything about the way he asks says to the woman "I'm trying to figure out<br>what you want me to do... please help me know how you want me to act, where<br>you want me to take you, and what you want me to say".<br><br>This is ATTRACTION DEATH!<br><br>men who don't lead, and even worse, try to get a woman to lead, ANNOY THE<br>HELL OUT OF SINGLE WOMEN.<br><br>They HATE IT!<br><br><br>4) Using Insecure, Approval-Seeking, Low-Status Posture, Gestures, Voice<br>Tone, And Body Language<br><br>There's a term that single, attractive, in-demand women use to describe men<br>who use weak, approval-seeking posture, gestures, comments, and<br>mannerisms...<br><br>The term is "NICE".<br><br>"He's nice... but... there's no chemistry."<br><br>This is one of those areas that's not easy to talk about.<br><br>Since SO DAMN MANY GUYS do this stuff, it's almost impossible to explain.<br><br>It's like trying to tell a fish that they're not going to get anywhere in<br>life if they stay wet.<br><br>The fish doesn't even KNOW it's wet in the first place.<br><br>But let me try.<br><br>This is important.<br><br>Go spend a day observing couples.<br><br>Go places where couples that have just met spend time together.<br><br>Bars, clubs, coffee shops, whatever.<br><br>Now watch the GUYS.<br><br>Watch how they lean towards the women.<br><br>Watch how they raise their eyebrows in<br>exaggerated response to women's comments.<br><br>Watch how they slump over, let their shoulders fall forward, and smile<br>fake-ly at whatever the women say.<br><br>If you're close enough, listen to how men ask questions and make comments<br>with a voice tone that says "I'm insecure and I'm trying to be extra nice to<br>compensate for it".<br><br>You'll see it EVERYWHERE.<br><br>In fact, you'll see it so much that you'll probably write me back to tell me<br>that I'm the one who's crazy, and that since it happens so much, it must be<br>"the right way".<br><br>Well, it's not.<br><br>If there's one thing that triggers an attractive single woman's WUSS-DAR,<br>it's a man's posture, gestures, eye contact, voice tone, etc.<br><br>It all happens in an INSTANT.<br><br>Women read this stuff and interpret it as instantly and accurately as you<br>read and interpret the cover of Playboy.<br><br>NO ANALYSIS NECESSARY.<br><br>I'd say that probably 90% of all men alive today INSTANTLY disqualify<br>themselves with women because of this problem.<br><br>Their voice tone, gestures, posture, etc. TELEGRAPH the message that they're<br>a WUSS.<br><br>They do a thousand weird little things to let a woman know that they're<br>uncomfortable and "not being themselves".<br><br>And you guessed it...<br><br>Single women HATE IT!<br><br><br>5) Not Understanding That She's A Woman And You're A Man<br><br>I'm about to get philosophical on your ass, so be cool.<br><br>When it comes down to it, most men don't understand women.<br><br>But the REAL kicker is that most men don't understand MEN, either!<br><br>Most guys don't know what it's like to get in touch with their MALE NATURE.<br><br>Combine these two issues, and you get a guy who behaves in ways that DO NOT<br>trigger ATTRACTION in women.<br><br>Women have a "nature". A female nature.<br><br>Men also have a "nature". You guessed it, it's a MALE nature.<br><br>Women are coy. They like to play hard to get. They like to enjoy the chase.<br>They love anticipation. They love to "let a guy catch them"...<br><br>Men are competitive. Men are dominant. Men like to play rough games, win<br>things, and rule their territory.<br><br>Well guess what?<br><br>Most men don't BEHAVE like men when they're in the presence of a woman that<br>they "like".<br><br>And since most men don't understand female human nature, they don't<br>demonstrate that they "get it" when they're with women that they "like".<br><br>Women like men. Men like women. There are POWERFUL causes at play here.<br><br>When you're around a woman you like, don't act like a GIRLY-MAN. It's not<br>sexy, and it's not attractive...<br><br>And single women HATE IT!<br><br><br>6) Not Being Interesting To Be Around<br><br>Underneath most behavior that I see most guys acting out is a "core belief"<br>that goes like this:<br><br>"I don't believe that an attractive woman would want to be around me just<br>because she enjoys my presence... so I make up for it by saying and doing<br>certain things that I hope she'll enjoy... and if she enjoys those other<br>things enough, then maybe she'll want to spend more time with me."<br><br>Heavy, man.<br><br>Well guess what? Most attractive single women KNOW that if a guy isn't<br>interesting to be around, they she's eventually going to go CRAZY being<br>around him.<br><br>In other words, no amount of material gifts, compliments, dinners, and other<br>"displays" will EVER compensate for a lack of BEING INTERESTING.<br><br>Here's a profound thought:<br><br>I and several other guys I know have many women who call us often... just<br>because they enjoy being around us.<br><br>These women would be happy just to be in the same room with us... and enjoy<br>our company.<br><br>And yes, these women CALL US.<br><br>Often.<br><br>Material gifts, food, flowers, and other "displays" have ZERO lasting value<br>to a woman when it comes to how she FEELS about you...<br><br>An attractive single woman wants a guy who LIGHTS HER UP. She wants to FEEL<br>GOOD.<br><br>She wants mystery... she wants to laugh... she wants a challenge... she<br>wants sexual tension...<br><br>If you're using compliments, gifts, food, and other "displays" to get a<br>woman's attention... you need to ask yourself a tough question:<br><br>Is it because you don't believe that a woman would want to be around you<br>just to be around you?<br><br>Because if you don't know how to be INTERESTING to a woman, then no amount<br>of compensation is going to fix the problem.<br><br>If you're boring, predictable, and uninteresting, then you're never going to<br>have women calling YOU to hang out.<br><br>Oh, and women HATE IT.<br><br><br>7) Not Understanding Attraction<br><br>This is a BIGGIE.<br><br>You hear me talking about it all the time, right?<br><br>Maybe now that you've read this newsletter you'll have a better context to<br>understand what I'm about to tell you...<br><br>If you "get it" with women, it's SUPER INTERESTING and ATTRACTIVE to them.<br><br>Women can INSTANTLY FEEL IT when they're with a guy who "gets it".<br><br><br>Women know very quickly if they're talking to a guy who understands himself<br>and women... and who enjoys creating and building sexual tension.<br><br>Women know if a guy speaks the SECRET LANGUAGE of "Sexual Communication".<br><br>If he doesn't, then she stops all communication on that level.<br><br>If he does, then it continues.<br><br>ATTRACTION Isn't A Choice.<br><br>Attraction is an emotional and physical RESPONSE... and you can't "convince"<br>a woman to feel it with logic, gifts, and NICENESS.<br><br>Attraction is the result of a woman meeting a man who understands how<br>attraction works... and who knows what to do in each specific situation to<br>progress to the next level.<br><br>The PROBLEM with ATTRACTION, and with success with women in general is that<br>the things you need to DO to be successful are NOT OBVIOUS.<br><br>They're "counter intuitive", in many cases.<br><br>In other words, they're the OPPOSITE of what you'd THINK would make sense.<br><br>You have to do things like CREATE TENSION... stop doing something that she<br>likes...give her time to miss you... etc.<br><br>And if you don't understand ATTRACTION, a woman is going to KNOW IT.<br><br><br>And guess what?<br><br>Single women HATE IT when a man doesn't understand ATTRACTION and how to<br>communicate on this "other level".<br><br>Now that I've shared the mistakes, you need the next piece of the puzzle.<br>You need to get an education on how attraction works for women... and the<br>RIGHT things to do up front to give her those emotional/physical feelings<br>inside.<br><br>Right now you're probably feeling that excited "Ah Ha!" feeling.<br><br>That's because you understand something at a different level... you've used<br>your mind to understand something complex... and you feel good about<br>bettering yourself.<br><br>Well this is just the TIP of the iceberg.<br><br>As educational as this has been, this is only the beginning.</div></div>

              <p>pfft...please.. some women are just yearning for the dude to throw literally everything on her feet and hands her his reigns. The end result is no different. Once together liaw '<br> Men, in effect, say "Hi, I want your approval and attention. I'm
                                      willing to<br> let YOU be the one who's in control... and let YOU call the

              <p>tis the kind of ego boosting feminist article again, makes it sound as if all ladies are highly sought after and all guys in the world are despo and single</p>

              <p>if not, u should be thankful that a guy is even interested in you</p>
              <p>to all the guys: u are  the one wif upper hand, u are the ones who take the initiative to hunt, enjoy this privelege, make good use of it, gals are not that hard to tackle as long as you hav the "groove" ..</p>
              <p>gals are juz as despo (despo for luv n attention, not lust), not that hard to get them if u can give them that</p>

              <p>DDA is just one of many conmen known as gurus in the seduction community, a circle that is hell bent on scoring with women for flings...they sell very similar "advice "and they hate one another's guts. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>You have to remember that the women that these guys talk about are the there's-nothing-no-one-has-tried-on-me, "untouchable" sort. It's good for breaking the ice with them, but no matter how much you practice, <em>people do not change</em>, and you can cover your true self or only so long.</p>
              <p>You don't need conmen to tell you the only important things you can take away - be a man, stand up for yourself and work on your self-esteem.</p>

              <p>If u cant attract a female on the 1st date u can forget about asking her for 2nd date.</p>
