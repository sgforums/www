              <p>How is hiding behing analogy a cowardly move ? Even if its not. Its still perfectly logical. 500K still beats ur 30K. The whole point is NOT about whether the 500K able to purchase a house of any nature in Sg.</p>
              <p>If you cant even get the real point , coming up to a conclusion that i am a liar and a coward..isnt it like.. slapping ur own face ? Or swallowing ur own vomit ?</p>
              <p>U are being inconsistent. If you want to prove your points be consistent. Slippery slope arguments , ad hominem types.. dont work on me Parn.</p>
              <p>But if u insist on it, then there is no point discussing anything from here on.</p>
              <p>I back off a step and let you 'win'. I dont nee to prove to you or anyone my points.</p>

I'm willing to<br>let YOU be the one who's in control... and let YOU call the shots... and do<br>anything to please YOU... if you'll give me your attention and approval".<br><br>But the problem is that women DON'T WANT you to give up your status and<br>"manliness".<br><br>Women aren't ATTRACTED to men who act weak and tentative.<br><br>Women secretly HATE IT when a guy does something to demonstrate that he'll<br>give away his power in return for approval.<br><br>THEY HATE IT!<br><br>I could literally write an entire book on this one single concept.<br><br>Take a few minutes to think this one over, and maybe write down the ways<br>that you make this mistake with women.<br><br>More importantly, think about how you're going to STOP DOING IT IMMEDIATELY.<br><br><br>2) Being Needy, Clingy, And Insecure<br><br>When one person "clings" to another person "psychologically", the person who<br>is being "clinged to" RESENTS and REJECTS the needy, clingy emotional<br>parasite...<br><br>This is WUSS behavior at its worst.<br><br>If a guy is on the phone with a girl he just met, and she says "Hey, I have<br>to go", he might say "Aw, well... um... OK. Um, will you call me when you<br>get home?".<br><br>Or let's say a guy and a girl are out on their first date, and they're<br>walking around in a large department store.<br><br>Most guys will follow the woman everywhere, and not leave her side for a<br>minute.<br><br>If she wanders away, he'll come find her IMMEDIATELY.<br><br>He'll stay physically close to her, as if he's afraid she'll leave without<br>him.<br><br>And an even worse example is a guy who is so emotionally insecure that he<br>actually ASKS a woman to tell him that he's nice, fun, interesting, etc.<br><br>"Do you think I'm interesting?"<br><br>"Do you think we could ever have a relationship?"<br><br>"Am I your type?"<br><br>Women HATE this stuff. It makes them shiver with the heebie-jeebies. It<br>makes them want to RUN AWAY.<br><br><br>3) Not Leading - And Even Worse, Trying To Get Her To Lead<br><br>Women have WUSS-DAR.<br><br>One of the things that triggers a woman's WUSS-DAR is a man who FOLLOWS.<br><br>The REAL problem is that most women won't try to LEAD naturally.<br><br>So you've got a situation where a man is trying to FOLLOW a woman who isn't<br>LEADING.<br><br>He's looking for little cues so he knows where to go and what to do... but<br>he isn't getting them.<br><br>So what does he do?<br><br>He ASKS for them!<br><br>He says "So, I was thinking of maybe taking you to Olive Garden for<br>dinner...how does that sound?".<br><br>Everything about the way he asks says to the woman "I'm trying to figure out<br>what you want me to do... please help me know how you want me to act, where<br>you want me to take you, and what you want me to say".<br><br>This is ATTRACTION DEATH!<br><br>men who don't lead, and even worse, try to get a woman to lead, ANNOY THE<br>HELL OUT OF SINGLE WOMEN.<br><br>They HATE IT!<br><br><br>4) Using Insecure, Approval-Seeking, Low-Status Posture, Gestures, Voice<br>Tone, And Body Language<br><br>There's a term that single, attractive, in-demand women use to describe men<br>who use weak, approval-seeking posture, gestures, comments, and<br>mannerisms...<br><br>The term is "NICE".<br><br>"He's nice... but... there's no chemistry."<br><br>This is one of those areas that's not easy to talk about.<br><br>Since SO DAMN MANY GUYS do this stuff, it's almost impossible to explain.<br><br>It's like trying to tell a fish that they're not going to get anywhere in<br>life if they stay wet.<br><br>The fish doesn't even KNOW it's wet in the first place.<br><br>But let me try.<br><br>This is important.<br><br>Go spend a day observing couples.<br><br>Go places where couples that have just met spend time together.<br><br>Bars, clubs, coffee shops, whatever.<br><br>Now watch the GUYS.<br><br>Watch how they lean towards the women.<br><br>Watch how they raise their eyebrows in<br>exaggerated response to women's comments.<br><br>Watch how they slump over, let their shoulders fall forward, and smile<br>fake-ly at whatever the women say.<br><br>If you're close enough, listen to how men ask questions and make comments<br>with a voice tone that says "I'm insecure and I'm trying to be extra nice to<br>compensate for it".<br><br>You'll see it EVERYWHERE.<br><br>In fact, you'll see it so much that you'll probably write me back to tell me<br>that I'm the one who's crazy, and that since it happens so much, it must be<br>"the right way".<br><br>Well, it's not.<br><br>If there's one thing that triggers an attractive single woman's WUSS-DAR,<br>it's a man's posture, gestures, eye contact, voice tone, etc.<br><br>It all happens in an INSTANT.<br><br>Women read this stuff and interpret it as instantly and accurately as you<br>read and interpret the cover of Playboy.<br><br>NO ANALYSIS NECESSARY.<br><br>I'd say that probably 90% of all men alive today INSTANTLY disqualify<br>themselves with women because of this problem.<br><br>Their voice tone, gestures, posture, etc. TELEGRAPH the message that they're<br>a WUSS.<br><br>They do a thousand weird little things to let a woman know that they're<br>uncomfortable and "not being themselves".<br><br>And you guessed it...<br><br>Single women HATE IT!<br><br><br>5) Not Understanding That She's A Woman And You're A Man<br><br>I'm about to get philosophical on your ass, so be cool.<br><br>When it comes down to it, most men don't understand women.<br><br>But the REAL kicker is that most men don't understand MEN, either!<br><br>Most guys don't know what it's like to get in touch with their MALE NATURE.<br><br>Combine these two issues, and you get a guy who behaves in ways that DO NOT<br>trigger ATTRACTION in women.<br><br>Women have a "nature". A female nature.<br><br>Men also have a "nature". You guessed it, it's a MALE nature.<br><br>Women are coy. They like to play hard to get. They like to enjoy the chase.<br>They love anticipation. They love to "let a guy catch them"...<br><br>Men are competitive. Men are dominant. Men like to play rough games, win<br>things, and rule their territory.<br><br>Well guess what?<br><br>Most men don't BEHAVE like men when they're in the presence of a woman that<br>they "like".<br><br>And since most men don't understand female human nature, they don't<br>demonstrate that they "get it" when they're with women that they "like".<br><br>Women like men. Men like women. There are POWERFUL causes at play here.<br><br>When you're around a woman you like, don't act like a GIRLY-MAN. It's not<br>sexy, and it's not attractive...<br><br>And single women HATE IT!<br><br><br>6) Not Being Interesting To Be Around<br><br>Underneath most behavior that I see most guys acting out is a "core belief"<br>that goes like this:<br><br>"I don't believe that an attractive woman would want to be around me just<br>because she enjoys my presence... so I make up for it by saying and doing<br>certain things that I hope she'll enjoy... and if she enjoys those other<br>things enough, then maybe she'll want to spend more time with me."<br><br>Heavy, man.<br><br>Well guess what? Most attractive single women KNOW that if a guy isn't<br>interesting to be around, they she's eventually going to go CRAZY being<br>around him.<br><br>In other words, no amount of material gifts, compliments, dinners, and other<br>"displays" will EVER compensate for a lack of BEING INTERESTING.<br><br>Here's a profound thought:<br><br>I and several other guys I know have many women who call us often... just<br>because they enjoy being around us.<br><br>These women would be happy just to be in the same room with us... and enjoy<br>our company.<br><br>And yes, these women CALL US.<br><br>Often.<br><br>Material gifts, food, flowers, and other "displays" have ZERO lasting value<br>to a woman when it comes to how she FEELS about you...<br><br>An attractive single woman wants a guy who LIGHTS HER UP. She wants to FEEL<br>GOOD.<br><br>She wants mystery... she wants to laugh... she wants a challenge... she<br>wants sexual tension...<br><br>If you're using compliments, gifts, food, and other "displays" to get a<br>woman's attention... you need to ask yourself a tough question:<br><br>Is it because you don't believe that a woman would want to be around you<br>just to be around you?<br><br>Because if you don't know how to be INTERESTING to a woman, then no amount<br>of compensation is going to fix the problem.<br><br>If you're boring, predictable, and uninteresting, then you're never going to<br>have women calling YOU to hang out.<br><br>Oh, and women HATE IT.<br><br><br>7) Not Understanding Attraction<br><br>This is a BIGGIE.<br><br>You hear me talking about it all the time, right?<br><br>Maybe now that you've read this newsletter you'll have a better context to<br>understand what I'm about to tell you...<br><br>If you "get it" with women, it's SUPER INTERESTING and ATTRACTIVE to them.<br><br>Women can INSTANTLY FEEL IT when they're with a guy who "gets it".<br><br><br>Women know very quickly if they're talking to a guy who understands himself<br>and women... and who enjoys creating and building sexual tension.<br><br>Women know if a guy speaks the SECRET LANGUAGE of "Sexual Communication".<br><br>If he doesn't, then she stops all communication on that level.<br><br>If he does, then it continues.<br><br>ATTRACTION Isn't A Choice.<br><br>Attraction is an emotional and physical RESPONSE... and you can't "convince"<br>a woman to feel it with logic, gifts, and NICENESS.<br><br>Attraction is the result of a woman meeting a man who understands how<br>attraction works... and who knows what to do in each specific situation to<br>progress to the next level.<br><br>The PROBLEM with ATTRACTION, and with success with women in general is that<br>the things you need to DO to be successful are NOT OBVIOUS.<br><br>They're "counter intuitive", in many cases.<br><br>In other words, they're the OPPOSITE of what you'd THINK would make sense.<br><br>You have to do things like CREATE TENSION... stop doing something that she<br>likes...give her time to miss you... etc.<br><br>And if you don't understand ATTRACTION, a woman is going to KNOW IT.<br><br><br>And guess what?<br><br>Single women HATE IT when a man doesn't understand ATTRACTION and how to<br>communicate on this "other level".<br><br>Now that I've shared the mistakes, you need the next piece of the puzzle.<br>You need to get an education on how attraction works for women... and the<br>RIGHT things to do up front to give her those emotional/physical feelings<br>inside.<br><br>Right now you're probably feeling that excited "Ah Ha!" feeling.<br><br>That's because you understand something at a different level... you've used<br>your mind to understand something complex... and you feel good about<br>bettering yourself.<br><br>Well this is just the TIP of the iceberg.<br><br>As educational as this has been, this is only the beginning.</div>

              <p>If you cant even get the real point , coming up to a conclusion that i am a liar and a coward..isnt it like.. slapping ur own face ? Or swallowing ur own vomit ?</p>
              <p>U are being inconsistent. If you want to prove your points be consistent. Slippery slope arguments , ad hominem types.. dont work on me Parn.</p>

              <p>Well, i'm not perfect.I'll admit mistakes if i make one. But by looking at the arguments , i am pretty sure i am of better standing then you.</p>
              <p>500K House in West or East Malaysia. Happy ? Nice big semi-detached. Sure as hell beat ur 30K engagement ring. U still do not get the point. Its not about the 30K or 500K,  its about the fact that ur emphasis on the 30K ring which ..gee.. i dont know.. somehow is connected to ur philosophy of love , marriage , proof of commitment and all that good stuff.</p>
              <p>Any more questions regarding my 500K house ?</p>
