              <p>Planning doesn't work... You'll still forget everything you planned to talk about when you meet her. ;)</p>
              <p>Just be yourself. The more you try to act, the more awkward and nervous you'll get. Comment about the things or people around. Find things on the spot to talk about. You'll be surprised how conversations can be sparked off from random things.</p>

              <p>Look at the surroundings and find topics to talk about lor. Or maybe biatch about the innocent people that are walking around. Let them be the victims of the interesting topic. Haha.</p>
              <p>I don't think you can go there with a prepared list of topics to talk about right. I think if you are nervous you will make things worse with that prepared list of topics.</p>

              <p><br>Earning and work is not the topic u are not going to talk but do u know her deep enough?</p>
              <p>Tell yrself what kind of gal do u like? Try narrow down the question regards to the type of gal u like and u can make it a chit chat and test her out.</p>
              <p>Ask her some more personal question(not those are u still virgin?) But maybe what type of guys she like and what she expect of her future family will like. Some childhood thing is good too so u can know more of her family relation and background and how she build her her character thru her upbringing.</p>

              <p>When you say having dinner, is the place somewhere you are familiar with or is it a fine dining restaurant where you will feel intense stress and nervousness?</p>
              <p>The advice i have is, first, be comfortable with your surroundings, if you are comfortable in a coffeeshop, then go there, if you are comfortable in fast food outlets, then go there. The surroundings can really affect your outlook and how nervous you already are. If you are feeling extreme nervousness, take deep breathes and loosen up yourself.</p>
              <p>Now, ask yourself this simple question. If you are a girl, and you have plans to have dinner with a guy, do you expect it to be fun or boring?</p>
              <p>Henshin, be fun and spontaneous! Move away from boring topics like what type of guys she like and what she expect of her future family will like or what her childhood was like.</p>
              <p>Next, what is so difficult about starting a topic on the spot? For your info, maybe she is as nervous as you and you must be the one to actually light the "spark". I can think of a million topics right now.</p>
              <p>"So erm, have you been to the singapore flyer? Did you know that it's actually the largest ferriswheel in the world, right now?"</p>
              <p>"Hey, you played the game called The Cube before?"</p>
              <p>For your info, it's a game, you can find it at</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cube_(game">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cube_(game</a>)</p>
              <p>This game is especially useful to find out more about her and creates a heck load of topics to start off.</p>
