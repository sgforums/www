              <p>When I start school, got one chiobu live near my house. Every time want go to school, she will walk past my block there, so I will purpose stick my head out of my window(9th floor!) just to see her.</p>

              <p>This goes on for 2 years until in Sec 3, we happen to be in the same class! That time I slowly make my move, but she like 2 of my buddies. No, is 3! But nevertheless, I manage to get close to her. Still remember I touch her back on the pretext of 'massaging' her...</p>
              <p>And in Sec 4, we got even closer. I bring her to the Esplanade, treat her to TWO movies, send her home etc. Never did once she said thank you...</p>
              <p>One day, I saw her MSN message saying about a guy call Jonathan. So I ask her, who is that guy? And she say...</p>

              <p>When I was in the middle of sec 2 I suddenly started noticing this girl in my school. Funny how I didn't even know she existed before then.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I found her damn beautiful. Not really beautiful in a physical way, but more on how she exudes this 'aura' of innocence. Somehow, the more I looked at her, the more beautiful I found her to be, and the more I could not forget her.</p>
              <p>The problem is, I don't even really know her. Lol. I've never talked to her before, never interacted with her in anyway before, don't know her character or pretty much anything at all (except her name)</p>
              <p>I went very crazy over her for the next two years and after (even after graduation, I couldn't really forget her), but I don't even know how to start getting to know her and talk to her or something. I was afraid of appearing as 'crazy' or a 'toad lusting after a swan' if I approached her. I only dared look at her from afar and just think of her.</p>
              <p>After the O'levels, she created a friendster account and I happened to chance across her account. I added her as friend and got her msn account. Chatted for like 1 hr and that's it! She went poly and I went JC and she has probably forgotten my existence by now. Even has a boyfriend and stayed together for quite a long time.</p>
              <p>Looking back, I was really very stupid. I had nothing much to loose by approaching her. Whatever 'face' I had thrown had I approached her, it will not matter now. Conversely, had I succeed, my life would be different now.</p>
              <p>Frankly speaking though, I have never since meet another girl who could affect me as much as her after since (4 years after graduation), and we've never even talked before! LOL!</p>
