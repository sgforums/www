              <p>Have you known anyone who is so into his or her BF / GF that that person almost spend the entire free time with the other person.......</p>
              <p>I think this kind of relationship is unhealthy because it is a kind of overdependence.....and furthermore, it takes away the time for friends and families and personal interests.......</p>

I know it's not healthy but it was kind of sweet being together all the time and feel close to someone you can truly trust and inlove with. Be careful when the relationship over, everything turn horrible..that's what i;ve been through</p></div>

              <p>YES!!!!!</p>
              <p>There is this friend of mine, whom used to hang out with me and my gf alot. Then she went gaga over this malaysia guy, a guy that is only 23 years old but then looks like 30+. Then she went head over heels for him and is willing to do anything. Then she even mentioned that she misses him and if we find her missing means she already went to malaysia looking for him. But in the end they broke up. My friend is quite chio, alot of people chasing, but then this malaysia guy is haiz haiz haiz......</p>
              <p>Then she now with another guy, also look much older de. Then worst is hor she spends the whole week at his home, and never go back home. Wash clothes and do housework for him. This guy, just after 2 months with her say wanna married and she happily agree. Na bei, now want to ask her out is like so difficult cause she needs to ask bf and then boyfren dont like our gang, and keep saying we childish, blah blah blah. Ask her go movie at night 11+, knn she say cannot she going dinner with bf auntie.. dinner got until so late de meh??</p>
              <p>I dont know la, i hate it when people are so into their other half that they ignore their close friends. Basket.</p>
              <p>Worst is we are going overseas and that damn bf of hers is coming along, even though we do not want him to come at all. He insists on coming and that gf knows about it. We did tell her we dont want him to come, then think she never go tell the bf, now the bf is tagging along, damn it. Spoil our trip. Think during the whole trip the bf would want the gf to go with him to walk around instead in joining our activites.</p>
              <p>Initially this bugger did not even want the gf to join us. We are close friends and he did not want her to go with us, citing reasons that there are other guys. There are only 3 guys. One is married, the other 2 (including me) have our own gfs. And our gfs and this girl knows each other like for 12 years. I know the girl also quite long already. In fact we are all close friends and there will not be any strangers at all!!! Worst is that this bf, we only knew him for less than a year, if want to say stranger, he is the stranger.</p>
              <p>Basket, then the gf insists on going and this bf still must call his cousin and ask if he would allows his gf to go for the trip given such scenario. Only when his cousin says he would, then this bugger allowed my friend to join us for the trip.</p>
              <p>Rubbish leh this type of boyfriend. Speaking of this, my trip is totally spoilt. SPOILT!!!!</p>
