              <p>I would suggest a cool-off period between the both of you for around a week or two and promise her that you would reflect on your mistake over this period.</p>
              <p>Think of it this way: say if I'm a salesman, and you're a custom-built oven, and I sell you to your girlfriend. So she bakes bread with you and enjoys every bite of it every day, until a month later you go cranky and caused a fire in her home. She calls me up and tells me about the incident.  I immediately apologize to her and luckily, she accepts my apology.</p>
              <p>Now, do you think I, as a salesman, would be pushing a little too far if I said, "Hey, just give that oven another try. I assure you it won't cause another fire" when it almost killed her just a while ago? And on the other hand, if I just keep trying to convince her to use you again, wouldn't she simply be annoyed instead of having any thoughts to use you again?</p>
              <p>So instead, I tell her, "Lady, let me refund you with a voucher and take the oven back to fix it. It should be fixed in a week. After one week, let me know whether you would still want this custom-built oven."</p>
              <p>Chances are, she will take you back after a week because:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>She misses baking nice-smelling bread with you.</li>
              <li>She don't want to spend more time choosing and buying another oven.</li>
              <li>Neither does she want to spend time learning how to use another oven.</li>
              <li>She's afraid that her next oven would be worse than you.</li>
              </ul>
              <div>And if she does, great for you, because she would be more tolerant of your future blow-ups as long as they are not as bad as the one before. (Some evil ovens exploit this human behaviour!)</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Of course, if she doesn't take you back, it would probably mean your bread is just not good enough for her. No point staying in her kitchen if she's not going to bake bread with you anyway. Time to upgrade yourself and find a new owner who makes better dough.</div>

              <p>Wah.. You know her not long, start to touch chest liao ah... hahaha.. I think you need to know her better and build up your relationship before she will actually "allow and enjoy" you touching her chest.</p>
              <p>Don't worry.. Most girls are like that.. They can forgive but can't forget. You should re-assure her that the matter wont happen a second time. Time will slowly fade her memory on this, but if anything similar happens again, be sure that she will "remember hatred" and bring up this matter again, even though it has passed for 1 year, 5 years or even 10 years !!</p>

              <p>Luckily, she stopped you, or you could have done something which will have land you in hot soup. She is only 15, let the relationship progress as a non-physical one ( And I don't mean kissing. You know what I mean. ) for the time being.</p>
              <p>Anyway, no point in trying to make her forget about it. Just try asking her out again, since the cooling period has passed. The main thing now is to stabilise your relationship once more, instead of worrying about this and that. </p>
