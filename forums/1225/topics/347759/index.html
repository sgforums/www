              <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">No money? No marry</span> <br> <br> Local men, listen up. According to a survey conducted by the Shin Min
              Daily News, women in Singapore require that their prospective partners
              earn a minimum of $4,000 to $5,000, before they will consider marrying
              them.
              <br> <br>Local TV artiste and compere Quan Yifeng discussed this issue on a
              talkshow programme recently. The topic was about "How much should a
              Singaporean man earn" and how much is enough?
              <br> <br> <br>The three female guests invited to speak on the talkshow agreed
              that a good amount would be between $4,000 to $5,000. A shocked Quan
              Yifeng quipped: "No wonder Singaporean men can't get wives."
              <br> <br>A local netizen posted this topic in an online forum in May. Till
              today, the topic has raged on, with many forummers posting their
              comments and opinions. The thread has accumulated more than 200
              responses so far.
              <br> <br> <br>Regarding the minimum that a man should earn, a reporter from the
              Chinese daily posed this question to 20 men and women. Most of them
              said that having a salary that is good enough to sustain your lifestyle
              would be sufficient. However, most agreed that $4,000 to $5,000 is a
              "reasonable amount" if one is thinking of setting up a family.
              <br> <br> <br>Without that minimum amount, they reason, it would be difficult for
              a man to support his wife, let alone think about having children and
              allowing them to grow up in a comfortable environment.
              <br> <br> <br> The men say: "I would say the same too"
              <br>&gt;&gt; Mr Su Jun Long, 27, an accountant, earns $2,400 per month.
              He says: "I am not worried about not finding a wife, especially not a
              materialistic one. Actually, it is not important how much I earn, but
              more of how much I spend. However, when I am thirty-plus, I would also
              hope I am able to earn a minimum of $3,000 and above."
              <br> <br> <br>&gt;&gt; Mr Zhang Yi Zheng, 26, an auditor, earns $2,100 per month.
              He says: "$4,000 to $5,000 is a reasonable amount to expect. But at my
              age, it is normal to earn only $2000 plus. My girlfriend earns about
              the same amount as I do."
              <br> <br> <br>&gt;&gt; Mr Huang, 30, an IT personnel who earns $2,500 per month,
              says: "Contentment is key. Money is a factor, but it should not be the
              main consideration. Having a low income would be a problem too, so a
              salary of $4,000 to $5,000 is not too much to ask."
              <br> <br> <br> The women say: "It is just enough to support a family"
              <br>&gt;&gt; Ms Shen Yu Tai, 27, a bank officer, says: "Actually,
              $2,000 is enough. But it is understandable that women would require
              their husbands to earn $4,000 to $5,000. After all, we all want to be
              able to live a comfortable life. That amount is required to start a
              family as well."
              <br> <br>&gt;&gt; Ms Pan, 27, a writer, says: "It is not important how much
              he earns, but he must be good at saving. The salary ranges for
              industries differ, so there shouldn't be a specific requirement, as
              long as he earns above $2,500.
              <br> <br>&gt;&gt; Ms Tan, 30, a customer service officer, says:
              "Realistically, an income of $4,000 to $5,000 should be expected.
              Generally, as long as you have a degree, and have worked for a few
              years, you should be able to draw that amount."</p>

              <p>I hope they are referring to the combined income.</p>
              <p>But of course I don't think they represent all Singapore women, at least I don't agree with the amount and the way they have made us looked so materialistic.</p>
              <p>Yes, Singaporean women are materialistic, but not all are that materialistic.</p>
              <p>I don't know why they failed to question the mentality of the Singaporean men, as I believed it is the mentality of both Singaporean men and women that is hindering them from having a successful marriage or even having a blissful wedding.</p>
              <p>You may not know, alot of Singaporeans' marriage are actually at risks and marriage has somehow became business-like nowadays.</p>
