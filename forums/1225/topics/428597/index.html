              <p>I have heard of many people is still single throughout their life and had never been into relationship before really made me ponder a lot of reason here. I post this topic here to draw discussion and also from my personal experience in relationship throughout my 10 years since I step into relationship world.</p>
              <p>First of all, I have many male friends who have not been in relationship before, some never hold a girl hand and worst, never had the opportunities to talk to girl.</p>
              <p>My question here is do you really want to wait for the durian to fall from the tree as in wait for girl to come and approach you? *Question to a single guy. </p>
              <p>My key point for a relationship is to lose your pride and be courageous to break the ice. Do something which you fear for your life, stand in front of the girl to capture her attention and strike the conversation. I believe not many people can do that.</p>
              <p>I would like to share my personal experience here, I'm currently working as a deliveryman, driving a van delivery goods to various company and each time I pass by a bus stop, seeing many beautiful lady dress in shorts waiting for bus. And I'm that kind of guy who is thick skin and never embarass to girls, I will honk at them and wave. Believe it or not, some of them did actually smile back to me. This brings confidence in you and there was once, she was alone waiting at the bus stop, I stop my van in front of the bus, stopped for a while, strike a conversation with her and moments later I got her no. What did I say, I'm not gonna disclosed here. You definately feel nervous at the beginning but after you break the ice, the entire world is going to belong to you.</p>
              <p>And I tell myself, so what if you earn 5 or 6 figure per month, if you not going to talk to girls, girls will also not going to talk to you.</p>
