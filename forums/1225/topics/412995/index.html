              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>So
               I've been brushing up on your book, and a few of your tips have really 
              helped me out. But I've run into something rather peculiar. </strong></span></p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Bridget
               and I work together. I asked her out for a drink and she said yes. The 
              next day she texted me and asked if I wanted to eat some ice cream and 
              walk her dog in the park. It went well, we talked for a few hours, said 
              good night, and that was the end. I actually thought it might not go 
              anywhere after that. But then I ran into Bridget at work two days later,
               and she practically asked me out. We set something up for a couple days
               later and we ended up going out again. This time it was amazing. I've 
              been on quite a few dates, but none that went as well as this. We ate at
               Bridget's favorite place and we talked after supper for about four 
              hours, went to see a movie and she made it known that she wanted me to 
              hold her hand through the movie. I took her hand while walking to the 
              car, which she liked. We kissed when we got to the car. The date lasted 
              about eight hours, there were no awkward silences and lots of laughing, 
              and after I dropped her off she said she had a great time and so did I. 
              She showed a very high Interest Level.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Forward
               a day. We made plans to go out and have a picnic. This was her idea. I 
              was going to stop and pick some food up so I asked her if she needed me 
              to grab anything. This is when she tells me that she's still a little 
              nervous about dating me, because she had told herself she didn't want to
               get into another relationship for a few months (it's been about two 
              months since her last one). She said her "head was all over the place." 
              Then she said she wanted to take things really slow, which I told her I 
              have no problem with. So she cancelled our date to go and play poker 
              with a few of her friends, and that was that. Nothing was rescheduled.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><span class="il">Doc</span>,
               I'm crazy confused. One night Bridget is an 80% to 90% Interest Level 
              and the next afternoon she feels like a slim 50%. I'm not sure how to go
               about this one. How slow should I go? Should I go totally hands/lips 
              off and not talk to her as much? Or should I act like nothing happened 
              the other night, and just act more like a friend?</strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Derelle - whose head is spinning</strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Hi Derelle,</strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>It's
               good that this babe hustled you at first - it showed that she had high 
              Interest Level. Now let's see how you handled that high interest, 
              because that's the real test of whether you memorized my book and put my
               principles and techniques into action.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>You
               shouldn't be holding hands with this girl when you're walking to your 
              car. She should be taking your elbow at most. And you shouldn't be 
              hanging all over each other in public. Like my cousin Rabbi <span class="il">Love</span> says, "Displays of affection should always be private and discreet."</strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Derelle,
               an eight-hour date when you don't even know a girl is way, way too 
              long. To you Psych majors, here is the progression of how long dates 
              should last: the Starbucks date should last no longer than 45 minutes to
               one hour. The first dates after that should go two to two and a half, 
              no more than three hours MAXIMUM. A full eight hours is overkill in the 
              beginning of a relationship. Like my cousin Fast Eddie <span class="il">Love</span> from East L.A. says, "Dude, are you trying to give away the store? You don't even know this honey!" </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Now
               let's look at what happened next. This girl is all of a sudden nervous 
              about dating you and she's the one making all the dates? Like my Uncle 
              Jethro <span class="il">Love</span> says, "I think I hear the cuckoo bird singing!" </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Bridget
               might not want to get into a relationship so soon after her last one 
              ended, but so what? Nobody knows when relationships are going to happen 
              or not happen. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The point here is that Bridget is acting highly inconsistent.</span> Derelle, is that the kind of relationship you want?</strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Bridget's asking you out all the time and now she wants to go slow? Now think about what's happening here <em>logically</em>.
               Pretend you're a psychiatrist, my friend. What would you say about this
               woman? And what advice would you give yourself? Does this situation 
              make any sense at all? Like the great Doctor Freud once said, "We all 
              want to have our cake and eat it too. But we can't have it both ways." </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Then Bridget calls off your date to go and play cards. This is a broken date, pal. In my book it says <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a broken date means that the girl is OUT</span>. Period. So this thing is over, and that's all there is to it. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Guy,
               in the amount of time you spent with this girl, you didn't do all the 
              right things. In fact, you did everything wrong. You "brushed up" on my 
              book instead of <em>memorizing</em> it. You were using only a few of my 
              techniques when you should have been using ALL of them. In other words, 
              you took weak, halfway measures with Bridget and now you have to pay for
               not doing what you were supposed to do.<span>  </span></strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Actually Bridget is a slim <em>49%</em> Interest Level. There is no such thing as a 50% Interest Level. It's 
              either 51% and up, and 49% and below - which means you're OUT. And 
              you're out, Derelle. In this case you're out because there was a broken 
              date and you spent much too much time with this girl.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>You
               can't go slowly with Bridget now because you already went too fast and 
              crashed into a wall. Once you break the speed limit, it's too late. And 
              Bridget<em> broke a date</em> - which means it's adios, baby!<span>  </span>So
               now you're going to see her at work, smile, say "Hi, how ya doin'," and
               keep walking. That's it. You can't act like a friend because you're 
              nothing but an acquaintance. And Bridget won't even remember that. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Remember, guys: if you don't spoon-feed yourself, she's going to burn out on you.</strong></span></p>
