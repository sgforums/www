              <p>You are a concerned parent. Many parents have their views on relationships. Some youths get into relationship deal to peer pressure. But some are geninue. In such era, no one believe in true love or even love but that doesn't mean it don't exist. A one is mature and serious about relationship, age is never a factor. For a mature and serious couple, they can advance in their lives and also be together. Sometime, relationship can be a source of motivation to do well in their lives as there is a purpose. So please do not think that having a relationship spoils our youth. There is good and bad . We got to look at two sides of the coin plus everyone sees relationship at a different light. If your son even have a girlfriend now, my advice is let it be. Unless you know that your son is not ready to commit or not mature enough to handle such responsibilties, then maybe you should step in. You know your son best and you will know when he is ready and when he is not. But do not stop him if he is ready and YOU are not. That is a big differenece.</p>
              <p>But thanks for your input on this issue. I thank you for your time.</p>

              <p>I guess you are not in a right position to say anything. I can see that you are just targeting guys for their wrong doing based on your own experience. First of all, not all guys are bad and some are good. Doesn't mean that you met a very bad guy in your life then every guy is bad. You are aiming guys not the issue that I had posted.</p>

              <p>Having this thread is for an open discussion with useful input. No one want any sympathy for any act. As for you, you are just purely aiming at guys for no good reason. Beside, i'm a girl who stand on the right side but not the gender side. Maybe you should put aside your emotion before having any input for this thread. I thank you for your time.</p>
              <p>By the way, please do not pollute the thread if you have nothing worthy to speak of. I beg of you use this time for other stuff rather then arguing about your emotion.</p>

              <p>If the couple is mature enough they will know what to do.</p>
              <p>But if they are not, then too bad. In fact, ending the
              relationship right now would be the best ending (presuming that

              <p>I am here to talk about an incident that happened to my friend
              and his girlfriend. I just want to know what you guys think about
              this relationship.</p>
              <p>My friend (let's call him boyfriend) is a very faithful guy who
              loves his girlfriend very much. Most of the time I see him giving
              up his weekends to his girlfriend and thus he spend lesser time
              with his fellow friends or buddies. He is currently in NS but he is
              always free on weekends. He even agreed to give tuition for his
              girlfriend's sister.</p>
              <p>As for the girlfriend, I will say she also love my friend alot.
              But the way she thinks and speaks just confused me and her
              boyfriend. Here is one incident that happened.</p>
              <p>They had been dating for 2 years plus. They had a common
              committment which is to watch movie together every month. What
              happened is that the guy is spending most saturdays teaching his
              girlfriend's sister and sundays he got to go to church with her
              girlfriend. After church he will have to prepare to book in back to
              camp and his camp ain't near his house. After all, his girlfriend
              also needs to go to her aunt house to give tuition to her
              cousin.</p>
              <p>Therefore there is one month they realised that they did not
              watch a movie for that month and they left 1 last week before the
              month ends. Just  to make things worse, the boyfriend needs to
              be in camp on saturday thus he will be only be out of camp on
              saturday night. The girlfriend insisted on watching the movie and
              they both fought over this issue because the boyfriend is just
              feeling very tired and wish to have a break at home. He invited the
              girlfriend to come over to his house and they can spend time
              watching movies on the computer but she rejected the idea.</p>
              <p>Sunday came and to the boyfriend's surprise, the girlfriend do
              not need to go and teach tuition, so she keep insisting of watching
              movie again. But the boyfriend is really tired after the saturday
              activities in camp plus he woke up early sunday morning to attend
              church. Church ends at about 4 and he promised his parents to go
              back for dinner. Therefore there is no way he can go out or movie.
              He wanted to cheer up his girlfriend and try to make it up by
              telling her to meet her at woodlands for movie on wednesday night
              as he can come out of camp for that night to have a break. But the
              girlfriend replied that she is lazy and don't feel like going down
              to so far just to catch a movie. In the end, the girlfriend
              suggested breaking up.</p>
              <p>Before all these happens, everything was fine. Just because they
              failed to watch movie for a month and the girlfriend demanded a
              break up. The boyfriend is really sad about this. I can sense that
              he tired very hard. Everytime the couple fight over something, the
              boyfriend always give in as much as he can. So I feel that it is
              abit unfair for him. So what do you guys think?</p>

              <p>the girl does not love the boyfriend anymore (or she never loved him to begin with), she is just finding excuse to get rid of him and since he does not want to watch movie with her, it become a perfect excuse for her to use as a so called valid reason to dump him.</p>
