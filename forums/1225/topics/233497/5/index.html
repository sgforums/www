Why do you want to insist on paying? I think that paying for things is a small thing, and generally shouldnt need to be too calculative. Some things he pay, some things I pay, doesn't need to calculate down to every cent. And sometimes it isn't about ego if the guy is upset that the girl keeps insisting on paying, but even among friends I will feel a little hurt if a friend wants to be so calculative with me that i can't even treat him/her a meal when I feel like it? </strong><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">it's not being calculative ba..<br><br>partly bcos i dun want him to think that im with him bcos of his money.<br><br>but my ex told me if he insist on paying, i should juz graciously accept.. since then, I seldom reject man's offer.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   </span><br><br><strong><br>Well, maybe it is because you begged him. You can 'speed up' a relationship but it is very difficult to 'force' a friendship. And being his girlfriend does not automatically qualify you as his buddy/friend, and definitely does not entitle you to be privy to all that he thinks. And I think the more you quarrel about wanting to be 'in the know', the more he will shy away from wanting to tell y ou about it. </strong><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">The reason he gave was.. he din want me to worry for him..<br><br>he was almost involved in a military lawsuit and i was very worried, couldnt eat or sleep... </span><br><br><strong>I can only say perhaps you need to take some time off and re-assess the type of men you are interested in. A relationship is made up of many elements - companionship and lust ARE important in a lasting relationship. In fact, I think for most people, a compatible companionship AND lust is important before love can start to take root. Love takes time. </strong><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Perhaps?<br><br>but to me, love comes before lust.<br><br>but then again, i was juz referring to my exs.<br><br>not stereotyping here.  </span><br><br><strong>Take time to understand how each man needs to be loved cos all of them are different right?  We all need to be loved in different ways, when we are with different people, when we are in different life stages. </strong><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">true enough..</span><br><br><strong>You can't make anyone commit. No one is ever in a perpetually committed or uncommitted relationship. It isn't a ... 'state' in a relationship where everyone 'strives' towards.
