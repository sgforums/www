I'll write down 3 simply cos tts a nice number? Hehehhe<br><br>1) Don't be insecure. Be confident in who you are and your own ability to be loved. Nothing kills a relationship faster than a constant need for reassurance that can never be satisfied. It is tedious.<br><br>2) Be interested in your partner. Listen, Laugh and Laud compliments when its due. Honest and demonstrative affection is hard to resist. Show interest in what your partner enjoys (even if you don't have to get your entirely involved).<br><br>3) Be interesting. Be interested in life, people, places.

Why do you want to insist on paying? I think that paying for things is a small thing, and generally shouldnt need to be too calculative. Some things he pay, some things I pay, doesn't need to calculate down to every cent. And sometimes it isn't about ego if the guy is upset that the girl keeps insisting on paying, but even among friends I will feel a little hurt if a friend wants to be so calculative with me that i can't even treat him/her a meal when I feel like it?<br><br><blockquote><br><br>2) how to make my man open up to me?<br><br>Past experiences tell me that man like to keep things to themselves.. and if they really need to talk, they would find their good female frens, than to share with their girlfriend  (and true enough.. my guy frens also come to me when they have issue with their wife/gf)..

You can 'speed up' a relationship but it is very difficult to 'force' a friendship. And being his girlfriend does not automatically qualify you as his buddy/friend, and definitely does not entitle you to be privy to all that he thinks. And I think the more you quarrel about wanting to be 'in the know', the more he will shy away from wanting to tell y ou about it.<br><br><blockquote><br><br>3) What do men want from a relationship?<br><br>Pardon me for saying this, but my past relationships tell me that it's companionship and lust that they are after.<br><br></blockquote>I can only say perhaps you need to take some time off and re-assess the type of men you are interested in. A relationship is made up of many elements - companionship and lust ARE important in a lasting relationship. In fact, I think for most people,  a compatible companionship AND lust is important before love can start to take root. Love takes time.<br><br><blockquote><br>4) Man = rubber band?<br><br>I read the book "Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus' by John Gray.. still remember the 'rubber band theory'.. it says men reacts like rubber bands.. if he needs to be alone, let him be and he will come back to you after that.

No one is ever in a perpetually committed or uncommitted relationship. It isn't a ... 'state' in a relationship where everyone 'strives' towards. It is a continual process that needs to be worked at, the 'flux' that smooths the edges, heals the hurt, discard the unnecessary elements that weakens the relationship.</div>
