Of cos, there are some common traits like men need space, men need face...  but afterall, one thing could be important to one man, but not important to another man.<br><br>Like most forumites say here, they hate women who spend their money, but my ex love to spend money on me.  in the beginning of the relationship, we had to race to the counter to get the bill.  there was once, before i came out from the fitting room, he already paid!    And he will be very sad if i dun let him pay actually.  then i had to resort to only shop when he is not around!<br><br>Some forumites say "why dating muz go restaurants?"?  but my ex loves fine dining.  he will be very miserable if i bring him to a hawker with no air-con.<br><br>And all the forumites here say, food.  keep him well-fed.  but i had got another ex who doesnt like to eat.  Food?  no use.  Well, of cos i found out what he likes (*wink) and that relationship lasted for 5 years.  We broke up 2 years already, and he is still asking me to patch up till today.<br><br>Every man is different.   know your man, and do what he likes, do things that he enjoys doing together and abstain from wat he doesnt like.  Give him space, give him face.  Build mutual trust and respect.  That is the way to keep a man, i think.</div>

There are even arrangements where the Thai husband moves out, when the foreign husband visits.
