Be it guys or girls. A healthy dosage of space and freedom would be benificial to the relationship to me.<br><br>Demanding for someone to be there is a tad bit too much. I see girls doing that at times too. In fact, alot of girls use that as an excuse for a break up, guys too maybe?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>ah, the ego thing is overhyped.

Good luck to those who got such guys.<br><br>One thing I wanna emphasize on is "freedom" the guys want. Its a hard thing to juggle really... Especially if you are unsure of what the guy is like and what he wants. Sometimes he wants you at very odd times, sometimes he wanna steer clear of you at all costs other times.<br><br>I guess the simple way is to ask him is he free on that day. If he says yes and you 2 agreed to go out. Make sure you let him know beforehand, "You made your promise that you are free today to accompany me" or something liddat. If he is not free, you may have to find other people to go out with you. Thus his freedom is also your free time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Try not to bring him to an all girls outing. Unless he is those kind who revel in girls' company (IF you can tolerate that), it will not do him or you any good if you gals keep chatting away and leaving him alone. Same thing wise if he is bringing you to an all guys outing.<br><br>Also if you understand him well enough, you will automatically trust him. When he is out with other female friends, you trust him not to go astray or do something stupid. Of course there are exceptions whereby the guy is "trapped in a spider's web". SO you have to know him well beforehand to understand its NOT in his character to go astray should he is attached, ie. he is devoted to you.</div>

It helps to maintain the relationship. You can't expect them to stick to each other like glue 24/7.<br><br>Guys' ego very big? Not all. Cannot make him no face? I think there should be fair treatment on both sides. Submissive? No that's not a good man but neither should he give in to her all the time.<br><br>Guys like to see chio girls.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well .... those two words actually mean a whole range of things<br><br>When two people come together they've got to communicate how they want their relationship to be.  Alot of matters need to be agreed upon.  That's what I call setting boundaries.<br><br>One does not automatically know exactly how to behave in a relationship - thus boundaries must be set.<br><br>E.g.  Work vs couple time.  Is he a workaholic?  How much phone time a day is enough?<br>E.g.  A cosuming hobby, like gaming <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Are you being ignored? Or are  you denying him space?<br>E.g.  Closeness to other people.  Where do you draw the line between harmless friends and flirtation?<br><br>To set boundaries couples should try to do it 1. fairly, a reasonable compromise that you both can live with, and  2.  honestly- lay your cards on the table.  No "testing him" nonsense, no "I expect him to read my mind" games.<br><br>When you have good boundaries in place, and you both know clearly what is OK and what is not, I think the guy (and yourself) are happier because he knows where he stands, he gives you respect cos he knows you don't take just any nonsense, and he acknowledges that you've made some sacrifices to keep him happy too, and overall the relationship is healthy &amp; reaches a deeper understanding through the process of working to achieve a compromise.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by blu_sky:</div><div class="quote_body">what do you mean by set boundaries?</div></blockquote></div>
