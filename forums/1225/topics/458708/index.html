            <div class='col-md body'><p>so ive been dating this girl for over a month now we met of a dating site and we have been seeing each other weekly - when i meet up with her we get on really well the 1st date we had a meal which went really well, the 2nd date we went to see a movie and the 3rd date i got her flowers and picked her up and we went to a park and had a picnic, and the last date we went on went really well we had another meal and then came back to mine for a movie which we snuggled up for! after the 2nd date she asked me to kiss her so since then we have ended each date with a kiss, we are meant to be meeting up this wednesday as she wants me to meet her parents and friends its just theres been a few things that bother me in between the dates which give me a bad feeling - first of all she doesn't like using the phone so i don't call her which means texting is the main form of communication we normally talk a little every day until she stops replying, rarely does she text me first and sometimes i don't think i would hear from her at all if i don't text her, i have never overtext her though maybe im over thinking things but i would have thought that she would want to text me too. i just the impression that i like her more than she likes me which leads me on to the next thing after she kissed me on the 2nd date i thought i didn't need my dating profile any more so i deleted it, any way she told me during the 3rd date that she had as well as she didn't need it any more which made me happy, however i done something i probably shouldn't have done which was check to make sure she had and she hasn't and she still is using it as it says when she was last on-line i wish i hadn't of checked, cause now its making me think all sorts of things i do realise we have only met each other 4 times i just don't see why she would lie obviously i cant say anything to her as she will know i checked on her just seems there are so many mixed signals here and i don't know what to do Â just wanted some advice!</p></div>
