              <p class="byline"><span style="color: #333300;">by Brenda 
              Wilson</span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span class="program"><span style="color: #333300;">Morning 
              Edition,</span></span><span style="color: #333300;"> </span><span class="date"><span style="color: #333300;">June 8, 2009 · </span></span><span style="color: #333300;">The hookup — that 
              meeting and mating ritual that started among high school and college students — 
              is becoming a trend among young people who have entered the workaday world. For 
              the many who are delaying the responsibilities of marriage and child-rearing, 
              hooking up has virtually replaced dating. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">It is a major shift in the culture over the past few decades, says Kathleen 
              Bogle, a professor of sociology and criminal justice at La Salle University.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">Young people during one of the most sexually active periods of their lives 
              aren't necessarily looking for a mate. What used to be a mate-seeking ritual has 
              shifted to hookups: sexual encounters with no strings attached.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">"The idea used to be you are going to date someone that is going to lead to 
              something sexual happening," Bogle says. "In the hookup era, something sexual 
              happens, even though it may be less than sexual intercourse, that may or may not 
              ever lead to dating." </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">Young people from high school on are so preoccupied with friends, getting an 
              education and establishing themselves, they don't make time for 
              relationships.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #333300;">New Goal: Fun, Not Marriage</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">"Going out on a date is a sort of ironic, obsolete type of thing," says 
              25-year-old Elizabeth Welsh, who graduated from college in 2005 and now lives in 
              Boston. She says that among her friends, dating is a joke. "Going out on a date 
              to dinner and a movie? It's so cliche — isn't that funny?" </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">It seems it's far easier to have casual sexual encounters or hookups, though 
              several national surveys of college students found a stalwart 28 percent who 
              remain virgins. The term "hookup" is so vague, however, it might well encompass 
              someone's idea of virginity — it involves anything from kissing to fooling 
              around, oral sex and sexual intercourse. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">"For me, it's been anytime that I was attracted to a guy and we spent the 
              night together," Welsh says. "It has been sex; it has just been some sort of 
              light making out. That's the beautiful thing about the phrase. Whatever happened 
              is hooking up."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">Bogle interviewed college students on a small and a large campus, as well as 
              recent college graduates, to find out what was going on. The hooking-up 
              phenomena has been traced back to the 1960s and the 1970s, when male and female 
              students were thrown together in apartment-style dormitories, and there was a 
              revolt against strict rules on having a member of the opposite sex in your dorm, 
              lights out and curfews. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">"What you see on college campuses now, even in some cases Catholic campuses, 
              is that young men and women have unrestricted access to each other," Bogle says. 
              Throw in the heavy drinking that occurs on most campuses, and there are no 
              inhibitions to stand in the way of a hookup.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">The alumni Bogle spoke with were less into hooking up after leaving college, 
              but she says that's changing. It is catching on among young working adults, 
              mainly because of the Internet and social networks. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #333300;">The Evolution Of Dating</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">Dating itself represented a historical change. It evolved out of a courtship 
              ritual where young women entertained gentleman callers, usually in the home, 
              under the watchful eye of a chaperon. At the turn of the 20th century, dating 
              caught on among the poor whose homes were not suitable for entertaining, 
              according to Beth Bailey's history of dating, </span><em><span style="color: #333300;">From Front Porch to Back Seat: 
              Courtship in Twentieth-Century America</span></em><span style="color: #333300;">. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">Young couples would go out for a movie or dinner. The expectation was that 
              dating, as with courtship, would ultimately lead to a relationship, the capstone 
              of which was marriage. Precious few of these young women attended college. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">According to experts, the main reason hooking up is so popular among young 
              people is that in the United States and other Western countries, the age at 
              which people marry for the first time has been steadily creeping up. As of 2005, 
              in the United States, men married for the first time around the age of 27, and 
              women at about 25 years of age. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">Bogle says the hookup is what happens when high school seniors and college 
              freshmen suddenly begin to realize they won't be marrying for five, 10 or 15 
              years.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #333300;">Prioritizing Career And Social Life</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">Marriage is often the last thing on the minds of young people leaving college 
              today. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">"My first few years out of college was about trying to get on my feet and 
              having a good time," Welsh says. Dating and a relationship interfered with that. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">Avery Leake, 25, knows what this is like from the other side. He's in a 
              relationship now, but he says that, in general, most of the young women he used 
              to meet "just wanted sex. They're independent." Being in a relationship was not 
              important to them, especially if it interfered with their careers or their 
              pursuit of advanced degrees, he says. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">Leake found that he was also up against women who had as much money as he 
              had, if not more, and he says dating had just become too expensive. "You used to 
              be able to get away with paying $30 for a dinner and a movie," Leake says. "Not 
              anymore." </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #333300;">Empowerment Or Loss Of Intimacy?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">A number of experts accept this relaxed attitude toward sex outside of 
              relationships as a natural consequence of the sexual revolution, women's growing 
              independence and the availability of modern contraceptives. But Deborah Roffman, 
              who conducts human sexuality workshops for middle- and high-school-age students 
              and their parents, sees that as a distorted view of liberation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">"It's not a new model. I think most people would probably look back and agree 
              that this has been a more traditionally, or at least stereotypically, male 
              model," says Roffman. "What I've seen over the last few years is girls adopting 
              a more compartmentalized view, and feeling good and empowered by it." </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">She's not convinced that this is a good thing for women, and says that being 
              able to say yes is only one way of looking at freedom. She would feel much 
              better if young men also were developing a greater capacity for intimacy. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">Being able to engage in intimate relationships where men and women bring all 
              of themselves to the relationship is the cornerstone of family, Roffman says. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">But young people like Elizabeth Welsh don't see the hookup as an obstacle to 
              future relationships:</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">"It is a common and easy mistake," Welsh says, "to assume that the value of 
              friendship and those relationship building blocks have no place in longer-term 
              relationships."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">If you're honest and open about what you're doing, and willing to commit to a 
              relationship, she says, a hookup and friendship can be fused into a lifetime 
              partnership. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #333300;">Partnership Still The Ultimate Goal</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">At 25, May Wilkerson would like a relationship, but not a family — not quite 
              yet. She's lived a lot of places: Argentina, Canada and Paris. Wilkerson says 
              she hasn't found much intimacy with the men she's encountered.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">In New York City, where she moved two years ago, people seem even more 
              emotionally detached, and she thinks it is because so many of the people who 
              come to the big city are focused on success.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">"For many of us, the requisite vulnerability and exposure that comes from 
              being really intimate with someone in a committed sense is kind of threatening." </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">And the thought of being in love with someone, Wilkerson says, "is the most 
              terrifying thing."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">Yes, she has been in love, but the guy wasn't quite into it. There was one 
              older guy who was serious; he used to bring her cupcakes. She couldn't work up 
              an interest in him. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">Today, Wilkerson says people hook up via the Internet and text messaging. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">"What that means is that you have contact with many, many more people, but 
              each of those relationships takes up a little bit less of your life. That 
              fragmentation of the social world creates a lot of loneliness."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">Hooking up started before the Internet and social networks, but the 
              technology is extending the lifestyle way beyond the campus. Deborah Roffman 
              says no one is offering this generation guidance on how to manage what is 
              essentially a new stage in life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">The dilemma for this generation is how to learn about intimacy, she says: 
              "How am I going to have a series of relationships that are going to be healthy 
              for me and others, and going to prepare me" for settling down with one person? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">Wilkerson doesn't really focus on the concerns of people like Roffman, who 
              fear that hooking up doesn't bode well for the future of young people. She 
              thinks young people will be able to sort it out for themselves.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">"We all attended health class in middle school and high school. We know about 
              condoms and sexually transmitted disease. Sex is fun, and a lot of people would 
              argue that it is a physical need. It's a healthy activity."</span></p>
