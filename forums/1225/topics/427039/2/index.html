              <p>Muslims stick to their Islam no matter what, as they are brainwashed to an insane extent. I was raised as a Hindu since birth, as my mom is a hindu, but since age 11 I have stopped following the religion. My mother is perfectly fine with it.</p>
              <p>However, if I were born into a muslim family, and were to say I'm not following Islam anymore and not going to mosque, my parents would chop my head off without even considering that I'm their son.
