              <p>Can sms, but not the best form of communication.</p>
              <p>Nobody wants a love interest or partner to only be able to express their feelings  through sms right?</p>
              <p>Men already have weakness in reading body language and producing non verbal language positively. Now the form of communication have been weakened to non visuals, this might  not help unless you grasp a good sense of communication already.</p>
              <p>With that said, if the best a guy can do to contact a girl he's interested in is sms. So be it. Let it start with that, at least it's an action taken. </p>
