            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">This is a repost of a old thread dated two years ago. I think it is a very good thing to have a friend whom you can be open to and get her to show you something which you don't get to see all the time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>I'm still yet to find a girl who has sharp intuition. More or less, they have high awareness or EQ but not enough to read situation accurately.<br><br>Once again, this is a very good read.<br></span><br>__<br><br>Great article. Next time, get a galfriend to join you for Babe-watchin activities. I'm goin to have fun observing this weekend.<br><br><strong>Using Women's Intuition to Observe Girls</strong><br><br>I was out with some friends a few weeks ago, and I was talking with my friend's wife about my recent dating experiences. She is a relationship therapist, and we regularly talk about our opinions on dating and male-female dynamics. She gives me the "textbook" or more formal point of view, while I hit her with a more informal but real-life opinion. We often disagree, but that's the fun of it. I love hearing how things "should" be, and watching for the gap between that and reality.<br><br>We were talking about the possibilities in the bar we were in (a trendy San Francisco bar called Palominos, where the most beautiful women gather after hours.) My friend - I'll call her Rose for the sake of this article - started to pick out women she thought I would be interested in long-term.<br><br>(Mind you, she also ignored the fact that I had just said that I wasn't interested in marriage, only dating around. More on this in a minute.)<br><br>I would just pick women by appearance, pretty much at random. The typical male approach, right ? We get interested by what we see. Appearance is what we use initially to pick our targets. It's not because we're superficial (as many women like to say), but that we've been programmed by evolution to size up a woman based on her ability to demonstrate her physical health and ability to bear young. Typically we see this in a body of certain proportions, good hips/large !#*$*%s, good teeth, white eyes, etc.<br><br>Now after I picked a woman out of the crowd, my friend Rose took a look at her and said, "Oh, no. High maintenance. You don't want her."<br><br>This stopped me in my tracks.<br><br>How did she know that she was high-maintenance just by looking at her, and for only a second longer than I had ?<br><br>I stopped for a second and double-checked the woman I had picked. Sure enough, after watching her behavior, I started to understand how she could be thought of as high-maintenance.<br><br>First, she was very rigid in her posture. She had a serious look on her face. And even when she smiled to her friend, it looked a bit strained, like she was trying to keep up an appearance. Plus, she looked as if she'd spent about two hours on her appearance. Overall, she just looked like she wasn't very FLEXIBLE. I could imagine taking her out somewhere and hearing her nitpick about the unimportant details.<br><br>Sure, this may have been a case of judging a book by its cover, but you know what I've noticed? Most people can be sized up pretty quickly by their "cover." Sad but true. We just don't trust our intuition as much as we should.<br><br>Then, Rose pointed out another gal. "Her," she said. "That one is low-maintenance.<br><br>I checked this gal out, and she was even attractive to the eye. (The first thing a man notices.) Then I watched her a little longer and noticed that she also gave off an easy-going aura. She seemed to laugh freely and un-self-consciously. her body movements were relaxed and calm, not uptight and controlled. She was dressed nice, but it didn't look like she had to spend a couple hours applying make-up and picking out just the right clothes.<br><br>Her cover wasn't as slick and polished as the last woman's, but something in my gut told me she was much more relaxed and probably easier to talk to. Low maintenance.<br><br>Now, I'm sure I would have been able to figure out even more about these two women if I'd had a chance to talk to them both as well. Still, it was an eye-opener to see how women are able to pick up on these things in person.<br><br>Now the lesson here is two-fold :<br><br>1) Women are incredibly good at reading body language and interpreting a person by the way they behave. If you think you can sneak past a woman's defenses, you're nuts. She'll sniff you out faster than old pork in a trash can in summer. You've got to learn how to carry yourself around women of all ages and experience levels.<br><br>Why ? Because she will be able to figure out in a few short minutes what you're really made of. And, even if she isn't quite as good at describing the reasons why she thinks you're whatever she makes of you, she will FEEL it. And she'll trust that feeling for all it's worth.<br><br>2) You can pick up on these signals, too. Women are intuitive and perceptive about these things, but it's a skill you can learn as well. The signals are subtle, yet understandable. You can save yourself a lot of pain by reading a woman's visual cues to tell you about her personality and what kind of a woman she is.</div>
