            <div class='col-md body'>Your relationship with your girlfriend is sailing along -- you're having fun, there isn't a lot of fighting, and the sex is good. Everything seems to be working quite nicely.<br>But then, out of left field, she tosses you a hand grenade: she accuses you of having an affair with the new girl at work. A girl you've exchanged maybe ten words with.<br><br>After you finish picking your jaw up off the floor, you deny her accusation, but she's pouty, sullen. "I can't believe you're destroying our relationship," she tells you. "What is it? I'm not pretty enough for you anymore?"<br><br>Desperate, shaking your head in disbelief, you try to pour oil on troubled waters by apologizing for something you never did in the first place.<br><br>But it's too late. The sex is cut off. And it's only after innumerable phone calls, flower deliveries, and humiliating begging that you manage to restore harmony.<br><br>For something you never did in the first place.<br><br>What the hell happened here?<br><br>Well, my friend, you were just a victim of "The Test." And you failed it miserably.<br><br>the nasty tests women dish<br><br>__________________________________<br><br>Women are like spoiled children. They are self-focused, insecure and irrational. They crave drama and games. They demand constant attention, reassurance, and above all, power in relationships. And, like children, who ceaselessly push limits to see just how much they can get away with from their parents, women relentlessly test men.<br><br>Just how do women test? Here are a few examples:<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Canceling or changing plans at the last minute.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Not returning phone calls (even though she's interested in you).<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Finding fault with your clothes, hair, car, etc. and pressuring you to change them.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Pouting when you want to spend time with your buddies.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Bringing up the dreaded "Where do you think this relationship is going?" question.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Acting bratty, bitchy, demanding, dramatic, picky, or manipulative to see if you will put with it.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Testing to see how nice you are (will you back down or change your behavior to suit her?).<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Expecting you to ask for permission before doing any "guy stuff."<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Blatantly flirting with other men in front of you.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Accusing you of doing things you didn't do.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Threatening to leave or end the relationship if she doesn't get her way.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Blaming you when you call her on her behavior.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Making you jump through all sorts of hoops.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Asking "no-win situation" questions ("Does this dress make me look fat?" ).<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Playing hard-to-get -- pretending she's not interested in you when she really is, and then expecting you to keep pursuing her.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Not answering questions directly/expecting you to be a mind reader and then blaming you when you're not.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Withholding sex and making you beg for it.<br><br>"The Test" is all about control. Since women already know they control relationships with sex, they are experts at manipulating men. Their power base is granting and withdrawing attention and access to their "favors" (while making sure they extort a hefty price).<br><br>But they need more -- they need to know that their control is absolute. So they test men to see how far they can push them, to see just how much they can get away with. They test to see how insecure men are, to see how desperate they are for sex (to determine how much they can exploit them). They test to see how much they've been able to feminize men (for example, forcing them to express emotions) and so make them more controllable.<br><br>They test to reassure themselves of their physical attractiveness, to see if they can still wrap men around their fingers with their sexual power. They test to provide drama in their lives by provoking unnecessary fights and arguments.<br><br>Testing is a woman's way of keeping a man off-balance, of keeping him dancing to her tune like a puppet on a string. This is why, as soon as a man reacts to The Test by getting angry, giving in, or apologizing, he has failed. He's lost the relationship game and handed over all his male power, forever doomed to be the groveling wuss-boy who will kneel down and take anything his woman dishes out. And she loves it.<br><br>Thinking you can't win? Don't be so sure.<br><br>slam on the brakes<br><br><strong>Here are a few tips to put the brakes on her manipulative tests:<br><br>1- Develop a test "radar." Be on the lookout for the items in the list above. Remember; it is how a man reacts to a woman's testing off the bat that will determine the course of the relationship. Once you become aware of what she's doing, it will be much easier to stop it before it starts.<br><br>2- Never get angry at her testing, and never apologize for your behavior (assuming you've done nothing wrong) -- if you do, you'll lose instantly.<br><br>3- Test her back! Try using her own tests against her and see how she reacts.<br><br>4- Stand your ground at the outset. At the first inkling of a test, put your foot down, and keep it down. Tell her that you refuse to be tested. Explain to her that if she wants to be with you, then she'll have to knock off the childish power games.<br><br>5- When all else fails, walk away. Go out and look for a woman who doesn't need to test you and who genuinely appreciates you. This is your ultimate power as a man, and the ultimate "pass" of her tests.</strong></div>

(idealism could lead to optimism which could lead to disappointment) becos i have a pretty strong emotional structure to keep me in check. i've only been broken once ever in my life, and i am utterly disappointed at myself for that.<br><br>loving deep doesn't mean hurting ALOT when it ends. it doesn't have to be.<br><br>anywayz, back to it, i think understanding is a very important thing. of course, nothing's to say that the girl i love may wake up one more all insecure and wanting to test me, EVEN after knowing that i will be totally upset if she did. so... she still does. if u're in love, and u've been together for a while (being idealistic again) you would understand each other pretty well, and be able to tell she's insecure, and she able to tell that u KNOW wat she's up to. and u nip the problem in the bud.<br><br>when they know u love them, all they need to hear are the right things. REFUSE to go thru the test, but nip the problem in the bud when u sense something and soothe her insecurities. if the test is let drag for too long, there's something wrong with the "unwritten" communication between the two and perhaps the reln isn't that stong.<br><br>of course... there are TONNES of relns out there like that (not strong), so how? i dunno... hope that she won't test u until the reln becomes strong? ahahha...<br><br>i dun have answers to everything ....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>oh i refer back to my above post. i refuse to suck up to her and apologise for something i didn't do doesn't mean i won't be gentle yet resolute in how i handle the situation. i believe sometimes girls just get too emotional and they really don't know wat they are doing. i mean not as in they are blind or deaf or stupid. but they get confused sometimes and if u understand her.. set her straight. tell her: you are feeling this way BECOS blah blah, you are doing this BECOS blah blah... and u need not feel this way BECOS blah blah...<br><br>women choose a man they can rely on. if u can think on their behalf and decipher them even better then they can themselves, don't u think they will stick by u for support, since u know them so well? they want to feel safe, and safety is in knowing her man knows how she feels and that he loves her enuff to do wat is required to handle those feelings. it's all about emotions, deep down in a woman.<br><br>of course.. all that CRAP i just wrote, is almost impossible to do. but KNOWING where u need to go, the direction to get there, is important. u might not be able to do so now, but if ur direction is right, u might get close. but many guys are just clueless, so that's where relns are fragile.<br><br>and.. of course these are just my humble opinions.<br><br>seldom post long post anymore.. *phew*<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Be on the lookout for the items in the list above. Remember; it is how a man reacts to a woman's testing off the bat that will determine the course of the relationship. Once you become aware of what she's doing, it will be much easier to stop it before it starts.</strong><br><br>Bad move... What if you're not so good a 'radar'? There might be much misinterpretations, doubts and miscommunications.. Besides.. If you don't do well as a 'radar'... You'll probably wear out in time to come... Dragging the relationship DOWN with you...<br><br>ESPECIALLY a BAD move if you're an OVERLY SENSITIVE guy...<br><br><strong><br>3- Test her back! Try using her own tests against her and see how she reacts.</strong><br><br>Might not be such a smart move.. Probably testing the patience and tolerance of both parties... If FAILED, both parties' gonna be SUFFERING for it...<br><br><strong><br>4- Stand your ground at the outset. At the first inkling of a test, put your foot down, and keep it down. Tell her that you refuse to be tested. Explain to her that if she wants to be with you, then she'll have to knock off the childish power games.</strong><br><br>BAD MOVE.
