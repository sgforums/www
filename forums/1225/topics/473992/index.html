              <p>Firstly, let me explain my situation to you guys. Recently, I was just browsing my Facebook account and I saw my junior from the same secondary school. She's damn cute and I really wish to talk to her. But then, I'm currently studying in Singapore Polytechnic while she's doing her "A" levels at a JC.</p>
              <p>But there's a friend of mine who knows her and what should I do? Should I just start up a conversation with her on Facebook or should I talk to my friend first? Which will be a better option?</p>
              <p>And yes, I'm the shy guy those type despite being in a communication course in SP =.= That irony =.=</p>
              <p>Please give me your honest suggestion and I'll work on that :)</p>

              <p>I'm pretty sure that she's single. On a second thought, I can confirm that she's single. And not to mention, there's a similar case that happened to me before and eventually, I lose that girl due to my shyness and I seriously hope it'll not happen to me once again.</p>
              <p>After all, we are practically strangers and don't know each other and in addition, we are from different schools. So it's really alright to chat her up on Facebook just to understand her a little bit better and maybe exchange phone numbers? </p>
              <p>I'm just saying. I think I'm going to suck up my shyness and just do it before you got a boyfriend and that's just like de javu for me. </p>

              <p>You attracted to her looks, pui, what if she's not cute-looking? Like a guy who wants a girl not after his money, as a girl, I seriously hope a guy appreciates me for my personality not looks. </p>
              <p>You remind me of those kind of playboys in my school, aiming every gal. I dated around 3 years ago, and it was something like, at the start, he was like, "Damn you are so cute I love you so much! &lt;3", and a days later, "EWW you are so ugly I want to break-up with you". So, because of this boy I have since decided to focus on my education. Since she's a cute girl, most likely got guy who went out with her before, who probably has the same experiences as me. If I was the girl, I will outright reject you. What a shallow little guy. Such relationship will not really last. Oh, if you want to know how long the relationship lasted, well, we were only together for 3 days.</p>
              <p>This is not some fairytale, where the princess fall in love with the prince just after one dance. It's a slow progression from strangers, to friendship, to mutual understanding of each other and then to a close friendship, and then to a steady relationship. Just because she looks cute you want to rush into relationship with here. Hahahahahaha. Don't be surprise you if you ever get rich one day, and the model at the bar wants to date you just after one day of meeting.</p>
              <p>HAHAHA! </p>

I just wanted to get to know her better so start off with being a FRIEND. I know that it's a tough tough world out there and this ain't no Disney movie so yeah. </p>
