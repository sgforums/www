              <p>When it comes to romantic relationships and dating, the word honesty 
              seems to have taken on a different meaning. A lot of women equate being 
              honest with being open. When a man is not open to a woman, she considers
               him dishonest. But being honest and being open is two separate issues.<br> <br> Everyone has their share of positive and negative experiences in life. 
              It is entirely up to you to decide which experiences you wish to talk 
              about in the presence of your date/partner.<br> <br> If a man only chooses to talk about all his positive experiences to his 
              date, she can only have a positive image about him simply because she 
              doesn't know anything negative about him. Despite what they claim, women
               want to enjoy their date by having a positive and uplifting time with a
               guy. Anything that is negative will only have a negative effect on her 
              interest towards him. Which also means that anything positive will only 
              have a positive effect on her interest towards him. <br> <br> You can tell her how you used to represent your school for 
              athletic/sport competitions. Tell her you have a great family and enjoy 
              spending time with your family members on weekends/holidays. Tell her 
              you have a great job where you get along very well with all your 
              colleagues and you enjoy the work that you do. But never ever brag 
              though. Basically everything that comes out from your mouth has to be 
              positive and avoid anything negative at all costs.<br> <br> Woman like men who are mysterious and they like the fact that they have 
              to work to find out more about you. They like to play detective and find
               out everything about you. So it is of utmost importance for the man not
               to give the store away too easily. If you tell her your whole life 
              story on the first date, then there is nothing interesting for her to 
              find out anymore. You have to open up to her very slowly. Spoon feed her
               bit by bit. <br> <br> In fact, it is highly recommended for the man to do only 30% of the 
              talking by asking her questions about her and let her do 70% of the 
              talking. Listen attentively and ask her questions on her answers. Women 
              love to talk (about themselves).</p>
