            <div class='col-md body'>haiz...this is my 1st post and i also having some problem. Right now, I juz being too confuse.<br><br>You see, this few weeks,I having some trouble in my r/s. My guy like this gal, and i found out abt this. I was so angry with him that he actually went to date this gal behind my back. Then I told him, I wanna break with him. He cry and finally he let me go. I tot I could let him go but I came to realise, I can't. So two days ltr, I ask for a patch back. He told me he need time to think. So i told him, I can give him time. So that week, I dun call him nor sms him until on sat he sms me, asking whether did i go out anot. I told him yes,I gg out ltr.<br>That night,finally he sms me cos normally he won't not sms me. I am always the one who sms him call him 1st. I was so delighted that he actually sms.<br>So next day, we went to church(every sun), he still talk to me.<br><br>Then in the late afternoon, when we went back to his hse. he started to give me that "pissed off " face. I felt that something is wrong but i did not ask.<br>Until I wanted to go home, he send me home.In his car, I ask him, "are u not happy"He say no. I ask him whether did he have any problem.<br>He did not reply me.<br>I sense something is wrong, but i do not question him further.<br>When we reach my home, I ask him again. I tell him even if he doen't treat me like his gf, at least treat me like a frenz. I scold him, I told him. I really pissed off by his behaviour. He juz refuse to tell me what happen. Den he told me that I can dun bother abt him. He keep telling me how lousy he is. I told him, no, he not lousy at all.<br><br>Haiz... is he telling me to give up on him.Did i ask too much ques?<br>anyone can tell me what going in a guy mind? Anyone encounter this?<br>I really dunno what to do. Right now, I afraid that he might not sms me again.<br>I really want to give this r/s a chance. But how????</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well he obviously was waiting for you to say something to brighten up the atmosphere in the journey home in his car. That's all I can say.<br><br>Some guys take the initiative with a plan in mind, but wait for some affiriming signs from the female counterpart before continuing to the next phase. Think if you can get him to come out for you again, nxt time just be more affirimin'.<br><br>Still, I think that if he's able to date behind your back it doesn't reflect a very optimistic future for your r/s even if you cont'd. The groundwork for trust &amp; transparency just isn't there in your r/s. I usually tell my gf if i do date any girls, and she reciprocate the gesture though I'm usually the one that goes out like 10x more. Emotions get a bit stormy here and there when we go out with other partners la, but at least it's a buffered. We've never quarelled about gg out with other guys/girls exclusively or think of breakup.<br><br>'nuff said. Think you should move on, just note that some guys function like your ex does. Plenty of nicer guys out there for you. If you go to church do pray to God for the strength to be let go &amp; set free. He's definitely got someone else in mind for you. God never plans break-ups u know, it's unhealthy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u don need to ask him for patch.<br><br>He's telling u he is lousy because he wanna use a exucse to ditch and at the same time u can pity him.<br><br>He's the one not being sincere abt this relationship since how can he like another gal in this process ?<br><br>If u can't forget him do some thing else like playing game, sports etc.<br><br>Don ask him for patch again man.<br><br></div>
