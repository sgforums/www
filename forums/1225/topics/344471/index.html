            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">as a lady, i think most quite true lah<br></span><br><br><br><br>-- Guys hate sluts even though they have sex with them!<br><br>--"Hey, are you busy?" or "Are you doing something?" ~ two phrases guys open with to stop from stammering on the phone.<br><br>--Guys may be flirting around all day but before they go to sleep, they always think about the girl they truly care about.<br><br>--Before they call, guys try to plan out a little about what they're gonna say so there aren't awkward pauses, but once he's on the phone he forgets it all and makes it up as he goes.<br><br>--Guys go crazy over a girl's smile.<br><br>--Guys will do anything just to get you to notice him.<br><br>--Guys hate it when you talk about your ex-boyfriend or ex love-interest. Unless they're goin for the let-her-complain-to-you-and-then-have-her-realize-how-wonderful-and-nice-you-are<br>method.<br><br>--A guy who likes you wants to be the only guy you talk to.<br><br>--Boyfriends need to be reassured often that they're still loved.<br><br>--Don't talk about your guy friends to your boyfriend.<br><br>--Guys get jealous easily.<br><br>--Guys are more emotional than they'd like people to think.<br><br>--Giving a guy a hanging message like "You know what?!..uh...nevermind.." would make him jump to a conclusion that is far from what you are thinking. And he'll assume he did something wrong and he'll obsess about it trying to figure it out.<br><br>--Guys are good flatterers when courting but they usually stammer when they talk to a girl they really like.<br><br>--Guys hate asking parents for money to buy girls presents. So they come up with ideas like saving their lunch money for a week. But it never works because guys are always hungry so they end up asking the parents for money anyway.<br><br>--Girls are guys' weaknesses.<br><br>--Guys are very open about themselves.<br><br>--It's good to test a guy first before you trust him. But don't let him wait too long.<br><br>--Your best friend, whom your boyfriend seeks help from about his problems with you may end up being admired by your boyfriend.<br><br>--If a guy tells you about his problems, he just needs someone to listen to him. You don't need to give advice.<br><br>--A usual act that proves that the guy likes you is when he teases you.<br><br>--Guys love you more than you love them if they are serious in your relationships.<br><br>--Guys will brag about anything.<br><br>--Guys use words like hot or cute to describe girls. We rarely use beautiful. If a guy uses that, he likes you a whole hell of a lot.<br><br>--Guys think WAY too much. One small thing a girl does, even if she doesn't notice it can make the guy think about it for hours, trying to figure out what it meant.<br><br>--Guys seek for advice from girls not other guys. Because most guys think alike, so if one guy's confused, then we're all confused.<br><br>--Any guy could write out a rulebook or advice book for flirting, but no guy can write out a book about relationships.<br><br>--Try to be as straightforward as possible.<br><br>--A guy has to experience rejection, because if he's too-good-never-been-busted, never been in love and hurt, he won't be mature and grown up.<br><br>--If the guy does something stupid in front of the girl, he will think about it for the next couple days or until the next time he spends time with the girl.<br><br>--No matter how much guys talk about asses and boobs, personality is key.<br><br>--Guys learn from experience not from the romance books that girls read and take as their basis of experience.<br><br>--Guys worry about the thin line between being compassionate and being whipped.<br><br>--If a guy looks unusually calm and laid back, he's probably faking it and is spazzing inside.<br><br>--When a guy says he is going crazy about the girl, he really is. Guys rarely say that.<br><br>--When a guy asks you to leave him alone, he's just actually saying, "Please come and listen to me."<br><br>--Guys don't really have final decisions.<br><br>--If a guy starts to talk seriously, listen to him. It doesn't happen that often, so when it does, you know something's up.<br><br>--If your best guy friend seems to avoid you or is never around when you're with your boyfriend, he's probably jealous and likes you.<br><br>--When a guy looks at you for longer than a second, he's definitely thinking something.<br><br>--Guys like femininity not feebleness.<br><br>--Guys don't like girls who punch harder than they do.<br><br>--A guy has more problems than you can see with your naked eyes.<br><br>--Don't be a snob. Guys can be intimidated and give up easily.<br><br>--Everything in moderation. Put on makeup, wear perfume. Just not too much.<br><br>--Guys talk about girls more than girls talk about guys.<br><br>--Guys hate rejection, but they hate being led on even more.<br><br>--Guys really think that girls are strange and have unpredictable decisions and are MAD confusing but somehow are drawn even more to them.<br><br>--A guy would give his left nut to be able to read a girl's mind for a day.<br><br>--No guy can handle all his problems on his own. He's just too stubborn to admit it.<br><br>--Not all guys are assholes. Just because ONE is a jackass doesnt mean he represents ALL of us.<br><br>--We don't like girls who are too skinny.<br><br>--We love it when girls talk about there boobs.<br><br>--Always make sure you know what kind of stuff your getting into before making out with a guy ...like wheather it's a one time deal or not ....<br><br>--Believe it or not shy guys are the most easiest to talk to..it may not seem right but trust me they will start opening up like books after you just ask them questions about their lives and unoticable tell them about yours...<br><br>--When a guy hits your butt it means that he wants you sexually<br><br>--Even if they refuse it all guys are ticklish on the ribs..<br><br>--Guys love neck rubs and if he lets you keep doing it ..it means that he really likes you or his neck really hurts...<br><br>--Guys will test the waters to see how far they can get with you. Even if he doesn't intend to it will happen. Know how far it is you want to let him go and he will respect that...after you let him know a couple times.<br><br>--When a guy sacrifices his sleep and health just to be with you, he really likes you and wants to be with you as much as possible.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>50 things most guys dont know about girls<br><br></strong>1. Girls hate it when guys say perverted things.<br><br>2. Girls like to be told that they're beautiful, rather than hot, pretty, cute, or sexy. It just gives more meaning.<br><br>3. Girls love to feel special, even though they might not show it.<br><br>4. Girls talk about EVERYTHING with their girlfriends. So that means, you're possibly 90% of their conversation. And believe me, trash talking takes up most of it, unless you're a Greek god, which you're not.<br><br>5. When girls are online, they want the guy to instant message them first, and they literally burn up inside when they're not messaged. Of course, when they are messaged, they play it all cool and go "oh, hey" as if they just discovered your message.<br><br>6. Girls have a thing for guys who dress GQ.<br><br>7. Girls love it when guys are over 6 feet.<br><br>8. Girls find it awfully attractive when guys wear just a white t-shirt and jeans and yet they happen to look awesome in it.<br><br>9. Remember. Sense of humor. GIRLS LOVE GUYS WHO CAN MAKE THEM LAUGH.<br><br>10. Girls hate guys with bad hygiene. So put on that deodorant and clip those nails!<br><br>11. Girls love guys who know how to dance.<br><br>12. Girls love it when a guy pulls them close by the waist.<br><br>13. Girls go crazy when a guy smells good.<br><br>14. Girls hate cocky guys.<br><br>15. Usually, when a girl is sarcastically mean to you, it means they're attracted to you, but are afraid that they'll be showing too much.<br><br>16. A kiss on the hand with the right timing can be a REAL TURN-ON.<br><br>17. Girls have a thing for guys who sport blazers with a destroyed tee underneath.<br><br>18. Girls have a thing for guys who have messy sex hair.<br><br>19. Some girls can think about their crushes for 18+ hours straight. No exaggeration.<br><br>20. When a guy says something really sentimental, girls will remember it forever.<br><br>21. The smallest gestures, the smallest stares, and the smallest statements could make a girl's year. No joke.<br><br>22. Girls get embarassed easily, even if guys don't know what the hell just happened.<br><br>23. Girls daydream about their crushes. Like getting married, going on dates, kissing, etc. They just don't show it.<br><br>24. Girls HATE players.<br><br>25. Guys who can sing are a major turn on.<br><br>26. Guitarists are sexy.<br><br>27. When a girl is upset and wants you to listen, she wants you to listen. Don't give her advice unless she asks for it.<br><br>28. When a girl is crying, she feels a lot safer if you pull her close and tell her that everything is going to be alright.<br><br>29. Girls love it when guys say their name.<br><br>30. Girls don't like short tempered guys.<br><br>31. Sometimes girls just wish that guys would notice when they get a new haircut or if they're wearing eyeliner.<br><br>32. When a girl calls you her loser or her dork, it usually means she's attracted to you.<br><br>33. Girls find it a lot more romantic if you just fall asleep with them holding them with your arms rather than having a night of hot kinky sex.<br><br>34. Girls will never say I love you unless you say it first. But that doesn't mean she doesn't want to scream it from the top of her lungs.<br><br>35. Girls love confidence.<br><br>36. Girls don't like rock-hard guys. They like to know that guys can have a sensitive side too.<br><br>37. There comes a time when girls have needs too. Enough said.<br><br>38. A girl will cry over you a lot more than you think.<br><br>39. A girl's wounds can last awhile. And when I say awhile, I mean awhile.<br><br>40. Girls hate guys who smell bad.<br><br>41. When a girl cooks for you, you know you mean a lot to her.<br><br>42. Girls don't like it when you think other women are hot and say it so.<br><br>43. Eyeliner is a girl's essential product. Don't ever try to take it away from her.<br><br>44. Girls hate it, absolutely HATE IT when guys don't keep their promises. It throws them over the top.<br><br>45. Every girl fantasizes about her wedding. Her dress, her flowers, her shoes, her hair. More than you think.<br><br>46. Girls hate it when other girls flirt. Yet they flirt themselves too. Ah, the beauty of irony.<br><br>47. Girls will save instant message conversations when they like a guy.<br><br>48. A phone call, a text message, or a single Hershey's kiss will mean A LOT MORE than a bouquet of flowers and a box of chocolates on her birthday.<br><br>49. Every girl think she's pretty in one way or another. They just won't admit it.<br><br>50. Girls are VERY SELF-CONSCIOUS when it comes to their looks. No makeup is a very sensitive topic to them. ;P<br></p></div>

              it.<br> <br> 4. Girls talk about EVERYTHING with their girlfriends. So that
              means, you're possibly 90% of their conversation. And believe me,
              trash talking takes up most of it, unless you're a Greek god, which
              you're not.<br> <br> 5. When girls are online, they want the guy to instant message them
              first, and they literally burn up inside when they're not messaged.
              Of course, when they are messaged, they play it all cool and go
              "oh, hey" as if they just discovered your message.<br> <br> 6. Girls have a thing for guys who dress GQ.<br> <br> 7. Girls love it when guys are over 6 feet.<br> <br> 8. Girls find it awfully attractive when guys wear just a white
              t-shirt and jeans and yet they happen to look awesome in it.<br> <br> 9. Remember. Sense of humor. GIRLS LOVE GUYS WHO CAN MAKE THEM
              LAUGH.<br> <br> 10. Girls hate guys with bad hygiene. So put on that deodorant and
              clip those nails!<br> <br> 11. Girls love guys who know how to dance.<br> <br> 12. Girls love it when a guy pulls them close by the waist.<br> <br> 13. Girls go crazy when a guy smells good.<br> <br> 14. Girls hate cocky guys.<br> <br> 15. Usually, when a girl is sarcastically mean to you, it means
              they're attracted to you, but are afraid that they'll be showing
              too much.<br> <br> 16. A kiss on the hand with the right timing can be a REAL
              TURN-ON.<br> <br> 17. Girls have a thing for guys who sport blazers with a destroyed
              tee underneath.<br> <br> 18. Girls have a thing for guys who have messy sex hair.<br> <br> 19. Some girls can think about their crushes for 18+ hours
              straight. No exaggeration.<br> <br> 20. When a guy says something really sentimental, girls will
              remember it forever.<br> <br> 21. The smallest gestures, the smallest stares, and the smallest
              statements could make a girl's year. No joke.<br> <br> 22. Girls get embarassed easily, even if guys don't know what the
              hell just happened.<br> <br> 23. Girls daydream about their crushes. Like getting married, going
              on dates, kissing, etc. They just don't show it.<br> <br> 24. Girls HATE players.<br> <br> 25. Guys who can sing are a major turn on.<br> <br> 26. Guitarists are sexy.<br> <br> 27. When a girl is upset and wants you to listen, she wants you to
              listen. Don't give her advice unless she asks for it.<br> <br> 28. When a girl is crying, she feels a lot safer if you pull her
              close and tell her that everything is going to be alright.<br> <br> 29. Girls love it when guys say their name.<br> <br> 30. Girls don't like short tempered guys.<br> <br> 31. Sometimes girls just wish that guys would notice when they get
              a new haircut or if they're wearing eyeliner.<br> <br> 32. When a girl calls you her loser or her dork, it usually means
              she's attracted to you.<br> <br> 33. Girls find it a lot more romantic if you just fall asleep with
              them holding them with your arms rather than having a night of hot
              kinky sex.<br> <br> 34. Girls will never say I love you unless you say it first. But
              that doesn't mean she doesn't want to scream it from the top of her
              lungs.<br> <br> 35. Girls love confidence.<br> <br> 36. Girls don't like rock-hard guys. They like to know that guys
              can have a sensitive side too.<br> <br> 37. There comes a time when girls have needs too. Enough
              said.<br> <br> 38. A girl will cry over you a lot more than you think.<br> <br> 39. A girl's wounds can last awhile. And when I say awhile, I mean
              awhile.<br> <br> 40. Girls hate guys who smell bad.<br> <br> 41. When a girl cooks for you, you know you mean a lot to
              her.<br> <br> 42. Girls don't like it when you think other women are hot and say
              it so.<br> <br> 43. Eyeliner is a girl's essential product. Don't ever try to take
              it away from her.<br> <br> 44. Girls hate it, absolutely HATE IT when guys don't keep their
              promises. It throws them over the top.<br> <br> 45. Every girl fantasizes about her wedding. Her dress, her
              flowers, her shoes, her hair. More than you think.<br> <br> 46. Girls hate it when other girls flirt. Yet they flirt themselves
              too. Ah, the beauty of irony.<br> <br> 47. Girls will save instant message conversations when they like a
              guy.<br> <br> 48. A phone call, a text message, or a single Hershey's kiss will
              mean A LOT MORE than a bouquet of flowers and a box of chocolates
              on her birthday.<br> <br> 49. Every girl think she's pretty in one way or another. They just
              won't admit it.<br> <br> 50. Girls are VERY SELF-CONSCIOUS when it comes to their looks. No
              makeup is a very sensitive topic to them. ;P</p>

              they always think about the girl they truly care about.<br> <br> --Before they call, guys try to plan out a little about what
              they're gonna say so there aren't awkward pauses, but once he's on
              the phone he forgets it all and makes it up as he goes.<br> <br> --Guys go crazy over a girl's smile.<br> <br> --Guys will do anything just to get you to notice him.<br> <br> --Guys hate it when you talk about your ex-boyfriend or ex
              love-interest. Unless they're goin for the
              let-her-complain-to-you-and-then-have-her-realize-how-wonderful-and-nice-you-are<br> method.<br> <br> --A guy who likes you wants to be the only guy you talk to.<br> <br> --Boyfriends need to be reassured often that they're still
              loved.<br> <br> --Don't talk about your guy friends to your boyfriend.<br> <br> --Guys get jealous easily.<br> <br> --Guys are more emotional than they'd like people to think.<br> <br> --Giving a guy a hanging message like "You know
              what?!..uh...nevermind.." would make him jump to a conclusion that
              is far from what you are thinking. And he'll assume he did
              something wrong and he'll obsess about it trying to figure it
              out.<br> <br> --Guys are good flatterers when courting but they usually stammer
              when they talk to a girl they really like.<br> <br> --Guys hate asking parents for money to buy girls presents. So they
              come up with ideas like saving their lunch money for a week. But it
              never works because guys are always hungry so they end up asking
              the parents for money anyway.<br> <br> --Girls are guys' weaknesses.<br> <br> --Guys are very open about themselves.<br> <br> --It's good to test a guy first before you trust him. But don't let
              him wait too long.<br> <br> --Your best friend, whom your boyfriend seeks help from about his
              problems with you may end up being admired by your boyfriend.<br> <br> --If a guy tells you about his problems, he just needs someone to
              listen to him. You don't need to give advice.<br> <br> --A usual act that proves that the guy likes you is when he teases
              you.<br> <br> --Guys love you more than you love them if they are serious in your
              relationships.<br> <br> --Guys will brag about anything.<br> <br> --Guys use words like hot or cute to describe girls. We rarely use
              beautiful. If a guy uses that, he likes you a whole hell of a
              lot.<br> <br> --Guys think WAY too much. One small thing a girl does, even if she
              doesn't notice it can make the guy think about it for hours, trying
              to figure out what it meant.<br> <br> --Guys seek for advice from girls not other guys. Because most guys
              think alike, so if one guy's confused, then we're all
              confused.<br> <br> --Any guy could write out a rulebook or advice book for flirting,
              but no guy can write out a book about relationships.<br> <br> --Try to be as straightforward as possible.<br> <br> --A guy has to experience rejection, because if he's
              too-good-never-been-busted, never been in love and hurt, he won't
              be mature and grown up.<br> <br> --If the guy does something stupid in front of the girl, he will
              think about it for the next couple days or until the next time he
              spends time with the girl.<br> <br> --No matter how much guys talk about asses and boobs, personality
              is key.<br> <br> --Guys learn from experience not from the romance books that girls
              read and take as their basis of experience.<br> <br> --Guys worry about the thin line between being compassionate and
              being whipped.<br> <br> --If a guy looks unusually calm and laid back, he's probably faking
              it and is spazzing inside.<br> <br> --When a guy says he is going crazy about the girl, he really is.
              Guys rarely say that.<br> <br> --When a guy asks you to leave him alone, he's just actually
              saying, "Please come and listen to me."<br> <br> --Guys don't really have final decisions.<br> <br> --If a guy starts to talk seriously, listen to him. It doesn't
              happen that often, so when it does, you know something's up.<br> <br> --If your best guy friend seems to avoid you or is never around
              when you're with your boyfriend, he's probably jealous and likes
              you.<br> <br> --When a guy looks at you for longer than a second, he's definitely
              thinking something.<br> <br> --Guys like femininity not feebleness.<br> <br> --Guys don't like girls who punch harder than they do.<br> <br> --A guy has more problems than you can see with your naked
              eyes.<br> <br> --Don't be a snob. Guys can be intimidated and give up
              easily.<br> <br> --Everything in moderation. Put on makeup, wear perfume. Just not
              too much.<br> <br> --Guys talk about girls more than girls talk about guys.<br> <br> --Guys hate rejection, but they hate being led on even more.<br> <br> --Guys really think that girls are strange and have unpredictable
              decisions and are MAD confusing but somehow are drawn even more to
              them.<br> <br> --A guy would give his left nut to be able to read a girl's mind
              for a day.<br> <br> --No guy can handle all his problems on his own. He's just too
              stubborn to admit it.<br> <br> --Not all guys are assholes. Just because ONE is a jackass doesnt
              mean he represents ALL of us.<br> <br> --We don't like girls who are too skinny.<br> <br> --We love it when girls talk about there boobs.<br> <br> --Always make sure you know what kind of stuff your getting into
              before making out with a guy ...like wheather it's a one time deal
              or not ....<br> <br> --Believe it or not shy guys are the most easiest to talk to..it
              may not seem right but trust me they will start opening up like
              books after you just ask them questions about their lives and
              unoticable tell them about yours...<br> <br> --When a guy hits your butt it means that he wants you
              sexually<br> <br> --Even if they refuse it all guys are ticklish on the ribs..<br> <br> --Guys love neck rubs and if he lets you keep doing it ..it means
              that he really likes you or his neck really hurts...<br> <br> --Guys will test the waters to see how far they can get with you.
              Even if he doesn't intend to it will happen. Know how far it is you
              want to let him go and he will respect that...after you let him
              know a couple times.<br> <br> --When a guy sacrifices his sleep and health just to be with you,
              he really likes you and wants to be with you as much as
              possible.</p>

              <p>Things you shld know about girls</p>
              <p><br>1. Don't ever lie to us; we always find out. (CARDINAL RULE) <br><br>2. Don't say you understand when you don't. <br><br>3. Girls are petty; get over it. We like to start fights. <br><br>4. You don't have PMS, so don't act like you know what it's like. Don't try to understand...believe me you never will. <br><br>5. Saying something sweet might get you off the hook; doing something sweet will always get you off the hook. <br><br>6. We don't like it when you act like Mr. Big. <br><br>7. A system in your car only impresses your homeboys. <br><br>8. It's good to be sensitive sometimes. <br><br>9. If you did something wrong or even if you didn't, apologize. <br><br>10. Be spontaneous; dinner and a movie won't always cut it, but it is extremely sweet. <br><br>11. We are self-conscious by nature; we can't help it. <br><br>12. We are Drama queens; never forget that. <br><br><br>13. Fashion police do exist. <br><br>14. We absolutely DO NOT care about monster trucks, car systems, paintball, or anything else you and your friends talk about. <br><br>15. Hugs and kisses must be given at all times. <br><br>16. We don't shave our legs everyday: get over it. <br><br>17. Don't make bets about us; we always find out; you may think we don't know, but WE DO! <br><br>18. Shave! No matter how cool you think your goatee or beard or mustache looks, we hate it. We like clean-cut men. <br><br>19. Even if you think it is cool to burp, fart, or emit other strange gases from your body, it is not. <br><br>20. Don't compare us to Pamela Anderson; parts of her are fake, just remember that. (Remember: you have a better shot at us than you ever will have with her.) <br><br>21. It is not cool to shoot snot rockets. <br><br>22. We are beautiful at all times. <br><br>23. We will always think we are fat, so humor us and tell us we aren't. <br><br>24. You can shoot hoops, score a goal, knock down big fat guys, and hit a little baseball with a stick, so why can't you aim in the toilet and not on it. <br><br>25. Most importantly: we are always right in one way or another so don't forget that!</p>

              <p>More things to know about guys..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Guys don't actually look after good-looking girls. They prefer neat and presentable girls. <br><br>Guys hate flirts. <br><br>A guy can like you for a minute, and then forget you afterwards. <br><br>When a guy says he doesn't understand you, it simply means you're not thinking the way he is. <br><br>When a guy really likes you, he'll disregard all your bad characteristics. <br><br>When guys want to meet your parents. Let them. <br><br>Guys want to tell you many things but they can't. And they sure have one habit to gain courage and spirit to tell you many things and it is drinking! <br><br>Guys cry!!! <br><br>Don't provoke the guy to heat up. Believe me. He will. <br><br>Guys can never dream and hope too much. <br><br>Guys usually try hard to get the girl who has dumped them, and this makes it harder for them to accept their defeat. <br><br>When you touch a guy's heart, there's no turning back. <br><br>Guys go crazy when girls touch their hands. <br><br>When a guy makes a prolonged "umm" or makes any excuses when you're asking him to do you a favor, he's actually saying that he doesn't like you and he can't lay down the card for you. <br><br>When a girl says "no", a guy hears it as "try again tomorrow." <br><br>You have to tell a guy what you really want before he gets the message clearly. <br><br>Guys hate gays! <br><br>Guys love their moms. <br><br>A guy would sacrifice his money for lunch just to get you a couple of roses. <br><br>A guy often thinks about the girl who likes him. But this doesn't mean that the guy likes her. <br><br>You can never understand him unless you listen to him. <br><br>If a guy tells you he loves you once in a lifetime. He does. <br><br>Beware. Guys can make gossips scatter through half of the face of the earth faster than girls can.</p>
              <p>Like Eve, girls are guys' weaknesses. <br><br>No guy is bad when he is courting <br><br>Guys hate it when their clothes get dirty. Even a small dot. <br><br>Guys really admire girls that they like even if they're not that much pretty. <br><br>A usual act that proves that the guy likes you is when he teases you. <br><br>A guy finds ways to keep you off from linking with someone else. <br><br>Guys love girls with brains more than girls in miniskirts. <br><br>Guys try to find the stuffed toy a girl wants but would unluckily get the wrong one. <br><br>Guys virtually brag about anything. <br><br>Guys cannot keep secrets that girls tell them. <br><br>Guys think too much. <br><br>Guys' fantasies are unlimited. <br><br>Girls' height doesn't really matter to a guy but her weight does! <br><br>Guys tend to get serious with their relationship and become too possessive. So watch out girls!!! <br><br>When a girl makes the boy suffer during courtship, it would be hard for him to let go of that girl. <br><br>. It's not easy for a guy to let go of his girlfriend after they broke up especially when they've been together for 3 years or more. <br><br>You have to tell a guy what you really want before getting involved with that guy. <br><br>When an unlikable circumstance comes, guys blame themselves a lot more than girls do. They could even hurt themselves physically. <br><br>Guys have strong passion to change but have weak will power. <br><br>Guys are tigers in their peer groups but become tamed pussycats with their girlfriends. <br><br>When a guy pretends to be calm, check if he's sweating. You'll probably see that he is nervous. <br><br>When a guy loves you, bring out the best in him. <br><br>If a guy starts to talk seriously, listen to him. <br><br>If a guy has been kept shut or silent, say something. <br><br>Guys believe that there's no such thing as love at first sight, but court the girls anyway and then realize at the end that he is wrong. <br><br>A guy would waste his time over video games and basketball, the way a girl would do over her romance novels and make-ups. <br><br>Guys love girls who can cook or bake. <br><br>Guys like girls who are like their moms. No kidding! <br><br>A guy's friend knows everything about him. Use this to your advantage. <br><br>Don't be a snob. Guys may easily give up on the first sign of rejection. <br><br>Don't be biased. Try loving a guy without prejudice and you'll be surprised. <br><br>Girls who bathe in their eau de perfumes do more repelling than attracting guys. <br><br>Guys are more talkative than girls are especially when the topic is about girls. <br><br>Guys don't comprehend the statement "Get lost" too well. <br><br>When a guy gives a crooked or pretentious grin at your jokes, he finds them offending and he just tried to be polite. <br><br>Guys don't care about how shiny their shoes are unlike girls. <br><br>Guys tend to generalize about girls but once they get to know them,they'll realize they're wrong. <br><br>Any guy can handle his problems all by his own. He's just too stubborn to deal with it. <br><br>Guys find it so objectionable when a girl swears. <br><br> Guys' weakest point is at the knee. <br><br>When a problem arises, a guy usually keeps himself cool but is already thinking of a way out. <br><br>When a guy is conscious of his looks, it shows he is not good at fixing things. <br><br>When a guy looks at you, either he's amazed of you or he's criticizing you. <br><br>When you catch him cheating on you and he asks for a second chance, give it to him. But when you catch him again and he asks for another chance, ignore him. <br><br>If a guy lets you go, he really loves you. <br><br>Guys learn from experience not from the romance books that girls read and take as their basis of experience. <br><br> You can tell if a guy is really hurt or in pain when he cries in front of you! <br><br> If a guy suddenly asks you for a date, ask him first why. <br><br> When a guy says he can't sleep if he doesn't hear your voice even just for one night, hang up. He also tells that to another girl. He only flatters you and sometimes makes fun of you. <br><br> You can truly say that a guy has good intentions if you see him praying sometimes. <br><br>Girls are allowed to touch boys' things. Not their hair! <br><br>a guy says you're beautiful, that guy likes you. <br><br>Guys hate girls who overreact.</p>
