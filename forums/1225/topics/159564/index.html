But recently, when I asked if he feels insecure, he said, he just dun trust my guy friends.<br><br>I told him to trust me while Im out with my friends and I invite him to join us. He promised tht heÂ’ll try his best and he said he might be joining me and my friends on our next casual outings.<br><br>So, weÂ’re giving it a try nwÂ…I hope everything goes fine. Hehe.
