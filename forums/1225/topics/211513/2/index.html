No strings attached.<br><br>2) If there's love, sex is not the main thing ba.  I dun think a man would leave a woman juz bcos she's not willing to do it if he really loves her.<br><br>3) Perhaps many people perceive this as a 'healthy relationship'.  Some people believe that love and sex comes as a package.  But I think sex only comes into the picture if both are really sure that they love and trust each other.<br><br>I know u will correct me de.<br><br>Actually I suddenly ask this question because I watched the 9pm show on channel 8 last night..<br><br>chen shu chen had an affair with a woman even tho he's married.  The woman really love him, and did not ask for much in return, juz hoping that he will visit her maybe once a year.  But after sex, he heartlessly said that they have made a mistake, and knowing that it's a mistake, they should not continue.  Then he said sorry he cannot commit to her.  And he really left her behind.<br><br>I think he's selfish and irresponsible.  The woman trusted and love him.  But he left just like that.  Well it's true that he cannot commit to her because he's married.  But since he knows he cannot commit to her, why start?  And when things has reached that stage, then he said that it's a mistake?  Did he love her?<br><br>20, 30 years later they met again.  And he told her that they are good friends.  She even bore him a son. <span style="font-style: italic;"> Just good friends? </span><br><br>sorry i think im getting a bit carried away.  </span><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kaobeikaobu:</div><div class="quote_body">if a man really wants to commit himself to a relationship, he doesnt need his lover to keep breathing down his neck. <span style="color: blue;">And for most guys, the tedency to commit is higher as maturity sets in.</span><br><br>if the person's heart is nt there in the first place, what's there to catch?<br><br>no sex? b4 or after marriage. rejection or incapability? it really depends on individuals...nt all guys wld react the same. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote><span style="color: indigo;">Maturity as in?<br><br>What I mean here is before marriage, rejection and not incapability.  </span><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by choco B:</div><div class="quote_body">I don't wanna make it seem like an excuse.<br>But men do really perceive sex differently from women.  You might never understand it but I think at some point acceptance is necessary.<br>A man who loves a woman will be able to compromise or change his sexual needs, if required, out of concern for his girl. But that doesn't mean he will totally lose it.<br>And it's not for nothing that the easiest way to tell if something's wrong with your man is through a change in his libido.<br>So to answer ur question, sex is not everything but it's not an unimportant Nothing either.</div></blockquote><span style="color: indigo;">I know what you mean.<br><br>I know man perceive sex differently as woman.<br><br>That's why the question... coz I dun understand what a man really thinks. </span><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MÂ©+square:</div><div class="quote_body">Until bbb come to terms with her values and ideals.<br><br>otherwise, she will just be ever asking for something which she would reject at end state.<br>In other words.
