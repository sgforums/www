              <p><br>You barely know her and she also barely know you. Chatting on MSN and Facebook don't means anything at all.</p>
              <p>And also it depends on how you communicate with her, the way you phrased your sentence whether politely or not, indifferent or not, straightforward or not, relax enough or not...all makes a difference to the result that you are seeking.</p>
              <p>If you got no looks and weath, and if you cannot even talk properly and if you're really not a people-caring type of person, then you are really not as good as you claimed to be. She can sense it from the chat and so can I.</p>
              <p>Normally she will tell you both of you got no chemistry and it's better to remain as friends. But I believed you must have said something or your attitude towards her in the chats, makes her feel unattracted to you.</p>
              <p>It's difficult if she's not attracted to you, but if you got enough balls and guts and great sense of humour and sparkling personality, you might just be able to pull through.</p>
              <p>If you don't, then you need to help yourself to become someone who got all these criterias.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why don't you tell us HOW YOU GOT HER NUMBER BY SHEER CHANCE?</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>     I may not be a relationship expert but i have been through 2 r/s before. It is a good thing that you have been actively chatting with her and spending the thought to get her a birthday present. For the part where she says she is busy and only replied the third time you asked her, she might be hinting you, in my opinion. Firstly, she might not want to go out with you(which i hope not) or might just be busy. Or she could be hinting you to act faster or go an extra mile in asking her out for a meal (e.g. proposing a nice place to dine or go about a more creative approach). What I want to tell you is that girls do not like to wait too long, thus if you are sincere about this girl and really like being with her then you should go for it. Also, do not feel so bad about other boys jioing her, you must be strong and move on as there will always be challenges, just be at your best and do not worry so much and you will stand more chance. I am sure she notices something unique about you compared with others. Good luck!<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
