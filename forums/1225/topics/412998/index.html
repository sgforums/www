              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hey <span class="il">Doc</span>,</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> <br>I'm really clueless as to what I should do about the situation I'm in. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I was with Kayla for one month plus. We had an okay time, we enjoyed each other's company, and we both said I <span class="il">love</span> you to each other. She was my second girlfriend, while I'm Kayla's 
              first boyfriend. We talked about my ex. Kayla was shocked that I was in a
               seven-plus-year relationship that I ended not too long ago, but she was
               able to handle this part of my past and we got closer. She told me that
               at least we're sharing, which helps to build intimacy.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> <br>Well,
               the bad news is that I'm actually married to my ex. I recently told 
              Kayla the truth and that I would be finalizing my divorce in the next 
              few months. But she's afraid of my emotional baggage and how being 
              married will affect us in the future. I assured her that it would not 
              affect me negatively and that I have moved on. I'm confident that I can 
              have a new relationship that is fruitful and can last. Kayla now says 
              that she cannot accept the fact that I was married before and she minds 
              that I started a relationship with her while I was still married. She 
              feels that she needs time to think and we agreed that it would better 
              that we remain friends, which kind of sucks. Deep down, I feel that 
              Kayla is gone.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> <br>The
               worst part of all this is that we are work colleagues. Kayla is kind of
               withdrawn, and I can't stop feeling and looking sad. She does not 
              initiate any conversation with me. She'll smile and respond if I talk to
               her, but it is not spontaneous or enjoyable. It seems that she does not
               want to be reminded of me and has stopped using the phone I gave her 
              too. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I'm at a loss as to what I should do now. I really want Kayla back. <span class="il">Doc</span>, please coach me and give me some hope.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Nils - who feels unfairly treated</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hi Nils,</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">First off, let me get this straight. After only 30 days you're actually saying, <em>"I <span class="il">love</span> you" </em>to a babe? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dude, -- you're not supposed to ever tell a woman "I <span class="il">love</span> you." <em>It's the antithesis of Challenge</em>.</span> And by the way, from what you're telling me, it's no surprise whatsoever that neither of you have dated much! </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Why
               should Kayla be shocked that you were in a seven-day, or seven-month, 
              or seven-year relationship? What's the big deal? Your soon-to-be ex-wife
               is already gone, right? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The point is this: all of Kayla's professed shock that you're married is <em>just an excuse for low Interest Level</em>. And she was going to mention that low interest in one way or another at some point later anyway.</span> When she said "at least we're sharing," it sounds like Kayla was 
              thinking that she wasn't all that excited about being with you and that 
              she was thinking of something else that could be better - like another 
              man and another relationship! </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">All of Kayla's concern about you being married is really the <em>second reason</em> she wants to put distance between the two of you. Like I said, she has 
              low interest in you, so she has to concoct some phony rationale for why 
              you can't be together. Even if what you're saying is true - that you 
              have no baggage from your marriage and that you're ready to move on - 
              she's not going to believe you because her interest in you is so weak. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">To you Psych majors, when a woman has low interest in you, it's going to have a ripple effect.</span> In other words, it's going to affect everything that happens between the two of you.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">That
               said, Kayla's absolutely right that you started a relationship with her
               while you were still married, kept her in the dark about it, and it was
               wrong. You should have told her that you'd filed the divorce papers and
               everything would be wrapped up in 60 days. Like my cousin Rabbi <span class="il">Love</span> says, "The reality is that you shouldn't date while you're still 
              married." You have to wait until the legal proceedings are completely 
              finished before you start seriously seeing a woman. But of course, like 
              most men, you're rushing everything because you don't know how to be on 
              your own for more than three seconds.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sadly, Nils, you're on the money -- Kayla <em>is</em> gone. And when you've been dumped, women always hand you that stuff 
              about being "friends," which means absolutely NOTHING. "Let's just be 
              friends" is actually Womanese for "I'm never going to talk to you again 
              for the rest of my life!" </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Since
               you and Kayla are work colleagues, now you'll get to face her every 
              single day. Really cool, Nils! That should be loads of fun! And why are 
              you moping around? Put on a happy face and start hustling other women --
               but just make sure you get your divorce papers first, of course! </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Your
               interactions with Kayla from now on are not going to be enjoyable 
              because you withheld information from her - in a sense; you lied to her 
              by omission -- when you went out with her. No wonder she's distant and 
              feels let down. I don't blame her. Like my cousin Sal "The Fish" <span class="il">Love</span> says, "Let's face it, man -- you're a liar and a sneak." Women really hate liars and sneaks, Nils.<span>  </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You gave a woman a phone after going out with her for a <em>month</em>? What are you doing, keeping tabs on her already? You don't have "The System," I can see that, my friend! </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Guy,
               you have absolutely zero hope with this babe. You screwed this up from 
              the very beginning, you made a lot of mistakes, and you don't have my 
              program memorized. When you don't memorize "The System," these are the 
              consequences. Like my cousin Fast Eddie <span class="il">Love</span> from East L.A. says, "When you don't know what you're doing, you get to 
              face a girl that you like at work for the rest of your life until one of
               you quits or she runs off with the boss." </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Remember, guys: women don't like dating married men</span></strong></p>
