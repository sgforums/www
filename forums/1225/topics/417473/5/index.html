              <p>Once in a while you'll find that there will be some low-class forumer who would come into a topic and start trolling all he can to get people to believe his revolutionary whine.</p>
              <p>But such people always failed 100% of the time because they don't really have a valid reason to convince anyone to believe him.</p>
              <p>So what he do? He just keep trying like a loser and hope that one day he might achieve something successful anonymously in the online world. People of his kind are often society failures and underachievers in their real lives, no money, no career, no woman except his Mum.</p>
              <p>And in this topic, the one such person is Fcukpap. From trying to fuck pap since he started his nick until now he's trying to abolish women charter without any reasons and without any girlfriend/potential wife.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'll still say the same thing. Find a girlfriend/potential wife and have a real reason so that people will believe and be convinced by your post.</p>
              <p>Don't behave like a sore loser even if you're really feeling sore. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Women charter is to protect Men from having distractions in a marriage, be committed to their wives, to avert the risks of contracting unknown sex diseases and TO OBEY their wives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So Men just need to remember to OBEY their wives and they will live a long and fulfilling lives with many children and grandchildren on their deathbed. Else Men will only die a sad and lonely death after they have been cheated by other Women...always easily cheated by other Women. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Actually I wasn't feeling uncomfortable in meeting him alone. I just didn't know it was a date, as far as I was concerned, we were pals!  I met my friend before meeting him.  I was even thinking of introducing my friend to him! I figure he should have just accepted the money from both of us and forget abd it!</p>
              <p>kekek My girlfriend and I just thought it was damn funny over this. Aiyo if over such a small thing affect friendship then quite wasted liao lor! I am the forgetful type :D</p>

              <p>If both parties are working adults, think if its a date, the guy
              should offer to pay. And the girl should be automatic to pay for
              coffee/drinks/ dessert later on.</p>
              <p>But if a guy first date insist on calculating every single cent
              who pay what, then cannot imagine rest of the rship with him.</p>

              <p>I went for an interesting 'date' once. I didn't know when the
              guy asked me out that it was a DATE date cos we've been out in a
              group before. So before that I met a girlfriend and just asked her
              along, then when we went to eat, he said he'll pay for ME but not
              for HER. I think he paid for both of us first, then he accepted
              money from her, but refused to accept money from me. walao so

              <p>well from the guy's point of view, he just intended to date you out, not your friend. So he must have felt a tinge of unhappiness seeing you friend, hence the reluctance to spend on your friend. But perhaps he's still immature? Your friend's endorsement of him is important as well and he should not have made it awkward by paying only for you.</p>
              <p>Well who knows....maybe he's struggling with his finances or doesnt earn a fantastic salary.</p>

              <p>Wow, this thread has turned from a question based thread to a flaming thread it seems. <br><br>Apparently i tink some ppl are more biase towards man in which they judge guys as a cheapo/not cheapo just becos they pay or do not pay?</p>
              <p>However i guess it is pretty much that girls do actually expect guys to pay for them during a date.Honestly i really tink it depends on the status/depth of the relationship. If purely jus normal frens, going on a date does not necessarily means that the guy have to pay for the girl imo. If already in a relation then he really shld try to</p>
              <p>We also have to look at the financial status on both parties. Assuming that we have a not so rich guy out with a well to do girl. Whats the point of acting all so gentlymenly when u are gonna go quite broke/over budget by paying for the girl and if the girl's really ur fren, i believe she wont expect much or would not mind much that the guy does not pay? If that stills happens then i believe it also tells alot about the girl.</p>
              <p>So i probably guess it really is a situational thing and not exactly a social rule that guys have to pay.</p>

              <p>lol..</p>
              <p>I think guys should pay, if they can. But if the girl really had any decency or what, and if she wants to pay, why not ;p, of course the ego might try to step in and thats when you control your ego man.</p>
              <p>Normally for me, its an exchange lo, like she may say want to pay for something or what, just say how about lunch/dinner instead. But of course dun go to some super ex place like u are milking her goodwill like that la. hahaha. Its the thought that counts.</p>

              <p>i dnt mind paying for items like food, drinks cause i'm eating also mah but sometimes the gal wanna go hawker ctr or food court, so can't expect me to pay cause diff store, maybe i'll get her a drink if she haven't got one herself.</p>
              <p>things that i won't pay are those i dnt get a share out of. there was this gal i date, she took a cab to meet me then pretend forgot bring wallet, so ask me help her pay. i paid so as not to make the uncle wait. then few days later, she got sick, ask me bring her go see doctor, then later say forgot bring wallet again, ask me pay.</p>
              <p>this was too much already, own consulation fee also can't pay, i still paid for her and i directly ask her later over the phone, "so wat are you taking me for? a sucker?", she put down the phone and we nvr talked again</p>

              <p>i seldom talk abt this but i'm glad there are pple who agrees with me on this.</p>
              <p>hhhhmm, i do know of some ladies who kind of pretend to say "oh it's ok, we'll split the bill" but deep inside is hope the guy pays for it all and if the guy really took their word for it,then it's game over for them. maybe those guys tht went out with you have met such ladies and was just being cautious? once bitten, twice shy.</p>
              <p>anyway, from a lady's POV, how far should guys take tht statement "oh it's ok, we'll split the bill"? how do we know the lady really meant it or is just pretending only?</p>
              <p>for me, i'll reject but if the lady really keep insisting, then i'll take up the "offer"</p>
