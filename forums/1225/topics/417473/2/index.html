              <p>If both parties are working adults, think if its a date, the guy should offer to pay. And the girl should be automatic to pay for coffee/drinks/ dessert later on.</p>
              <p>But if a guy first date insist on calculating every single cent who pay what, then cannot imagine rest of the rship with him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I went for an interesting 'date' once. I didn't know when the guy asked me out that it was a DATE date cos we've been out in a group before. So before that I met a girlfriend and just asked her along, then when we went to eat, he said he'll pay for ME but not for HER. I think he paid for both of us first, then he accepted money from her, but refused to accept money from me. walao so paisay!!!</p>

              <p><br>So you meant general singaporeans are trying to make ends meet by being thrifty and kiam siap and niao?</p>
              <p>My point of view is if these general singaporeans really need to do that to maintain their own survival, then it will be difficult for them to impress their dates or the girl of their interests.</p>
              <p>A cool date will pay for their girl, so these general singaporeans don't even qualify as a cool date for any girls to go out with them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A decent smart guy with brain will be smart enough to know how to earn more money to allow him to pay for his date comfortably.</p>
              <p>No need to have ferrari 458, but if the guy need to ask the taxi driver if there's any surcharge when his date is also in the taxi, then that doesn't makes him smart or generous or cool at all to his date.</p>

              along, then when we went to eat, he said he'll pay for ME but not
              for HER. I think he paid for both of us first, then he accepted
              money from her, but refused to accept money from me. walao so

              <p><br>So you meant general singaporeans are trying to make ends meet by being thrifty and kiam siap and niao?</p>
              <p>My point of view is if these general singaporeans really need to do that to maintain their own survival, then it will be difficult for them to impress their dates or the girl of their interests.</p>
              <p>A cool date will pay for their girl, so these general singaporeans don't even qualify as a cool date for any girls to go out with them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A decent smart guy with brain will be smart enough to know how to earn more money to allow him to pay for his date comfortably.</p>
              <p>No need to have ferrari 458, but if the guy need to ask the taxi driver if there's any surcharge when his date is also in the taxi, then that doesn't makes him smart or generous or cool at all to his date.</p>

              <p><br>It happens, but the girl also at fault in this scenario.</p>
              <p>If she's not comfortable to go out with the guy alone, then decline the outing.</p>
              <p>Bringing or suggesting to bring another girl friend along is really just a bad idea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In cases like this, it will also affect the friendship between the girl and her girl friend. We can forgive but we cannot forget.</p>
