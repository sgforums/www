            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I have numerous encounters in which many Singapore guys working in China, eventually leave their gf/wife for China Women. Many of them have chosen those from Shanghai, Suzhou, etc... We had a discussion among friends about how/why China Women are so good at it, and what is there in China Women that we don't have, we don't have any conclusion as yet. That is scary, as we don't know the enemy and this problem is real.<br><br>I have a friend's hubby who are also posted there, and once it crossed my mind that I should warn her, but I didn't. My friend just called me, hubby leaving her. This is so scary. Any one would like to share what they know about China Women, why are they so good in stealing heart, anyway to make the guys immune to them?<br><br>I think we need to know more about them.<br><br>Thx,</div>

What I am wondering is that, I know many more other people that work in different country, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, etc. Most of them I know don't end up in divorce, well, many of them have flings/gf, undeniable, but many that go to China end up in divorce instead.<br><br>Like what you say, seduction, is definitely part of it. Allowing themselves to be 'lower' than men. These are the factors I wanna explore in this topic, is China women better at this, and if so, what makes them different/better.<br><br>I definitely know they are much more eager, aggressive &amp; determined. Some of them may do anything just to get out of the country. I was hoping that those who have more experience, who perhaps stay in China before, with the real observation can shed some lights.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I will cut to the chase. I have China and Taiwan friends so I am more clear. They are more easy to get along with and can really lend at least a listening ear when you are down. Singaporean girls are usually very cold. They tend to judge a guy by his education level, his money and his job. For normal typical guys like me from a not too rich family and with lets say only a diploma, its usually hard to find a suitable person. Especially when you are down and really need someone to talk to. From my experiences, I know that singapore girls don't really like to hang out with so call "loser" guys. They also usually suspect us of having ulterior motives. And you ask why the good men choose other women from different coutries. Maybe its because they were there for them when they needed someone. Somtimes thats all the difference it make. However I doubt our local friends will ever understand this</div>
