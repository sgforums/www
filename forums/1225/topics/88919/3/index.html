            <div class='col-md body'>haa.. looks whos talkg...<br><br>[Elindra] Basically in reply to what sounds a lot of complaints to me.<br><br>hmm..Im thinking...abt the simplistic definition of dao:<br>mayb shud add too vocal, too complacent n not knowing how<br>to reject men properly...<br><br>[Elindra] Ok about this too vocal bit, if the girl doesn't air her thoughts, she gets put down for having no opinion. Complacent in what sense?<br><br>Ok the not knowing how to reject men properly is the tricky bit. See I have lots of bad experiences with this here. If you do it nicely and indirectly, usually the guy doesn't take the hint and thinks you're playing hard to get, and some don't even take "No, I have no interest in you" as an answer. So, what's a girl to do?<br><br>As well, I find fymk experience very familar. I don't know if its something to do with Singapore Chinese guys. My ex sponged off me till I got sick of him, including his attitude. Yes, I have the same "Bring me a glass of water" experience as you fymk. Yes, I'm marrying a local guy in a few days, only thing is he is not chinese. Oh, there are definately nice chinese guys around. I know a number of them.

Maybe it's in their women's culture. Can't really tell but if it's in a scale of ten I would rate them 8.5 wheres local ones are 8. One thing though is that they're more approachable compare to the local counterpart.
