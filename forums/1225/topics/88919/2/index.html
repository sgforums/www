Taking a walk down Orchard road and I barely spot a handful. You guys like pretty girls, but girls do like good looking guys as well though I have to admit for some the amount of money they earn can compensate for their looks.</span><br><br>2) Spore women liks to be pampered, too demanding..<br>too 'modern'.. n some r also not independent enuf...<br>..n adores the western culture/value too much...<br>these r jus a nice words... i say they think too highly of themselves...<br>Living n growing up in china is not lik spore.<br>Its a more competitive, complex n real society.<br>It makes the people/women more independent, capable...less sheltered.<br>Sporeans/women r jus too sheltered n wants to be impressed even more by men.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> I would just like to say that Singapore guys like to be pampered and mothered over. God knows how many I have met who treated me like a maid. As for the guys, I would say that many are bigoted chavanists who just wants to be waited on hand and foot. I believe a relationship is a partnership and never one-sided. Most guys expect the girls to be sweet, gentle, good listener and indepedent, but from some of my Singaporean exs? I'm too independent, think too much on my own and able to make decisions?!!? WTF? Make up your minds!!! Most of the guys here in Singapore are also so pampered by their mums that they aren't really as independent or capable as they think they are, and they expect us women to be impressed. </span><br><br>3) Its more exciting, more exhilarting to know someone whos<br>from a foriegn country.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> I agree its more exhilarting to know someone from a foreign country</span><br><br>In short, spore women not as pretty, yet so dao, demanding...<br>how do u wan a man here to choose if he has a choice?<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> I would say the same that the guys here aren't that great looking, yet they want to be pampered over, and complain that us girls are just brainless SPGs who run after caucasian men. One thing I have to say is that most Singaporean guys here really need to brush up on their love-making skills. </span><br><br>extra:<br>I have lots of frens/colls from China... and I certainly do not think<br>our China frens deserve the kind of society accessment from sporeans...<br>in terms of either work or women... they r frenly, generous, geniune people.<br>It only makes me feel that spore people r lik the 'frog in the well'...<br>once u hav been to china/ard the world... u wil see that<br>sporeans/women r so narrow minded n dao...<br><br>Once a sporean lady fren told me tat china women has no 'qi zhi'..<br>...well i think spore women's 'qi zhi' is more associated w 'dao-ness'<br><br>Thou i must agree that in terms of communications, its not as easy..<br>since we r brought up in mixed eng/ch environment. So our command<br>of chinese is limited...<br>But then.. i think communicating w dao spore women is even more diff...;p<br>must learn to pamper/impress them... not my cup of tea...<br>u can say it seemed lik male chavinism,<br>but i think e problem is e women who thinks so highly of themselve first.<br>When I lik/love someone, the method of expessions wil not be one of<br>superficial 'pampering/ impressing'...<br><br>ps: in order not to upset anyone.. when i say<br>sporean, or china...etc .. i refer generally to most of them....not all...<br><br>so spore women... go on n think tat men cannot handle u... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">I have to comment that some of the guys I have dated before are Chinese expats from China. I think they are great guys really. I've also asked them their thoughts about Chinese women and Singaporean women. Guess what is the reply? They do agree that Singaporean women may be materialistic but at the least they are not manupilative and they said they find Chinese girls dao to them??!! They also cited that they prefered girls from Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. Go figure. I guess the grass is always greener on the other side of the river.<br><br>As well, I have to say that some Singaporean guys just cannot handle directness from a girl. Are we dao because we're not interested in you and just tell you lets just be friends? Come on, you don't want your time wasted and neither do we. I find that alot of Singaporean guys cannot accept rejection at all. And no, its not always about your job or pay. When we say we don't like you anything more than a friend, we mean that we don't like you anymore than a friend.<br><br>Maybe there is a percentage of gold diggers out their in the female population, but trust me, that is apparent in every single society. As well, I have read from some posts that Singaporean women usually ask the guy for his job first before showing interest in talking to him. I find that strange because usually its the guys who ask me this question first.<br><br>Ok, I might belong to the minority group. Don't fault me on that as I'm just sharing my personal thoughts and experiences.<br></span><br><br></div></blockquote></div>

If sex is not important, you won't see the increment in guys and gals cheating on each other because their partner is not satisfying them, and I'm talking about married couples here.<br><br><blockquote>haa. i pity u... no offence ;p but i guess these r minor things or aint they?<br>Thou im definitely not lik tat, im thinkg:<br>If these r little things women can do to make some men happy, why not?<br>Lik u said, its a 2-way give n take thing. it takes little to make a man happy.<br>Many men try hard to make their loved one happy,<br>if it only takes abit on women side, why not? </blockquote>Minor things so why complain that the girls here are not gentle yada yada and the list goes on enough  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>I'm complaining here because its one-track.

There are some who are persistently looking for a childbearing machine and a housewife. China women can subscribe to the idea of being married and a housewife but I don't think many women in my shoes can.<br><br>I remembered my experience with my two chinese ex- bfs .<br><br>Both wants an obedient housewife and a childbearing machine .<br><br>Both have no future plans - both depend on daddy and mommy generous contributions and advice . Not that there is something wrong with it but not caring about the future does worry me. 2k job  wah so stable....right.<br><br>Both have parents who think that a girl shouldn't have a degree nor work but yet thinks a wife must not be too dependent on husband for money. - Now only miracles will make that happen.<br><br>Both have parents who are stuck up and think that their precious sons are the best in the world and the girl he marries should dedicate her life to serving him.<br><br>OH YES my ex told me to get him water while watching TV, I told him to pour it himself. His mother looked at me with utter disgust and mutter something about girls these days.  If they want a dedicated personal slave - they should buy one. I am there because I am his girlfriend not his bloody maid.<br><br>One of the mothers wanted me to clean the frickin toilet and the house - well her dowager highness issued me an order "Oh I am going on a holiday ...can you clean the house while his father and I are away" . My reply was "no" and I broke up with my bf the next day. If they want a maid, go hire one. IF their precious son messes up the place , too bad, he can clean it up because I am with a job , he is unemployed , waiting for his interview reply.<br><br>Now I have higher expectations of what I want in a guy. Why? Because I got the same right as anybody else to expect that. Education level must be the same , mutual respect for each other, earning power slightly less or more is ok. Most importantly , I have my own apartment  under my name through hardwork and I do not expect to share that asset I have sweated to get. If he wants to live off my apartment , he can go leech off someone else.<br><br>The only ones I know with a more open view are non chinese guys in regards to that . Which really stinks because I don't like to date non chinese guys for relationships . Yes I went out with a jewish guy too...smart , independent and a future planner (not to mention he is  a dr)  but too much objections from families of both parties.  So I guess I stay a spinster.</div>
