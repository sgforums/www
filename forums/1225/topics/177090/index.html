            <div class='col-md body'>girls, love to use mood-swing as a weapon. sadly, but i believe a matured enough girl would know how to control the watever symtoms. and not be controlled by it.<br>being a girl doesn't mean the right to treat their bfs unreasonably. If u love ur bf, control ur mood. not he compromise to every little PMS u have. till u know how to control it, else u are not making a good gf.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

J/k <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> If girls don't have emotional irregularities and act like men i think they somewhat lose part of their attraction factor. After all, there's a reason why we never label guys 'cute' or 'adorable' in a very complimentry kinda way. You will also nv see a guy pouting (i'm gettin goosepimples writing this) either. It's just one of the mystery of girls that makes them so special.<br><br>On the other hand though, things are always best in moderation. Excessive moodswings to 'test' or 'destress upon' the poor guy isn't the most ideal situation in a bgr yea? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Regards</div>
