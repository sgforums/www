              <p>Is she a total stranger to the local scene?</p>
              <p>Apart from the normal chinese traditions there isnt much of a difference really.</p>
              <p>If she spent some time in singapore she would have known much about the local culture here so as long as you behave like how you do here there shouldnt be a problem.</p>
              <p>The younger generations tend not to bother much about the old traditions just like the youth of any other developed society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Erm one think in their context, they dont seem to talk much about north korea for obvious reasons.</p>

              <p>Instead of worrying about her, you should worry more about her more conservative parents and older relatives.</p>

              <p>LOL!!!</p>
              <p>Kimchi !!</p>
              <p>Like forbidden sinner said , its her
              friends , family, relatives u gotta worry about. lol. I remember
              learning alot of ettiquettes from my kimchi gf when dealing with her
              relatives, parents etc...</p>
              <p>as for her friends,  especially the
              guys, i felt like, those buggers should upz thier own ettiquette first
              before telling me how to hold n pour soju. For instance, stop talking
              in kimchi.. n stop calling me Jang kheh. lol Shiba lo mo... ;p</p>
              <p>They should understand your culture different ma.</p>
              <p>OH..
              n one thing, some of them being brought up, they are taught to serve
              the guy. So its o.k to act like a real man.. e.g , let her wash the
              dishes, cook... etc..  but then again, u are not korean.. so u just
              show her ur own style lo. Be urself.</p>
              <p>Best thing in this kind of
              situation, is often having conversations with her whether u did
              something wrong or not, or normally 'bla bla bla do this.. do you bla
              bla bla that?' .. cause u wanna understand thier culture etc.</p>
              <p>Just dun sound too sissy...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In Korean culture, sadly, women are not treated as equal to men. If you have a Korean GF, you are technically "eligible" to tell her off/task her to do stuff for you. And traditions stick... You'd be shocked despite the modernisation of Korea the simple act of bowing can mean a lot.</p>

              <p>To be honest the Southerners don't care about the North. They can continue their antics... We don't care already.</p>

              <p>Correct. You need not impress the girl. In Korean culture to have a long lasting marriage, impressing the parents of the girl is more important...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is similar to Chinese culture whereby once a girl is married out of the family, she is no longer considered to be part of the family but the guy's asset. So impress the girl's parents to give the girl's hand in marriage is most important.</p>

              <p>Like forbidden sinner said , its her friends , family, relatives
              u gotta worry about. lol. I remember learning alot of ettiquettes
              from my kimchi gf when dealing with her relatives, parents
              etc...</p>
              <p>as for her friends,  especially the guys, i felt like,
              those buggers should upz thier own ettiquette first before telling
              me how to hold n pour soju. For instance, stop talking in kimchi..
              n stop calling me Jang kheh. lol Shiba lo mo... ;p</p>
              <p>They should understand your culture different ma.</p>
              <p>OH.. n one thing, some of them being brought up, they are taught
              to serve the guy. So its o.k to act like a real man.. e.g , let her
              wash the dishes, cook... etc..  but then again, u are not
              korean.. so u just show her ur own style lo. Be urself.</p>
              <p>Best thing in this kind of situation, is often having
              conversations with her whether u did something wrong or not, or
              normally 'bla bla bla do this.. do you bla bla bla that?' .. cause
              u wanna understand thier culture etc.</p>
              <p>Just dun sound too sissy...</p>
