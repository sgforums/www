              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Greetings from Scandinavia! I read "The System" a year ago and I've learned a lot. Thank you!</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Elsa
               and I have been together for seven months. She is extremely attractive,
               really loves me, and her Interest Level is up in the 90s. She would do 
              anything for me. In return, I keep her on her toes and keep it light, 
              funny and cocky. I always make sure to go out with the boys, and have 
              several friends, both girls and guys.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Now
               here's the rub. We are both students and we've moved in together. 
              Already I'm beginning to wonder if this move happened too soon. I feel 
              like sometimes we are on top of each other. Would you say that after 
              seven months it's too early to move in together? And if so, how can I 
              suggest to Elsa that it is too early without ruining the relationship? 
              The one time I mentioned my misgivings, she got very bummed out and sad.
               Now that we're under the same roof, how do we keep the relationship 
              fresh, interesting and loving? How do we avoid falling into a rut and 
              letting everything become boring and so forth? </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>There's
               one more thing I want to mention and I'm a little embarrassed about it.
               A few days ago Elsa threw me a real curveball, as you like to say in 
              America. She shocked me by suggesting that someday we should have a 
              "second" girlfriend in our relationship. She said she thought it might 
              be fun to be romantic with a third person and thought she would like to 
              try it. When I pressed her on it, she said it was just a passing 
              fantasy.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><span class="il">Doc</span>,
               do you think Elsa is thinking of cheating on me? I'm still trying to 
              process her question and I'm getting nowhere. Any insight would be 
              appreciated. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Bubba - who doesn't know what to make of it</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Hi Bubba,</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>You can't say you read "The System" a year ago and expect it to have the desired effect. <em>You have to immerse yourself in my book on a constant basis</em>. You have to read at least seven pages a night and you can't let your girlfriend know about it. Like my cousin Rabbi <span class="il">Love</span> says, "This is a continuous educational process." So, Bubba, you can't 
              say you read "The System" once a long time ago and insist that you 
              learned a lot. You've got a lot more to learn, and you have to memorize 
              the program in order for it to have its full, proper effect on your 
              life. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>All
               the things you say you did in the first seven months with Elsa were 
              great. You kept her at arm's length and you were a Challenge. 
              Congratulations. Now let's see where you went off the track. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>When
               you're cohabiting, sometimes you're going to feel like Elsa is on top 
              of you but a lot depends on your actual living situation. How big is the
               place you're living in? Is it a spacious house or a tight apartment? Do
               you have separate bedrooms? Can you stay in one room and study while 
              she's in the living room watching television so you both have some 
              breathing space? Obviously the smaller the space you're in, the 
              relationship is going to be more claustrophobic. Like my cousin General <span class="il">Love</span> says, "Ask anybody in a nuclear submarine."</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>But on the other hand, living together after only seven months of dating is way, way, <em>WAY</em> too soon. So you've already made the biggest mistake of your life by 
              moving in with this girl. But you can't suggest to Elsa that it's too 
              early now because it <em>will</em> ruin the relationship. Like my cousin Sal "The Fish" <span class="il">Love</span> says, "Since you've already messed it up by not controlling yourself, 
              the only thing you can do now is suck it up and do the best you can." </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Of
               course Elsa got bummed out and sad when you brought up your misgivings 
              about the relationship because you hurt her feelings. What did you 
              expect, dude? Like my cousin Fast Eddie <span class="il">Love</span> from East L.A. says, "You're backpedaling, and you can't backpedal with your girlfriend."</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>You keep the relationship fresh, interesting and loving by looking up "MAINTENANCE PROGRAM" in the <em>Dating Dictionary</em>. You're going to give Elsa respect, affection, romance, and support. You're going to be humorous, you're never going to say "I <span class="il">love</span> you," and you're going to take her out once a week. That's the only way
               you can keep this thing from getting boring now. You have a lot of work
               ahead of you, my friend.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Now
               let's move on to the third party that Elsa wants in your relationship. 
              If you wouldn't have jumped into living together after only seven 
              months, this would have come out eventually and you wouldn't have moved 
              in with her and gotten yourself trapped. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anytime a girl wants to bring a third party in to spice things up, that relationship is dead in the water.</span> Like the old Chinese saying goes, "Relationships are for two people, not three, grasshopper." </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Hey,
               Elsa's not thinking of cheating on you because she wants you involved! 
              But like the great Doctor Freud once said, "Your ego would not be able 
              to handle it." Plus, it's not healthy for the relationship.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Bubba,
               you've got a massive problem on your hands here. And all because you 
              only read "The System" once a year ago. If you'd read it 15 times like I
               tell you guys to, you wouldn't be in this predicament. If you'd taken 
              the counsel of my program, which you didn't, you'd have emailed me or 
              gotten coaching from me or solicited my opinion before you made this big
               move with Elsa. But you didn't do any of it, which means you don't know
               "The System." And now you're going to have to pay for it.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Remember, guys: if your girlfriend is into threesomes, she can't be a long-term relationship.</strong></span></p>
