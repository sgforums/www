              <p>Now there is a new website for you to decide on your dating service needs.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.clubuno.sg/">http://www.clubuno.sg/</a></p>
              <p>According to a recent survey of 500 individuals, four in 10 singles said they are open to using a dating agency to meet new people.</p>
              <p>But half of them are unsure if the matchmaking agencies were reputable or suitable for them.</p>
              <p>An independent dating review website aims to help these singles make better life choices.</p>
              <p>Singles can post their review of dating agencies and rate their services on the website, Club Uno.</p>
              <p>There are 22 dating agencies in its database. The website also features articles on dating and has a list of activities.</p>
              <p>The Association of Dating Agencies and Matchmakers hopes the website can help singles make informed decisions.</p>
              <p>Violet Lim, president, Association of Dating Agencies and Matchmakers, said: "Recently we did a survey, and the survey results have shown that there are quite a lot of singles out there who are open to using dating services.</p>
              <p>"However, they are not sure of what are the types of services that are out there and they don't even know the type of services that would be comfortable or good for them.</p>
              <p>"They also might have some concerns such as prices, the quality, because they feel that obviously dating services in their own websites would just say good things about themselves."</p>
              <p>Teo Yi Shan, user of online dating services, said: "<strong>Club Uno is very useful for singles who are actually lost out there, not very sure which dating agency to use, because not only they classify according to events and stuff, it's also more suited to personal needs</strong>."</p>
              <p>The website also provides information such as dating tips and an event listing to help singles connect.</p>

              <p>Dear TS,</p>
              <p>For every sex predator male or materialistic female in dating agencies, there are many more worthy fellow citizens to matchmake.</p>
              <p>Everyone deserves a chance at life as it should be gifted, regardless if young or old, rich or poor, clerk or doctor. Matchmaking agencies responsibility is to let these people meet. What happens later is their choice they being adults make.</p>
              <p>Our society had funded and organised such agencies, because we want everyone to have a chance, to know love and family, and not just slogged their lives away for employers.</p>

              <p> hmmmmm....... pebbly i think you are living in your own world...... firstly, who dun think  of money? unless your parents are super rich, there is nothing wrong about thinking about money. In singapore, we study so hard in sch is for good jobs (MONEY!!!!), after we enter the society, we work mon to fri is also for MONEY!!!!</p>
              <p>And for your infor, guys are designed to look for sex(i'm not saying with alot of different girls, i mean with a constant gf or wife) ......  it is our nature, is just some guys have higher sex drive, than you can handle..... dun tell me when you go zoo, and saw some animal having sex, you will complain to the zoo management saying their animals are sicked?</p>
              <p>We are just animal with higher intelligence, we are not saint or god.... we got survivor instinct to reproduce and ensure survivor of our species..... if guys are not design to have sex drive, den i dun see why we want to get a wife..... just stay single will do.... den end of mankind.......</p>
              <p>Ts if you hate guys so much you must as well go become lesbian..... den no more sick guy and sex ma..... simple..... or you can go become a nun, no more sex.....</p>
              <p>ya, and if you happen to know a guy who say he can live with out sex, there are two possibilities:</p>
              <p>1) he is faking it or lying to you</p>
              <p>2) he got disorder in his reproductive system, or he is a eunuch or he got super low hormones and behaving like a girl</p>
              <p>to prevent misunderstanding, i mean having sex with a constant single partner. having sex drive is not a reason for cheating on gf or wife.</p>
