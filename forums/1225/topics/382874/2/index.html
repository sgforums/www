              <p>ok u guys. I'm sorry ok. If u were in my shoes, u know my pain. Its just that this is too much for me. And btw, the money problem is my ex use MY MONEY to buy him stuff. i dont mean to be selfish but isn't it suppose to be another way around. U guys dont know because u guys are... guys. Taking sneaky pics of girls, flirt around. no such thing as true love. If there is, there will be world peace now. Guys use girls when they have nothing better to do on weekends. They drag away girls freedom.</p>
