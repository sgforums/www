              <p>I have been putting in efforts lately to make her open up more...talk to more people, ask more questions.... In this way, she'll learn more ways to protect herself instead of just one...</p>
              <p>I can see she is doing so, but not enough. Maybe i am too impatient to see her grow stronger....haha...watching her grow stronger is like seeing my own sister grow up...</p>

              <p>Same thought here--I find it a little surprising that you guys (Travels, jess) managed to think she's waiting in frustration for that special person she secretly admires....</p>
              <p>In fact, she is waiting but that person is already attached......</p>
              <p>I really hope she is moving on and not waiting for that person.....haizzzzz......</p>

              <p>maybe she's so capable and pretty that u think you don't match up to her (+quiet), that's why</p>
              <p>i have a friend like that too, she's smart (studying law), and really pretty, so very few guys dare to approach her. but the ones who do approach are cute and rich, but these guys just make gals insecure, that's why she still single now and always bitching to me about it.</p>
              <p>surprisingly the guy she likes is a average-looking guy, but he's a very considerate and caring guy, a rather serious guy. my fren will practically drool when she see him concentrating on his work, lol<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
