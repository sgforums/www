              <p>I believe hondapons did not mention anything about bringing the girl to expensive restaurants at all? He just mentioned about planning the whole date in advance.</p>
              <p>IMO, planning should be done. A guy should have some backup places in case the girl don't like the 1st choice. Otherwise, go out already then stand around to decide where to go. Waste of time!</p>

              <p>Well I guess its good to have done it. than to keep thinking later that I missed the chance. i had no regrets but it does not mean it does not hurt to be rejected and 2 times.</p>
              <p>I was glad to actually have done it. But also gald I never dated that guy. He sorta became enclosed in his world and in the past when we met up for group gatherings, he would spike me by telling me who else he dated and then later I heard he got dumped and didn't get back up for some time. So to me this kind of loser actions, I am glad to have saved myself from him. I think its not appropriate action to rub people in that way even if the person used to have a crush on you. Its verging on cruel. I was sad to be treated this way.</p>
              <p>There's always been crushes but these guys have their beautiful GF already. So comparing with them, I feel like sh!t. For these cases, no action was taken evne if I really like the guy. I didn't want to be the 3rd party. Besides, I know all these guys don't want me lah. Its obvious that all their action, talk and whatever they do are immature and easy to tell these people make it known that any girl is Ok, just not me.  Actually, I was happy to simply stay single and keep a pet. Its a simple life I want. So my "love" life is extremely boring and will not be able to give much advice about dating. Just this once, I asked to date a guy 2 times and failed. So I know how it feels.</p>
