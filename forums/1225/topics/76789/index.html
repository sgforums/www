Meanwhile, we fill our days by reading romance novels and peering from behind closed curtains, on the watch for knights on big white stallions.<br><br>What a load of crap. Women have always made the first move and orchestrated the pace, flow and direction of romantic relationships.<br><br>Masters of intuition and emotional manipulation, adept at body language, able to gauge the emotional temperature of a room quicker than our nipples stiffen in a breeze,<br>you can bet on it that if he's on his way over, armed with courage and a pickup line,<br>you were the one who lured him.<br><br>Women choose from no less than 52 moves to show men they're interested.<br>The average man chooses from a maximum of 10 to attract a female.<br>Good news then, that the average female is usually very good at deciphering body language.<br><br>Just in case you're not, I've included the obvious, along with signals that are more subtle, secretive and (occasionally) downright loony.</div>
