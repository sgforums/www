            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">I'm 24 and this girl is 23 whom I met in my school's orientation during late August this year. I'm a student leader and I can tell that I attract quite a lot of attentions from people and through friends telling me, most were girls. (will not go into details). This girl is a freshman and we did not speak during camp cause we don't know each other well but she knows who I am and I know who she is, (student leader and freshman,</span><strong style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">same main group, different sub-group</strong><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">). Camp ended and 2 days later, she</span><strong style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"> added</strong><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"> me in Facebook. We chat in Facebook messenger and eventually exchanged number and text. </span><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">We have been texting <strong>everyday</strong> for consecutive 2 weeks till the wee hours and I am always the one who initiate the text ( she initiate only once ). I kinda feel that this is becoming a habit that we are texting everday and honestly, I don't know how long we can last. Has been very positive in the text so far and comes 3 week, I forgot what I sent her but its a statement and she suddenly never reply. Maybe cause it's a statement and she expect me to text her another sentences, and the stubborn me was expecting her to reply me because the last text was send by me.(habit between us). So after 4 days, I sent her in the night on a sunday and she said she realise we didn't text for 4 days and we began texting again, but this time, it last only 2 days. Last text was me asking her how was school etc etc. and she never replied. So never mind, maybe she need some space.</span><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">4 week:  As we have orientation group outings, so it's like after the outing from sentosa and we didn't speak in sentosa, I just smiled at her and she smiled back, cause again I'm the one leading everyone to take part in games/photos etc. After the sentosa, I text her telling her in a humorous way why she left so early, then blah blah blah. AGAIN, just for that night, she didn't reply me and I was the one sending the last text. </span><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Week 6(yes 1 week never text): The a zouk event hosted by our school and I saw her there( during the 2 week she told me she won't be going), so I approached her and her friends ( i believed she saw me but maybe just waiting for me to say 'hi' to her) and greet them, I asked her 'i thought u said u not coming?' (in a casual tone) then we chat a while. </span><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">So i sent her a text the next day asking her what time she left, and from there, we text again and I can feel that it's quite a normal casual positive text. So I text her telling her to enjoy her precious sunday and she replied: you too! blah blah blah. I didn't reply her course wanted to give her space. The next day(monday night), was on facebook and saw her commenting on some frriend's thread, thus send her a message in facebook messenger instantly saying: wahhh, so late haven't sleep? From facebook, we chat again, very casual chatting and this time too I was the one signing out first so and the last message from her was : good night (my name)! blah blah blah. <br></span><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Basically, I am not despo in wanting her to be my gf or what, I just want to take things slowly and want to know her more. From what I have said above, what can I conclude so far? </span><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">1.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>ahahaha jojobeach is right :) you should just go get the girl...and then again, girls who will text you first, always reply to your texts and send you the last text....will not trigger any interest in you, trust me, so that`s just a girl being a girl and nothing else...as long as she answers and gives u hints from time to time it`s obvious she is interested as well just waits for u to be a real man and do something for real not just text her and waste time haha :)</p></div>
