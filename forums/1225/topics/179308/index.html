Dont go all emotional or over react over small things, etc. Hmm..hard to describe. Lets say someone ask you a question, instead of your usual way of answering quickly in an excited voice, you can pause for a sec or two, look the person straight in the eye and answer in a slow, controlled tone...(older guys will go wow! she is pretty mature!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )... something like that.<br><br>also, i think if u joke around too much, it may be hard for people to take you seriously...and vice versa. Thats why when 'serious' people try to tell jokes, its hard to laugh.</div>
