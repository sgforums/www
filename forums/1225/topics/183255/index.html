            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">sometimes really feel ashamed when i saw how those people with handicaps or cancer patients who know that they are going to die anytime being so cheerful and optimistic.  They still continue caring for others, take good care of themselves, and not bury themselves in sorrows, giving up their life.<br><br>i was inspired by a little girl.. who is abt 9 years old.. saw on tv.. she has brain cancer, and one of her eye is blind.. the other eye might go blind too in near future... she has to take 40+ types of medicines everyday.  She is so disciplined, wake up and go to sch by herself, take her medicine without supervision, brings her brother to and from school.. do housework etc.. when she saw news report about people commiting suicide, she told her mum those people are so silly, why did they choose to end their life etc.  She sighs whenever she read those news.<br><br>After watching that episode, I really did some self reflection.  She is only 9 yrs old, her misery is not what we can understand.. she never give up hope, and bring joy to the people around her putting them at ease.  And why do us, normal healthy people.. takes failures and mishap so hard.. that we have lost part of our will to live or strive on?  </span></div>
