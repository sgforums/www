              <p>I met this date through the internet.</p>
              <p>First time we met, it was very good. We met over lunch and spoke over a range of issues for 3 hours. I then paid for lunch. Then second round, we met for breakfast. We spoke for 2 hours. She paid for breakfast.</p>
              <p>We spoke about religion. Hers is different from mine. At first i didn't want to talk about religion because it was too heavy for a second date. However, since she brought up the issue, I had no choice but to talk about my religion. I found that she was yawning when I spoke about my religion. Also when she ask me what I was doing over the past week and I ask her back how was her week, our answers differ largely. She said that she was hanging out with friends and going to favourite eateries. While for me, I was going for this religious study or meeting. I sort of accidentaly gave her the impression that I am a religious guy. I was wondering if she feared me converting her. However, I am okay with marrying the person of another religion, I don't practice converting people, I respect their religious beliefs.</p>
              <p>However during our conversation, we shared many other commonalities. Like our hatred for facebook. And we both also don't like PAP government policies and the stressful working environment. We both also liked to talk about economy.</p>
              <p>One week later, I ask her out for movie. I text her in morning. She didn't reply. So I text her again in the evening. This time she reply at night. And then I ask her what movie she like to watch. She inform this or that. Then we agreed. We also agree to eat lunch before movie.</p>
              <p>However, on that very day, she had to cancel the lunch but said that she would be able to watch movie. So i came to the cinema but she was late for half an hour. after watching the movie, we went for coffee. THis time the conversation lasted shorter, like half an hour. Then she said she got to excuse herself because she had something on in the evening.</p>
              <p>So my question is:</p>
              <p>1) Should I call her for another date? She seems less responsive than before. Her sms are like several hours (exactly 7 hours) to answer.</p>
              <p>2) Can I try other dates while seeing her? I am sure she is also trying out others since we met on the internet</p>
              <p>3) Could our religious beliefs be an obstacle? I am ok with her religion but I am fearing that she may see me as a religious person and find it too stressful to be with me.</p>

              <p><br>I try my best not to talk religion. However, she brought it up and ask me about my religion because she say that on my status. She was saying how good her religion is and all that. And so she ask me, what my religion is about.</p>
              <p>It just came to me automatically to share because I always go for my religious group discussions.</p>
              <p>I think eventually I have to talk about religion but yes, third date is just too soon.</p>
              <p>Yep, I am arranging another date. I think I just wait, I've done my part, I called her a few times. If she's interested maybe she give me a call.</p>

Well, since I am not sure what's going on between you and her during the two dates, I'd give her the benefit of doubt. Some girls are not open with their personal problems or don't behave rashly so give her a bit more time? Otherwise, move on. No loss. And you should stop thinking about religion being the issue. Stop being a worriwart, it'd only add unnecessary stress to yourself.</p></div>

              <p>You tell us you are doing the WOOING but you let her make the decision on what movie to watch?? So are you wooing her or not? You're making an offer only..what wooing??</p>
              <p>And one last thing. She still accept your movie offer previously so she give you chance to show your adventerous side cause maybe she know guy might be abit shy in first few dates and what did u do? Bore her...If its really about the religion she wont even give you the 2nd chance liao</p>
              <p>NEXT chance you get bring out the beast within la. Be adventurous espicially when it comes to old woman. Show her holy man can also be fun and have a life outside religion!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! jia you!</p>

              <p>I met this date through the internet.</p>
              <p> text her again in the evening. This time she reply at night. And then I ask her what movie she like to watch. She inform this or that. Then we agreed. We also agree to eat lunch before movie.</p>
              <p>However, on that very day, she had to cancel the lunch but said that she would be able to watch movie. So i came to the cinema but she was late for half an hour. after watching the movie, we went for coffee. THis time the conversation lasted shorter, like half an hour. Then she said she got to excuse herself because she had something on in the evening.</p>

              <p>My view is :</p>
              <p>Drop her out of your mind. She is not keen in your company. You are not her types. You are an introvert species and she an outgoing type. Going for a movie is old fashion. She would rather go clubbing instead.</p>
              <p>Look for one who prefers a religiously bounded chap like you. </p>
