What you're providing is really vague and doesn't give us any insight into your life. Nobody can really provide you good advice like this. I think maturity has a lot to do with detecting felt needs of a person and answering them. Perhaps you're not a very emotionally-sensitive person and you've passed on a few incidents whereby she needed your shoulder, needed someone to talk to or to take the 'initiative' to get closer.<br><br>I think that not many girls will come tell you this kinda thing unless she's pretty comfortable with you. If it really was a casual remark punctuated with laughs (teasing you) then i think there's not much to look into or worry about.</div>
