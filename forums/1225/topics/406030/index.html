              <p>I am 27 years old man who just started working for a company located in Tg Pagar. I am still single but haven't found the right person in my life. I sympathise with women who in their late age and are eager to settle down but why must most of the time they force pair themselves with single men who are not interested in them?</p>
              <p>There is this lady in the office that wants my attention and is always getting this manager whom I work closely with, to try to give me problems. He (the manager) constantly try to denegrade me, speak to me rudely and give me utter disrespect. Then when she thinks that I am seen to be flustered and frustrated, she tries to come near me as if wanting to be friends. I am not trying to be unfriendly but why must she resort to such dirty tactics to try to get to know me better? I did not want to be too open at her because her intentions don't seem to be very genuine.</p>
              <p>Then secondly there is anotehr lady who constantly want to be popular and always wanting attention. Because I tend to sink into my work and not conversate a lot, she became frustrated at my lack of attention at her. Days after that, some people started being rude at me, not given me the teamwork I wanted. But I made my stand and I don't polish shoe and I just be myself and do my best at my work.</p>
              <p>From this two cases, I find that single women seem to want to set a lot of pre-conditions on their offer of friendship which seem to have dubious intentions. I do not mind making friends with single women so as long as they don't take advantage of my status of being single and instead want to be chased after in return. Don't they understand that the guy is not interested in them? Friendships with single women are very difficult because they always want the single guy's attention, and when they don't get it, they become frustrated and start attacking the guy. Why is this so? I am very sure generally not all single women think like this, only the bad apples.</p>
              <p>It is so difficult to find genuine friendships with single women because 1) they are suspicious of your intentions 2) their intentions are suspicious and they impose pre-conditions that want to be showered with attention.</p>
              <p>First, we men don't really have the luxury of choosing whom we want to be because we are always forced paired with somebody we are not interested in. I can understand that some women are eager to get married because of age but they must understand too, the liking must be mutual, the guy is not interested.</p>
              <p>Second, when we men find somebody we are interested in, why is it that woman we are interested in always tend to get people to attack us and want us to look miserable, only then she thinks we are genuine and honest in liking them? I dislike this kind of approach. I have never come across men who like their women, get to start a relationship from frienship (not all friendship). Instead it has to be a bidding war and we men have to chase to woman like a trophy case? Why must be like this? With my previous girl friend, I had to go through a barrage of humiliating trials, where I was mocked and insulted by her friends. And now, it seems that it is repeating again on those women that I like. They really bargain very high. Why can't everything be simple and start from honest friendship, makan together and watch movie?</p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Working Man:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I am 27 years old man who just started working for a company located in Tg Pagar. I am still single but haven't found the right person in my life. I sympathise with women who in their late age and are eager to settle down but why must most of the time they force pair themselves with single men who are not interested in them?</p>
              <p>There is this lady in the office that wants my attention and is always getting this manager whom I work closely with, to try to give me problems. He (the manager) constantly try to denegrade me, speak to me rudely and give me utter disrespect. Then when she thinks that I am seen to be flustered and frustrated, she tries to come near me as if wanting to be friends. I am not trying to be unfriendly but why must she resort to such dirty tactics to try to get to know me better? I did not want to be too open at her because her intentions don't seem to be very genuine.</p>
              <p>Then secondly there is anotehr lady who constantly want to be popular and always wanting attention. Because I tend to sink into my work and not conversate a lot, she became frustrated at my lack of attention at her. Days after that, some people started being rude at me, not given me the teamwork I wanted. But I made my stand and I don't polish shoe and I just be myself and do my best at my work.</p>
              <p>From this two cases, I find that single women seem to want to set a lot of pre-conditions on their offer of friendship which seem to have dubious intentions. I do not mind making friends with single women so as long as they don't take advantage of my status of being single and instead want to be chased after in return. Don't they understand that the guy is not interested in them? Friendships with single women are very difficult because they always want the single guy's attention, and when they don't get it, they become frustrated and start attacking the guy. Why is this so? I am very sure generally not all single women think like this, only the bad apples.</p>
              <p>It is so difficult to find genuine friendships with single women because 1) they are suspicious of your intentions 2) their intentions are suspicious and they impose pre-conditions that want to be showered with attention.</p>
              <p>First, we men don't really have the luxury of choosing whom we want to be because we are always forced paired with somebody we are not interested in. I can understand that some women are eager to get married because of age but they must understand too, the liking must be mutual, the guy is not interested.</p>
              <p>Second, when we men find somebody we are interested in, why is it that woman we are interested in always tend to get people to attack us and want us to look miserable, only then she thinks we are genuine and honest in liking them? I dislike this kind of approach. I have never come across men who like their women, get to start a relationship from frienship (not all friendship). Instead it has to be a bidding war and we men have to chase to woman like a trophy case? Why must be like this? With my previous girl friend, I had to go through a barrage of humiliating trials, where I was mocked and insulted by her friends. And now, it seems that it is repeating again on those women that I like. They really bargain very high. Why can't everything be simple and start from honest friendship, makan together and watch movie?</p>
