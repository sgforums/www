              <p>I've studied and observe throughout this experience of what guys inner attention of the way they view on girls --</p>
              <p>When guys look at girls legs: Means that guys just want to have sex no matter what. Petting, licking and so on. They are desparate and will not think other than sexual pleasure. They will think this is paradise once the girls with nice legs comes in contact with them, like sitting beside bus or walking infront of the guy. They will try peek at the corner of their eyes. This is the lowest of what guys can get.</p>
              <p>When guys look at girls upper body: This is purely NOT RECOMMENDED. Most girls will not be impressed by this. Sometimes even by those who have their very own boyfriend. This is very similar on the legs issue. It means u are just disgusting and a beast. Hungry for petting, sex and some other dirty minded thoughts. Ever noticed that some girls with okok size boobs c cup or whatever wear something that it isn't so revealing. If some girls do wear something revealing means they are either a hooker, social escort, ah lians with desparate attention or university kids tired of being stress. Now we know guys who look at upper body are wolves.</p>
              <p>When guys look at girls ass: This is how u say, 'sickest in the cool way'. Not desparate but dirty thoughts. Some girls LIKE it when guys look at their ass. Girls are build with nicely shape ass for a reason and not just poking a stick in it. They use it to attract guys attention, notice sometimes your girl friends bend down often to 'pick up stuff'. Its a proof by some professional playboy that girls feels closer and more in love if her boyfriend put his hands at the girls back pocket of the pants. This beats any lame holding hands couple technique.</p>
              <p>When guys look at girls arm and hands: Yes, some guys do like girls arm and hands. And believe it or not, its the sweetest because u can do many romantic stuff with it like guys holding it (typical bf/gf style), rub it to keep warmth of the girl, Peck/kiss it is the most romantic stuff and its a physical words of compliment of a girl. Most girls like when guys look at the palm of their hands, its a somesort of palm reading technique which make the girls curious more and of course, its sweet.</p>
              <p>When guys look at girls face: Now this is the most gentlemen way of looking at girls. If u just focus on the face and nothing else, means ur a true blue gentlemen (if u have no other intention or whatever). Slide down your hands when touching her face, she likes it. Slide her hair thats covering her eyes and place it behind her ear, she likes it. Nose-to-nose technique, she likes it. Whisper to her, she likes it. Dont make me start on kissing. And when u look at her eyes, think of it like ur looking at some sparkling crystal and when she sees your eyes gaze upon her, she may feel the spark. Let her feel it by just looking at her face.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>omg lolx. And somehow i agree that looking at the upper body is annoying. I dont quite like it when i caught my friends looking at my upper body area AND IM NOT BRAGGING BTW. its just my experience. erm looking at legs is fine as long as dont stare at it. I mostly wear shorts most of the day DUE TO WEATHER, so yup.</p></div>

              <p>actually when a guy looks at a gals legs,,,,,he is impressed by the length and shape of her legs  and how artistic it is like comparing it to those art galleries with beautiful statues of shapely greek atheletic girls with tummy muscles...and the upper most part reflects on how well formed a girls breast is....is purely ARTISTIC AND BEAUTY in a girl.Just like a Porsche car.</p>
              <p>but if guy dun look at u...means ya history......u need to go for plastic surgery or total overhaul.</p>
              <p> a guy lookin at a gal dun mean he wants to pump and burst her tyres or something sinistrous.</p>

              <p>i think as a man... looking at any part of a women is like a compliment to the woman... staring is not recommended though.</p>
              <p>but i will think of it as, "if i look at you, either legs, upper body, lower body etc, it's because i feel you are worth my time and effort to look... if there's nothing nice, i would rather look at something else interesting.</p>
              <p>but frankly, i don't agree that purely looking at upper body, legs or even lower body = "wanting to have sex no matter what", like what TS has claimed... and through my 12 years experience in the dating scene, looking at hands is a little creepy... </p>
              <p>for me; first is the face... some gals are very pretty but somehow you don't feel comfortable with the look, it's still "not acceptable". Like Zhang Ziyi, people do see her as very pretty and i do agree she is attractive but it's just doesn't digest well with me, i won't date...</p>
              <p>next is the personality; a b*tch and nope, won't ask her out... too out-spoken, will consider, bossy? nah... i'll pass... gentle? well, a few dates to know her better... </p>
              <p>after the first two hurdles; you definitely have to look at the physical aspect... the body. if she is well endowed, plus point... if she has a perky ass? another plus point... it's the eventual sum of the plus points whether you would ask her out. if she is skinny and scrawny,  i might hesitate as she might have a eating disorder or a medical issue... all these will be cleared out after a few dates...</p>
              <p>about having sex? that is the eventual if she "pass" the hurdles that i have set up. am i being jerk? wait a moment, don't deny that you girls too will have a few tests before you would even want to bed us men... now in today's context, the tide has changed. it's women who wants to bed men anywhere, anyhow... not us men... we don't just jump into any ladies' pants now... hey, kinda scary you know...</p>
