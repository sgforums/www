              <p>1) Fark la, judge on photo only. I also can put Tom Cruise photo den say it's me.</p>
              <p>2) Every relationship is always a sweet things at the start, after a few rounds of dating, den conflict and disagreement comes in.<br>3) You say no girls eye on you, you got initiate first not? Or you those kind of people wait for durian to drop from the tree?</p>
              <p>4) Not pouring cold water on you la, I think you're being blinded by photos and sweet words from girls. I was like you in the past. I experience till numb already.</p>

              <p>Very soon she ask you for $$$ in one form or the other before you meet face to face. Most likely you would oblige until god knows when. But you'll not be able to see her, and can't locate her as she most probably posted a pic thats not hers... </p>

              <p>I say something maybe alot of you may disagree or laugh. I had only got 4 gfs in my life, all ended with nothing. And had experienced numerous let-downs from the girls I tried to chase, until heart really give up. I am not ugly, have a degree and stable job, dun smoke, dun fool around, dun gamble...maybe abit, but much less than last time already ;). So dunno why every girl eye cannot see me.</p>
              <p>I cannot see any potential in dating anymore, so actually, I already planned to go for marriage agency to find either Vietnamese or China (Hainan) bride.</p>
              <p>If try to know a girl need 1 year, and if fail a few more times, I will be in the forties. My parents are 70 and I know they are waiting to see me settle down, although they say nevermind. Being the only son, I also sense the need to carry on my family name. If another few more years, my quality will become bad...then cannot make it, how?</p>
              <p>So all these add together, then I decided to risk it. Also, many couples who dated for years also finally divorced after marriage. Are there anyone who marry a foreigner bride here? Maybe can share your experience and give advice too? (thanks for everyone who give me their advice, appreciate alot! :) )</p>

              <p>I haven't replied so this long cos I need to see where it is heading. It's been 5 days since we never had any contact in IM already. Before that, our conversations got shorter. Just greetings like 'Have you eaten', 'how's your day', etc. And then we both went off to catch our own tv dramas after saying goodnight.</p>
              <p>I thought of many reasons why she didn't contact me. Maybe her IM couldn't connect to mine? (often happen) But if she is sincere, there are always other ways like e-mail and phone, right? Maybe she is also waiting for me to open my mouth first to test my sincerity? Or maybe she turned her attention to other guys? Anyway, I feel that our connection is weaken, and I guess she is not interested anymore. I am rather sad that this is another deadend for me, but I am so used to my failures in relationships.</p>
              <p>So what do I do next? I am considering giving another 3 months to date other girls thru speeddatings. If still no sparks, I guess as a final resort, I will turn to the marriage agency for help.</p>

              <p>If try to know a girl need 1 year, and if fail a few more times, I will be in the forties. My parents are 70 and I know they are waiting to see me settle down, although they say nevermind. Being the only son, I also sense the need to carry on my family name. If another few more years, my quality will become bad...then cannot make it, how?</p>

              <p><br>I already say my reasons. Basically its to let my parents know that I have settled down and not to worry about me. Even if suay suay I got the wrong girl, I hope that she can agree to show my parents for their last years of their lives that everything is fine.</p>
              <p>And second is to try carry on my family name, which is very important to me.</p>
              <p>Maybe will sound silly to many, but my parents are everything to me. I cannot let them leave the world with any worries or regrets.</p>

              <p>seems too good to be true....but once a person is head over heels, even his surname can be changed...so, go ahead if u r mentally and emotionally prepared....</p>
              <p>but just a word of advice...whatever happens, remember that life is not only about the other, its also about how you face and love yourself again when it is gone....</p>
