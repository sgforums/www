              <p>I knew this China girl working in HK about 4-5 months ago in a dating website. Her photo is very chio and very surprised that she messaged me to chat.

When I asked her, she says she likes me and already find what she wants, so she terminated the membership.</p>
              <p>For these months, we chat everyday on MSN. Sometimes she will call me on phone to talk for a few minutes. We discussed and agree that end of the year,, she will come to Singapore and stay with me for a while (2 weeks social pass?), and then if everything ok, I will go to her hometown to see her parents for discussing marriage plans.

              <p>Wayne - It is classic Con, I know of people who fall for it.</p>
              <p>1) chio gal - don't need to spend time alone, and need to go on dating website. <br>Dating website is a classical - hunting ground, people willing to pay to go in - of course easiler prey !!!</p>
              <p>2) Of course she pay membership -  you go catch fish you don't buy bait ? <br><br>3) 2-3 days she cancel her membership ..  <br>Now that is a huge red flag for con !!!  she cancel it for good reason - she already hook you big fish.  She also caution - as what happen if you get your friend another member to check her out ? She is covering her track .  By cancelling her member - she concentrate on you, smart girl  . <br>People like these have many accounts under different names, even MSN account for each victim - this way - they don't get cross wire and expose themself.</p>
              <p>4) Even if a gal found what she wants - if serious into it she would still want to meet up before even saying that to you. <br>Another red flag.</p>
              <p>5) Yeap like my friend - one word of advice - this is how it work. Be smart do not give her any cash. Yes she will bring you to china - yeap you will visit the family - but it is all setup - father , mother , family all hired !!!  Then you will give he money for the dowery , wedding ..... then next come story about father or mother sick  need hospitalisation ... more money. In end when she got enough - disappeared .  You like may friend , dodo - find and find - go to china home, it is not there , rental one, all actor and actress .  Dodo did not give up finally found - actually she is already married with husband and even have kid ... one big con.</p>
              <p>My friend here is what you do . act blur .... go with it , but do not part with any money. Yes go visit the family - yes note down all the detail quiet how to go there address .   After you visit 3 mths later ask a friend or you yourself go back to check out the family - ask around - yes they may be paided to act out, but surprise check like this will expose a lot.</p>

              <p>I realized that I was not very clear-minded. Thanks for the jolt, storywolf. Fortunately, I have not given her any address or money, only my hp number.</p>
              <p>But I feel abit guilty on suspecting about her job, big savings, photos, promises. What if I I misunderstood her? If everything she said is true, then it will be my fault.</p>
              <p>If she really come visit me end of the year and stay with me (and my parents), doesn`t that show her sincerity? How?</p>

              <p>Dude</p>
              <p>Let me make it simple. She needed to find some one in SG and has found you.Since you are already trappd by her, you would not feel the small things changing  eg: How she did not have a high paying job, Why she is rushing to tie you down etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rule of thumb:Stay witha  girl atleast 1 year before even thinking to tie the knot and that noo with a pre-nup.I agree with S<a href="http://sgforums.com/users/283784"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">asperillabob</span></span></a></p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>Woman are far worse than what it was before. She will leave you with what you have.</p>

              <p>I say something maybe alot of you may disagree or laugh. I had only got 4 gfs in my life, all ended with nothing. And had experienced numerous let-downs from the girls I tried to chase, until heart really give up. I am not ugly, have a degree and stable job, dun smoke, dun fool around, dun gamble...maybe abit, but much less than last time already ;). So dunno why every girl eye cannot see me.</p>
              <p>I cannot see any potential in dating anymore, so actually, I already planned to go for marriage agency to find either Vietnamese or China (Hainan) bride.</p>
              <p>If try to know a girl need 1 year, and if fail a few more times, I will be in the forties. My parents are 70 and I know they are waiting to see me settle down, although they say nevermind. Being the only son, I also sense the need to carry on my family name. If another few more years, my quality will become bad...then cannot make it, how?</p>
              <p>So all these add together, then I decided to risk it. Also, many couples who dated for years also finally divorced after marriage. Are there anyone who marry a foreigner bride here? Maybe can share your experience and give advice too? (thanks for everyone who give me their advice, appreciate alot! :) )</p>

              <p>Dude</p>
              <p>First things first: She may be a real deal. Though unlikely. So start adressing her as a female and not a product of a country. This is why SGians really sucks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My only advice is don't rush to marriage. 1 week staying together is nothing like a life time. Eventhough it might be easier/more satisfying to go with this one, you might end up paying a very big price. Go to atleast 10 'professional woman' even if it might cost you a bit. After all his 10 different ones you can choose the right one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And don't be a pussy.Be a man. Start with the Game from Neil.</p>

              <p><br>Whether u like it or not, marriage is not something you can rush. Sympathize with yer predicament, but this not something you can just pick out from a supermarket. There r a lot of hiccups in finding mail order brides. They often run away.</p>
              <p>Let Love be the centre of your marriage. Do you know how to do some Marketing? You got to go out there and do some marketing for yourself. Do an outreach, get to know more gals. Groom yourself, exercise to improve your physique and confidence.</p>
              <p>If you are really that desperate, look up the job ads, there are job offers to China, Vietnam and Cambodia. Go there, find work and get to know the local gals there.</p>
              <p>Patience is the key.</p>
