              <p>If you’re like most couples, you’re watching your pennies this year
              and looking for ways to romance your sweetheart on Valentine’s Day
              without breaking the bank. The following list will help:</p>
              <p>1. Create an indoor picnic with available props, i.e., picnic
              tablecloth, paper goods. Share finger foods and favorite treats along
              with a glass of wine. Spice up “dessert.” Enjoy your picnic on the
              living room floor or in bed. Play card games, board games, or make up
              your own.</p>
              <p>2. Decorate a unique-looking jar or box with craft items. Write
              numerous love notes on small pieces of paper and fill the jar with
              them. Present the jar to your sweetheart.</p>
              <p>3. There are many local and national Valentine’s Day giveaway
              contests with great prizes. Enter as many as you can and maybe you’ll
              get lucky.</p>
              <p>4. For young couples with kids, get them involved in an all-family
              fun Valentine’s Day dinner at home. Mom can prepare a dessert for two
              and light the candles while dad puts the kids to bed.</p>
              <p>5. Since Valentine’s Day is on a Saturday, celebrate with a day full
              of low-cost activities you both enjoy doing (depending upon your
              location and weather). Do something with your significant other that
              he/she rarely has time to do, but loves.</p>
              <p>6. Take a 2-hour, one-time salsa or tango dancing lesson together.
              Or, identify some other interest you share and find a place to give you
              one-time extended lesson on Valentine’s Day.</p>
              <p>7. Gals…Make the entire day full of his favorites: the breakfast of
              his dreams, the dinner of his dreams, TV that is his favorite, his
              music, etc. Don’t say anything about it, surprise him all day long.</p>
              <p>8. Take the person you love to experience something spectacular in
              nature: a sunset, a sunrise, the calm of the beach, share an evening
              walk gazing at the moon.</p>
              <p>9. Create a framed group of photos that put your relationship in
              chronological order of events, by months or years (depending on how
              long you’ve been together).</p>
              <p>10.	Create a CD with songs that make you think of your sweetheart, and give it to him/her.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>11. Choose specialty foods, such as wine, cheese, fresh
              bread/dessert from a favorite bakery. Enjoy in front of your warm,
              toasty fireplace.</p>
              <p>12. Create an at-home spa day for your mate. Deliver the gift in a
              basket filled with inexpensive candles, bubble bath, rose petals,
              facial mask and scrub. Then give your mate time to enjoy it. When
              he/she is done, heat up towels in the dryer for drying off.</p>
              <p>13.	Give each other long-lingering back rubs or head-to-toe body massages.  Invest in luxurious lotion or oils.</p>
              <p>14. Create a favorite drink together. Try all kinds of ingredients.
              Enjoy taste-testing. Be sure to record the ingredients, so you can make
              the “your” drink again on Valentine’s Day year after year.</p>
              <p>15.	Watch an old movie at home together, with popcorn and soft drinks and candy – movie-theater style.</p>
              <p>16.	Share a scrumptious dessert and latté at a local patisserie or bakery.</p>
              <p>17. Pick a few household chores your Valentine usually does and
              surprise them by doing it before they get a chance, i.e., making the
              bed. It doesn’t sound romantic, but the thought will most certainly
              count.</p>
              <p>18.	Walk around a favorite part of town, stopping at a nice locale for a glass of wine and appetizers.</p>
              <p>19. On Valentine’s Day, place three pair of sexy undies on your bed
              and let your mate pick out which one you should wear. It’s your secret!</p>
              <p>20.	Write a “Top 10 Reasons Why I Love You” list.</p>

              <p>21. Since Valentine’s Day is on Saturday, if you’re a member of a
              wholesale club (like Sam’s or Costco) have fun eating all the free
              samples! Then fill in any empty holes left in your stomach by going out
              to lunch. (That way you won’t spend a lot of money at a restaurant!)</p>
              <p>22. What’s a new activity you’ve both wanted to try that’s low cost?
              Do it. Or, how can you creatively modify it to make it low cost? Do it.</p>
              <p>23. Leave a note on your mate’s pillow expressing how special you
              think he/she is. Place a couple of mints on the pillow, too (or a
              single rose)…all to be discovered at bedtime.</p>
              <p>24. Guys…If you want to cook dinner, remember, she doesn’t care what
              you make. There are many easy recipes on food web sites that look like
              you spent hours in the kitchen. Be imaginative and set the table
              special. Play romantic music softly while you dine. Leave the clean-up
              until morning!</p>
              <p>25. Guys or Gals…When you make that special dinner…Just like when
              you go to a fancy event and a “dinner menu” is put on each plate
              describing each food item, do something similar. For example, on your
              menu, write “Spaghetti &amp; Meatballs, made with passion to be with
              YOU.” Don’t forget to give your “event” or “restaurant” a name at the
              top of the menu.</p>
              <p>26.	Make a simple dinner at home, then go out dancing or to listen to live music at a jazz club.</p>
              <p>27. Buy two champagne flutes for use on Valentine’s Day only to
              annually toast your love. Keep them in a visible location as a
              year-round reminder of how special you are to each other.</p>
              <p>28. Play a sport together that you haven’t played in awhile, or that
              you rarely get a chance to enjoy. Before you start, determine what the
              “winner” gets (making it something to do with caring, loving, etc.).</p>
              <p>29.	Leave a “racy” picture on your mate’s cell phone.  Text a romantic message at a time of day when you know things get hectic.</p>
              <p>30. Present your Valentine IOU coupons: I will make dinner; I will
              do the laundry; I will take care of the kids one day a month for the
              next year; I will clean the kitchen for a week; I will serve you
              breakfast in bed.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>31.	Together, go “shopping” at a sex-toy store without spending any money.  It’ll give you ideas and get you “in the mood.”</p>
              <p>32. The tough economy has lured many upscale restaurants to have
              high-end early-bird specials. Find out what’s available in your area.</p>
              <p>33. Some volunteer fire departments use holiday fauna to create
              flower and rose bouquets as a fund-raiser. Prices are reasonable; just
              get there early.</p>
              <p>34. If she loves chocolate…Take her on a chocolates tour. Find your
              hometown chocolate purveyor and ask for a behind-the-scenes tour. Next,
              go to a restaurant that serves her favorite chocolate dessert. Return
              home to snuggle with a cup of hot chocolate.</p>
              <p>35. Use a bar of soap to draft a love note on your bathroom mirror.
              Or, if you shower first, write a love note to your sweetheart in the
              steam on the mirror.</p>
              <p>36. Write “I love you because….” notes and insert them into
              balloons. Blow up the balloons, and spread the balloons throughout your
              bedroom for your Valentine to pop and capture each message.</p>
              <p>37. Many drug stores with photo departments offer a variety of
              Valentine’s Day specials to make gifts from photographs. Use a good
              picture of the two of you together.</p>
              <p>38. Make homemade chocolate-covered strawberries: 1) Melt a package
              of chocolate chips in a double boiler and add a small amount of oil; 2)
              Remove from heat and quickly dip the strawberries into the chocolate;
              3) Place on wax paper and refrigerate for several hours until chocolate
              is firm.</p>
              <p>39. Guys…If you want to order flowers for your gal, supermarket
              florists are generally half the price of the stand-alone or on-line
              stores, but the trick to for seeing real savings is to order two weeks
              or more in advance and pay for the flowers up front………..Another trick
              to save money, get other guys who want to order flowers to join you and
              place your orders to the same florist all at once. The florist may give
              you a “bulk” discount. Again, important to plan ahead.</p>
              <p>40. Plan a scavenger hunt. Write clues and place them in envelopes,
              and place the envelopes around town. Make the final clue a doozey of a
              destination.</p>

              <p>41.	Get a small radio and take your partner dancing at a romantic hideaway, such as the woods or riverfront or ocean.</p>
              <p>42. Use fabric paint to decorate a Valentine’s Day pillowcase for
              your loved one. Check arts-and-crafts web sites for other easy-to-make
              gifts.</p>
              <p>43.	What did you do on your very first date?  Repeat it.</p>
              <p>44. Create a year-long calendar with photos of just the two of you
              above (top page) each month. Office supply stores will insert the
              spiral/binding for you.</p>
              <p>45. Have a progressive dinner. If you’re single, appetizers at his
              place. Entrée at her place. The middle course, dessert, after-dinner
              cordials…map it out a few days ahead. If you’re married, one course at
              home, one course at her office, his office, etc. Use your imagination
              to set locations!</p>
              <p>46. Write new “updated” wedding vows, both serious and humorous, and
              share them with each other over a glass of wine in a candlelit room.</p>
              <p>47. In the morning, tuck a love note in his pocket or her pocketbook
              or other certain-to-be-found spot. Jot down some meaningful words on a
              piece of paper – “Can’t wait to wrap my arms around you tonight!”;
              “What’s for ‘dessert’?”; “You make me happy every day!” – and tuck it
              in a conspicuous location to be easily discovered during the day.</p>
              <p>48. Have a 15-minute kissing session and try some new ways and
              places to kiss. The same old smoocheroo can get boring. Use your
              imagination…and perhaps a little whipped cream, chocolate syrup, etc.</p>
              <p>49. If you don’t have a special sweetheart, focus on bringing a
              smile or laughter to everyone you come in contact with on Valentine’s
              Day.</p>
              <p>50. What are your mate’s quirks and habits that irk you? Don’t nag
              about any of them the entire day. Then try to extend the no-nagging
              effort to every day of the year. Remember, you’re never going to change
              the other person.</p>
