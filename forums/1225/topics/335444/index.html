              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span>1. He never calls you first.</span></strong></span><br> <span>Sure he calls, but it’s always to return your call. Running after
              someone can become an obsession—a disappointing one. Is he playing hard
              to get or just not that into you? Here’s how to find out: don’t call
              him for a few days. If he calls you, great. If he doesn’t, move on. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span>2. He won’t plan ahead.</span></strong></span><br> <span>You invite him to a hot party next month, and he hesitates before
              giving you his answer. Maybe he’s waiting to see if something better
              comes up—a sign he’s not ecstatic about going. If his final answer is
              “yes”, then rejoice: all may not be lost. But if it’s “no”, and it’s
              his second refusal, cut back on the invitations and rethink the
              relationship.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span>3. He won’t come up for a nightcap.</span></strong></span><br> <span>You’re both coming back from a party, he’s driving you home, and
              you ask him if he’d like to come up for a drink. A classic move, with a
              classic response: “yes”. But if he surprises you by refusing your
              invitation because he has to get up early to take his cat out for a
              walk, start asking yourself some questions. If it happens more than
              once, it should be clear that you’re just not clicking.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span>4. He’s vague about getting together again.</span></strong></span><br> <span>At the end of your date, he suggests keeping in touch—and nothing
              more specific. It may not be the end of the world, but if he really
              wants to see you again, he’ll make the time. Maybe you’ve just started
              dating and he fears putting too much pressure on you; or it could be
              he’s not so sure he wants to see you again next week. You’ll have the
              answer soon enough if he doesn’t call in the days to come, or if he
              turns you down the next time you call to ask him out.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span>5. He doesn’t ask you questions.</span></strong></span><br> <span>How can someone be interested in you if they don’t want to know
              what your interests are—or even how you are, or how your day went? If
              he rarely ever asks you about your day or what you did last night, it’s
              probably because he just doesn’t care. It’s hurtful when the person
              you’re attracted to doesn’t show much interest in your life, but better
              to realize it as soon as possible and move on.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span>6. He doesn’t call when he says he will.</span></strong></span><br> <span>He says he’ll call at seven, but your phone only rings at nine—or
              even worse, the next day. When you do talk, he gives you lame excuses
              for calling so late. You may be telling yourself he’s probably too busy
              to call when he said he would, but why make excuses for him? If he’s
              interested in you, he’d be thinking of you, which usually leads to
              calling when he said he would. But try to keep an open mind, too;
              sometimes there’s a legitimate reason for not calling. Trust your
              instinct!</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span>7. He hasn’t introduced you to his family.</span></strong></span><br> <span>It’s true that presenting someone you’ve started seeing to your
              family is a big step. It’s also true that some people need more time
              before they’re ready to bring you home for dinner—if ever. But if he’s
              already met your folks and you haven’t met his, he may not be ready to
              make your relationship official. If you feel he should introduce you to
              the other people in his life, then sit down and discuss your feelings
              with him. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span>8. His friends don’t know you exist.</span></strong></span><br> <span>Introducing you to his family is a big leap forward, and it
              usually comes after a long period of getting to know each other.
              However, there’s no reason why he shouldn’t introduce you to his
              buddies—nowhere near as formal and stressful as presenting you to his
              parents. If it’s going well, then he’s probably told them about you, or
              even included you in plans with them. If he’s trying to hide your
              relationship, ask him why. His response should make it clear what’s
              going on—or not.</span></p>

              <p>These signs are used to gauge interest in the context of dating. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"> I don't think it's applicable to platonic friends. Think means to an end. The ends are different.</p>

              <p>haha, so true. i guess this tactic works on guys too!</p>
              <p>aiyo, i hate it when someone is like so nice to me, and then suddenly ignores me. drives me nuts. and makes me say stuff like 'stupid ass****' or 'i hate him'. (but actually i dont, just that i get mad when things dont go my way ie he doesnt call me and stuff)</p>
              <p>but how to know if the guy is actually wooing you and just backs off to get you to respond, or if he really dont like you that way (and he somehow realises you feel that way for him)?</p>
