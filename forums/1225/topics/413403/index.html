              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Hey Doc,</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>I've
               been looking your columns and trying to find a situation close to mine.
               Most of the other men's situations are missing my key problem -- the 
              other guy.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>I
               met Alita through my best friend two months ago. We've gone out for 
              drinks and hung out on many occasions. There is definitely a strong 
              attraction between us. Every date ends with a heavy make-out session, 
              but our relationship never goes further because she says she has a 
              boyfriend, so it's understandable. But what I don't understand is that 
              if Alita is willing to tell me -- and show me for that matter -- the way
               she feels about me, then why is the boyfriend even an issue? I don't 
              expect any type of relationship to come of this, but I just don't want 
              be led on time and time again, only to be shot to the curb at the end of
               the summer when she goes back to school (which is where her boyfriend 
              lives). </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>I
               told Alita, "Well, I just wish I wasn't being put into the friend 
              zone," and she replied that she didn't want to put me in the friend 
              zone. Her next statement really got me, though. She said "I want things 
              to just stay the same until I finish school, then we'll see what 
              happens."</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Doc,
               what am I doing wrong? How can I make this work? This is the girl every
               man wants to marry, be with, love, etc., and God knows I would do what 
              it takes to make it work. Should I give up hope? </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Drazen - who's going crazy over her</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Hi Drazen,</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>While
               it's true that I give you guys a ton of information in my columns, I 
              also hold back a lot by necessity - because of the constraints of time 
              and space. The vital, deeper information is in my book, "The System." <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unless
               you own and memorize that essential volume, you're never going to 
              successfully put all of this information together and make it work.</span> Why? Because <em>"The System" is the combination to the safe that contains the truth.</em> Like my cousin Rabbi Love says, "<em>The Dating Dictionary</em> is the Bible of Romance. You'll never know the commandments of love without it." </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>You don't hang out with girls, Drazen. You <em>date</em> them. But hold it right here. You're telling me that you're falling for a girl who <em>already has a boyfriend</em>?
               What you don't seem to realize is that Alita is NOT AVAILABLE. When you
               meet a girl, you have to pass the Physical Attraction Test, she has to 
              have at least 51% Interest Level in you, and she CANNOT have a 
              boyfriend. Without having ALL of these requirements fulfilled, you can't
               do anything with her. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>To
               you Psych majors, if a girl has a boyfriend and she's kissing you, all 
              you're ever going to be is a Boy Toy, somebody she plays with on the 
              side while the other guy isn't around. So what this means, Drazen, is 
              that Alita is <em>using</em> you and <em>misleading</em> you and <em>giving you false hope</em>.
               Or like my cousin Fast Eddie Love from East L.A. says, "This woman is 
              no good." She has no character. She has no honesty. She has no Loyalty. 
              She has no Integrity. You can't trust her. Otherwise, she's great! And 
              by the way, how do you think her boyfriend would feel if he found out 
              that you were making out with his girl? But of course most men in 
              America are weak when it comes to women, so he wouldn't have the guts to
               get rid of her anyway.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>You ask why Alita's boyfriend is even an issue. Let me explain it to you: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if she really dug you, she would break up with that guy</span>.
               But he's an idiot, and you're an idiot, so she'll continue stringing 
              the two of you along until she gets more bored with the both of you than
               she already is. Making out with one guy isn't enough for Alita. Like 
              the great Doctor Freud once said, "If she has two guys, she can try to 
              fill that empty hole of low self-esteem inside her which can never be 
              filled." And by the way, what makes you so sure that you and Alita's 
              boyfriend are the only two turkeys she's got on the line? What if she's 
              flirting with and emailing other guys around the country? </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Getting
               shot to the curb when she goes back to her boyfriend is exactly what's 
              going to happen to you, dude. So you've got your answer right there - 
              you're not as dumb as I thought you were. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Drazen,
               this babe is not putting you into the friend zone. She's making out 
              with you, isn't she? She has feelings for you. And she has feelings for 
              the other guy, whose arms she'll be in again as soon as she moves out of
               town. And guess what? Odds are you'll never see her again. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>I
               know Alita's telling you that she wants to see what will happen, but 
              nothing's ever going to happen. But I have to give Alita this: she sure 
              has gall to tell you up front that she's just using you. But of course 
              with your sky-high Interest Level and your ego, you can't even see it 
              and so like a fool you accept it. Plus, of course, you don't have my 
              book, so you don't know which end is up. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>What
               are you doing wrong? Well, when a girl has a boyfriend, like I said 
              before, she's really not in the ballgame at all. How can you make this 
              work? Like my cousin Sal "The Fish" Love says, "Hire a hit man and kill 
              the boyfriend." That's the only way you're going to have a chance with 
              this gem every guy wants to marry, love, be with, etc. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Should you give up hope? Like my cousin General Love says, "Soldier, this thing was dead in the water before it even started."</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Remember, guys: if she has a boyfriend, she's not available.</strong></span></p>
