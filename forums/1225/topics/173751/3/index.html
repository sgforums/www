I shall advise these points to you.<br><br>You should drop him because he is definitely not a boyfriend material, or at least, he is not the one who could make you feel loved and cared for as a friend, what more a girlfriend?<br><br>Since you've realised that he is mum or kept his love life at low profile state. You also will have to admit that you are not in his list, otherwise he would have advanced on both yr position in this friendship.<br>Let's say, i'm wrong. He actually have you somewhere in his list, but still he didn't make his move and you shouldn't make yours.<br>Let's say he'll do it(admit that he likes you) in the future, let the future reveal the next step then.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> But for now? Do not make any move unless you're dead sure you're going to hit the nail in the coffin.<br><br>Let me just help you picture this out.<br><br>Would you want the guy whom you've admired and adore be your boyfriend? However, he seems aloof and distant from you because he still embraces his Happy Go lucky kind of nature. And the more you want to spend time with him, the more he'll 'run away'<br>The more initiative you make, the more he'll shun from you.<br>Do you want to end up with a guy like this?<br>Would you want to have your boyfriend going to anywhere he wants and you tagging along behind all the while? Sad isn't it?<br><br>I'm not discrediting him as a jerk or anything negetive. But as far as i could observe from your post.<br>This guy is not your guy. And he's definitely not ready to get into a loving relationship.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You need to realise something. You need to know your worth, your value and hold your esteem high.<br><br>Do not chase the wind when wind is free and happy in his state he's in.<br><br>1)Let your guy do the chase - be heartless.<br>Let him chase you hard and leave him breathless.<br><br>2)Let your guy call you. Not the other way round.<br>If he likes you, he'll be compelled to call you and hear your voice.<br>If he doesn't call. Drop him.<br><br>3)Always let him date you. You'll do the wait.<br>Do not date him out. No matter how much you want to see him.<br>Do not let your value drop, easy dater is a easy target and it's no challenge to guys. (It's mean to say that MÂ© you may say. But it's true my dear. If you disagree, you'll find out in due time.)<br><br>4)Observe your guy. See if he's interested in what you said and what you share.<br>If he's not sensitive enough to realise that the connection between both of you is important. Then he may not treat you seriously afterall.<br><br>I'll stop at this 4 points. I believe i've made myself clear why you should drop that guy.<br><br>With the 4 points mentioned. We understand there are reasons why some guys are unable to meet the expectations of any of those 4 points.<br>But the bottomline is:<br><span style="color: darkred;">If they really like you, they'll try all means to do the chase. And it will be obvious that they are falling head over heels with you.</span><br><br>It'll be another story when you've entered in a formal BGR, relationship.<br>This will be next time when you post here.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers</div></blockquote><span style="color: indigo;">Dear MÂ©+square,<br><br>Thanks for ur reply to me. Yeapx. I somehow agree with the words u say.<br><br>His love life is just a mystery to me. Always telling me that his love life is empty de. If i wanna hear other of his stories in work, family n frens, he would be happy to share with me..<br><br>Though i like him alot, Im not exactly looking for a relationship right now.<br><br>I guess i should keep my eyes open on other guys. Missed a few boats already. Lolx. Anyway.....i wont rush into a r.s de. thanks again for ur replies.<br><br>ps: Personally find this dating advice a better place to post my thoughts. =) </span></div>

But the ultimate respond comes from him.<br><br>Basically, he's attracted to you. But not to the account of chasing after you. Though it may seem like one. He feels comfortable with you therefore all those gestures, naturally he knows you guys have mutual affections. Hence his actions.<br><br>When he tells you he's not as good as you thought, he might have something within himself which he was unable to overcome. In Simple sense, he didn't want to hurt you.<br>Well, you can choose to look at it in a negetive light.<br><br>Possible to develop? How are things now?<br><br>Cheers</div>
