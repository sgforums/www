If you think you cannot take rejection that well, then it's better to hold your horses.<br>What are your chances of getting his attention?<br><br>Do you know most people don't really get the person their 'dream partners'?<br>How close are you to him and what is the communication frequency?<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

I like his way of attitude towards problems. His happy go lucky nature. Though he gets whiny sometimes, he does know how to handle situations.<br><br>I used to have a bad impression on him. About 4 yrs back, I thought he was gay. Perhps because of the way he talks to his fren(who is his closet guy fren). But still we become really good frens. I did ask if he wasnt straight, he just brushed it off by saying, "what do u think?"<br><br>Though i do like him, i told myself he isnt straight and should move on. Then i met my ex and accepted him. But still somewhere inside, theres this slight feelings towards him which i felt that its more of admiration.<br><br>It was only till recently i realised he wasnt the way i thought he was. I hang out with him, well just the two of us, a couple of times. We are close frens now. And during those hang outs, i got to know him better. And also realised that i i didnt fit into his citeria of ideal gf.Now i like him. sigh. But he said that he prefers a carefree life when i asked if he has anyone on his mind.<br><br>i really wonder if i should tell him how i feel.....................</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> Have we met? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok let me be serious here.<br><br>the tread starter mentioned tat the guy said he prefers a carefree life instead of being in a r/s.<br><br>and he apparently also mentioned the criterias he wanted in a gal if he was to be involved in a r/s. (ans this criteria was not similar to the threadstarter)<br><br>to me there are 2 ways to look at it.<br><br>1) its too early in their frenship to tok bout r/s n his comments were jus based on is past experiences. noting to be taken too seriously.<br><br>carry on w the frenship for a period more. if things wer meant to be and te threadstarter is a wonderful gal. i see no reason as to why sparks wont fly.<br><br>2) the feelings of the treadstarter as not been contained well enuf perhaps through her behaviour or speech. the guy feel akward and is not ready for a commitement or seriously belives that they would not be a good match or he doesnt want to be the rebound boy. thus he purposely mentiond bout his wantg a carefree life n the criteria of a gf tt he hopes will indirectly hint to the threadstarter that he is not interested or not ready to commite at the present moment.<br><br>all in all. i would advise the threadstarter to put her feelings on hold. love is in everyone. but the time it takes to grow is diff for everyone. be frens, good frens are hard to find and will last a lifetime. if it turns out tt your best bud becomes yr partner. consider it a bonus. a gift worth treasuring.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
