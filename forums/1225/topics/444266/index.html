We are in the same maths class and we are both 16. Yeah so he likes to catch my eye and stare at me and smiles at the same time. Most of the time it freaks me out, but I could sense that he is interested in me. At the beginning of the year, as I was new to the class in the beginning and was the first one to arrive so I stood outside the classroom alone. Before I knew it, he came and stared at me and said:" Feel free to come in" with a friendly smile and walked in. Although he may be just being friendly, I could sense that there was something more. The next day I was also the first one to arrive, and so I entered the classroom. But when I didnt see anyone inside, I walked out and almost banged onto him! We exchanged an awkward look and laughed and it was the most embarrassing thing ever! As time passes I realised he likes to catch my eye and smile until I pull away. There was once he cracked up laughing at something I said to my friend in class, which I thought wasnt funny at all. However, I think the friend I was talking to likes him as she always talks to him and so he doesnt talk to me much. There was once when I entered the classroom, he looked at me straight in the eye and smiled widely. But I didnt have the courage to talk to him as his smile was so intimidating, so I broke the silence by talking to everyone instead. I know I'm sending the wrong signals, but it is hard to talk to him face to face when he stares at me like that. And recently I mustered the courage to text him, saying:"Hey (his name) :)" and he replied: "hehe, hey ;)" within minutes. I thought this was pretty cute and we were chatting about our results, and although he did better than me, he said it was still good. And at the end he asked me if I went to a place that day, and I said no, but I thought this was a good indicator that he was thinking of me and after I said I had to go, he bid me goodnite and I did the same. I was waiting for him to talk to me again but he doesnt. I think he's the shy type cos he's very smart and geeky, so he probably wont initiate contact. So what should I do, I think he likes me, but he would not make a move.</span></p></div>

              <p>very simple lah, next time you see him, do exactly what i say here...</p>
              <p>1) Stop whatever you're doing, drop everything you're holding.</p>
              <p>2) stand straight, chest out, hands by your side, stand very straight don't move for 10 seconds.</p>
              <p>3) Starts singing "HEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!"</p>
              <p>4) Starts dancing wildly, just anyhow swing hands and legs.</p>
              <p>5) Keep rocking head back and forth, let hair swing wildly in the air.</p>
              <p>if THAT guy is reading this thread, then he will come and ask you to be his girlfriend after seeing you doing the 5 steps I mentioned.</p>
