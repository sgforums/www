              <p>I know a former employee of Lunch Actually, and from what she has told me, I have to agree with some of the points raised below. It is true that members are "rated" and those with good ratings and are more eligible are "used" often for 1st dates to create a good impression and reduce chances of refunds. Often, after that, not much thought goes into the matching. Sometimes members call up to ask why they were matched with someone and the consultants can't even give a reasonable answer. They claim to discuss among themselves in order to match since not all consultants meet all members, but that is not true. To hit their "quota" of number of matches and dates per month, they just do it as quickly as possible.</p>
              <p>Also true that there are lots of women in their database, so the men get many dates, sometimes 3 a week, while some women wait 6-8 months for one. Some clients are smart and try to get into consultant's good books with frequent visits with gifts or food, so they get more attention and better matches. But I suppose that's how it works anywhere. </p>
              <p>The coaching videos seem really dumb as well- teaching things like how women should have long hair and nice makeup to get a man etc. </p>

              <p>Please do NOT join Lunch Actually Dating Agency</p>
              <p>1) Lunch Actually (LA) claims to match you with someone
              'holistically' and taking into account your "preferences". They
              claim that the only thing they do not guarantee is chemistry. It is
              NOT true. While most of the time, LA members are truthful abt their
              personal details, LA will LIE about it in order to 'create' a
              match. They can LIE abt anything just to push out a date. Eg, if
              you say you don't want to meet someone who drinks heavily, LA will
              LIE to you and cheat you into going on a date which they 'have
              painstakingly looked through and is a high match'. One date cost a
              few hundred dollars, and you end up meeting someone you will not
              even consider. Your date also ends up wasting his/her time as
              he/she had given truthful details to LA without knowing that LA had
              lied to you. Your preferences are not important to LA. Your money
              is.</p>
              <p>2) LA has more female than male members. Ladies can wait up to 8
              months in between dates. Man gets one or two dates per month.
              Chances are, the female members will end up getting hitched by
              someone through their own social circle and forfeit the rest of
              their package (that means LA gets to keep the money). Although it
              seems like the man has a wider pool of selection, male members are
              likely to end up going on dates with people who are poorly
              matched.</p>
              <p>3) LA allows members to request for a full refund within 7 days
              after going on their first date. If you are not happy with your
              first date, you can get all your money back. So, you are likely to
              get someone decent on your first date. And GOOD LUCK for your
              subsequent dates. You first date may be someone you are looking for
              as LA may have matched him/her according to your criteria just to
              give you a false good impression. BUT you may not be matched
              according to your date's preferences. So you will still end up
              wasting a date because the other party is not interested in
              you.</p>
              <p>Some unlucky people (possibly those who appear nice and received
              decent/good feedback from their first few dates) will be
              unofficially 'selected' by LA (without their knowledge or consent
              of course) to be the first date or 'service recovery' date for
              other LA members. It means that whenever LA gets a new/difficult
              customer, they will pick this 'selected' candidate out to go on a
              date with their new/difficult members. If you are granted the
              'honor' of being 'handpicked' by LA to do the 'job', you are likely
              to end up with dates with new members or angry people who have just
              complained abt LA. (since LA gets a lot of complains). To make
              things worse, if the LA member is someone LA knows that you will
              not be interested in, LA will either LIE to you about their
              particulars or keep you in the dark. Eg, Member A complains about
              LA or his/her previous bad date. LA will do service recovery by
              giving member A a free make up date. Then LA will go to their "nice
              members list" and pick member B to go on a date with member A.
              However, member A is a smoker and LA knows that there's no way
              member B will agree to go out with someone who smokes. So LA will
              either LIE to member B or keep member B in the dark. In other
              words, LA makes use of their members to help them make more money
              from other people.</p>
              <p>4) Whenever LA's lies were found out and exposed, they will
              either insist that it was the member who had given them the wrong
              information (which is not always true) or they will brush it off by
              offering a free make up date. There's no point taking up the make
              up date because the same problem will repeat.</p>
              <p>5) LA has 'highly trained' consultants with high turnover rate.
              The consultants seem to be ONLY trained to be polite, politically
              correct when communicating with their members and pushing members
              to sign up for their workshops. They are not genuine about helping
              their members get a good date. The matching is done using a
              computer system anyway. Members' details and/or preferences are
              manually tweaked or almost completely changed in order to increase
              the number of matches (drastically). Any Tom or Harry can be
              matched to Jane or Mary.</p>
              <p>LA charges higher prices than all other dating agencies in
              Singapore. Save your money and time. Do NOT join LA.</p>

              <p>I'm a Lunch Actually member and as in the contract it states clearly that they have to find me a date within three months after the contract is signed. So, they did, by sending a totally unmatched and rude person to meet for a date. After that, it has been more than a year and still no other dates. </p>
              <p>So, I believe they are out to cheat people. Totally unethically business practices. I hope my review will stop other people from getting cheated by these con women working in Lunch Actually. I made numerous complaints and all they came back was upgrade my membership which was useless as well. I have not received any invitations to any of their events. Although they keep saying they found me some date but it never realises into a actual date. They have gone silent again since February and again empty promises. </p>
              <p>I hope the authorities will shut them down permanently for their unethical business practices.Such people should not be given a business license at all. </p>
