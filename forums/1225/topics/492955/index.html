            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;">I was a Lunch Actually customer and I had a negative experience with them. After my first 2 dates, I requested my dating consultant to match me with members who are less religious, however, they still match me with other members who have firm believes in their religion. My new match requirements were only updated after meeting another 2 matches. Overall I didn't have much success with my dates. On top of that, I purchased their add-on coaching services which didn't yield any results too. <br></div>
              <div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;">
              <div style="color: #222222;"><br></div>
              <div><span style="color: #222222;">I was very frustrated with Lunch Actually, I felt like they cheated my money. I posted several negative reviews and complaints on several forums and websites such as hardwarezone, sgforums, </span><span style="font-size: 12.8px; color: #222222;">alldatingwebsites.com, petalbytes.com, pissedconsumer.com, singaporebikes.com, vrzone.com etc</span></div>
              <div style="color: #222222;"><br></div>
              <div style="color: #222222;"><br></div>
              <div style="color: #222222;">Soon, Lunch Actually reached out to me. It took them some time, but we eventually sorted things out. They explained to me that I was matched with other religious users because I'm a Christian. The issue was only corrected after they update my profile to a free-thinker. </div>
              <div style="color: #222222;"><br></div>
              <div style="color: #222222;">After the incident, they were still sincere and keen to help me with my dating journey; they offered me several complimentary services </div>
              <div style="color: #222222;">1) Extra free date coaching and image coaching sessions</div>
              <div style="color: #222222;">2) Extra free dates for Lunch Actually</div>
              <div style="color: #222222;">3) Invitation to 1 singles events</div>
              <div style="color: #222222;">4) A fair partial refund</div>
              <div style="color: #222222;"><br></div>
              <div style="color: #222222;">Even though their matching services did not work for me, I'm happy that they reached out to me for service recovery and offered me a fair compensation. They also shared with me (real data) that they are sending thousands of singles out on dates every month, and many members met their bf/gf through their dating services. </div>
              <div style="color: #222222;"><br></div>
              <div style="color: #222222;">After testing various dating platforms, I realized that dating agency and dating app didn't work for me. Personally, I prefer speed dating events. Lunch actually should do more speed dating events.</div>

              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">Do mail order bride
              really exist?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">The answer is Yes,
              and No, it really depends on your definition of mail order brides.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">The historical roots
              of the mail-order bride industry that emerged in the 1800s in the American
              frontier:  European American men found financial success in the migration
              West, but the one thing that was missing was the company of a wife. Very few women
              lived there at this time, so it was hard for these men to settle down and start
              a family. They attempted to attract women living back East; the men wrote
              letters to churches and published personal advertisements in magazines and
              newspapers. In return, the women would write to the men and send them
              photographs of themselves. Courtship was conducted by letter, until a woman
              agreed to marry a man she had never met.[9] Many women wanted to escape their
              present way of living, gain financial security and see what life on the
              frontier could offer them. Most of these women were single, but some were
              widows, divorcees or runaways.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">During most of the
              20 century,  the mail order bride continued  with the main method of
              women putting themselves in catalogs. Then men would view the women's profile,
              then for a fee order the women address. These became the main order bride companies
              business method in the 20 the century, with the fall of the Soviet union and
              cheap airfares,  these companies  spread from Asian to Eastern 
              Europe, mainly  now the Ukraine</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">Today most women do
              not leave their countries to escape poverty but to seek a man they believe will
              be a good husband and  provider, that is family orientated and that looks
              at women with more respect than in many countries around the world.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-GB">With the advent of the intent, the mail order bride industry
              boomed  into a billion dollar industry, Now with a few pictures and
              website, anyone could be in the mail order bride business.   With
              hundreds of ma and pop shops opening over the last two decade, Most who were
              clients of one of the three original mail order bride companies,  A
              Foreign Affair (AFA), Anastasia and EC,  The owner  of
              ForeignLadies.com  met his wife while working on  a tour  from</span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US"> </span><a href="http://loveme.com/"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 9.6pt; background: white;" lang="en-US">loveme.com</span></a><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US">,  A Foreign affair  still today
              in the largest in the industry, each week they offer tours to one of a dozen
              countries  China to Peru and everywhere in between.  The
              industry  grew so fast in 1998, Senator Cantwell of Washington state 
              introduces legislation to regulate the mail order bride industry.  and a
              new law Called:  "International Marriage Brokers Act"  or
              IMBRA was born. With stiff regulations, many companies like Anastasia moved
              from Bride business to Fantasy Chat.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-GB">Although the industry  strongly objects to the term mail order
              brides,  saying  there is no difference if   man  in
              New York courting a woman from California through</span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US"> </span><a href="http://match.com/"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 9.6pt; background: white;" lang="en-US">match.com</span></a><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US">, then courting a woman
              from Russia. Critics  like the Terra Justice Center  has a different
              out look, saying these men take advantage of women oversea. But studies have
              contradicted these statement and show abuse is actually  lower in these
              marriages. See "International Marriages - A Report to Congress"</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">So why do thousands
              of women join these site: Elena  Kosalova of the Ukraine says, "Men
              here are not serious about family,  they expect women to stay home while
              they go out each night with their  friends and drink. I want  a man who
              s serious, mature and who wants to be with his wife and family.  I have
              met Americans in the past and they seem more reliable and mature." 
              Elena rejects the idea  she is a "Mail Order Bride"</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">Why do men
              seek  a mail order bride:  James Goodwin, 43 of South Carolina says,
              " I  meet women here all the time, but I just can not find the values
              I am looking for..  I have dated here for more than 20 years, After three
              days in Kiev, I was shock at how many beautiful women I met that I would
              consider marrying,  now I am just trying to reduce my options and pick the
              right one. It truly is the fastest way to find a beautiful sincere women.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-GB">So what is the cost,  the cost can range greatly from site to
              site and from type of service,  AFA or</span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US"> </span><a href="http://loveme.com/"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 9.6pt; background: white;" lang="en-US">loveme.com</span></a><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US"> offers everything
              from letter writing, tours and executive services for the rich and famous. As
              little as $12 to as much as $25,000.  The owner John Adams say's the best
              way is just go over and meet then women, avoid letters and never waste money on
              expensive chat.  You can meet up to 1000 beautiful women in just 10 days,
              it will be the greatest vacation of your life. Joe Nail of ForeignLadies.com,
              has stayed with the traditional  Letter Writing, Each letter is $7.50
              and  but say they do plan on offer some limited chat option.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-GB">Many sites like,</span><a href="http://foreignwomen.com/"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 9.6pt; background: white;" lang="en-US">foreignwomen.com</span></a><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US">, PhilippineSinges.com,
              and  UkraineSsingles.com, that offer simple unlimited membership for $29
              per month. These type of site also target pacific regions, like Asia, Latin
              America or Eastern Europe.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">There is  also
              a site for  mail order grooms; SingleMenOnline.com, that caters to men
              publishing their photos in hopes to meet an American Bride.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">James Dunn, who is a
              ghost writer for  review sites says "You  get what you pay
              for.  Membership sites to do not screen the members at all. so you never
              know who  you really are writing,  The big boys require the women to
              apply in person in one of their  local offices. The companies that offer
              group tours will introduce you to hundreds of beautiful  women, for the
              cost of $1000 to $3000 depending on location, about the same you would pay for
              any  vacation.  Several companies also do individual tours these can
              range from $750 to $1500, But only arrange one to one introductions, 
              Always make sure they are biased in the USA  or EU,  Most of the
              complaints  come from small agencies that are desperate and need to make
              as much as they can from you.  Just a note, if the company is based in an
              a foreign  country you will have no   recourse if they do not
              follow through.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;" lang="en-US"> </p>

              <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">So do mail
              order  brides exist, If you belive a if a  woman  is a mail
              order bride if she lives in another   county then Yes, But if you
              believe it  just another dating option like any on-line dating site,

              <div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;">I had initally wrote that Lunch Actually is the most expensive dating agency in singapore. After doing some research, I found out Lunch Actually charges are on par with other dating agencies. After that I felt that for personalised matchmaking services, its normal for it to be quite expensive as the agency will need to hire consultants and staff salary is a huge cost.</div>
              <div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;"><br></div>
              <div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;">I have heard of other dating agencies which have stopped doing personalised matchmaking services due to the high costs involved and decided to just focus on doing events. It is not easy for a dating agency to do personalised matchmaking services as the profit margin is not high.</div>
              <div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;"><br></div>
              <div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;">I did felt that there was some pushing/hard selling from some of the staffs. I was told that LA took some actions as other customers complained too and the staffs in concern have left the company."</div>

              <p>Andrew here. I'm a Dating Coach for men. Just to share,we do have a number of clients who have been to Dating Agencies, Speed Dating events and other similar match-making schemes. Personally, I have attended such events covertly to gain an understanding myself.</p>
              <p>My personal opinion (for the guys):</p>
              <p>I believe these bodies started out with noble intentions. They had to, for the business to grow to what it is today. But like any other businesses, commercialization takes over eventually.It's more than the numbers (revenue) holding hands, rather than people holding hands.</p>
              <p>The intentions for the candidates are very clear - to find a partner, possibly a soulmate. However, most feel like they're buying a very expensive lottery ticket with no gurantee of winning. (this is a subconscious stress on the process)</p>
              <p>Understand this-</p>
              <p>Conventional Dating Agencies, Dating Events or Dating Apps serve ONLY as a PLATFORM to meet potential partners, and this is further more constrained by a LIMITED pool of candidates, no matter how large the database is.</p>
              <p>In an alternate scenario, when you do meet that person of interest, would you screw it up?</p>
              <p>I believe Men, and even women, should tackle these issues with hard social skills instead and meet people out there - WITHOUT the stress of expecting an ROI from a potential partner in a process that's supposed to be organic and sponaneous.</p>
              <p>I mean, the world is your playground.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps.</p>
