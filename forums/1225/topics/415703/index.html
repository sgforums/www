              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Hi <span class="il">Doc</span>,</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>I've
               got "The System," which has helped me a great deal with women.  I've 
              been with Sapphire for four and a half years. She's the coolest chick 
              I've ever dated and one of the best people I've met in my life.  When I 
              first met her I was following "The System" strictly and I won her 
              over. The problem is that while I was really attracted to her in the 
              beginning of our relationship, I lost a lot of that attraction. Sapphire
               put <span class="il">on</span> weight and stopped trying to keep her looks together. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Recently
               my old girlfriend contacted me after 12 years. Stormy is smokin' hot 
              and I never had any problems with physical attraction, but she was super
               bitchy and eventually cheated <span class="il">on</span> me. Anyway, I 
              should have followed "The System" by never going back to Stormy, but 
              like a fool I listened to a friend (a girl) who said, "Oh that's a long 
              time, she may have changed." So I began talking to Stormy and of course 
              she put her best foot forward and sucked me in by stroking my ego. Since
               I'm not as attracted to Sapphire anymore, I seriously thought of 
              leaving her for Stormy, who I began to pursue. The problem is that she 
              lives four hours away. Talk about a double whammy!<span>  </span>Not only did I pursue the old girlfriend, but I pursued her into a long distance relationship!  </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>But I also know that this is all wrong.  Somehow I managed to keep both girls <span class="il">on</span> the hook until just this week when the old girlfriend informed me that 
              she found another man. This really is good news no matter how much it 
              hurts my ego. Stormy is no good, but I was a sucker for her. But I 
              couldn't let go of my current girlfriend because I have a twisted sense 
              of loyalty to her. She never treated me badly and she really is my best 
              friend.<span>  </span>I've treated her horribly though, but she still holds <span class="il">on</span>. In the middle of all this I told Sapphire that she's put <span class="il">on</span> weight and let herself go. She was hurt, but she did lose a lot of the weight and when she does herself up she looks great.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong><span class="il">Doc</span>,
               my emotions are all over the place. Because I messed with Sapphire so 
              much, she wants to be married ASAP or it's off.  But I'm too twisted to 
              feel 100% about marriage right now. But I feel like if I lose Sapphire I
               may lose the best thing that's happened to me, yet the physical 
              attraction is not as hot as it was. My old girlfriend coming back into 
              my life only stirred up the feeling I had for that physical attraction 
              and those sexy ways. At the same time maybe I'm looking for perfection 
              that doesn't exist. I'm 38 and I haven't had kids but I know it's a good
               time for all this and Sapphire will be a great mom. But I'm still 
              having a tough time wanting the marriage even though I believe we could 
              have a very happy life. I wish I wasn't so superficial.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong><span class="il">Doc</span>, I know I've done some bad stuff, but lay it <span class="il">on</span> me. I need to know how to handle myself through this.  </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Wilfred - who's twisted into a pretzel</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Hi Wilfred,</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Let me ask you a question<em>: if you've been with Sapphire for four and half years, how come you two aren't married?</em> After all that time, you should be.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>But since Sapphire let herself go to fat, you sure as heck don't want to marry her now. Like my cousin Rabbi <span class="il">Love</span> says, "At that weight, she's not going to be a healthy spouse." So this is grounds to drop her now.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Instead, you decided to try to rekindle the mess with the super bitchy Stormy who cheated <span class="il">on</span> you before. Like most men, since you're having problems with your 
              current girl, you go to the past for a solution. (To you Psych majors, 
              women do the same thing, by the way.) And what men do is <em>distort</em> what <em>really</em> happened back then into something more agreeable to their present 
              needs. But Stormy belongs to the past, Wilfred. This disaster happened 
              12 years ago. She memorized all the mistakes you made and she can't 
              forget them. So it's over. Get that through your head. I don't care if 
              this stuff happened 100 years ago - you can't go back. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Sure, like your friend said, Stormy may have changed, but her memory <em>hasn't</em> changed. Your friend didn't give you good advice, guy. And by the way, 
              you should be listening to me, not some yahoo friend of yours who 
              doesn't know anything about anything. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>It's
               interesting that you realized that Stormy sucked you in by pandering to
               your ego. Most guys don't understand what's happening when they're 
              being taken for a ride, but you did at the same time as Stormy was doing
               it. So you're making the wrong choices when you know they're the wrong 
              choices, and even though you have my book. What's wrong with you, 
              Wilfred?</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>And
               you pursued Stormy anyway. So now you're entangled with two girls, 
              neither of whom you have a chance with. It was over years ago with 
              Stormy, and Sapphire loves to eat like Oprah. So what do you really 
              have? </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>It doesn't matter if Stormy lives next door or in New Zealand - it's finished with her. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is all a waste of time and has absolutely nothing to do with your problems with Sapphire.</span> You've somehow gotten it into your head that there are only two women 
              in the whole world and you have to choose between them. But these two 
              are both OUT.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>You
               don't have a twisted sense of loyalty to anyone, Wilfred. You just 
              can't be alone, that's your problem - you're not into loyalty at all. 
              Like my cousin Fast Eddie <span class="il">Love</span> from East L.A. says, "If you were really loyal, you wouldn't be chasing another chick around." You wouldn't even be <em>talking</em> about Stormy if you were a loyal man. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>And
               like I said before, it's also true that it's history with Sapphire. 
              You've got four and a half years in with a fat girl, that's all. Your 
              emotions aren't all over the place. It's your logic and reasoning that 
              are all over the place. Your emotions are fine. If Sapphire wants to be 
              married right away, tell her forget it, it's off. That way you're rid of
               both of these pieces of dead wood once and for all. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>If you stay with Sapphire, the physical attraction problem is only going to get worse. Because like my cousin Sal "The Fish" <span class="il">Love</span> says, "After she pops a kid, she's going to be carrying another hundred pounds around."</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>The real problem here is that you're not thinking about the possibility of a <em>third</em> girl. Both Sapphire and Stormy are extinct issues - that's what you don't seem to get. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You have to find a girl that you <em>like</em>, Wilfred. If you haven't married a girl after four and a half years, you don't really like her.</span> And so you have a problem. You think you can still have a happy life with Sapphire? Like my Uncle Jethro <span class="il">Love</span> says, "You're off in la-la land, boy." </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>And
               you're not superficial, Wilfred. You just think in the short term, like
               most men, and you're run by your emotions and your high Interest Level.
               Other than that, you're a average guy.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Here's how you should handle yourself: drop both girls, commit my materials to memory, and find a third girl. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Remember, guys: unless you memorize my program, you're going to make stupid mistakes.</strong></span></p>
