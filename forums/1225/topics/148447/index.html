            <div class='col-md body'>It all started last Christmas. I got her a gift, then I asked her what she wanted for Christmas the Wednesday before Christmas. She replied on Christmas itself, she told me she thank you and she enjoyed herself. I never did passed the gift to her.<br><br>After that, I started by wishing her a simple "Good Night," she replied with a forward message almost immediately, I was so thrilled and happy. So I decided to do that again the next day. She didn't replied and I got scared. So I told her "Sorry, I won't bother you again." She replied almost immediately, she said "You are  from  right?" I was stunned by the weird reply, I replied "Yes." It was kinda weird, I didn't know why she asked me that.<br><br>Talk about fate, the following day, I told myself to give up and move on but I had to see her shopping with her father.<br><br>On New Year's Day itself, I sent her "Happy New Year," but she didn't replied.<br>I thought she might be angry about what happened before.<br><br>I told myself, since I saw her right after I decided to forget about her, this might be fate, she maybe "THE ONE." So I mustered my courage and asked her out. The SMS was send, 10 mins, 20 mins, 30 mins... and I got scared and told her I "Not replying is also a form of reply. I am sleepy." I guess I made a wrong again, I should have waited longer for her to reply.<br><br>Then I added her to my MSN list, I don't know if it was coincident or not. The moment I added her she changed to nick to something that would suggest she had some love problems and is sad or something like that. I always wondered if it had anything to do with me. She never changed her nick since then till now.<br><br>Since then, I been sending her forward messages everyweek regularly. At the initial stage, she didn't reply but then she started to reply more and more regularly. So I decided to try something fresh, I send her a message "Are you there?" I thought she wouldn't reply but she did and she even told me she was camping. So the following Monday, 2 days after I send her that message, I asked her out. She didn't replied again. I always wondered if it was because she was still camping.<br><br>I asked her out again on Sunday, she replied, she say she wasn't free as she had  practice. I know she isn't lying on this one, it was her regular schedule.<br><br>So I went back to sending her forward message and as usual she would reply to it once in a while.<br><br>Then one day, one of my friends told me she was attached, I checked her Friendster, Single. I even checked up on everyone in her Friendster. Nope, no one in her friend list could be her boyfriend and all the more, she should have used this excuse to get rid of me.<br><br>Then a few weeks later, I decided to asked her out again. She didn't replied, I expected it. So I didn't forward her anything that week. I wanted to test her reaction and also wanted to try giving up. Little did I know, 2 days later she forwarded me a message. I always wondered why she did that. So I continued with the routine again and once in a while she would reply.<br><br>Then today, I viewed her Friendster again, there was new photo and there was this Testimonial from this guy. That guy was commenting on how her new hairstyle suits her better and might attract more guys. And made a joke commenting "Don't let other guys snatch you away tell them you're mine. HaHa."<br><br>I checked up on that guy's profile and Testimonial. It appears that he is from another school, knew her only from 1st 3 months, he had a different girl he fancied and she (referring to the girl I like.) never wrote him a Testimonial before.<br><br>What bothers me is that, he wrote the Testimonial last week and she only changed her photo today. Which means he didn't saw her new hairstyle through Friendster and this might suggests they might have met somehow. I really feel uneasy about this. What if I have a challenger?<br><br>Her prelims are coming, so are her A'Levels and her father is strict. I don't really don't know what to do now. I liked her since the first day I seen her in year 2000. I really miss her.<br><br>What should I do now? I need a plan but I don't want to affect her studies but I am getting more and more afraid that some guy might woo her away. I don't know how she feels about me but my friend did once told me, she said I was handsome before.<br><br>Maybe this year isn't a good year to woo her but what else can I do? I need a plan.</div>
