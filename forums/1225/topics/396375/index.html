              <p>Last saturday I went out with my friends from my Junior College. Some of the girls brought their boyfriends along. Most of the boyfriends were undergraduates, just like those girls. However, there was one exception...</p>
              <p>One of the girl's boyfriend isnt an undergraduate. He's a diploma holder and is currently working as a computer technicians in a school. The guy's hair is dyed in golden colour and he's a smoker....</p>
              <p>To me, this is perfectly all right. My men during my NS time were all ah beng smokers. I must say that some of these ah bengs are nice people. A number of them turned out to be like this due to family circumstances...</p>
              <p>However,for my ladies classmates, due to the lack of exposure to people of different social strata, they concluded that the guy was not suitable for my cassmate.</p>
              <p>I was shocked by their views.. (maybe NS has changed my perception of certain stuffs?).. Wat about the rest of you guys? Do you all agree that it's a case of mismatch as mentioned by the other girls?</p>

              <p>don't judge a book by its cover...their education levels don't match though..there's bound to be problem in the future due to their education level mismatch instead of his appearance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can change your appearance as long as you have money but you can't change your education level unless you pursue it..of course, being wealthy is better than having an education</p>
