              <p>Its normal for ppl to judge a person first impression based on their appearance together with what they have. And I dont really believe in instinct to judge people, there are just bullshit excuse for stereotyping, unless u are the kind who is street smart or you really have alot of experience with people.</p>
              <p>I accept TS's friend's comment based on first meet up, but I cannot accept if they still make the same remark when they know each other well.</p>
              <p>Let me quote you an example of stereotyping: if you see a stranger who is younger than 20 yrs old drives a BMW. Do you normally think that he/she must have a rich parent to drive that?? </p>
              <p>Think about it. This kind of thing happen anywhere. Try not to be too affected or think too much by what other people said. Cheers!</p>

              <p>Last saturday I went out with my friends from my Junior College.
              Some of the girls brought their boyfriends along. Most of the
              boyfriends were undergraduates, just like those girls. However,
              there was one exception...</p>
              <p>One of the girl's boyfriend isnt an undergraduate. He's a
              diploma holder and is currently working as a computer technicians
              in a school. The guy's hair is dyed in golden colour and he's
              a smoker....</p>
              <p>To me, this is perfectly all right. My men during my NS time
              were all ah beng smokers. I must say that some of these ah bengs
              are nice people. A number of them turned out to be like this due to
              family circumstances...</p>
              <p>However,for my ladies classmates, due to the lack of exposure to
              people of different social strata, they concluded that the guy was
              not suitable for my cassmate.</p>
              <p>I was shocked by their views.. (maybe NS has changed my
              perception of certain stuffs?).. Wat about the rest of you guys? Do
              you all agree that it's a case of mismatch as mentioned by the
              other girls?</p>
