I'm talking about honing elements like eye contact, tone of voice and timing. They're all important.<br>Go get some classic comedies on DVD and pay attention to how the actors deliver the lines that make you laugh. Watch them over and over again, and then practice your delivery skills with the women in your life. If women are cracking up and playfully punching you, you're doing it right. If they're not laughing at all, you have some improvements to make, or you need to choose women who are more fun and more secure in themselves to spend your time with.<br></div>

The idea here is to suggest that if she loses enough points, you may not want to see her again. So if she's a bit late for a date, tell her she just lost a point. If she likes country and you like classic rock, she just lost a point. If she likes broccoli and you hate it, she just lost a point. Get it?</div>

Whenever she does something that suggests she could be a loser, a nerd or otherwise unworthy of your attention, tell her, "I don't think this is going to work out." Let's say you're about to meet up with a woman you originally encountered online. You two have never met in person before. You call her on her cell, asking where she is. While you're on the phone with her you see her walking up, but she doesn't see you yet. You can tease her with "Oh, are you the one walking by the Ferris wheel with the black jacket? Yeah... uh... I don't think this is going to work out. I think I left the oven on back at home or something." Of course this works best with really attractive women, as they are sure to get the joke.</div>

Act disappointed. When she asks you what's wrong, tell her you don't date anyone over 17. Or if she's 35, tell her you don't date anyone under 47. The idea here is to convey the notion that if she's young, she's not young enough, and if she's older, she's not old enough. What makes this interesting and different is that it's the opposite of what most women would expect you to say.</div>

Got extra material to see from now <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>elindra: I dont think so. Nobody's asking to rip the whole thing off as an unedited template. Think of it more of referrencing material that you can sprout new adaptations and to consider new viewpoints from. If one needs to copy this thing wholesale it speaks a lot about his spontaniety as a guy companion really. Anyway, posting it here is simply to help guys kickstart when they're really pulling their hair out and hav no inkling of how to communicate with females from a radical, humourous approach. Being able to take it easy with girls and not being intimidated into being too serious or nervous certainly earns brownie points with girls. I'm not advocating the above as a bread-and-butter routine for guys, but merely to consider a different angle-of-approach.
