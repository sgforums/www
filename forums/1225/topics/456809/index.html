              <p>Often a lot of people ask each other, why do girls like bad boys?</p>
              <p>Now I have this burning question, why do guys like bad girls?</p>
              <p>I notice of late, guys like girls to treat them like carpet, scold them, neglect them and even ignore them. On the other hand, when a girl showers all her attention to the guy, he neglects her.</p>
              <p>This is the case of a friend I have. He used to aggressively pursue two girls. Girl A and Girl B. Girl A is tall with long black hair, she is a quiet person and very nice. She treated him so well. Whenever they go out on date, she would share half their outing expenses whether it be dining, going to entertainment places, movies, etc. Got one time my friend fell sick, Girl A came over to his place with a pot of personally boiled porridge for him. Girl A use to visit my friend's family home and would strike a chat with his mother. Girl A likes to join his family for dinner, and then after dinner help to wash dishes and even share some tips of cooking with his mom.</p>
              <p>Then there is girl B. She is very bitchy. She is from Malaysia, Ipoh. Some people tell me that girls from Ipoh are normally very pretty due to the calcium water there. Girl B is very rude and demanding. Every time my friend bring her out on a date, he has to foot the bill. When he drop her off at her rented place, he has to open the door for her and escort her to her home door. Got one time, my friend brought Girl B to visit his parents, Girl B never even bother to say hi, go straight to his room and sit there. Then Girl B decided to move in with my friend's home to stay with him and his parents. After dinner, my friend complain to me that Girl B never even bother to help wash the dishes, just chiak pui already, go straight to his bedroom and watch TV. Girl B is very rude, when my friend go out with us bunch of friends, she always like to stick to him like glue. She never speaks to us. whenever we go out to dining, she would take the newspaper lift up and read so that she can ignore us. When we bunch of friends order dishes in chinese restaurant to share, she purposely order her own dish because she don't want to share with us.</p>
              <p>In the end, my friend chose Girl B. Now he regrets marrying her. He tells me that she doesn't spent a cent for the household expenses. He has to foot all the expenses. Girl B is demanding and always want my friend to accompany him, so he got no time for his friend and his parents who are now old. Now he regrets marrying Girl B and sometimes think of Girl A, wondering what happened to her.</p>
              <p>So why? Why do guys like bad girls? Is it because they are:</p>
              <p>1) Pretty?</p>
              <p>2) Guys like girls to treat them like tramp?</p>

              Well i guess its the excitement though, guys like difficult targets. They think its fun, pleasing the "queen" gives them a sense of accomplishment. Its stupid i know, i learnt my lesson already. In relationship you can go around and decide, but to play with marriage is foolish. ALWAYS choose the nice one if it comes to that, so one would not regret for the rest of his life. 
              
              Its the same for girls though, they ALWAYS choose the bad character ones!! i had no idea why, but as Mr Nice Guy at this age is actually almost equals to be Forever Alone. Maybe girls find me boring. See how they regret after marriage with the bad boys they loved so much.
              
              From the above i guess Girl A isn't as appealing on the outside as Girl B, hence the result. The reason is rather simple though cos guys, at least 90%, goes for the looks. Well as far as i know though.
              
              Oldkamhouse you should learn from his lesson though......

              <p>Guys always choose to let go of the girl that actually loves him and go for another bitch that is just playing around with him. Dunno why, but many my friends around me like that one, then after that they say they regretted their action but too bad no way to turn back liao.</p>
              <p>In school, it always the nice guy that doesnt have a gf de. Some girls will turn to the nice guy when she suffered a break up or whatever, then ignore him when she gets over it and looks for next bf.</p>
