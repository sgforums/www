              <p>I was reading some Aunt Agony posts when this particular issue came to my mind.</p>
              <p>I remembered when I was in secondary school (21 yrs old this year), most parents and teachers were always advicing the teenagers not to get involve in a romantic relationship, that we might not be mentally mature enough for it and it's better to spend the time on school work.</p>
              <p>I was, and still is, wondering: seriously, who in the right mind would actually think a student will put his/her 100% into his/her academics even without being in a relationship?</p>
              <p>A few years on, it seemed to me that within my circle of friends, it is those who are daring enough to enter into a relationship at that age that gain more experience in the field of romance, and also are more tactful (or successful) around the opposite gender.</p>
              <p>Perhaps it has got more to do with one's character rather than so-called 'experience', but why surpress this phenomenon when I can hardly see any adverse effect?</p>
              <p>At the very least, I don't know of any one who had failed a major exam because of relationships. Or rather, I should put it in another way: I don't see students who're in relationships having a higher chance of doing badly in school as compared to the others. (More often than not, it's 'not studying' that makes one do badly in school)</p>
              <p>And the funniest thing is, once you're out of sec sch, it becomes very normal to have a girlfriend in JC, depressing if you don't have a gf when you're in NS, and somewhat worrying if you still don't even have a relationship experience after ord (i.e. me)</p>
              <p>Just a few years and it's so much of a difference?</p>
              <p>Not every relationship can last all the way till marriage, whether it be between sec sch students or grown-ups. However, I do have a pair of friends who were couples from sec sch till now.</p>
              <p>So what I really want to say is: why ask students to 'focus on their studies' and not think about relationships. Where's the harm in that?</p>

              <p>I've known of a decent number of students who get distracted and have thier results affected due to problems with BGRs. A good relationship may be fine but kids at that age are usually not matured enough to handle BGR well when even many adults fail. Any breakups or arguement during the exam period especially is usually very bad for the student involved and results are almost certain to be affected.</p>
