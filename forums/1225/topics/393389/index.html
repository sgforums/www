              <p>Hi all, I have a question for you girls, single, divorced or widowed.</p>
              <p>Will you gals consider going into a serious relationship with a divorced man with a child whose mother is still visiting the child weekly? If the answer is yes, will you feel awkard or jealous or even uneasy that the man's ex-wife is still in his life because of the child? Of course I am referring to myself, I would very much like to get attached and I had a chance to last year, but I do not know how the girl would really feel inside coz when you started out dating, EVERYTHING is ok. But when things enter a later stage, when plans of settling down comes, a lot of such different probs and issues start to arise.</p>
              <p>I would very much want to be attached, but I worry too much abt how my partner will feel eventually as I am a guy who wants to give the best I can to the one i love. Do you think I should get a girlfriend in this situation?</p>
              <p>And do you think a man like me sould get a gf when I am still linked to my ex-wife(even though I do not wish to but because there is a child in between!)?</p>
              <p>Pls give me your views/comments/advice, esp those who went thru marriage before, divorced or widowed, or girls who had been with married/divorced man before.</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>I think the most impt is not whether your future gf can accept your past, is how to present to her to accept it. If she is willing to be your gf after knowing that you are still in contact with your ex-wife means that you have some things that she likes.</p>
              <p>But the question is ,are you confident to handle problems occur between your kid n ex-wife with her?  </p>

              <p>multivariate reasons for divorces....but the main reason coincides with the rise of sluts and their sluttier motives and needs breeding inside them physiologically that are so helplessly maslownian, which basic needs are no longer satisfactory...</p>
              <p>more importantly whether future gfs are high on the maslownian scale....even u got them...your cost-benefits cannot sustain...it would lead to another wave of divorce cycle....</p>
