            <div class='col-md body'>If you try and use what makes sense to YOU as a woman with a man... odds are you're going to get very poor results.<br>Which means...<br><br>If you want to start getting better outcomes and results when it comes to men, and you want to be able to communicate with a man in a way that brings him closer...<br><br>Then you're going to have to learn to STOP doing what makes "sense" to you.<br><br>And START doing what it is that makes a man FEEL ATTRACTED and MORE INTERESTED in you.<br><br>In other words... the biggest challenge most women run into when it comes to "breaking through" to men and getting past the surface dating stuff and into a real relationship with a real man is not being able to see past their own MINDSET and the approach they've been using that hasn't<br>worked.<br><br><strong>If you have the wrong mindset, and the thus the wrong approach when it comes to men and dating. Then it practically guarantees you're going to fail from the very beginning.</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me tell you a quick little secret about men...<br><br>When it comes to women and relationships, in the beginning, most men think they want to 'have their cake, and eat it too'<br><br>I don't think I have to explain what I mean by this, because I'm sure you intuitively get what I'm talking about, and you've experienced this with a man.<br><br>But notice that I said MOST men<br><br>This is NOT the case with EVERY woman that a man meets and dates.<br><br>That's right. It's different in some situations<br><br>Every once in awhile, a man will meet a woman and KNOW very quickly - without a smidgeon of doubt - that he wants to be with HER and only HER. I'm talking about the situation where a man knows he wants to be with ONE WOMAN because it FEELS RIGHT on a deep emotional level.<br><br>And here's something else you should know:<br><br>When this happens, THE MAN will usually be the one to push for a long-term commitment.<br><br>And you won't have to do anything but keep being the great partner that you are and help him with the things he wants to do to keep you both CLOSE and TOGETHER.<br><br>I'm sure you've had at least one friend that the men ALWAYS seemed to pursue, and it seemed like they were in the one up position. Or maybe this has happened to you before but you don't exactly know how or why it happened or more importantly, how to repeat it with a guy you REALLY want<br><br>For some strange reason, the guys you DON'T WANT seem to always be PURSUING YOU for more.<br><br>Strange how that works, isn't it?<br><br>The truth is, getting a guy to WANT to be more and more committed WITH YOU can be summed up in 2 simple steps<br><br>A woman that TRULY captures a man's heart will:<br><br><strong>Make a man FEEL, through experience, that he's BETTER OFF being with YOU than being single, spending most of his time with his friends, or 'sleeping around'.<br><br>AND<br><br>Show a man, on a physical AND emotional level, that he's BETTER OFF being with YOU than ANY OTHER WOMAN HE COULD POSSIBLY MEET.</strong></div>
