You don't hear us complaining about you leaving it down.<br><br>Sunday sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.<br><br>Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way.<br><br>Crying is blackmail.<br><br>Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!<br><br>Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.<br><br>Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.<br><br>A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.<br><br>Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.<br><br>If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.<br><br>If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us.<br><br>If something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.<br><br>You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.<br><br>Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.<br><br>Christopher Columbus did not need directions and neither do we.<br><br>ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.<br><br>If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.<br><br>If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle.<br><br>If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear.<br><br>When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine...Really.<br><br>You have enough clothes.<br><br>You have too many shoes.<br><br>I am in shape. Round is a shape.<br><br>Thank you for reading this. Yes I know I have to sleep on the couch tonight. But did you know men really don't mind that?

"You don't know what you're asking...it'll change your entire view on the universe...won't you ask for something else...a million dollars, anything?"<br><br>But no matter what the mermaid said, the guy insisted on having his I.Q. increased by five times it's usual power.<br><br>So the mermaid sighed and said, "Done."<br><br>And he became a woman.<br></div>

But they still know how to use their softer side to make a point.<br><br>Women want to be the best for their family, their friends, and themselves.<br><br>Their hearts break when a friend dies. They have sorrow at the loss of a family member, yet they are strong when they think there is no strength left.<br><br>A woman can make a romantic evening unforgettable.<br><br>Women come in all sizes, in all colors and shapes. They live in homes, apartments and cabins. They drive, fly, walk, run or e-mail you to show how much they care about you.<br><br>The heart of a woman is what makes the world spin! Women do more than just give birth. They bring joy and hope. They give compassion and ideals.<br><br>They give moral support to their family and friends. And all they want back is a hug, a smile and for you to do the same to people you come in contact with.<br><br>MEN:<br><br>Men are good at lifting heavy stuff and killing spiders.<br></div>
