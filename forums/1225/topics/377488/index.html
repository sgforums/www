              <p>I met this girl from university, she's 22, I'm 24. We study in the same course but she's my senior by 1 semester.</p>
              <p>The first time I saw her was in a club meeting where she was selected to be a leader. I still remember then that I thought she looked klutzy and has a bad sense of fashion. Add on rumors about her being very fierce and demanding, I made a mental note to be wary of her.<br>That was 6 months ago.</p>
              <p>About a month later, I attended a gathering with some of club mates and that's where we first got acquianted proper. Us club mates talked about all kinds of stuff, from school to past relationships to porn, in which she recommended us boys a webbie, rather strongly. Here, I learnt that she's had 3 past relationships. I never had one by the way.</p>
              <p>I saw her a couple more times in our club room and had some small talk, and she kept reminding me to visit the webbie she recommended. I did and it turned out to be a shock site.</p>
              <p>A couple of weeks after the gathering, we had a club dinner with another group of club mates. I sat beside her and our conversation started like this:<br>Me: You bitch!<br>Her: Huh?<br>Me: I visited (webbie).com.<br>Her: *Laughs*<br>And throughout the night, we started talking, clicked and she got my MSN.</p>
              <p>For the months to come, we would have small talk on MSN.</p>
              <p>Exam time soon came, and one day she asked me if I wanted to study with her. I took up the offer and this is when we exchanged numbers. I studied together with her, but started to get worried that she may be interested in me romantically.</p>
              <p>During our studies together, I've learnt that behind her exterior of a strong, confident, 'power girl' lies a girl that's really kind, considerate and seems to believe that she's not 'hot' . Put simply, she's really strong but she has her weaknesses.<br>This is where I started to feel something for her.</p>
              <p>One night, she complained to me about how she's got to rush some work and couldn't proceed cause her groupmates haven't sent over yet. And there I was, having supper with my sis and her bf. With encouragement from them, I brought over supper for her and tried to get her to ease up a bit.<br><br>She asked me then 'What's the real reason for you coming over?' <br>I couldn't reply her honestly, so I told her some crap about just helping her relax.<br>When I went home, I MSN-ed her that I really just wanted to see her and that I liked her. (I know, confession through MSN is a huge no-no. T_T)<br>Anyway, her reply was 'So? What can I do about it?'<br><br>The next day, I tried to salvage it and settled for 'going back to what is was', through MSN.</p>
              <p>It was awkward for a while, trying to have our usual conversation but with fresh memories of that fateful night. But thanks to her maturity, we managed to put that past behind us.</p>
              <p>Recently, she's got a job near my place. So every week, we would meet up once for movie, dinner or both after her work. This time, I am in love with her and I am sure she is aware of it.</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Couple of things of note (Maybe I'm just imagining things here):<br>Whenever in company of people we know, she seem to be colder.<br><br>Once while in my company, our mutual friend called and she told him that she's out with a friend. Although, once when I called her, she mentioned the name of our friend that she's with.</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>I don't know what to do now. <br> I don't know how she feels about me. <br>Please advice and feel free to ask any questions, I'll try to answer.</p>

              <p>If u are in love as u proclaim - enjoy the trip while it lasts, the breeze is wafting thru the windows of your heart(soul). Shut the 'windows', close the 'doors' - u kill love - yours as well as hers (my assumption that is love lar).</p>
              <p>PS - the desire to make it yours or 'own' the other - is not love, but fear-based needs/expectations masquerading as love. Words are 'birds' - the word 'love' is not love, the word 'God' is not God, and the word 'fire' of course, is not fire. Love is an <em>existential herenow</em> experience n the heart resonates that which 'frees' or is freeing.</p>
              <p>Does your love free u or another? Only u know lar, self-honesty n a POROUS ego helps!</p>

              <p>hai. youre acting like some needy despo... its no wonder she doesn't want you. </p>
              <p>remember that whatever is hard to get is valuable. the way youre proceeding now (pursuing her, making your feelings known) is just going to chase her away. youre simply inflating her ego, not causing attraction.</p>
              <p>you need a total change of direction. it's always like that when you lack experience, so don't worry, take your time and try to learn from the so called "pros"</p>
