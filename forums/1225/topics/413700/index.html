              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Hey Doc,</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong><br> I've been seeing Chloe for six months now and things have been great.  
              She is a Beautiful Woman who used to model in New York and Paris.<span>  </span>She's
               also a Giver. She's bought me things plenty of times, she's kind to my 
              close friends, and she takes care of her mother who is financially 
              unstable.  She manages to baby-sit terribly bratty children, so she 
              seems to have good potential as a mother as well.  She also has very 
              high Integrity. Her Interest Level is in the 90s and she never uses 
              Womanese. She does, however, badmouth other people she doesn't care for,
               but then again, I can be the same way so I think that's acceptable.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong><br> Chloe has frequently told me I'm "the one." In fact, sometimes she's 
              overbearing, which brings me to her negatives. She can be very needy; 
              she often needs my help with her problems; if I don't spend the day with
               her she will call me and expect me to listen to her for at least 20 to 
              30 minutes; she has past "daddy" issues; every time she tells me "I love
               you" she must hear me say "I love you" back or else she won't leave me 
              alone.  When she dresses up, she must hear a compliment from me or else 
              she will give me a hard time about it. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong><span> </span><br> According to you I should not be there for Chloe all the time. However,
               the way I see it, it's just much easier for me to have a 20-minute 
              phone conversation with her, rather than pretend I was too busy to take 
              the call and then have an argument lasting at least an hour about why I 
              didn't pick up the phone or call her back. The same situation applies to
               saying "I love you." Although you might say that being there for her 
              too much and being too accommodating is anti-Challenge and lowers her 
              Interest Level, I think her Interest Level is so high that it's okay to 
              compromise on these issues and preserve my sanity. But might I be 
              lowering her Interest Level in order just to avoid a confrontation?</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong><br> So what do you think?  Is her moderate inflexibility a major problem to
               the relationship, enough to cause serious problems down the road?  Am I
               risking lowering her Interest Level too much, or am I compromising just
               the right amount? You've said yourself that Beautiful Women are by 
              nature inflexible, and I don't think she's all that bad, so are these 
              inflexible traits just part of the deal with Chloe?</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong><br> Nicoli - who wants to make sure this is a good one</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Hi Nicoli,</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Like
               my Uncle Jethro Love says, "Naw, it ain't no problem to badmouth other 
              folks - we all do it behind the barn." On the other hand, to you Psych 
              majors, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a needy woman will drive you bonkers</span>. And because Chloe is <em>so</em> needy, she has you playing psychiatrist, which you know, if you read my
               book that I'm against. Now I want you to think about this real hard. 
              Chloe has you listening to her complain and bitch and whine and whimper 
              for a half hour every single day...<em>and you're going to do it for the next 45 years</em>?
               You are literally going to be her shrink for the next half-century. 
              Like my cousin Sal "The Fish" Love says, "I hope you know what you're 
              getting yourself into, man."</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>And
               think about this: she's going to take her "daddy" issues out on you. 
              Daddy issues fall under the heading of "scars and baggage." Like most 
              women, Chloe isn't saying "I love you" because she really does love you,
               she's just saying it because she needs to hear it said to <em>her</em> all the time and she has to have the strokes. There's also this: every 
              time she changes her clothes you're going to have to tell her how 
              fabulous she looks. Like my cousin Fast Eddie Love from East L.A. says, 
              "Damn, this sounds like a lot of work. Ain't life supposed to be easy 
              some of the time?" </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Again,
               you have to consider being with Chloe while constantly meeting her 
              needs for the next 45 years. Like my cousin General Love says, "Think 
              about being stranded in a cabin with her up in Alaska for a year or 
              two." Or like my cousin Brother Love down in Watts says, "Bro, can you 
              imagine bein' in the same cell with her doin' life without the 
              possibility of parole?"</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>No,
               you shouldn't be there for Chloe all the time, pal. Because SHE SHOULD 
              BE GONE. Period. I don't care if she's an ex-model. I don't care if 
              she's the second coming of Stephanie Seymour. You have to get rid of her
               unless you want to be crazy, too. Like my cousin Rabbi Love says, "My 
              son, you're paying for those looks. And you're going to keep paying for 
              them." This babe is what we call SUPER HIGH-MAINTENANCE. She'll drive 
              you insane over the next 45 years. Remember, we die in our 80s today. 
              It's not like the old days when you croaked at 49.<span>   </span></strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>If
               Chloe argues with you about why you didn't pick up the phone whenever 
              she calls, you can only come to one conclusion: this girl is a M-E-S-S. 
              That spells MESS.<span>  </span></strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Now let me explain something very important to you. You're worrying needlessly about being a Challenge to Chloe because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHALLENGE DOESN'T WORK WITH WOMEN WHO HAVE LOW SELF-ESTEEM</span>. A needy woman <em>hates</em> Challenge. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Challenge only works with clinically sane, self-reliant women</span> - not loons. And Chloe, sadly, falls into the latter category. She has 
              95% Interest Level in you all right; the problem is that when you look 
              up "scars and baggage" in Webster's Dictionary, her face is there.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>You're
               not going to lower Chloe's Interest Level as long as you keep playing 
              psychiatrist and give her a therapy session every day for as long as you
               live and you never miss a session. And as long as whenever she says "I 
              love you" and you say it back to her two or three or four times, she's 
              not going anywhere. Of course it has no value whatsoever in the 
              relationship, but with her low Self-Esteem, she'll think it's great. You
               can say "I love you" to Chloe 50 times a day and never lower her 
              Interest Level because her Self-Esteem is in the ditch. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>You
               call her inflexibility "moderate?" Talk about rationalizing, Nicoli! 
              This is called SUPER inflexibility, my friend! This isn't a major 
              problem in the relationship - it's MASSIVE. Of course it's going to 
              cause serious problems down the road - how could it not?</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Don't fret about compromising too much or lowering Chloe's Interest Level. Neither concept should even be in this discussion. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What you have to do is get rid of her.</span> She's a whack-job and you'll end up hating her anyway. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Yes,
               it's true that as a rule the Beautiful Woman is inflexible. And that's 
              because ever since she was 12 years old, every male she's ever run into 
              has never said anything but YES to her.<span>  </span></strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>And
               yes, Chloe's character traits are just part of the deal with her. But 
              if you have three kids with her and are trying to run a household and 
              you have to put up with her inflexible neediness all the time, how do 
              you think it's going to work out? How much attention do you think your 
              kids are going to get? Or you, for that matter? I feel sorry for you, 
              Nicoli.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Remember, guys: if you have to play psychiatrist for her, it will drive you nuts.</strong></span></p>
