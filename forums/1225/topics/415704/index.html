              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Hey <span class="il">Doc</span>,</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>I ordered "The System" this week but I'm in need of an immediate RX.<br> <br> I was married for a long time to a nut case, my divorce was very messy,
               and a mutual friend introduced me to a Beautiful Woman, Courtney. We 
              hit it off. Courtney was starting a new business, I agreed to help her 
              and we began to get together. Then I asked her out. I offered her three 
              choices: two girly ideas and a Sumo wrestling tournament. She chose Sumo
               and I knew I had someone special.  </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>We've had a wonderful time together: fun dates, great trips, intimacy, etc.<br> Because I wanted to be closer to her, I moved to within a couple miles 
              of her house, which is 40 miles from where I used to live. It had gotten
               to the point that I thought about asking Courtney to marry me in the 
              next year or so. The only lingering doubts I had were that Courtney 
              might change her mind about our relationship, how a mixing of families 
              would work, and our financial situations. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>We
               both have complicated lives.  Courtney shares custody of two children, 
              one with special needs, is starting a new business which is eating away 
              at her savings, has been divorced only two years, and has no more 
              alimony. My own business is winding down and I'm looking for my next 
              endeavor, which I would like to start before making a marriage 
              commitment. My kids are older but still need the support of a parent 
              (they don't see or communicate with their mother), and they are with me 
              for school holidays.  In addition, I have a nasty alimony situation. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong><br> Courtney and I have been in an exclusive relationship for several 
              months now, but she began to act differently a few weeks ago. I noticed 
              her holding back and when asked, she said everything was okay. Finally 
              she admitted that a half a dozen people had asked her when I was going 
              to propose. (Her first husband had just gotten engaged and her second 
              husband had just remarried.) I told her that I loved her, planned <span class="il">on</span> always being with her, but needed more time to resolve job and alimony issues.  </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong><br> A couple days later Courtney told me that the commitment issue was 
              bugging her. She said in a cold, matter-of-fact way, "I didn't think it 
              would happen, but my heart has closed. It's over." I was dumbfounded. An
               argument, a disagreement, an ultimatum, a cooling down period, okay -- 
              but "my heart has closed?"</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong><br> I believe you when you say that a man has one chance with a woman and 
              when it's done, it's done. That is probably the case here but I don't 
              know if Courtney did something she will regret and whether I should 
              leave the door open. I drafted a letter, which gives me finality. I 
              wrote about how I cherished the relationship, how hard it is to lose 
              your lover, best friend and</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>partner, but acknowledge that once a heart is closed it does not reopen. I conclude with I <span class="il">love</span> you. Should I send it?</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong><br> Also, I <span class="il">love</span> her kids and they have become attached to me.  I don't want to cause them any pain. Coach me, <span class="il">Doc</span>!</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Sugar Ray - who's down for the count</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Hi Sugar Ray,</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Your first mistake with Courtney was mixing business and pleasure. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You don't bring friends or lovers into your business</span>,
               especially in the beginning! This babe is a stranger to you, pal. You 
              don't even know her. And right out of the gate you were way too 
              available.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Your next mistake was giving Courtney a <em>choice</em> about the date you asked her <span class="il">on</span>.
               You don't give woman choices - you TELL her what you're going to do. 
              You say to her "Here's where we're going and I'll pick you up at eight 
              o'clock." That's it. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">To you Psych majors, giving a woman choices is weak.</span> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>You
               think that because Courtney chose to watch two huge, fat, nearly naked 
              guys grappling that it makes her special? You think that enjoying 
              500-pound men trying to force each other off a mat makes her unique? 
              Like my Uncle Jethro <span class="il">Love</span> says, "Man, you're grabbing at straws!" </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>If
               you moved closer to Courtney's house after a couple of years, I could 
              understand it. But you just met this woman. What's wrong with you, Ray? 
              And why were you thinking of asking Courtney to marry you? You're way, 
              way ahead of yourself. Let Courtney ask <em>you</em> to get married. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Because it's the WOMAN'S Interest Level that counts, not yours.</span> Like my cousin Sal "The Fish" <span class="il">Love</span> says, "It sounds to me like you're doing all the work." You're helping 
              her out with her business, you're giving her choices for dates, you're 
              moving close to her house - so how is this babe chasing you? Dude, 
              you're the antithesis of Challenge!</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>If
               you kept Courtney's Interest Level in the 90s, you wouldn't have to 
              worry about your financial situations, and mixing families and whether 
              she'd change her mind about you. She would overlook all of it if she 
              were really gone over you.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Guy,
               you don't have enough time in with this woman to be pursuing marriage. 
              Until you get at least two years in with her, you shouldn't even be <em>thinking</em> about it. And if you have a nasty alimony situation, whatever you do, don't tell your new <span class="il">love</span> about it! Don't bring up your ex or get negative about your financial burdens.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>That
               said, with all of her problems, Courtney sounds like a real prize, let 
              me tell you. What you're saying is that she's got all kinds of baggage 
              and she's broke since her alimony ran out. Like my cousin Fast Eddie <span class="il">Love</span> from East L.A. says, "Maybe she's doing you a favor by getting rid of you, did you think of that?"</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Now here's something you'll learn when you commit my book to memory: <em>when the woman begins to hold back, that means that you're <span class="il">on</span> the way out</em>. And why does she care when you're going to propose? She has a mouth, doesn't she? Why doesn't <em>she</em> propose to <em>you</em>?
               Why is she bringing up what strangers think and say? Or what her loser 
              exes are doing? And she's a two-time loser at marriage already, so you 
              two are off to a really great start! </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When Courtney informed you that her heart had closed, it meant that her Interest Level went from 51% to 49% and you're OUT.</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> IT'S OVER. You should have gotten my book three years ago so you would 
              have anticipated and understood all this - that's where you dropped the 
              ball, cowboy. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Why
               would Courtney regret what she did when she doesn't care about you? It 
              doesn't make a lick of sense, Ray. People regret things when they <em>like</em> you. Courtney doesn't like you anymore romantically, which means she doesn't regret a thing. Besides, like my cousin Brother <span class="il">Love</span> down in Watts says, "She's already <span class="il">on</span> the lookout for the next guy since her alimony is gone."</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>The letter you wrote for "finality" is called BEGGING. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Begging lowers Interest Level even more.</span> Writing a <span class="il">love</span> letter to someone you're already <span class="il">on</span> the outs with is a waste of time. You ought to think about your own 
              pride, if you have any left. And by the way, you don't say, "I <span class="il">love</span> you" to a woman. So don't send the letter. Throw it in the fireplace and start a fire instead. Like my cousin Rabbi <span class="il">Love</span> says, "Your fireplace will be warmer than this wench's heart." </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Courtney's
               kids have nothing whatsoever to do with her Interest Level, so forget 
              them. She doesn't care if you cause them pain since she's dumping you, 
              so why should you care? </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Remember, guys: once a woman closes her heart, you're finished.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
