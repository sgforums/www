              <p>I want to ask you all, if you are interested in somebody, and you don't have the guts to ask her out, how did you do it?</p>
              <p>I always find myself in two situations, first, I accidentaly ask a girl who is already attached, and after that I feel embarassed that I didn't ask her background.</p>
              <p>Second, when I do find somebody interesting, I always get flame. Is it always like this, for you people who are attached? Do guys have to get flame first before he gets the girl? I don't think it is normal for men to get attack by his peers for trying to get to know the girl better unless the girl doesn't like him. Is this a normal thing? Have a relationship ever blossom from friendship. I mean, has anyone ever tried to call up a girl he is interested in, and then try to conversate with her, after that ask her out for a cup of coffee? Maybe she come out, maybe she won't. Or maybe afterward, our peer friends will find out (somehow) and make fun of me. I just don't know, the whole process is so confusing. Sometimes, to have guts, you lose a lot of friends over a girl, I felt better for me to be conservative. It is also hard to find a girl we like, it seems that the men don't have the luxury to pick who he wants to be with.</p>
              <p>I find in our asian society nowadays, so hard to find the opposite sex. We are always busy at work and our social life is getting more narrower and our friends getting fewer. So, it is hard to meet people. In Asia society, there is not many associations we can join to meet people. Whereas, in Western culture, it is easier to meet people, because they have many charitable org like Oxfam and others where you can get involve and meet people. Here in Asia, people tend to be more conservative.</p>
              <p>And then also, in western culture, they have more divorcees, so they have more opportunities to meet someone later on. There is a secondary market there. In Asia, divorcees are shunned and if single men try to date divorcee women their age, their families won't approve of it. It is more forgivable and acceptable in the west, to have divorcees and then divorcees are not so demanding, because they underwent the first marriage, they now know, the imperfection of their spouse, so they willing to accept your defects and mistakes.</p>
              <p>I just find Singaporean women is so demanding. Not only it is hard to find someone, because there is no avenue or place where we can meet people but also, women tend to want to place high requirements. Even if go past the dating stage, there is still the relationship stage to contend with, where she will evaluate how well you can provide herÂ a home and how good a husband and father you can be. I mean, even if I have the basic 5c, a lot of guys will still beat me to the girl. Because she always want the best guy. Sigh, so difficult to find a suitable partner.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I want to ask you all, if you are interested in somebody, and
              you don't have the guts to ask her out, how did you do it?</p>
              <p>I always find myself in two situations, first, I accidentaly ask
              a girl who is already attached, and after that I feel embarassed
              that I didn't ask her background.</p>
              <p>Second, when I do find somebody interesting, I always get flame.
              Is it always like this, for you people who are attached? Do guys
              have to get flame first before he gets the girl? I don't think it
              is normal for men to get attack by his peers for trying to get to
              know the girl better unless the girl doesn't like him. Is this a
              normal thing? Have a relationship ever blossom from friendship. I
              mean, has anyone ever tried to call up a girl he is interested in,
              and then try to conversate with her, after that ask her out for a
              cup of coffee? Maybe she come out, maybe she won't. Or maybe
              afterward, our peer friends will find out (somehow) and make fun of
              me. I just don't know, the whole process is so confusing.
              Sometimes, to have guts, you lose a lot of friends over a girl, I
              felt better for me to be conservative. It is also hard to find a
              girl we like, it seems that the men don't have the luxury to pick
              who he wants to be with.</p>
              <p>I find in our asian society nowadays, so hard to find the
              opposite sex. We are always busy at work and our social life is
              getting more narrower and our friends getting fewer. So, it is hard
              to meet people. In Asia society, there is not many associations we
              can join to meet people. Whereas, in Western culture, it is easier
              to meet people, because they have many charitable org like Oxfam
              and others where you can get involve and meet people. Here in Asia,
              people tend to be more conservative.</p>
              <p>And then also, in western culture, they have more divorcees, so
              they have more opportunities to meet someone later on. There is a
              secondary market there. In Asia, divorcees are shunned and if
              single men try to date divorcee women their age, their families
              won't approve of it. It is more forgivable and acceptable in the
              west, to have divorcees and then divorcees are not so demanding,
              because they underwent the first marriage, they now know, the
              imperfection of their spouse, so they willing to accept your
              defects and mistakes.</p>
              <p>I just find Singaporean women is so demanding. Not only it is
              hard to find someone, because there is no avenue or place where we
              can meet people but also, women tend to want to place high
              requirements. Even if go past the dating stage, there is still the
              relationship stage to contend with, where she will evaluate how
              well you can provide herÂ a home and how good a husband and
              father you can be. I mean, even if I have the basic 5c, a lot of
              guys will still beat me to the girl. Because she always want the
              best guy. Sigh, so difficult to find a suitable partner.</p>

              <p>if you are interested in a girl. you need to muster up the courage. if you don't swing you can never hit. when you first see her, strike a casual conversation with her, try to build some rapport first. about less than 5 mins into the conversation, ask her for her phone number.once you get her phone number, you say "nice talking to you" and you leave.</p>
              <p>you don't need to feel embarrased at all and you should not find out her background first. just ask her for her number. if she is attached/married she will let you know.</p>
              <p>if your peers attack you for getting to know a girl, you should not consider them your friends anymore because they are not worth it. and first of all, you should never let any of your peers know anything about your love life because all of them have big mouths and they cannot keep secrets. and if they also like the same girl as you do, they will not want to see you succeed in getting her. they will be envious and jealous and do all sorts of funny things to make sure you do not succeed in getting her.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>well, you can pick but they can choose. you need to build up your own self confidence and knowledge of women then your chances of success will be increased exponentially. </strong></span></p>
              <p>yes Asian society are not as open minded as western ones but we have our own good points. if you want to compare and complain then just go over there and look for your love. if you want to stay here, then just make the best out of what you have. there are a lot of places locally to meet women. you can join some activities where there women outnumber men. consider dancing classes, yoga classes, cooking classes, the list goes on. try online dating as well.you cannot just go to work everyday and hope that a girl will come to you. you have to go out there and get her.</p>
              <p>Singaporean women might have higher expectations but does not mean all of them are not good for long term relationship. there are a lot of good women as there are not so good women. you just need to expand your social circles and know more women. you only need one good one. start taking action instead of complaining.</p>

              <p>Alas if I can go to west country, I will but how can? I only got poly cert and work low level office job. Unless I am doctor or business man with millions then western country want me.</p>
              <p>Nowadays, peers will attack you one leh, how many enemies can you make out of them? Too many. Do you not think for a second who is the one who leak out my approach to the girl? Of course the girl tell everybody lar. That is why guys don't want to ask the girl out. Many girl think we don't have balls but they take baseball and whack our balls, you think not painful leh?</p>
              <p>That is why I dare say, serve some woman right, that is why a lot of men don't want to go after them because they go and tell everybody. But I also say that there are woman who go after guy when the guy not interested in them. So best way is to strengthen relationship through friendship, from there maybe the guy can make his move. Friendship have advantages because no emotional strings tied and you can see whether the ger match you or not.</p>
              <p>Sorrie, I don't go for dance lesson, sometimes I end up dancing with 60 year old grandma. Still they are good dancer but I don't expect to find anyone special there, I have gone for dancing class before. Plus I make a bad dancer, I got two left feet.</p>
