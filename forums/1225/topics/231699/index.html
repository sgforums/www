            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I'm currently dating this guy whom I got to know in August. We met thru a friend and he claims that he was attracted to me because 'I'm unlike most girls, I'm smart, intelligent...'<br><br>But anyway, I din feel that he was chasing me till sometime later when he asked me ' Don't you know that I'm chasing after you?' and I'm like ' Huh? Got meh? I dun feel it leh...'<br><br>Anyway, he loves his Mum and I have nothing against that. In fact, fillial piety has always been a trait that I looked for in my boyfriends. But I think, he's too much of a mummy's boy.<br><br>We've been together for a few months now and our dates never last beyond 9pm and we have never been out on a weekend, not to mention Xmas and New Year.<br><br>He never calls or sms me. He never replies my sms nor answer my calls. When I ask him about it,he claims that its because his phone was in his room on the 3rd floor and he din hear/ see/ notice. ( In my opinion, what use is a handphone if you keep it sitting in your room, away from your sight. Handphones aren't called mobile phone/ hand phones for nothing you know?)<br><br>When I ask him what he does over the weekends, he says that he's keeping his Mum company.<br><br>When we do go out for dates, he drops me at my void-deck without dinner, says he got to rush home but his car is still there when I reach my floor, busily sms-ing somebody in the car.<br><br>He ALWAYS uses his mum as an excuse and frankly, I'm starting to hate his Mum even before meeting his Mum and I have no intention of doing that.<br><br>He was the one who said that he told his mum about us and that his mum wants to meet me but now he's the one who keeps making excuses so that I cannot meet his mum.<br>Frankly, I wished that I could meet his mum and his family so that at least I can go out with them on weekends, just to spend more time to get to noe him.<br><br>In an effort to get to noe him better, I've even offered to go to church with him. He claims that he has to go to church for Bible studies on Sat evenings and he has to attend church on Sundays too. He was shocked by my offer, said that he'll make arrangements den did nothing about it.<br><br>Recently, because of an incident, I 'punished' him by making me promise that he'll keep me company every sat for a month and I'll go to Bible studies with him on Sats and he suddenly said that there isn't any classes.<br><br>Den last Fri, he told me that he cannot company me cos he got to bring his mum to KK for check up in the morn (weird considering the fact that KK deals with Gynae prob and his mum is well into her 50s going 60) and he got Bible Studies in the evening (didn't he just told me no classes for the time being?)<br><br>Now he's not just making me hate his mum, he's making me hate his church too.<br><br>Oh, and I've not mentioned a few pictures in his handphone of him hugging a ger and when queried, he said the ger is the gf/wife of a church fren and they all belonged to the same church and he was hugging her so titely cos their frens had dared them to behave as a couple for a day.<br><br>Now, which guy will bring his gf/wife to an outing with his frens and dare his fren and his wife to behave like a couple for the day?<br><br>After all these months, I know nothing of him, I dunnoe where he stays, I dunnoe his past, I dunnoe what he likes/ dislikes, I dunnoe anything about him at all.<br><br>I'm down with fever and migraine today and as usual, he didn't even call or sms me. When he did sms me and I told him I'm sick, he called and asked if I had dinner. When I said I hadn't, instead of offering to come bring me go see doc or go have diner or even asking me to remember to take medicine, he asked me to order Macdonalds.<br><br>I den told him that I'm sick and I shouldn't be having Macdonalds and I was hoping that he could bring me go have something soupy instead, he said ' I'll try to convince my mum to let me go out.'<br><br>Time den was bout 10pm and he's 30 this year.<br><br>Oh, btw, I only found out bout his past relationship after I did a search for his friendster profile and he has a blog there.<br><br>In it, his last r/s died cos he was dating this other ger while still attached to his ex, not daring to break up with her for fear that she would do something crazy?<br><br>He's turned me into this insecure person who sits around at home, waiting for his ever-absent calls/ sms. I've never felt so insecure and insignificant before.<br><br>When I ask him bout how he's treating me, he says it's cos he's still hurting from the last r/s and that he needs time to open up. But somehow, his refusal to let me know more bout him just make me even more suspicious.<br><br>The discovery of the blog din make it any better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Am I being paranoid for thinking that he's just using his mum as a cover up for somebody else or is it really his mum?</div>

Do you want him to even hide things from you after you and him are married???<br><br>he is already 30 YEARS OLD!....come on, 30 years old leh!.....he still need his mummy to plan and do everything for him? if he cant manange his time even if he is 30 years old, are u going to manage his time for him even after you are married? or worse still , his mum manage and plan YOUR AND HIS wedding?<br><br>as like wad u said, give him a chance.....if he still behaves like dat.....den give up is better....dere are many guys out dere who has better qualities...<br><br>i can see dat you really loved him a lot.....if i were his fren i would hav knocked his head hard to ask him come to his senses</div>
