            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by alegna_t13:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm currently dating this guy whom I got to know in August. We met thru a friend and he claims that he was attracted to me because 'I'm unlike most girls, I'm smart, intelligent...'<br><br>But anyway, I din feel that he was chasing me till sometime later when he asked me ' Don't you know that I'm chasing after you?' and I'm like ' Huh? Got meh? I dun feel it leh...'<br><br>Anyway, he loves his Mum and I have nothing against that. In fact, fillial piety has always been a trait that I looked for in my boyfriends. But I think, he's too much of a mummy's boy.<br><br>We've been together for a few months now and our dates never last beyond 9pm and we have never been out on a weekend, not to mention Xmas and New Year.<br><br>He never calls or sms me. He never replies my sms nor answer my calls. When I ask him about it,he claims that its because his phone was in his room on the 3rd floor and he din hear/ see/ notice. ( In my opinion, what use is a handphone if you keep it sitting in your room, away from your sight. Handphones aren't called mobile phone/ hand phones for nothing you know?)<br><br>When I ask him what he does over the weekends, he says that he's keeping his Mum company.<br><br>When we do go out for dates, he drops me at my void-deck without dinner, says he got to rush home but his car is still there when I reach my floor, busily sms-ing somebody in the car.<br><br>He ALWAYS uses his mum as an excuse and frankly, I'm starting to hate his Mum even before meeting his Mum and I have no intention of doing that.<br><br>He was the one who said that he told his mum about us and that his mum wants to meet me but now he's the one who keeps making excuses so that I cannot meet his mum.<br>Frankly, I wished that I could meet his mum and his family so that at least I can go out with them on weekends, just to spend more time to get to noe him.<br><br>In an effort to get to noe him better, I've even offered to go to church with him. He claims that he has to go to church for Bible studies on Sat evenings and he has to attend church on Sundays too. He was shocked by my offer, said that he'll make arrangements den did nothing about it.<br><br>Recently, because of an incident, I 'punished' him by making me promise that he'll keep me company every sat for a month and I'll go to Bible studies with him on Sats and he suddenly said that there isn't any classes.<br><br>Den last Fri, he told me that he cannot company me cos he got to bring his mum to KK for check up in the morn (weird considering the fact that KK deals with Gynae prob and his mum is well into her 50s going 60) and he got Bible Studies in the evening (didn't he just told me no classes for the time being?)<br><br>Now he's not just making me hate his mum, he's making me hate his church too.<br><br>Oh, and I've not mentioned a few pictures in his handphone of him hugging a ger and when queried, he said the ger is the gf/wife of a church fren and they all belonged to the same church and he was hugging her so titely cos their frens had dared them to behave as a couple for a day.<br><br>Now, which guy will bring his gf/wife to an outing with his frens and dare his fren and his wife to behave like a couple for the day?<br><br>After all these months, I know nothing of him, I dunnoe where he stays, I dunnoe his past, I dunnoe what he likes/ dislikes, I dunnoe anything about him at all.<br><br>I'm down with fever and migraine today and as usual, he didn't even call or sms me. When he did sms me and I told him I'm sick, he called and asked if I had dinner. When I said I hadn't, instead of offering to come bring me go see doc or go have diner or even asking me to remember to take medicine, he asked me to order Macdonalds.<br><br>I den told him that I'm sick and I shouldn't be having Macdonalds and I was hoping that he could bring me go have something soupy instead, he said ' I'll try to convince my mum to let me go out.'<br><br>Time den was bout 10pm and he's 30 this year.<br><br>Oh, btw, I only found out bout his past relationship after I did a search for his friendster profile and he has a blog there.<br><br>In it, his last r/s died cos he was dating this other ger while still attached to his ex, not daring to break up with her for fear that she would do something crazy?<br><br>He's turned me into this insecure person who sits around at home, waiting for his ever-absent calls/ sms. I've never felt so insecure and insignificant before.<br><br>When I ask him bout how he's treating me, he says it's cos he's still hurting from the last r/s and that he needs time to open up. But somehow, his refusal to let me know more bout him just make me even more suspicious.<br><br>The discovery of the blog din make it any better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Am I being paranoid for thinking that he's just using his mum as a cover up for somebody else or is it really his mum?</div></blockquote>got another forumer also got tis problem... it was found out tat he might hv a family(wife) liao... best is go down to his place and expose him.... everything points to him being a cheater or more but now is up to u to proof his is guilty.... good luck...</div>

In some cases, it's distrust. But in this case, it's 'no chance to trust'.<br><br>3) Hire PI I might as well just break it off, use the money go holiday maybe can find somebody better... *Tall, dark, eloquent, witty, humourous stranger.....*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>It's me again. This time, I'm not expecting any words of advice, consolence, pity or anything. Cos I noe that it was myself whom is responsible for the way things are now. I'm just whining so do ignore me if it bores you. I have nobody else to confide in, nobody else to talk to. I feel like crying but the tears refuse to come. Maybe even my tears noe that it's no point wasting themselves for this guy.<br><br>In the 1st post, I was deliberating on whether to leave this guy or not. However, I pulled a brake on it as his company is having a big situation now due to his poor management, his poor judgement skills, his ignorance to the ways of the business world, his refusal to heed good advice and his misplace of trust, hundreds of thousands of his company funds are unaccounted for, his staff are finger pointing but nobody wants to own up.<br><br>In short, his business is on the verge of folding unless his family agrees to loan him money to sustain the business.<br><br>Today, I woke up at 7am just so that I could go to his company and organise his accounts for him.<br><br>It all started pretty well until he realised the atrocities that his staff are commiting.<br><br>Anyway, I have this very very good fren, we would have been together if not for the fact that we didn't meet earlier, if not for the fact that I didn't want to break up his r/s with his gf.<br><br>So, when it came to the crunch of deciding on matters with regards to law, I called my fren who's a lawyer for help.<br><br>He gave me very good advice which he didn't have to, for he was not obliged in anyway. In his own words, he helped because of me and does not want to see me getting so stressed out by the whole matter.<br><br>So there I was, on the phone with my fren, seeking his advice, getting scolded by him for getting myself into this whole matter when he would have been more happy if I was spending my time playing maple at home, at least I can level up, not unlike this whole thankless mess.<br><br>Fast forward........<br><br>We decided on the course of action to take towards his errant employees and just when I was emailing their termination letters to his GM for record purposes, he told me ' Can you do this later when you get home? I need to rush off to have dinner with my family.' in front of his employees no less,and during this while, he was still in the midst of the discussion with his GM.<br><br>I just got so fed up with the fact that there you are, in the midst of the discussion and you're chasing me to pack up when I would have been done long before your conversation ended?<br><br>Anyway, after I finished packing the stuff, he was still in the midst of discussion and I busied myself with washing the cups, glasss, clearing the mss in the pantry that his staff had made and not cleared before going home.<br><br>Adter I finished everything, I just left the place. It's quite a distance to walk from his unit to the main road and by the time I reached the main road, he had already drove out to meet me.<br><br>He got out of the car and asked me what's wrong, that he wants to send me back. But I just asked him to go home and have dinner with his family, hailed a cab and went off.<br><br>He didn't even try following after the cab, or calling me or smsing me.....<br>It's gotten to the point whereby I'm just unhappy with him but I dunnoe for what. It's not anger anymore, it's not anything I can point out anymore.<br><br>I'm just so tired. Why the hell did I have to be an 'intelligent' ger who wants to help him get his business on the right track? I should have been a dumb stupid ger who is contented to stay at home and not ask him any questions and just keep quiet about everything.<br><br>I should stop doing this soon. I'll just stop after the termination.<br><br></div>

LOL!<br><br>Anyways.. since his business going bust , his staff are eating him out from the inside , his GM is as useless as him.. he is running a loose ship. And since he is not 'smart' enough to read ur interpretations. N dun expect a guy to chase after a cab..  if u hail a cab.. u go.. u go. Even i wont go after the cab.. its pointless at the point when u went into the cab.<br><br>I am not writnig to give advice or anything.. just the sudden urge to reply to this thread.. anyways..<br><br>Pull the plug.. let him sink. N while u are at it..  if i were u , i will shame his @ss in front of all his staff... abuot how badly he is running his ship.. slap him.. and then scold the rest of the staff for him.<br><br>I am sure he is a nice guy..  well, u decide.</div>
