              <p>I'm quite amuse by the fact that you seem to be rather focus on the physical issues in a R/S. That really sounds immature and lack of deeper thought. I would smack the persons behind and bring him/her on a tour of geylang at night to show them that physical intimacy could be bought with a few mere dollars.</p>
              <p>There should be a lot more thought put into the beginning of a R/S. Most of it would be focus on commitment. It is with upmost importance that you recognise the fact that once you are in a r/s, you are to be committed to that someone. You give up the perks of singlehood for the exculsivity of being in a r/s. Some people like the idea and some do not, and thus there is no right or wrong, just different needs.</p>
              <p>For me, sex is a must. I understand myself and know that I have a high sex drive. To me, a r/s without sex will most probably only lead to disaster. Of course, I'm open to objections but I will move on to someone else. For those who disagree with what I have said, I can only tell you that I dun disagree with you but you are just not me.</p>

              <p>hi guys and gals </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i am just wondering... why do a guy and girl decide to go into a
              offical relationship?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i mean... lets say... u and this guy/gal really can communicate
              very well, u guys are happy with each other's company.. to the
              extend of falling for each other.. even confessed to each
              other. but why cant the relationship status remain as
              'best friends' status, but must move on to other level 'BGR' and
              start to call each other bf/gf?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my guess is that with this offical BGR, u guys can start
              touching each other(like hold hands, hug, kiss etc). am i right to
              say that? just asking around for more views on this issue =)</p>

              <p>None of my relationships in the later part of my life were built base on lust. They were all base on love and commitment. There are some where I was two-timed, so I would not say the other party base the relationship on the same values as I do.</p>
              <p>To me, sex is part of commitment. It is my other way of showing commitment and saying "I love you". It is also a way of showing my most inner self to the person that I truly love. I dun share this part with anyone else.</p>
              <p>Believe it or not, my R/S motto has gone from "I want a pretty girlfriend." when I was 12 to "The beginning of a R/S is the beginning of a marriage." now.</p>
