Whatever happen to the old way of gentlemen dating in the olden days where none of this happens? Why? What is happening now? Seriously are most of the single girls now with some kind of mentality issues? You pursue, they run. You confess, they strike you out. In the end, they ended up with someone else.

              <p>Well I wouldnt mind being in london 1854.  Fish and Chips then were made out of Cod and served in newspapers.  YUMMY!. Oh wait right this topic was about gentlemen and girls.  Well ... urm ... to make this reply more to the point...</p>
              <p>Good Fish and Chips go hand in hand with being a Gentleman.  You cannot have one without the other.  So to be a true gentleman, you must first catch a nice Cod, fillet it, dip the slices in flour and beer in the ratio of 2:3 (thats about right... I have a secret ratio ... But Confucius say, master never teach all his tricks) and deep fry in lard (only the best for the date right? I mean she can always work off the calories later with you on the next fishing trip to haul in more Cod.  Hey fishing is tiring work!) Once fish and chips is ready, serve to the girl of your dreams, put on your best british accent and say "Let me get that for you madam" and be the perfect gentleman and help her eat the fish and chips. Leaving some for her is optional.</p>
              <p>Alternatively you could always save yourself the trouble and just be yourself.  No point being super sweet / gentlemanly now and not being able to maintain it.  Sure you'll appear to be the perfect date initially, but inconsistencies will appear and that may very well be a relationship breaker.  Than again if you're a gentleman by nature, then i salute a fellow gentleman (notice how i cunningly praised myself here? mwahahahaha).</p>

              <p><br>You are barking up the wrong door. All I know is that if a girl likes you, she will 100% croone all over you. Most men think that it is a challenge to go after the girls, playing their silly games but what they don't realise is when they do this, they tend to spoil their women. Most men just take the playing games and mind games into their stride. Until they go later into their relationships and found out the true nature of the women; by then the arguments are out and these men decide they have enough.</p>
              <p>To be fair, I don't think gals would do this kind of thing at you unless they genuinely don't like you. If they do genuinely like you, she would be more honest and open. We men got to change our own mentality and start making dates surreal and not let our women behave childlishly. We men also want to see the true nature of the women, we want to know whom we are sharing our lives with. If they constantly play these dumb mind games, we men just gave into their whims and fancies and by the time these gals show their true colours, it is too late. That's why we keep on reading things from TS having second thoughts about their girl friends. This is because we fail to make the proper evaluation. We men just simply go for the rubbish chase (which by the way is no fun at all but very entertaining to the gal). We risk ourselves getting expose to these women and getting ourselves hurt. We also get our hearts played out and made a fool in public.</p>
              <p>It is time we put a stop to this and go for the surreal old fashion dating. I am very sure that there are honest women out there who just wants to go out for a simple dinner or watching movies. No mind games, no telling other people and no playing around. We men want relationships that blossom to marriage. What is the use of playing these games? Nonsense. Mr Cua Soil Lack is married and yet he went for Johor Trists. So what good use is all these games? Are these silly games to prevent their men from betraying them? Are these games made to make the girls feel more highly valued? No. Won't a simple dinner and telephone call would suffice? Don't get me wrong, romance is not wrong. In fact romance is healthy in a relationship. But watch out ! Some games go too far. If we detect any backstabbing, any bad manoevring means this lady is getting people against us. Little bit of game is good so as long as the lady show some care for their men. But if it goes too far and starts to hurt the men, this means that these ladies are out there to only play with your hearts - its either for $$$ or their pride.</p>

              <p><br> You are barking up the wrong door. All I know is that if a girl
              likes you, she will 100% croone all over you. Most men think that
              it is a challenge to go after the girls, playing their silly games
              but what they don't realise is when they do this, they tend to
              spoil their women. Most men just take the playing games and mind
              games into their stride. Until they go later into their
              relationships and found out the true nature of the women; by then
              the arguments are out and these men decide they have enough.</p>
              <p>To be fair, I don't think gals would do this kind of thing at
              you unless they genuinely don't like you. If they do genuinely like
              you, she would be more honest and open. We men got to change our
              own mentality and start making dates surreal and not let our women
              behave childlishly. We men also want to see the true nature of the
              women, we want to know whom we are sharing our lives with. If they
              constantly play these dumb mind games, we men just gave into their
              whims and fancies and by the time these gals show their true
              colours, it is too late. That's why we keep on reading things from
              TS having second thoughts about their girl friends. This is because
              we fail to make the proper evaluation. We men just simply go for
              the rubbish chase (which by the way is no fun at all but very
              entertaining to the gal). We risk ourselves getting expose to these
              women and getting ourselves hurt. We also get our hearts played out
              and made a fool in public.</p>
              <p>It is time we put a stop to this and go for the surreal old
              fashion dating. I am very sure that there are honest women out
              there who just wants to go out for a simple dinner or watching
              movies. No mind games, no telling other people and no playing
              around. We men want relationships that blossom to marriage. What is
              the use of playing these games? Nonsense. Mr Cua Soil Lack is
              married and yet he went for Johor Trists. So what good use is all
              these games? Are these silly games to prevent their men from
              betraying them? Are these games made to make the girls feel more
              highly valued? No. Won't a simple dinner and telephone
              call would suffice? Don't get me wrong, romance is not wrong. In
              fact romance is healthy in a relationship. But watch out ! Some
              games go too far. If we detect any backstabbing, any bad manoevring
              means this lady is getting people against us. Little bit of
              game is good so as long as the lady show some care for their men.
              But if it goes too far and starts to hurt the men, this means that
              these ladies are out there to only play with your hearts - its
              either for $$$ or their pride.</p>
              <p>Be wise to choose whom you want to be with. I am very sure
              that if the gal likes you, she won't mind doing dating
              things your way. If not and if it looks suspicious then she is only
              interested to play a fool out of you and perhaps only want
              expensive presents and your $$$.  </p>

              <p>I agree with the founder of playboy. Be smart and dont throw all your $$ at the girl.  Cos who know? For all you know she may fall in love with your $$ and not you =) Trust me, whilst you can buy your way into somebody's heart, its not something that will sustain a meaningful relationship.</p>
              <p>Go dutch for your outings.  If you want it to be more romantic / gentlemanly, you can go for a slightly uneven split.  For example, if you're going to watch a movie and have dinner, consider which of the 2 will be more expensive and pay for it.  Dinner for 2 will most prob be $50, unless you're eating at Kopitiam/ Fast food. Let the girl pay for the movie tickets + popcorn, which comes up to about $30.</p>

              <p>Can I ask if the gentlemen way of dating girls still exist
              nowadays? It's like whenever I try to treat a girl right, they
              begin to show sense of undesirable behaviour, playing hard to get,
              countless mind games, hot and cold attention on you. Whatever
              happen to the old way of gentlemen dating in the olden days where
              none of this happens? Why? What is happening now? Seriously are
              most of the single girls now with some kind of mentality issues?
              You pursue, they run. You confess, they strike you out. In the end,
              they ended up with someone else. I could use the flirting way too
              but mostly if i could use it, its only for the girls whom im not
              serious about. Someone help me pls.</p>

              <p>it absolutely still exists. its just that you have no idea how to go about it. most of the time, the girls are simply not interested in you and they will never tell you a direct NO to your face and they end up misleading most men.</p>
              <p>dating is war. if you do not have a battleplan, be prepared to get hurt. you need to be guided by those who have done it successfully.</p>
