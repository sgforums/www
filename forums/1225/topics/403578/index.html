              <p>I like this girl from work. From the signs that I got, I feel in love with her. Soon our work finished. We were going our seperate ways, she was off to Uni, and I was off to NS. I had to tell her cause it was now or never. I told her. Learned that only I was in love. I feel being played. Girls!! But I still like her. She told me she doesnt have any feelings for me. Infact, she also told me she wasnt into a relationship. Well, she apologised. You know whats funny, instead of giving me a straight no when I told her I like her. She asked me things like why do you like me when you even don't know me. I tried explaining, but still it all went ashtray. Funny right, its not like I planned for all this to happen. It just happened, I didn't fall for her the first time I saw her, I just liked her after the days. Now, I miss her. I even dreamt about her rejecting me yesterday. </p>
              <p>I want to move on, but I can't. I never met any devil like her, and I sincerely feels she's the one for me. But its a lot complicated that that. </p>

              <p>finish up your NS fast without worrying much about gers for now...in fact u shd be planning for your career (or NUS if u gotten a place) when u r out of army (but by then she would have started working with her degree)...remember guys are always and at least 3 years behind due to the lop sided policies....</p>
              <p>CAREER is what u shd focus now...start to network more and dun miss your comrades in your army....their spirit will help u pull it through with lesser pain..</p>

              <p>Some girls just love to flirt even when they have no real interest in a guy. She wasn't into a relationship is most likely bullshit. she's just not into a relationship with you that's all. If Brad Pitt was in front of her, she would beg him to take her as his girlfriend.</p>
              <p>Its never any female's style to give a direct NO. They will give you all sorts of stupid excuses or whoopers but never the real reason which is "i don't find you attractive and i'm not interested in you at all"</p>
              <p>Rejection doubles the rejectee's interest. The more you can't get it, the more you want it. Human nature.</p>
              <p>You feel like she's the one for you. But she feels like you are not the one for her. Love is a two way street.</p>
              <p>My advice is for you to start approaching other girls. Once you are interested in other girls, your interest for her will soon vanish.</p>
              <p>Don't call her a devil. Most women are like that. You should not rely on or blame others but yourself. You need to equip yourself with the knowledge of handling women, once you have that, you will never be confused or get into a position where you suffer in pain.</p>

              <p>thanks guys! although we've met on a few other occations with my colleagues, i never showed her that im fond of her or anything like that. i'm keeping things on the low note now &amp;&amp;, i feel i should yea focus on ns, and stuffs like that. maybe the phase i had had with her will work but on practicality, ill focus on revamping myself.</p>
              <p>she such a flirt la, she was asking me if i had abs, not mockingly cos i was mocking my friend about his "United Nations" &amp; i partially do!</p>
