              <p>Counselor M. Gary Neuman surveyed 200 cheating and noncheating husbands to get at the real reasons behind men's infidelity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="yperContentPara"><em>What
              makes men cheat?</em> Marriage counselor M. Gary Neuman dug
              through past research on male infidelity and found that most answers
              came from the wife's point of view. "Wouldn't it make more sense to ask
              the guys?" he thought. So for his new book, "<a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?r=1&amp;EAN=9780470114636">The
              Truth About Cheating</a>," Neuman surveyed 200 cheating and
              noncheating husbands to get at the real reasons behind men's infidelity
              -- including what cheating men say could have prevented them from
              straying. Here, some of his findings:</div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><em class="subhead">48% of men rated emotional dissatisfaction as the primary reason they cheated.</em></strong></p>
              <div class="yperContentPara">So
              much for the myth that for men, cheating is all about physical
              intimacy: Only 8 percent of men said that physical dissatisfaction was
              the main factor in their infidelity. "Our culture tells us that all men
              need to be happy is to have physical intimacy with someone," Neuman
              says. "But men are emotionally driven beings too. They want their wives
              to show them that they're appreciated, and they want women to
              understand how hard they're trying to get things right." The problem is
              that men are less likely than women to express these feelings, so you
              won't always know when your guy is in need of a little affirmation.
              "Most men consider it unmanly to ask for a pat on the back, which is
              why their emotional needs are often overlooked," Neuman says. "But you
              can create a marital culture of appreciation and thoughtfulness -- and
              once you set the tone, he's likely to match it."</div>
              <div class="yperContentPara"><br></div>
              <p><strong><em class="subhead">66% of cheating men report feeling guilt during the affair.</em></strong></p>
              <div class="yperContentPara">The
              implications are a little scary: It isn't just uncaring jerks who
              cheat. In fact, 68 percent of cheaters never dreamed they'd be
              unfaithful, and almost all of them wished they hadn't done it, Neuman
              says. Clearly, guilt isn't enough to stop a man from cheating. "Men are
              good at compartmentalizing feelings," Neuman explains. "They can hold
              on to their emotions and deal with them later." So even if your partner
              swears he would never cheat, don't assume it can't happen. It's
              important for both of you to take steps toward creating the
              relationship you want.</div>
              <div class="yperContentPara"><br></div>
              <p><strong><em class="subhead">77% of cheating men have a good friend who cheated.</em></strong></p>
              <div class="yperContentPara">
              <div class="contentPullQuoteRight">
              <div id="yperContentPullQuoteRight_43" class="vwmod">
              <div class="bd"></div>
              <div class="ft"></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div class="yperContentPara">Hanging around friends who stray
              makes cheating seem normal and legitimizes it as a
              possibility. The message he's subconsciously telling
              himself: "My friend is a good guy who happens to be cheating on his
              wife. I guess even the best of us do it." You can't simply ban your
              husband from hanging out with Mr. Wandering Eyes, Neuman says, but you
              can request that they spend their time together in an environment that
              offers less temptation, like at a sporting event or a restaurant for
              lunch rather than at a bar or club. Another strategy: Build your social
              circle around happily married couples that share your values -- it'll
              create an environment that supports marriage.</div>
              <div class="yperContentPara"><br></div>
              <p><strong><em class="subhead">40% of cheating men met the other woman at work.</em></strong></p>
              <div class="yperContentPara">"Oftentimes
              the woman he cheats with at the office is someone who praises him,
              looks up to him, and compliments his efforts," Neuman says. "That's
              another reason why it's so critical that he feel valued at home."
              Luckily, there's a clear warning sign that your husband is getting a
              little too cozy with a colleague: If he praises or mentions the name of
              a female coworker more than he would a male counterpart, your antennae
              should go up -- and it's time for the two of you to set boundaries
              about what is and isn't okay at work, Neuman says. Is it acceptable for
              him to work late if it's only him and her? Can they travel together to
              conferences? Have dinners out to discuss a project? Ask him what he'd
              feel comfortable with you doing with a male colleague.</div>
              <div class="yperContentPara"><br></div>
              <p><strong><em class="subhead">Only 12% of cheating men said their mistress was more physically attractive than their wife.</em></strong></p>
              <div class="yperContentPara">In
              other words, a man doesn't stray because he thinks he'll get lucky with
              a better-looking body. "
              <div class="contentPullQuoteRight">
              <div id="yperContentPullQuoteRight_59" class="vwmod">
              <div class="bd"></div>
              <div class="ft"></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div class="yperContentPara">In most cases, he's cheating to fill an emotional
              void," Neuman says. "He feels a connection with the
              other woman, and physical intimacy comes along for the ride." If you're
              worried about infidelity, focus on making your relationship more loving
              and connected, not on getting your body just right or mastering how to
              please him physically. (But know that physical intimacy does matter --
              it's one of the key ways your guy expresses his love and feels close to
              you, so be sure to keep it a priority.)</div>
              <div class="yperContentPara"><br></div>
              <p><strong><em class="subhead">Only
              6% of cheating men had physical intimacy with a woman after meeting her
              that same day or night.</em></strong></p>
              <div class="yperContentPara">Actually, 73
              percent of men got to know the other woman for more than a month before
              they cheated. This means that you may have time to see the warning
              signs before infidelity occurs -- you might even see it coming before
              he does. Keep an eye out for these common signals: He spends more time
              away from home, stops asking for physical intimacy, picks fights more
              frequently, or avoids your calls. Your gut reaction may be to confront
              him, but most men will deny even thinking about cheating, especially if
              nothing physical has occurred yet. Instead, Neuman suggests, take
              charge of what you can control -- your own behavior -- and take the
              lead in bringing your relationship to a better place. Don't hesitate to
              show your appreciation for him, prioritize time together, and initiate
              affection more. Give him a reason to keep you at the front of his mind,
              Neuman says. And be open about how you feel about what's going on
              between the two of you (again, without mentioning any third parties).
              Try "I think we've started to lose something important in our
              relationship, and I don't want it to disappear." In the meantime,
              commit to keeping tabs on your relationship and doing what it takes to
              keep it working for you.</div>
