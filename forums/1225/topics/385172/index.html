              <p>Heres a little change of subject which might suit everyone including volunteers who run this place. Yes.. even them need the warmth of woman sometimes.<br><br>Women in Singapore are the by product of the education system. Singaporean men need to understand, but not get angry, is that the more educated a women is, the more she is likely to express herself boldly. <br><br>Ego plays a very important part in the mindset of a woman. She needs to know she can handle herself as well as her male counterparts. Therefore, if you wish to understand us women more, you need to know her egoistical points. To understand your 'enemy' means you have half the battle won.</p>
              <p>I know girls will hate me for this but this is for the better for our home grown boys.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1) Be yourself.</span></strong> <br>Now, this myth is self-defeating. Women like us, love sprouting this deceptive term. It is to put the man off guard.<br><br>'To be yourself' actually means 'to be the man' and doesn't mean being that lazy slob you are when nobodys at home. It also means, if a guy is willing to take stride in the way he woes his woman, is certainly going to get her.<br><br>Girls secretly love guys who have a dating circle, it means he's comfortable with dating women, although it might spell a comitment problem, it's still a positive trait girls secretly look out for.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2) Bad boys.</span></strong><br>Women love bad boys not because they beat us (which most nice guys focus on) but they provide a much more muscline choice compared to those who consider themselves as 'nice guys'. The bad thing that comes with bad boys is bad attitude and bad outcome. <br><br>Imagine a badboy in his 40's... not the same as badboy in his 20's. Same person ...bad lifetime choice.<br><br>But fret not. Even nice guys can be bad boys. All 'nice guy' needs to be or to do is be bold. <br><br>You've wintess us going gaga over a hearthrob, whith some muscle definition and still call him 'nice guy''. Yes, this is the type of nice guy a girl wants. Someone who is bold and nice. Not the ones we label 'nice guy' and have him as a friend forever.<br><br>So the idea is to be a bad boy who is nice and gentlemanly ..to us. Yes it's complicated but that's they way it is.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3) Looks</span></strong><br>Her body is everything to her. It also means her 'market value' in the dating world. And also because we know guys like to hump great bodies. So tell us we have great legs, although we know you'd rather check out our headlights. <br><br>So it would be good if a guy takes care of his body too. Work out alittle and keep clean. No girl goes gaga over a fat boy. We 'settle' for fatboys.<br><br>Fat women who like being fat have their own personal agenda which I do not know how to comment on. :)<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4) Money</span></strong><br>Money separates the gold diggers from true partners. Never flaunt your wealth excessively. If you do, you will attract women who are accustom to wealth. <br><br>Women who are single and 'high maintenence' are your worse investments. You need to keep her satisfied so that she can be sane. If you're suddenly broke, she go nuts and you'll go nuts too.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5) White Men</span></strong><br>There's nothing to worry about them. A woman who has a whitefetish or suddenly have a whiteboyfriend will not appear or reappear in your dating circle. Women who are up and about in your dating circle are better choices.<br><br>Women who openly declare 'sorry I date whitemen only because Singapore men are ....' sounds really stupid and ignorant to a white woman. A reject needs a reject.<br><br>The problem with women who date white men, is culture. If she marries him, someone has to make a life sacrificing choice of moving away fomr or to Singapore.<br><br>Make friends with our white friends, be it male or female. You'll have a better feel of things.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6) Sex</span></strong><br>Women who say 'men only have sex on their minds' are hypocrites. We all love sex even if we do not know it yet. <br><br><br>Have a great day!</p>
