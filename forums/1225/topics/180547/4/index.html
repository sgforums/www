And she has hope! And hopefully we are mutually interested.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>I'm quite sensitive when it comes to dates...mainly because of the implication. Usually dates will be sign of interest already(ahh...old fashion me). So, i seldom go on 'dates', but funny thing is. I always encourage me friends to go on dates and check things out.<br>So far, i haven't have experience liking a plump girl. And it's not about her size...just didn't happen to find one who attracts me.<br>I've rejected slim pretty girls as well...simply because they couldn't pass the chemistry and communication department. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Looks are secondary compared to maturity and character.<br>But how a guy can overcome it largely depends on himself.<br>In looks and size, it's in the matter of time people change and lose what they have held on so tightly.<br>These things will fade...<br><br>_______<br><br>Honestly, the most important question i would ask before engaging in dates or relationship is -<br>How long can this relationship last even when worst case scenario arises.<br>eg. if she have had an accident and her face is scarred and she's unable to walk.<br>It would be a test for me, in fact...i did make that decision to continue a relationship which i know will hurt me in the end. I was given two options and i chose her. But the 4 years worth didn't work out...unfortunately.<br><br>To me...if i dared to consider the worst case in my relationship and i would keep to it**<br>Don't see what's the obstacle with weight.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>BUT!!! It all depends...whether slim or plump....it all depends.<br><br>**i'm not sure if i dared to promise that again, that thought was only meant for that particular girl.
