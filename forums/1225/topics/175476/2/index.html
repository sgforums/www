            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, Sorry. Not used to having to jio girls again.. Only theory left in me..<br><br>Alright: Bladezy, if a girl you just know is v comfy with you ie she beeches a lot to you not long after you meet her and esp in 1 to 1 situations you'd know she likes you. However, in your case she doesn't, so you know there's still half the battle of attraction to win.<br><br>So now your problem is that the atmosphere is pretty uptight between the two of you. You really have to ask yourself why this is so. I get the feeling she isn't a fling for you but someone you'd wanna try out as a potential soulmate. I've read your sunset post and you'd fit into the "nice guy" catogery who won't date a girl casually and think nothing of it when you mutter "i love you" to a girl just to see her reaction. (Yes i do that, just sent that to one of my new friends on sms then smacked her w that joke as a reply to a fwd'd msg hehehe)<br><br>The thing i wanna ask you is before you start to worry about techniques, and about materials you wanna take to battle and impress her is that WHY you like her? Are you certain she's the one for you? Why is that so? I can see everyone in this thread's pretty much helping you on the technical side so i'd play the councillor here. Why is this girl so important? If you're looking for a soulmate you've gotta already have something in common or some special bond you recognize between the two of you. Otherwise it might be puppy love creeping up on ya, making you wet your pants. No offense meant though.<br><br>Anyway, just to contribute some to the thread, what are the things you share in common with her that makes your current friendship with her so special? Is this something felt mutually? If so shouldn't you take the initiative and whack topics from there? You said video games, but i get the feeling you didnt bank alot into it in conversation ie you touched based but didnt get a very encouraging reply from her. This could b because she's really not as interested as you've guessed or you still haven't learnt her turn on points and draw her out to be comfy with you. Btw, pls don't try the sunset thing, your groundwork isn't done you're sure to F up. =) Bide your time and we'd help you get ready bro =)<br><br>On a side note, yep, hardly any guys think that "she's boring and can't talk" anymore. That's a sign of confidence, or lackof for that matter. You've gotta start thinking that though your quarry is a catch, you can be one too. And start giving yourself some credit and respect. Do you think you deserve to be loved &amp; respected by some girl if you don't love &amp; respect yourself first? Not asking you to be sexually ravenous, but to start thinking positively of yourself. You have a lot of thinking to go through I can tell, that's why people say you're dense. You're not "dumb" you just haven't found yourself &amp; your resolve with regards to women. What makes you tick inside really? People who are really comfortable and confident attract others because they have an energetic aura, charisma, about them. Where's yours? If you aren't focused within, nothing special will come without. PS. people who are really comfy &amp; confident are so based on inner convictions and not what they achieve or who their friends are. So yea, you have a lot of thinking to do.<br><br>On a side note, you can try reading my incomplete article "the formula to relationships" think last post was june 2k5 so it's archived, but still on the first page of Dating Advice, though at the bottom.</div>
