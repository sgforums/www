              <p>Besides, a degree is no more than a printed piece of paper, it serves a sole purpose of causing the destruction of poor random innocent trees. </p>

              <p>LKY thinks that people with uni degrees should marry pple with uni degrees. He even came up with a graduate mother's scheme. Really wtf...</p>
              <p>Basically, when extremely young, a degree gives the false illusion that this person will be successful in life, and thus able to provide a comfortable life. <br>But when older, you will realise that the ability to provide a comfortable life to your spouse will reign, whether you have a degree a not. So what if you are a ITE grad? If you can produce a $250k annual salary, you win any uni degree hands down any day.</p>
              <p>You might say is money is not everything; it's all about love. But come back to reality: you cannot survive on love alone, you cannot depend on love to bring you your basic necessities in life. A serious relationship is a long term committment where you forsee your counterpart as the person you will spend the rest of your life with. Put yourself in the shoes of a female: would you prefer someone who cannot bring back the bread home most of the time?</p>
