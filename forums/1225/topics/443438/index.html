                              <p>I'll go straight to the point. I know that communication is
              important between two people in a relationship.Knowing this, I made
              sure that my relationship had no communication problems. When
              I had doubts or insecurities, I'll tell him about it.</p>
              <p>I admit that I had a lot of insecurities in this
              relationship.This is because I am a girl.I take the initiative ALL
              the time. Meeting time, venue ,activity. And when there was any
              problem in the relationship, I was the one who will take the
              inititaive to clear the mess. After a year and a half, it became
              disturbing for me. I began to wonder if he really likes me,if this
              is a one-sided relationship.</p>
              <p>Yes, i told him about what I typed above. But he still doesn't
              take the initiative.It doesn't work. We don't even meet every two
              weeks.He doesn't bother to call or text me at all.How can I not be
              insecure?I end up compromising for him most of the time.Like,I sent
              him home when I was supposed to be studying for promos.</p>
              <p>[luckily, my results were fine, but it wasn't as good as it shld
              be]</p>
              <p>I broke up with him. 700+ days down the drain. The breakup
              lasted &lt;5min.</p>
              <p>Me: lets break up</p>
              <p>Him:ok,expressionless</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>.....so girls shouldn't take initiative, huh?</p>

              Hey I guess you're just with a guy that don't really know how to treasure you as his girlfriend, allow me to say something though. Give time time and you'll get over him over sometime, life is short to be upset over this kind of jerk and once you get over him, I believe that you'll find someone way better than him and someone who knows how to treasure you and treat properly as a girlfriend.Cheers.

              <p>Agree with you, and the same thing happened to me, its just vice versa,  I always thought why couldn't she even seem to care when it all started out well in the first place. Now I have to do everything in order to keep the relationship healthy until i realized that when only one person commits into a relationship it is already unhealthy and waste of time.</p>

              <p>Time will totally heal you if you're going to leave him, but it depends if he wishes to get back on to his feet and take care of you, mutural understanding is necessary</p>

              <p>It seems like he didn't put in a lot of time or effort into the relationship, so it's not surprising that he had no qualms about breaking up. On the other hand, you're very much hurt for all the things you've done for him being unreciprocated.</p>
              <p>I know you're upset, and it's the I-have-done-everything-right-but-why-does-it-still-end-up-this-way kind of upset. It's not a bad thing to take the initiative, but have you ever thought that if you're doing it all the time, he may not have enough opportunities to play his part in the relationship?</p>
              <p>Instead of doing everything on your own, have you tried proding and trusting him to do some of it (and also not ending up doing it for him if he's not doing it himself)? Maybe he did try taking the initiative before, but you had unintentionally put him down and discouraged him from doing so (it's possible given that you're pretty strong-headed, or at least that's how you appear to me).</p>
              <p>Anyway, the relationship is over. Spend some time thinking about what else might have went wrong and make sure not to make the same mistakes in your next relationship. Then get over it. Just know that there will always be a guy out there waiting for you to appear in his life.</p>
