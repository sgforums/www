              <p class="western" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;">Recently, I found myself seated next to two Singaporean guys on a flight from Thailand to Singapore. They were having a very loud two hour-long conversation, and after trying in vain to read a book I’d brought I gave up trying to block out their voices.</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;">Guy A was distraught about the fact that he was unable to upkeep his materialistic girlfriend. Despite the fact that she had quit her job and expected him to give her an allowance, he was determined to keep the relationship going. Guy B shook his head sadly and agreed that in Singapore, you need money to solve all your problems. He then helped his friend to think of a speech to rattle off to his girlfriend in order to placate her.</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;">I’ll admit that this conversation made me lose a little bit more of my faith in Singapore society. Are relationships here nothing more than a pragmatic calculation of dollars and cents? Here are some reasons why it often seems that way.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;"> </p>
              <h4 class="western" style="font-size: 14.04px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;"><strong>Goal-oriented society</strong></h4>
              <p class="western" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;">Singaporeans are relentlessly goal-oriented. Few people these days do anything without first asking what’s in it for them. Blame it on a cut-throat education system where students only take subjects they know they can score in, or the exhausting rat race people constantly run so they can afford their Chanels and Audis, and it’s easy to see why there’s simply no time to sit back and enjoy things for what they are.</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;">The same thing happens in many relationships here. Guy B cheerfully informed Guy A that his wife had charted out a plan for them early in the relationship—ballot for a flat, get married by 28 and have the first kid by 30. Her next goal was to become a housewife by 40.</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;">Our goal-driven mentalities leave little room for the flexibility to simply experience or feel out a relationship. Instead, people constantly ask themselves what goals they can achieve with a potential relationship. I’ve had friends who were grilled about their desire for childrearing on a first date. If you’re already going to have a list of boxes to tick, why not just stipulate a minimum salary for your future spouse, and throw in a car and condo to go with it?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;"> </p>
              <h4 class="western" style="font-size: 14.04px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;"><strong>People are desperate to move out of their parents’ homes</strong></h4>
              <p class="western" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;">There are few developed countries in the world where one’s living situation is so closely tied to when and whom they marry. Thanks to the rule that only singles aged 35 and above are allowed to purchase HDB property and the astronomical prices of private property and rent here, many couples see marriage as the only way to move out of their parents’ homes.</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;">In addition, couples who have already downpaid or collected the keys to their property are <span style="color: #000080;"><span lang="zxx"><a style="color: #005790;" href="http://www101.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10321p.nsf/w/BuyResaleFlatFFScheme?OpenDocument">given 6 months to tie the knot</a></span></span> or face a big monetary loss if they decide to bow out of the relationship. I have several friends who broke up and lost their deposits. Many others decide to go ahead with the marriage because they’ve already invested so much in it financially, even if they are no longer emotionally invested in their partners.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;"> </p>
              <h4 class="western" style="font-size: 14.04px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;"><strong>Traditional gender roles</strong></h4>
              <p class="western" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;">Despite the fact that Singapore’s female workforce participation is very high, and there isn’t a terribly huge discrepancy in wages, we are still by and large a very conservative society.</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;">Long working hours and a work culture that is generally family unfriendly makes it increasingly difficult for women to get ahead in their careers and look after the family at the same time. It doesn’t help that men are still not pulling their weight in the child-rearing and housekeeping department.</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;">Conversely, many women still believe that the man should be earning more than them, and many men reciprocate by being overly defensive when their earning power is challenged or when faced with women who earn more than them. Of course not everybody is like that, but it’s not an uncommon phenomenon.</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;">With outmoded values like the above, it’s no wonder women continue to look to men as being the providers.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;"> </p>
              <h4 class="western" style="font-size: 14.04px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;"><strong>No social safety net</strong></h4>
              <p class="western" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;">While we’re not as bad as Hong Kong (yet), there’s no denying that it’s tough surviving in Singapore if you don’t make much money. With a weak social safety net, those unlucky enough to fall through the cracks find themselves struggling to feed themselves and pay their medical bills in old age.</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;">This weak social safety net incentivises people to marrying for money. It’s easy for people in Scandinavian countries to marry for love when they know all their needs will be taken care of in future.</p>
              <p class="western" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px; text-align: justify;">We might not be a third world country where women are left with no choice but to see marriage as a ticket out of starvation. But thanks to the feelings of fear and insecurity society here breeds, we might as well be.</p>

              <p>This is a good article and a plesant read. There are some fair point in terms of what is causing the society to react this way. Think about what you see when you are in the CBD area, sky scraper and luxury. It is a constant reminder of what is deemed successful as a person and that is the goal that is sold to us of the goal oriented society. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">It is human to always aspire for something better than what we currently have. Singapore had manage to take this unique scenario and make it to their favor. Think about this, as a society. It is a good goal to have. It is they singular reason why Singapore progresses. If everyone want to be "rich" then they will work hard to be "rich". If everyone in the country is working to be "rich" the country as a whole will be "rich". </span></p>
              <p>On a society level, this is good when measured in terms of over wealth. But on an individual level, you have people making life decision based on money. This is always a continuous balancing act, but I don't think the situation is so dire.</p>
              <p>Firstly, yes as a whole there are lots of people driven by money when it comes to love. But there are also those that are not. So the solution is to find those that are not.</p>
              <p>Usually, you can have a good gauage of people by the type of people they hang out with. Is the group continuously comparing against one another? e.g "hey look at what my boyfriend bought me". Or is the group supporting each other.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">In summary. Yes Singapore society is setup in a way where there are materialistic people. But there are those that are not as well. Go hang out with those that are not.</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">  </span></p>
