              <p>I knew this girl way back. Never talked to her upon seeing her then when we'were on the same campus. But since then after we departed, she made the effort to add me. This was couple years back. Then we talked and all. I kind of figured she likes me, so slowly started to go wayward and not talk to her at all. Then she sent me a message out of frustration; she hates me and that was it. Deleted me off facebook and msn and all that.</p>
              <p>Then after a while, about a year later. She adds me back. Not trying to be rude, I ask her how she is, feeling guilty abt the past that I never really asked her out or that I had never explained to her about my commitments.</p>
              <p>She tells me she'has no idea who I'm. Randomly added her. So I told her abt the past, yet she's so stubborn abt not knowing anything.</p>
              <p>Now, I'm like what the fuck!! Now she has a chance to date me, and she's ignoring everything. Why are girls so stubborn?? Then again, at least I don't feel guilty anymore cos I feel if I ever went out with her, it wouldn't have been worth it. Now, she's acting like a total stranger.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is she psycho?? haha</p>

              <p><br>She made effort to add u, and then wanted to meet up, which u aeroplane her.</p>
              <p>For whatever reason u didnt make it, obviously had an impact on her on how/what she percieves you to be and her opinion on the whole situation.</p>
              <p>There is possibilities that she forgot about u, or she doesnt want to remember u. Cause whatever it is, obviously the failed meet up did add weight to her opinion on you now.</p>
              <p>N now u say no point meeting up here cause its never worth it.</p>

              <p>We need to snap out of this dreadful mentality where we think that there is only one special girl for us and if she doesn't like us, then our whole world comes crashing down...blame it on media, stupid idiotic love songs and valentine's day which should rightfully be called "National Desperate Supplicator's Masturbators Day".</p>
              <p>After seeing what happened to a lot of my friends get affected by women and ex-GFs, I have a very different view altogether of the female species... :{  Not negative but not positive either...</p>
