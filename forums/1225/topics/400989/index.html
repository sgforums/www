              <p>No advice on your potential progress because U do not know anything from her and therefore basically told us nothing...how to give advice?</p>
              <p>If U really want some comments...I presume that by "relationship"...its with marriage in view.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>1. wedding dinner....singapore...china(might be more than 1 city)...</p>
              <p>2. best for her to be able to stay on in SG on her own merit...ie....tertiary-educated...</p>
              <p>3. if U work in govt-related job...might have a problem with background check.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that's all I can think of for now...now after lunch...Z-monster coming...ZzzZzz</p>

              <p>thanks for the reply Xcert</p>
              <p>I am not talking about wedding in perspective. Just a serious relationship. She has university education from China. She lives with her sister husband family.</p>
              <p>I am not experience in dating and girlfriend thing, and also the issue of love. Sometimes, i wonder people love for sex more or clickability more or for own self esteem. That is the issue I am asking myself as i try to move our relationship closer.</p>
              <p>Perhaps i will not find her suitable and vice versa as time passes. Through our communication for that day, i find that we have matching or at least not so conflicting beliefs in areas of money, love and general lifestyles. And we can chat quite smoothly, unlikes some of my memories of my past dates.. haha..</p>
              <p>In this one, i can sense there was mutual interest in each other conversation, at least compared to some of my past dates.</p>

              <p>i believe some idiot will soon post rubbish like</p>
              <p>" u just wan to bonk her or u serious in love with her ? "</p>
              <p>anyway back to your topic, im currently in 1 relationship with a china gal as well</p>
              <p>preopely can say im in the same suitation like u but advance cause we are already together</p>
              <p>she now back in china. Man this type of relationship is stess for when she goes back in china, unless u have QQ and she got computer, its really a torture when u can see her so soooooo manys days. life is tuff when u cannot see the 1 u love.</p>
              <p>i spend about $24 a month on internatonal call cards a month to talk to her about 1/2h to 1h everyday.</p>
              <p>she can only stay 2 months and off singapore for 2 months  if u wan to apply visit pass for her.  the period when she is in china for 2 months is a torture and the cost will also be high for u. but if u are rich then its ok. </p>
              <p>she cannot work and its also hard for her to work if u come to this point that she comes every 2 months to meet u.</p>
              <p>well u will experiance more torture to come with international relationship</p>

              All I can say is dating is totally different from marrying a china girl.
              
              I have seen a few bad cases already so all I can say is, good luck in dating.

              <p>I do have female PRC friends. Most of them belong to the upper social class in China. Most of their fathers are rich businessman and 1 of them lives in a penthouse. They party almost every weekends when they are in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Basically, money is very important to them.</p>

              <p>marry a PRC woman ??? you might as well take your chances with a black mamba !</p>
              <p>unless the PRC girl is from super rich family and far far richer than you so you got nothing to lose, better to skip all other PRC girls !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so far the greatest horror story i've heard of PRC girl is this one : -</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>* Austrian man and family go to Shanghai to live/work</p>
              <p>* Austrian man has affair and divorced wife before marrying PRC girl.</p>
              <p>* Austrian man pay for living expenses and other expenses for girl's family and relatives.</p>
              <p>* PRC girl was actually having affair with her cousin right from day 1 before even meeting Austrian man.</p>
              <p>* PRC girl suspected of Austrian man's murder and steals all his money from bank a/c and investments.</p>
              <p>* PRC girl then tries to steal Austrian man's trust funds for his Austrian children by claiming in court that the children were not his.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>moral of the story : why let a PRC girl destroy your life when you can do it yourself? LOL</p>

              <p>Hi, i am in late twenty and i am currently knowing one Chinese girl of similar age also. I like her after the first meeting and is trying to know her more often. She is here on working pass of some sort and her elder sister is married to singaporean.</p>
              <p>We can talked quite well to each other in the first meeting, though i do not know how well she thinks of our potential progress. Any advice about our potential progress?</p>
              <p>It is still early to talk about getting into a relationship but i hope to make it work out although she is working here only cos i think all these things are trivial stuff. important thing is that we can click then i will want to be with her.</p>

              <p><br>So far, you are doing well. Date her more. You can check with her interest first. If she is an outdoor person and like nature. Perhaps, you can arrange some outing to some mother nature. Thru more outing , you can find out trival matter and understand more of her before you finally commited to woo her and know she is the real correct one for you.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In response to Hwaimeng - For my case,
                  ( I am not sure about these china people working in singapore stuff),
                  the girl seems to be working all along when she is in Singapore at
                  various jobs. She is on some visa which needs renewal plus her
                  parents are actually also in Singapore living with sister husband
                  family(yup, its squeezing in her house I heard). She seems like
                  staying In singapore in pernament basis from what i gather.
                  Personally, if it is like yours where the girl is on off come here
                  come there, I think i cannot accept also.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">She is not materialistic type i see,
                  because the mannerism cannot faked one. Another thing i like about
                  her although she is from China is that at least she can understand my
                  written english, though she did not speak english in that outing. She
                  can read english in general but not high level or rich vocabulary
                  like Singaporean girls. She can read out english but i guesss its not smooth english.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">She is also polite and demure type, so
                  I am not afraid of stories of PRC ladies who are scheming or
                  murderous type. In our conversation, she said she dun mind public
                  transport and she is not spendthrift. She once also asked :”so what
                  age are you planning to get married?” and i answered to me marriage
                  is not compulsory thing. She did not react</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">adversly and thinks that nowadays
                  people are more liberal and also not insistence on marriage.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Thus, i found her thi<span lang="zxx">nking
                  to be more liberal and understanding. However, i also guessed that
                  for demure and filal lady like her, she would not probably be with
                  people like me who does not choose the conventional route. But, fuck
                  lah... go one step and see how she will behave lah.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span lang="zxx">She is also
                  understanding and not materialistic because during that meeting, we
                  eat two times and both is foodcourt stuff which she seems okay about
                  it. I paid for meals and she got thanked me.. she also did not seem
                  to insist that i should pay kind of mentality. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span lang="zxx">At this very early
                  stage, i feel that she is quite good and decent girl to commit a long
                  term relationship, but have worries about cultural differences. Her
                  family finacial status is so so. Sister and hubby earn decent amount
                  but got family and also spend well also, so like not saving alot.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span lang="zxx">I primarily concern
                  about she and me, which i think should be the case, on whether we both fit or now, left right center bottom. If fit, other problems can be solved. There maybe
                  hiccups which cos cause sudden rupture to the relationship and i am
                  mentally prepared for it. Anyway, lets just wait and see. Right now, despite not being prepared for such international relationship , espeically for a dummy/noob like me in relationship, I got a strong suspicion she fits me rather well based on the above observations.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Above all, I also find it interesting for 2 people from different background to get together(being positive here), and sort of cherish such opportunity. Before meeting her, my belief is actually preference for singaporean girls because better to have more similarities and allows for smoother communication. Lastly, I am not the rich person at all.</p>

              <p>refer to http://www.singstat.gov.sg/stats/keyind.html#note2 for some statistics of Singapore.  I think and research before I post something with substantial evidence and support as my back up.</p>
              <p>The normal marriagable age in Singapore is 21 years old. Take a look at the number of 21 years old local girls who are yet to be married, again I emphasize on yet to be married, I didn't state anything about them having boyfriends, it's not against the law to marry a girl with a boyfriend but it's against the law to marry a girl with a husband.</p>
              <p>Singapore hasn't reached the stage where the ratio of females to males is extremely low.</p>
