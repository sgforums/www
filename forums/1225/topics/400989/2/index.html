              <p>Hi, i am in late twenty and i am currently knowing one Chinese girl of similar age also. I like her after the first meeting and is trying to know her more often. She is here on working pass of some sort and her elder sister is married to singaporean.</p>
              <p>We can talked quite well to each other in the first meeting, though i do not know how well she thinks of our potential progress. Any advice about our potential progress?</p>
              <p>It is still early to talk about getting into a relationship but i hope to make it work out although she is working here only cos i think all these things are trivial stuff. important thing is that we can click then i will want to be with her.</p>

              <p>I think the topic has been hijacked abit from my intended aim.</p>
              <p>Anyway, i went out with her a second time for a breakfast, a short meeting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was smooth, although no sparks flew. I think she felt so-so about me so far. There was not much hint that she like me. One potential problem i forsee is that she is chinese speaking, though she know some english, while I am better at english language. All my chimer language and ideas is thought and spoken in english . Thus this factor is quite a hindrance for me because it means that we cannot communicate deeply enough due to our differences.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, while this is a disadvantage, I will still want to meet her and hope that i can be her boyfriend.</p>

              <p>Updates</p>
              <p>had another meeting recently, much longer meeting and we went out walk walk abit. and also eat. There were indeed differences, like how china chinese , seem to be more straighforward and fierce than singaporeans. I have observe about these things in few china chinese, for women ones at least, including this one, hence the generalization of idea on them.</p>
              <p>I have opininated about this with her, and there was a non-heated discussion about this observation i had.</p>
              <p>Overall, the mood of the outing was not awkward. it was nice but there was not much interest from her on me. She seems just like treating me more of the platonic kind of friends.</p>
              <p>She does not expect me to treat, but she was rather too concern about hygenie eating out, which I thought is like that one in outside food. But these are not overriding concerns.</p>
              <p>We also talked about thriftness and our opinions diverges. She thinks that earning more money is more important than saving little money, which i find is opposite because earning more money is more difficult and also brings some undesirable effects generally speaking, so it is not more important than thriftiness skill</p>
              <p>In the end, I still like her though as i said, she seems neutral about me. I have some idea how to touch her heart. But in this journey, i am still pondering on the nature and purpose of love, courtship and sex. While grasping with the rules and truth of these, I believe, for one thing at least, is that she is someone I must make her my partner.</p>
