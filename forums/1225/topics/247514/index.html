            <div class='col-md body'>took me sometime before i decided to post this. here goes...<br><br>there is this girl whom i have known for sometime. always going out with her, chatting, spending quality time. i was beside her when she was at her lowest point, shared her woes and happiness, basically spend plenty of time together with her for the best part of the last 9 months. she is someone who shares the same values as i do, viewpoints in life, lifestyle, hobbies, likes and dislikes. she understands me, fills up every gap that is missing in my life. in a sense, almost everything i could ask for.<br><br>then there is another girl whom i have known for sometime. i don't go out with her as regularly, but i was always around her. when she needed help, i could help her. when she needed to whine, i listen to her whinings. i am happy, cos i was part of her life. this girl is someone who has the same frequency as i do, but we share different lifestyles,different views on life, different goals, sometimes different viewpoints. she is not as caring, understanding and capable as the first girl, but somehow i got attracted by her zest in life. she always seem so happy, vibrant, beautiful.we went out a couple of times before, but everytime it seems so odd? i don't know, the feeling when i go out with her is not as strong when i go out with the first girl.<br><br>the thing about this situation is that i do like the second girl, but i know that somehow, we won't be together as couples even though i like her.<br>some people once said,"You don't have to be with someone just because you like them". i think its pretty true. at the moment, i would love the situation to stay, i.e chatting with her once in a while, have dinner, meet up once in a while, help her in everyway i can. but i am afraid i might lose control and do something silly like telling her i like her, which will probably stop us from meeting as regularly.<br><br>truth be told, i ever tried to like the first girl. she seems so perfect for my life, everything i have been looking for in my life she has provided me with. i really wanted this to work out, but somehow when i ask her, it didn't go as well as plan. reason being i probably like the second girl more than the first girl. feelings can't lie. i tried to be selfish just for this once and yet it still didn't work out.<br><br>yes, feelings can't lie. its really tiring to think about the second girl all the time, knowing that nothing will bear fruit from all those thoughts of her.<br>for the first girl, i am afraid she will start to like me. the signs are starting to show. i am afraid because i cannot reciprocate the love even though i try.<br><br>all i can say is, ke xi bu shi ni.</div>
