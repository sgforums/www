Its true to certain extent....Cos somehow..will feel paiseh de....<br><br>I think different case differnt outcome. It depends on both parties' maturity and how they handle the situation.<br><br>If ur frenship with him or her is solid strong and both parties strongly cherish the existing frenship, the degree of damage wont be that bad. Tats just based on my own experience. Till now...we are still close frens.....still hang out n chit chat as per normal. just that i do suffer the sadness...<br><br>Everything comes with a risk. No risk no excitement. And hte usual saying....the bigger the risk..the higher the venture.....<br><br>the moment u love someone....be prepared to let go of that person when the time comes......<br><br>u must know when to hold on..when to let go.......<br><br>Once u love...love ot hte fullest with no regrets...<br><br>i think its not tat tough to see if tat person is interested in you...<br><br>frequent calls...<br>asking you out often.....the gradually from grp to single dates...<br>being attentive to you<br>flirts with you<br>being sweet to you...<br>very considerate towards you<br>give u small surpises...<br>blush when u look into their eyes<br>and wat else .. lo;x//// </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for your replies.<br>Yea i totally agree. But it aint so easy. We just met like 2-3 mths ago when poly started.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Another reason i'm feeling so unsure is becuz i had this conversation wif her before abt relationships. She said she does not think she's ready to be in one. And she was the one that place that thought of confessions being risky.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>And its kinda hard to notice if she likes me or not too. Its becuz she's veri socially active. Come on . She hangs around guys. I've only been out wif her 2 times. Together wif my blurness.

Girls like to remember anniversaries and stuff like that. So make a point lors. Then u dont see a guy pulling out an electric frying pan or brand new microwave for their gfs on the beach on valentine's day. Girls usually go for not so practical things. =X so u shld offer her some diamond or necklace or something.. hurhurhur...<br><br>Depends on wat u believe in.. If u believe in fate and feels tat fate will decide whether she will be with you not, its very wrong. At the very least, put some effort in wooing her. Not everything is predestined.

I think that's a point hpergo was addressing. Put it this way, I find the idea of courting someone who takes absolutely no initiative an absolute turn-off(I mean if you kept a dog, there'd at least be times when he will come up to you and offer a friendly lick or wags his tail to draw your attention)...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by babyreyes:</div><div class="quote_body">Sometimes u must know hors....Girls like the feeling of being wooed de...

Do these thoughts ever cross your(as in girls' in general) mind and is the fear of rejection worth passing up the chance of finding "The One"?<br><br>I can't help but get this impression(in Singapore and many other parts of Asia, at least) sometimes(make that most times!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ) and if that really was the case, then it's obviously the girl's loss IMO.</div>
