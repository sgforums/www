              <p>When a man gets married to a woman, he will have to spend the rest of 
              his life with her on a daily basis.  If he married her at the age of 30,
               he will have to spend the next 50-60 years with her. If he married her 
              at the age of 60, he will have to spend the next 20-30 years with her. 
              Think about it, we are not talking about days or months or years. We are
               talking decades here.<br> <br> If you had to spend the rest of your life with one person whom you would
               have to interact with everyday, what kind of person would you choose? 
              More importantly, what character traits would you want this person to 
              have in order for you to spend the rest of your life in marital bliss as
               compared to constant arguments and disputes?  <br> <br> Majority of men fail to look into the future when selecting their 
              spouse. Most of them focus on the more immediate and tangible aspects of
               the relationship. The day of realization will come when he begins to 
              feel resentment in his marriage. He will then ask himself the question 
              “Why did I marry this woman?” If he had asked those questions before he 
              decided to marry her, life would be totally different. Prevention is 
              always better than cure.<br> <br> So exactly what character traits are we looking for in a long term 
              partner? To put it simply, a man should choose to be with a woman who is
               a Flexible Giver with Integrity.<br> <br> Flexible. It can also be interpreted as easy going or accommodating. The
               opposite of a flexible woman is a stubborn or hard headed woman who 
              always wants things done her way. No two persons on the face of earth 
              can agree on everything. So there will always be differing opinions and 
              disagreements, it’s just a matter of how those disagreements are 
              resolved. One party will have to decide to give in to the other. A woman
               who is flexible will be more than willing to give in to her man if he 
              treats her properly. Men are supposed to be leaders and take charge in 
              relationships so a good woman will play her part by being flexible. 
              Majority of the time, the man will be making the decisions and his woman
               will go with it. Men also need to know when to compromise when 
              necessary and not take advantage of her flexibility. If men let the 
              women take charge and make all the decisions, the relationship will not 
              last as the woman will lose respect for him. With no respect, there will
               be no love.<br> <br> Giver.  The opposite of a Giver is a Taker. In order for any 
              relationship to flourish over the long term, give and take is the way to
               go. When one party keeps giving and fails to receive from his partner, 
              he will feel shortchanged and resentment will start to build in his 
              mind. His love for his woman will decrease as the days go by and the 
              relationship will go downhill. When you give and do something for your 
              woman who is a giver, she will reciprocate in other ways. You will never
               feel shortchanged. In fact, it would make you want to give her more 
              because of her loving attitude towards you. Such dynamics and happiness 
              will never be able to occur if you choose to be with a Taker. A man who 
              is always more than willing to give and not expect to receive is a Wimp.
               A Wimp has low esteem and hopes that he can get the approval/acceptance
               of women by being their butler. A clinically sane woman can never love a
               man who has low esteem, it repels her. Women want men who are 
              self-assured and confident.<br> <br> Integrity. Unlike flexibility and giving which can vary in degrees from 
              woman to woman, integrity has to be a hundred percent. A woman who has 
              integrity is honest, loyal and trustworthy. Nobody wants to be lied to 
              or cheated upon. And men should never go with a woman who has no 
              integrity because if they do, it will only bring them a lot of pain in 
              the future.<br> <br> Is your girl a Flexible Giver with Integrity?</p>

              <p>"Love eventually fades" only applies to people who do not know how to or can't be bothered to maintain their relationships, which is 90% of the population btw. Majority are just stuck in loveless marriage since they have kids to raise and 30 year mortgage loan to pay back to the bank. Divorce is not really an option for most couples in such situation.</p>
              <p>If you chose a good woman to marry, you will have a lot less headaches in your marriage life. If you choose a not so good one, do not complain or blame your wife or pick on her bad points, because it only reflects badly on your lousy or non-existent selection process.</p>
