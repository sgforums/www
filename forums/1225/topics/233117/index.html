If you want to succeed with women you've got to slow down, get focused, and develop an attention span that can handle more than a thirty second sound bite. The key is patience.<br><br>Every week I'm written to by men who say they're eager for my help, but most aren't. No, what they want is a magic bullet. What they want is a solution to their romance and sex problems that's as easy as turning on the T.V. <strong><span style="color: black;">They don't want to think, they don't want to plan, and they don't want to change their behavior</span></strong> - they want instant gratification. Instant gratification, however, happens with electrical appliances, not people.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have two choices. You can be impatient and lonely - or learn patience, take the time to learn great strategies, and start attracting women. <strong><span style="color: black;">You can stay with impatience and be so desperate you repel every woman you're attracted to - or get focused, work your plan, and create results. You choose.</span></strong><br><br>Meanwhile time is wasting. Every day you spend frittering away your free hours gossiping with friends about the girl in class you long for but are afraid to talk to, every day you spend hours playing video games instead of signing up for an online dating service, every moment you spend mourning over a relationship that ended over a year ago instead of being open to a new woman right here, right now, is a waste.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Furthermore every time a girl says "no thanks" and you get angry, every time a date doesn't go the way you hoped and you let it ruin your week (or month, or semester), every time a woman you're attracted to doesn't seem to notice you, and you get angry, you move a step backward on the love/sex/romance game.<br><br>Being a man who attracts women takes skills, and skills that can be learned.<br><strong><span style="color: black;">Every man out there, no matter his age, his education level, or income, can learn great strategies for attracting the women he finds attractive</span></strong> - and then put them into play and succeed.<br><strong><span style="color: black;">The skills, however, don't learn themselves. They need to be studied, memorized, and then put into play. The results then need to be studied, analyzed and modified depending on what's working and what doesn't.</span></strong><br><br>If you were a pitcher who wasn't throwing strikes <strong><span style="color: black;">you'd examine your technique and figure out what the problem was. It's the same thing with woman. You need to patience to first learn skills, patience to polish them, and even more patience to study the feedback and find out where things need to be fine tuned to win.</span></strong></div>
