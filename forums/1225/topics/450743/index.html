              <p>22-year-old Eliza Lee is not only a fresh graduate who studied at a top 
              secondary school, she is also from a wealthy family and used to be 
              chauffeured home from school. Despite her background, she chose to marry
               a chicken rice seller.<br><br>According to an article in the New Paper,
               Miss Lee is the daughter of parents who own a bag-manufacturing 
              business and has a bachelor's degrees in hospitality management from the
               Management Development Institute of Singapore (MDIS). She is engaged to
               32-year-old Michael Poh, who owns a chicken rice stall. <br><br>Despite
               her pampered background, Miss Lee has been helping out at her fiance's 
              stall for 10 to 15 hours everyday, 7 days a week. Before she started 
              helping out at the stall, says her fiance, Miss Lee had 'not touched a 
              drop of detergent'. The prospect of being a hawker's wife has never 
              bothered her, says Miss Lee. <br><br>Miss Lee's mindset is rare among 
              Singaporean women her age. Most university graduates would not consider 
              marrying a blue-collar worker. Mr Poh affirmed this by saying he has 
              experienced his fair share of snobbery from ex-girlfriends, and says 
              that women like his fiance are rare. <br><br>And why did Miss Lee choose
               to be with Mr Poh? She says they 'click' and that they have endless 
              conversations. They also share a common goal of building a comfortable 
              life together. Mr Poh, who has a diploma is sociology, says: "To find 
              another one like Eliza, who would go through thick and think with me, is
               mission impossible."<br><br>In a poll conducted by the New Paper, 100 
              percent of 50 female undergraduates aged 21 to 28 said they would not 
              date a blue-collar worker. <br><br>STOMPer Splendora says:<br><br>"Hats
               off to Eliza Lee for following her heart. The modern-thinking 
              22-year-old may be a graduate from a wealthy family, but that has not 
              stopped her from choosing to marry a 32-year-old chicken rice seller.<br><br>"All
               my graduate female friends would turn their noses up at the idea of 
              marrying someone who does not match their educational qualifications, 
              and even those who aren't graduates hope to marry a man who is a 
              graduate, in the hopes of having a better life.<br><br>"I'm a graduate 
              from a local university too, and I think there is nothing wrong with 
              Eliza's choice. In fact, I admire her more than those women who refuse 
              to even consider someone who's not a graduate. Eliza has far more 
              attractive qualities than these narrow-minded women! <br><br>"For 
              someone who comes from a rich family to give up her pampered lifestyle 
              for the man she loves is truly an admirable quality. It shows she is not
               afraid to work hard, and has a fighting spirit. <br><br>"And there is 
              nothing wrong with selling chicken rice. It may be 'unglam', but it's an
               honest living and if you work hard, you can earn a comfortable living. 
              In fact, if a graduate were to scoff at the idea of marrying down, then 
              I'd say her years of education have been wasted on her."</p>
