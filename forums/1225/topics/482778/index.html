              <p>hi there,</p>
              <p><br>just sharing, so that readers can understand the type of segment that goodluck friends centre target for it's clientele.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>COST</p>
              <p>This marriage agency / dating agency / matchmaking agency is operated by Horatio Lee. He is an chinese male, probably in his 60s - 70s, who is more comfortable in speaking Mandarin, Hokkien than English ( as natural to the people of his era ).</p>
              <p>They charge a fee ranging from SG$788 - SG$1,488, based on how hard they think it is for them to find a life partner for you. Paying the above, allows you to meet 5 prospective life partners.</p>
              <p>They claim to provide a lifetime matchmaking service, whereby they still arrange a matchmake for you after the 5 initial dates @ SG$25/date. You are supposed to pay SG$25/date for the initial 5 dates too though.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MALE CLIENTELE</p>
              <p>They have mainly a pool of Singaporean Chinese males clientele, naturally.</p>
              <p>However, being sales-talkers, they would promise you what you like to hear, naturally.<br><br>A girl was looking for PRC Chinese based in Singapore, with PR / Citizenship, she is probably going to adjust to the truth later...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FEMALE CLIENTELE</p>
              <p>They have a majority pool of PRC girls on</p>
              <p>1. various work visas, ( think factory assembly-line PRC girl on work permit )</p>
              <p>2. PR / citizens,</p>
              <p>3. student passes,</p>
              <p>However, in order not to turn the male clientele away, they would tell you that they have a majority pool of singaporean ( as in born in singapore ) girls, if you quiz them.<br><br>I have found it to be extremely dodgy, as I wonder if the girls on the student passes are the same girls who moonlight at the entertainment establishments ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SALES PROCESS<br><br>Their sale process consist of 1 free consultation.<br><br>The free consultation is basically a list where they record down your personal information, as a database for them.<br><br>It also list down your requirements for the prospective date.<br><br>Then, the above is done by one of the pleasant receptionist, who would then arrange for you to meet up with Horatio in his cubicle.</p>
              <p>This is where Horatio would do abit of banter on finding a life-partner, after which he would reveal the costs structure.<br><br>However, if you resist, he would drop the price / installment plans.<br><br>Next, he would show you a folder of girls profile, with pictures attached.<br><br>NOTE : This is the ONLY TIME you would see the folder of girls profile with their pictures. <br><br>You are not allowed to choose the girls from the above, nor would you have any accessibility to it.<br><br>Safely, I would believe the folder is just used as a sales bait for guys, as we tend to be visual oriented creatures.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the never-changing pitch from Horatio Lee to the Male Clients is Males look for Pretty Females, comprising mainly on Face / Figure. He would look for a pretty girl for you.<br><br>The pitch he gives to the Female Clients is Females seek a Financially-Secure Male, who can provide for the family and pay for the household expenses. He would look for someone who earns SG$3k and above for you.</p>
              <p><br>THE MEETUP<br><br>This is where you would find the whole process unsophistated and simply messy.</p>
              <p>Whatever requirement you have listed, is immediately thrown out of the window.<br><br>They just do a very random matching, which is accorded by the age group and that's it.<br><br>In the process, they do not explain the person's profile accurately, as they do not understand the jobscope / needs of the person well.<br><br><br>WHORES PICKUP POINT<br><br>If you are seeking a ex-KTV hostess looking to clean up her life, this is probably an awesome place for you.<br><br>They have got pretty girls on dodgy student-visas / short-term holiday passes, looking to marry a local singaporean male, so that they can convert to the sought-after PR / sg citizen status...</p>
              <p><br>hope this serves as an insight, which comes useful to prospective clients.<br><br>;)</p>
