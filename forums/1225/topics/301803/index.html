            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">note: for reference only</span><br><br>Is he interested in you? Body language signals to look out for.<br><br>No matter where you've met that great guy, at a friend's party, a bar or even a blind date, there's the million-dollar question you are dying to find out: Does he like me, or not? What if you could know for sure? His body language could be a dead giveaway. So quit the guesswork: David Givens, Ph.D., director of the Center for Nonverbal Studies (CNS) in Washington and author of Love Signals: A Practical Field Guide to the Body Language of Courtship, decodes body language signs that say he's into you!<br><br><strong>SIGN #1</strong>:<br><span style="color: red;">He flashes his brows and smiles when he sees you.</span><br># Body Language Decoder: Raised brows signal attraction: It's the universal sign of interest and it exists in every culture. In fact, some experts think it's the most recognized non-verbal sign of greeting used by humans. When we're attracted to someone, our eyebrows rise and fall subconsciously. And when the other person is similarly attracted, they raise their brows and smile in return. The whole exchange lasts less than a second, though, so it can be easy to miss unless you're looking out for it!<br><br><strong>SIGN #2</strong>:<br><span style="color: red;">He points his body towards you.</span><br># Body Language Decoder: If he's across the room, take a peek at his hands and feet: We tend to point toward the object of our desire subsciously. When we find someone attractive, we'll often point (with our hands, feet or toes) toward that person.<br><br>If you're engaging in a conversation with him sitting next to you, it's even easier to tell: If he leans slightly forward and keeps his shoulders and upper body squarely facing you, it shows that he's deeply interested in you and what you have to say.<br><br><strong>SIGN #3</strong>:<br><span style="color: red;">He gazes at your lips while you're talking.</span><br># Body Language Decoder: Our eyes have a body language all their own. A major telltale sign of how we feel about someone is our gazing pattern: When we look at acquaintances, like at business meetings, we keep our gazes at eye-level, focusing on the other person's eyes and the bridge of the nose.<br><br>With friends or someone we like, we hold our eye contact longer than usual and our gaze moves down to include the nose and mouth. And if he's romantically drawn to you, the look can further drop down to include parts of your body like the neck or shoulders. This type of intimate gaze conveys interest. It's as if he can't resist caressing the rest of your face and hair with his eyes, or he's imagining what it feels like to kiss you on the lips.<br><br><strong>SIGN #4</strong>:<br><span style="color: red;">His pupils widen and he blinks more when looking at you.</span><br># Body Language Decoder: The size of our pupils adjusts according to two things: Light and attraction. It's a biological reaction we cannot control. Secretly compare his pupils and another person's (like your girlfriend if she's sitting beside you) in the same surroundings. If we're looking at a person we like, our pupils will dilate, so will our blink rate. The reason: When we're excited, our body releases more adrenaline which results in dilated pupils and faster blinks, the same physiological process that makes our heart pump faster and our knees weak!<br><br><strong>SIGN #5</strong>:<br><span style="color: red;">He laughs at just about everything you say.</span><br># Body Language Decoder: If his eyebrows remain slightly raised while you're talking, it signals that he finds you fascinating. Another obvious sign that he likes you a lot: He nods, smiles, laughs and agrees with just about everything you say, including the silly stuff. He's not just being cordial, he's genuinely happy to be with you!</div>

              <p>I read somewhere that it is actually easier to know if a guy like you than the <strong>TRUE</strong> reason <strong>WHY</strong> he like you.</p>
              <p>Here's what I read:</p>
              <p><strong>What's not so easy to tell is why he's interested in you. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Some experts estimate that the majority of men who <span style="text-decoration: underline;">express interest in a woman do so purely out of sexual interest.</span></strong> These men will actively pursue the woman as long as there's the possibility that the evening might end in sex, but, if it becomes clear that intimacy is not on the menu, they'll quickly lose interest and drift away. If you're one of those women, you may be left thinking, "What did I do wrong? Was it something I said?" A man losing interest in you is not the same as him rejecting you. The loss of interest may be due to a variety of factors. The more superficial a man's interest in you, the more easily he will be dissuaded. <strong>His loss of interest often says more about the type of man he is than it does about you.</strong></p>
