              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I would need advises from all guys and gers.</p>
              <p>I am attached, but somehow I do feel that I am treated like shit by my ger. Worst, she claimed that she treated me really like shit. She would just bring up the idea of breaking up as and when she likes. I feel hurt whenever she said this through sms. I feel that I am the one who is saving this relationship, but not her. I may be wrong, and I am not sure.</p>
              <p>She can get angry for small issues, which I have to tolerate it. I do reflection on myself, is the problem lies with me or she is not my league?</p>
              <p>Please advise. Feel free to ask me for details.</p>

              <p>Perhaps she just being emotional and passed such a remark. I don't and I am not sure, therefore I wouldn't make any judgement. However, I want to continue this relationship, the resistance is too great for me.</p>

              <p>I don't know whether did she show much respect to me? I'm an easy going guy, therefore I will not take too many things into account. I'm a very simple guy with no expectations, but she is a complicated ger with demanding expectations.</p>
              <p>TTFU,</p>
              <p>I can't meet her demands, I have been trying very hard. Is it because i CMI or her expectations are far way too demanding already.</p>

              <p>Why not sit down with her and have a good talk? If you feel that you can't talk to her face to face about this issue because you don't know how to bring up, or you fear that your feelings will betray you and accept whatever she says without really feeling that way. Then the best way would be through email. </p>
              <p>Send her an email. And get her to reply through there. Not by call or sms. This way, whatever that she reply, at least you got time to think how are you going to best reply her. Also, in your email, ask her how she feels about you, and whether does she a future with you? Write in what you are unhappy about and put in some suggestions that could help those negative feelings in you subside. </p>
              <p>Both of you should compromise. Don't expect her to change for you though. Sometimes its just their character. You love that girl, you got to love some of her character too. =) </p>

              <p>I will heed your advise. However, I am afraid that the relationship will turn sour. I do compromise a lot. However, based on my character, I don't like to compromise for things, unless necessary. I never tell her about this, afraid might hurt her in a way. Eventually, I do compromise. Maybe, both our personality are too strong headed.</p>

              <p>I will heed your advise. However, I am afraid that the
              relationship will turn sour. I do compromise a lot. However, based
              on my character, I don't like to compromise for things, unless
              necessary. I never tell her about this, afraid might hurt her in a
              way. Eventually, I do compromise. Maybe, both our personality are
              too strong headed.</p>

              <p>Haha. I feel that you are a bit like me in terms of character and thinking. Don't worry. Usually when face with such a situation, I will always tell myself, if I'm meant to be with her, she will know how to reply. At least when she reply, I will know whether she is true to me or not. And for those emails I sent, it prove me right that I'm correct in choosing her. =D </p>
              <p>Anyway, back to you, its a good time to know how she feels about you. If things do turn sour, at least you know she is not serious. And you must get her to make the decision whether she wants to continue with you or not. If she reply you saying she don't know, guilty. .  All these crap. Then please just shoot her back and say, stop being unfair to me, yes or no? </p>
              <p>If she say no, then okay lor. If she say yes, please work out with her on how to mend the relationship. Nothing is impossible if the 2 of you are willing to work together. =) </p>

              Dear threadstarter,
              
              The high resistance that is forcing u to still be with her may be due to the fact that you are too used to having her by your side? 
              
              Talk things out. 
              
              She may say all those bullshit such as admitting she's treated u bad and that you deserve better and stuff, but if she realli loves you, she can't bear to let you leave.
              
              It's kinda like a fiend's grip, if you know what I mean.
              
              Cheers

              <p><br>I dunno</p>
              <p>Do you really love her tts y ur still trying to salvage the relationship...or are you staying on becoz you're used to her presence?</p>
              <p>If it's the latter then I'd recommend that you break out of your comfort zone and leave her. A relationship with no love would probably be torturous to both parties. Might as well break it off early.</p>
              <p>Find someone who wun hiam you...either that or improve yourself so that better women out there would be attracted to u.</p>
