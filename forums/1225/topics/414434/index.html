              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Hey Doc, </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>I
               have a bit of a quandary here.  I've been dating Larissa off and on for
               four months. On the first date she told me it takes a long time for her
               to consider something a relationship.  At that time I was not the proud
               owner of "The System." I set dates while I was on a date with Larissa. I
               didn't wait a week to contact her between dates. It wasn't until a 
              month later, after she told me she wasn't interested in a relationship 
              or dating, that I ditched my ego, purchased your book and became a 
              member of the Doc Love Club. I saw EVERYTHING that I did wrong with 
              Larissa. I allowed my Interest Level to skyrocket while hers plummeted.  </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>After
               a month alone with your book and hustling new phone numbers, I was 
              constantly troubled by what could have been with Larissa had I had "The 
              System." So, violating the "BACK (YOU CAN'T GO)" principle, I called 
              Larissa. We went out and had a great time. Since then we've gone out 
              three more times, and each time I have watched her Interest Level rise 
              because of my use of your techniques.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Everything
               is going great, Doc. Like you say, she is going to do what she wants, 
              when she wants to do it and with whom. I have been able to relax and let
               things come more naturally and on her terms. She really does have to 
              think that it's all her idea -- again, just like you say.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>I
               don't want you to think that I am just being a sap for Larissa. I am 
              out one night a week hustling new phone numbers and dating other girls, 
              and I am seeing Larissa once every two weeks.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong><br> So here's my question. Larissa and I went out last night and, like 
              always, we laughed and had a great time. Towards the end of the night 
              she turned to me and invited me to her two birthday parties. One is a 
              barbeque at her house and one is at a club for a dance party. She said 
              that all of her friends are invited but I am getting a SPECIAL invite. I
               take this as incoming, but I don't know if I should go because I won't 
              be on a date with her at either party. On the other hand, she may 
              consider it rude if I don't show up to at least one of these bashes. 
              Larissa is chased by a lot of guys, and I am a bit of an outsider to her
               social circle, so I don't know what to expect should I show up to 
              either or both of these parties.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>What should I do?</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Igor - who is a true believer</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Hi Igor,</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Larissa
               told you outright that it takes a long time for her to consider 
              something a relationship. So why didn't common sense enter your mind and
               tell you to SLOW DOWN? You were given a fair warning right upfront, 
              weren't you? Look again at the name of my column, pal - WOMEN DON'T LIE 
              AND MEN DON'T LISTEN. It's amazing to me that you didn't heed Larissa's 
              warning - or mine - and TAKE IT SLOW with her the first time around. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>You
               started out by breaking a rule, and then you went and broke another 
              rule by calling Larissa after she told you she really wanted nothing to 
              do with you. So all you're doing here is breaking rules, dude. You don't
               have my book and you break rules, you get the book and you break rules.
               You're not listening and you're not paying attention to what you read. 
              Like the great Doctor Freud once said, "Some men just don't want to be 
              coached."</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>I hate to have to tell you this, Igor, but Larissa's Interest Level <em>isn't</em> rising. Her interest in you is still below 50%. When she went out with 
              you for a few weeks she learned all she needed to know about Igor. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">She can't erase that knowledge now.</span> She can't forget all the mistakes you made even though you're making 
              none now (though you did make another major one by trying to go back 
              when the rule says you can't!). </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Just
               who do you think you're kidding here, Igor? Of course you're just being
               a sap for Larissa. She told you she didn't want anything to do with you
               and yet you insist on hanging around her. Like my cousin Sal "The Fish"
               Love says, "If sticking to her like an insect to flypaper ain't the 
              definition of a pushover, I don't know what is." </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Let's
               look a little more closely at what you're doing now. You're seeing 
              Larissa only once every two weeks. If she really dug you, if she had any
               kind of hot interest in you, she would insist on seeing you at least 
              once a week. So you're not seeing enough of this girl to make this 
              something that's going to actually go somewhere. This situation is what 
              we call a "retread." It's like an old tire, which isn't as good as a new
               Michelin. Larissa's just going out with you to fill time, guy, because 
              she doesn't have anyone else right now. Like my cousin Fast Eddie Love 
              from East L.A. says, "If there was someone she liked, she wouldn't be 
              dating you." And we already know she doesn't like you, right?</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>It's
               actually good that you won't be on a date with Larissa at her birthday 
              parties. For one thing, it would be a group date, which is a big NO-NO, 
              and for another, it gives you the chance to hustle other babes. Like my 
              cousin General Love says, "Soldier, you have to learn to see the 
              openings on the battlefield." Since you've got nothing going with 
              Larissa, you're going to attend both the barbecue and the dance party 
              and you're going to be cordial to the hostess. Then you're going to 
              hustle her best-looking girlfriends and get as many phone numbers as you
               can. Like my cousin Brother Love down in Watts says, "Bro, you're gonna
               turn her birthday blasts to your advantage."</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>And
               when you show up to these parties, you're going to be the best-dressed 
              man there. You're going to stand out in the crowd when you hustle 
              Larissa's friends and you're going to forget about her because she's 
              already forgotten about you.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Remember, guys: you get one shot per girl per lifetime.</strong></span></p>
