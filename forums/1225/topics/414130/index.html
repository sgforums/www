              <p><br> Written by Adrian Tan, author of The Teenage Textbook (1988). He was the 
                      guest-of-honour at a recent NTU convocation ceremony. This was his 
                      speech to the graduating class of 2008.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Don’t work. Avoid telling the truth. Be hated. Love someone.   </h3>
              <p>I must say thank you to the faculty and staff of the Wee Kim Wee 
              School of Communication and Information for inviting me to give your 
              convocation address. It’s a wonderful honour and a privilege for me to 
              speak here for ten minutes without fear of contradiction, defamation or 
              retaliation. I say this as a Singaporean and more so as a husband.</p>
              <p>My wife is a wonderful person and perfect in every way except one. 
              She is the editor of a magazine. She corrects people for a living. She 
              has honed her expert skills over a quarter of a century, mostly by 
              practising at home during conversations between her and me.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, I am a litigator. Essentially, I spend my day 
              telling people how wrong they are. I make my living being disagreeable. 
              Nevertheless, there is perfect harmony in our matrimonial home. That is 
              because when an editor and a litigator have an argument, the one who 
              triumphs is always the wife.</p>
              <p>And so I want to start by giving one piece of advice to the men: when
               you’ve already won her heart, you don’t need to win every argument.</p>
              <p>Marriage is considered one milestone of life. Some of you may already
               be married. Some of you may never be married. Some of you will be 
              married. Some of you will enjoy the experience so much, you will be 
              married many, many times. Good for you.</p>
              <p>The next big milestone in your life is today: your graduation. The 
              end of education. You’re done learning. You’ve probably been told the 
              big lie that “Learning is a lifelong process” and that therefore you 
              will continue studying and taking masters’ degrees and doctorates and 
              professorships and so on. You know the sort of people who tell you that?
               Teachers. Don’t you think there is some measure of conflict of 
              interest? They are in the business of learning, after all. Where would 
              they be without you? They need you to be repeat customers.</p>
              <p>The good news is that they’re wrong.</p>
              <p>The bad news is that you don’t need further education because your 
              entire life is over. It is gone. That may come as a shock to some of 
              you. You’re in your teens or early twenties. People may tell you that 
              you will live to be 70, 80, 90 years old. That is your life expectancy.</p>
              <p>I love that term: life expectancy. We all understand the term to mean
               the average life span of a group of people. But I’m here to talk about a
               bigger idea, which is what you expect from your life.</p>
              <p>You may be very happy to know that Singapore is currently ranked as 
              the country with the third highest life expectancy. We are behind 
              Andorra and Japan, and tied with San Marino. It seems quite clear why 
              people in those countries, and ours, live so long. We share one thing in
               common: our football teams are all hopeless. There’s very little danger
               of any of our citizens having their pulses raised by watching us play 
              in the World Cup. Spectators are more likely to be lulled into a gentle 
              and restful nap.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have a life expectancy of 81.8 years. Singapore men live
               to an average of 79.21 years, while Singapore women live more than five
               years longer, probably to take into account the additional time they 
              need to spend in the bathroom.</p>
              <p>So here you are, in your twenties, thinking that you’ll have another 
              40 years to go. Four decades in which to live long and prosper.</p>
              <p>Bad news. Read the papers. There are people dropping dead when 
              they’re 50, 40, 30 years old. Or quite possibly just after finishing 
              their convocation. They would be very disappointed that they didn’t meet
               their life expectancy.</p>
              <p>I’m here to tell you this. Forget about your life expectancy. After 
              all, it’s calculated based on an average. And you never, ever want to 
              expect being average.</p>
              <p>Revisit those expectations. You might be looking forward to working, 
              falling in love, marrying, raising a family. You are told that, as 
              graduates, you should expect to find a job paying so much, where your 
              hours are so much, where your responsibilities are so much.</p>
              <p>That is what is expected of you. And if you live up to it, it will be an awful waste.</p>
              <p>If you expect that, you will be limiting yourself. You will be living
               your life according to boundaries set by average people. I have nothing
               against average people. But no one should aspire to be them. And you 
              don’t need years of education by the best minds in Singapore to prepare 
              you to be average.</p>
              <p>What you should prepare for is mess. Life’s a mess. You are not 
              entitled to expect anything from it. Life is not fair. Everything does 
              not balance out in the end. Life happens, and you have no control over 
              it. Good and bad things happen to you day by day, hour by hour, moment 
              by moment. Your degree is a poor armour against fate. Don’t expect 
              anything. Erase all life expectancies. Just live. Your life is over as 
              of today. At this point in time, you have grown as tall as you will ever
               be, you are physically the fittest you will ever be in your entire life
               and you are probably looking the best that you will ever look. This is 
              as good as it gets. It is all downhill from here. Or up. No one knows. 
              What does this mean for you? It is good that your life is over.</p>
              <p>Since your life is over, you are free. Let me tell you the many 
              wonderful things that you can do when you are free. The most important 
              is this: do not work. Work is anything that you are compelled to do. By 
              its very nature, it is undesirable. Work kills. The Japanese have a term
               “Karoshi”, which means death from overwork. That’s the most dramatic 
              form of how work can kill. But it can also kill you in more subtle ways.
               If you work, then day by day, bit by bit, your soul is chipped away, 
              disintegrating until there’s nothing left. A rock has been ground into 
              sand and dust. There’s a common misconception that work is necessary. 
              You will meet people working at miserable jobs. They tell you they are 
              “making a living”. No, they’re not. They’re dying, frittering away their
               fast-extinguishing lives doing things which are, at best, meaningless 
              and, at worst, harmful. People will tell you that work ennobles you, 
              that work lends you a certain dignity. Work makes you free. The slogan 
              “Arbeit macht frei” was placed at the entrances to a number of Nazi 
              concentration camps. Utter nonsense. Do not waste the vast majority of 
              your life doing something you hate so that you can spend the small 
              remainder sliver of your life in modest comfort. You may never reach 
              that end anyway. Resist the temptation to get a job. Instead, play. Find
               something you enjoy doing. Do it. Over and over again. You will become 
              good at it for two reasons: you like it, and you do it often. Soon, that
               will have value in itself. I like arguing, and I love language. So, I 
              became a litigator. I enjoy it and I would do it for free. If I didn’t 
              do that, I would’ve been in some other type of work that still involved 
              writing fiction – probably a sports journalist.</p>
              <p>So what should you do? You will find your own niche. I don’t imagine 
              you will need to look very hard. By this time in your life, you will 
              have a very good idea of what you will want to do. In fact, I’ll go 
              further and say the ideal situation would be that you will not be able 
              to stop yourself pursuing your passions. By this time you should know 
              what your obsessions are. If you enjoy showing off your knowledge and 
              feeling superior, you might become a teacher. Find that pursuit that 
              will energise you, consume you, become an obsession. Each day, you must 
              rise with a restless enthusiasm. If you don’t, you are working.</p>
              <p>Most of you will end up in activities which involve communication. To
               those of you I have a second message: be wary of the truth. I’m not 
              asking you to speak it, or write it, for there are times when it is 
              dangerous or impossible to do those things. The truth has a great 
              capacity to offend and injure, and you will find that the closer you are
               to someone, the more care you must take to disguise or even conceal the
               truth. Often, there is great virtue in being evasive, or equivocating. 
              There is also great skill. Any child can blurt out the truth, without 
              thought to the consequences. It takes great maturity to appreciate the 
              value of silence. In order to be wary of the truth, you must first know 
              it. That requires great frankness to yourself. Never fool the person in 
              the mirror. I have told you that your life is over, that you should not 
              work, and that you should avoid telling the truth.</p>
              <p>I now say this to you: be hated. It’s not as easy as it sounds. Do 
              you know anyone who hates you? Yet every great figure who has 
              contributed to the human race has been hated, not just by one person, 
              but often by a great many. That hatred is so strong it has caused those 
              great figures to be shunned, abused, murdered and in one famous 
              instance, nailed to a cross. One does not have to be evil to be hated. 
              In fact, it’s often the case that one is hated precisely because one is 
              trying to do right by one’s own convictions. It is far too easy to be 
              liked, one merely has to be accommodating and hold no strong 
              convictions. Then one will gravitate towards the centre and settle into 
              the average. That cannot be your role. There are a great many bad people
               in the world, and if you are not offending them, you must be bad 
              yourself. Popularity is a sure sign that you are doing something wrong.</p>
              <p>The other side of the coin is this: fall in love.</p>
              <p>I didn’t say “be loved”. That requires too much compromise. If one 
              changes one’s looks, personality and values, one can be loved by anyone.
               Rather, I exhort you to love another human being. It may seem odd for 
              me to tell you this. You may expect it to happen naturally, without 
              deliberation. That is false. Modern society is anti-love. We’ve taken a 
              microscope to everyone to bring out their flaws and shortcomings. It far
               easier to find a reason not to love someone, than otherwise. Rejection 
              requires only one reason. Love requires complete acceptance. It is hard 
              work – the only kind of work that I find palatable. Loving someone has 
              great benefits. There is admiration, learning, attraction and something 
              which, for the want of a better word, we call happiness. In loving 
              someone, we become inspired to better ourselves in every way. We learn 
              the truth worthlessness of material things. We celebrate being human. 
              Loving is good for the soul. Loving someone is therefore very important,
               and it is also important to choose the right person. Despite popular 
              culture, love doesn’t happen by chance, at first sight, across a crowded
               dance floor. It grows slowly, sinking roots first before branching and 
              blossoming. It is not a silly weed, but a mighty tree that weathers 
              every storm. You will find, that when you have someone to love, that the
               face is less important than the brain, and the body is less important 
              than the heart. You will also find that it is no great tragedy if your 
              love is not reciprocated. You are not doing it to be loved back. Its 
              value is to inspire you. Finally, you will find that there is no 
              half-measure when it comes to loving someone. You either don’t, or you 
              do with every cell in your body, completely and utterly, without 
              reservation or apology. It consumes you, and you are reborn, all the 
              better for it.</p>
              <p>Don’t work. Avoid telling the truth. Be hated. Love someone. You’re 
              going to have a busy life. Thank goodness there’s no life expectancy.</p>
