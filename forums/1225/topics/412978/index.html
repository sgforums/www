              </span></span></span></span></strong></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Hey <span class="il">Doc</span>,</span></strong></strong></p><strong>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><br>First of all, let me compliment you on your incredible contribution to mankind's
              dating skills. I've been an avid follower of "The System" for years now, and
              it's paid off massively. I feel I have built a good intuitive understanding of
              your principles, and usually can apply them without thinking. Except that now I
              find myself in a rather peculiar situation in which I can't really figure out
              what to do. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><br>I'm a 30-year old professional in New York, and spent the summer doing a
              project in our Paris office. There I met Isabelle, a French colleague who was
              on my team. She is a beautiful, extremely smart, very independent woman. She's
              also funny and has a Flexible, Giving personality. We spent a lot of time
              together and had a great connection. From her body language and overall
              behavior I could sense that she liked me as well, so I could have easily asked
              her out on a date. However, I knew I'd be back in New York after the summer,
              and since I don't believe in long-distance relationships, I didn't ask her out.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><br>The project I did in Paris was successful, and I will be relocating there next
              summer. Since I really dig Isabelle and I think we could be a fantastic fit, I
              would <span class="il">love</span> to maximize my chances of winning her over then. Obviously, in the
              meantime, I'm not going to let my interest in her stop me from dating women in
              New York. But I do want to make sure to make her as excited as possible about
              the prospect of dating me when I'm back in Paris. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><br>I've been in Paris twice since, and looked up Isabelle on both occasions. I
              kept everything light and funny, and it felt like we were on a date (even
              though we weren't). We briefly talked about the "special connection" we had and
              I said that I enjoyed her company and that maybe one day we could have a great
              relationship. I realized afterwards that this was probably very much
              anti-Challenge. Did I make a terrible mistake here, <span class="il">Doc</span>?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><br>In a few weeks, Isabelle is coming to New York to visit for a few days, before
              flying elsewhere for business. (She suggested the visit herself.) She's staying
              for two days, which seems like an awful lot of time to fill. I'm also not sure
              how I can come across as a Challenge in this situation. Spending two full days
              exclusively with her might make me look too available. On the other hand,
              leaving her on her own for extended periods of time knowing that she's in New York
              to visit me would be rude. I've thought about asking her to join me for a
              dinner party with friends, but that would be like a group date, and I know you
              don't like that. Also, should I let her stay at my place (which might look too
              eager) or suggest she stay at a hotel (which might seem unwelcoming and even
              rude)?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> This is such an unusual situation that I don't see how I can best apply "The
              System" to it. But Isabelle is fantastic, and I don't want to ruin my chances
              of dating her when I'm full time in Paris.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Ferdy - who wants to apply
              "The System" all the time</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Â </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Hi Ferdy,</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Let me ask you something.
              You're just working a job with Isabelle and you're trying to tell me that <em>in a romantic relationship she's Giving and
              Flexible</em>? How would you know? You don't have enough time in with her to
              make that judgment. You don't have any time in with this girl at all, really,
              and so you don't know anything about her. It's one thing to read Interest
              Level, but how could you possibly evaluate what she'd be like in a romantic
              relationship? It's not possible. Frankly, it's <em>im</em>possible. <br></span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">You should have asked
              Isabelle out on a date when you were in Paris. It might have been the last date
              you had with her, granted, but it wouldn't have made any difference. If you
              took her out, like my cousin General <span class="il">Love</span> says, "At least you would have been
              on her radar." You don't really know where you are with her. Anything you think
              is just guesswork.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">But here's the bigger
              problem looming ahead of you. If you get something going with Isabelle, you're
              an American and she's French. And this is potentially a huge obstacle, even if
              you did happen fall in <span class="il">love</span> with each other. Are you going to move to France?
              Is Isabelle going to move to America? Why start this up in the first place?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The reality of the
              situation is that when you went back to Paris, you were on a date with
              Isabelle. Why are you saying it wasn't a date? And like my cousin Sal "The
              Fish" <span class="il">Love</span> says, "Hey man, I hope you kissed her when the date was over!"</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">When you told Isabelle that
              you hoped one day the two of you would have a great relationship, you got a
              big, huge "F" in Challenge. You tell me that you read "The System" and then you
              went and talked about the future with a babe who's not even an American
              citizen? You blew it badly here, Ferdy. And one more thing - you came on heavy
              with her and you two aren't even dating! What were you thinking? So yes, what
              you did was anti-Challenge, and yes, you did make a huge mistake - times 10!</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">It's great that you had
              incoming interest from Isabelle when she invited herself to the Big Apple. But
              where's it going? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What you're really cultivating here is a long-distance
              relationship.</span> This is a NO-NO. Are you sure you read my book? Unless
              Isabelle wants to get a green card and move to America, you're frittering away
              your time. What if your company decides that they don't want you to move to
              Paris after all? What if Isabelle decides she could never leave France? Like
              the great Doctor Freud once said, "This is all a big illusion in your mind." </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Two days is not a great
              amount of time to fill when Isabelle gets to New York. You can be a Challenge
              by NOT talking about the future and how you're going to have the possibility of
              a long-term relationship like you did before. So keep it light and funny, and don't
              promise her the store before you know what's happening. Spending only two days
              in New York with Isabelle will not make you look too available - there's not
              enough time as long as you keep your mouth shut. It's not like you're spending
              10 days together. And besides, she's coming across the Atlantic to see you.
              Show her New York and have a good time and make her laugh. Like my cousin Fast
              Eddie <span class="il">Love</span> from East L.A. says, "She'll be gone before you know it." And by the
              way, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no group dates</span>. So forget the dinner party. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">You're not going to bring
              up the subject of where Isabelle is staying until she asks where the good
              hotels are. You don't want her staying at your place because it's much too
              quick and will destroy all remnants of Challenge. So put Isabelle in a hotel
              close to your place and leave it that.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">This is not an unusual
              situation at all, Ferdy. It's actually very simple. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What you have is a girl
              from another country who you're going to spend time with and she's going to end
              up not moving here.</span> When you're done with your work overseas, you'll end up
              back in America and she'll stay in France and you'll be back to square one.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Remember, guys: if she's
              not citizen of your country, you're wasting your time.</span></strong></p>
              </strong><p></p>
