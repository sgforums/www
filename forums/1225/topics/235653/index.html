            <div class='col-md body'>First impression lasted a long time. So, do it right... the first time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I'm sure some of you have seen these before but for those who have not.. here's it.<br><br>Please note, the "I" ain't me but the author.<br><br>====<br><br><strong>Bathe</strong><br>The worst thing you could do when going out on a date (especially if it is your first date with her) is to turn up unshaven and looking untidy. Women are generally the cleaner of the species and will judge you on how hygenic you are, after all you would be appalled if she turned up for the date looking scruffy and hadn't bathed for a while (no offence). It doesn't cost anything to take a bath and make an effort. Also remember that bad breath and body odour are also an instant turn off and she will assume that this is how you are all the time, even if you are just having a bad day (hey girls have bad hair days all the time! ) she won't see beyond your appearance.<br><br><strong>Arrive on time</strong><br>The worst thing you can do is turn up late. Turning up late will send out all the wrong impressions. Women always assume the worst and one of the worst is turning up late, not only will she think that she has been stood up, but will also think that you are unreliable. If you are picking her up from her home then it is advisable to turn up 5 minutes before you are due, any earlier she will be adjusting her make up or still getting ready and won't want you to see her half finished.<br><br><strong>Be a Gentleman</strong><br>Hold the door open for her, let her walk through the doors first, pull out her chair, be polite to her and people around you. Women like to feel special and by treating her like a lady she will think you are fantastic.<br><br><strong>Compliment Her</strong><br>The first thing to say to her is "You look beautiful" before you even ask how she is. Keep up the compliments throughout your date, but don't go overboard. A woman loves to be complimented, feel sexy, gorgeous/beautiful and know that you are attracted to her.<br><br><strong>Listen to her and ask questions</strong><br>Nobody wants to spend the whole night listening to someone talk about themselves, or not listening to what the other person is saying. But you do have to get to know each other. Ask her questions, but more importantly listen to what she has to say.<br><br>I remember once, while I was sitting in a resturant waiting for some friends, there was a man and women sitting at the table next to mine and I couldn't help overhearing their conversation (him talking of himself). I could tell it was their first date from what he was telling her about himself. "I play Sunday league football, I like roller-blading". He went on like this for about 10 minutes without stopping, or asking her any questions about herself. That day left an impact on me, and everytime I went on a date, I have been consious of the woman and took an interest in what she had to say. This is probably the best bit of advice I could give.<br><br><strong>Prepare</strong><br>The last thing you want is to be sitting having a meal, and the conversation dries up. Think about your date and what you would like to know about her and in return what you would like her to know about you. Try and think of any questions that she might ask you so that you can prepare the answer. You may think that it is easy to talk and that you will not run out of questions to ask, or that you will automatically have the answers, but until you are there, and in the situation, you will have no idea what to expect. You can avoid all of this by meeting for a quick drink then go on to see a film, so at least you will have something to talk about.<br><br><strong>Who will pay?</strong><br>This is a really tough question considering women are now more independant and like to pay their way. I suggest that you offer to pay and if she lets you then pay. If she wants to pay, you can suggest that you want to at least pay for half the bill.<br><br><strong>The goodnight kiss</strong><br>Some women prefer not to kiss after a date, others are disappointed if the guy doesn't even try. There is no easy answer to this. The only answer I can come up with is wait until either she makes the first move or that you both know when you are ready. Watch for body language and little touches, but I would not advice sex on the first date unless she wants to.<br><br><strong>I'll call you</strong><br>Only tell her that you will call her, if you mean it and intend on seeing her again. This is an awkward situation and most of the time the easiest solution is to take her number and tell her you will call her, but don't if you are not interested. When saying goodbye just say "It was nice meeting you" and wish her luck or you could just say "Goodnight", smile and walk away. But if you do like her and are interested, then you have to let her know.</div>
