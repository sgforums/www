              <p>just need some advice on the body language of women not little gals..</p>
              <p>1) almost everyday i will see this gal when going to work. i do not know her initially.</p>
              <p>2) she is quite nice and i always look at her directly, she will glance at me sometimes... i am not handsome guy and i am quite old 30+.</p>
              <p>3) then suddenly she started to stand very close behind me. when i found out, she will looked embrassed and stand infront of me. then she will start looking into the glass reflection and tidy her hair, take off her shoes. tidy her dress...etc...etc...</p>
              <p>4) i notice she wears a ring on middle finger, so i thought she was married and i did not approach her for a long time (a few months). then she changed to index finger. recently she do not wear the ring anymore.</p>
              <p>5) Then Recently, she started to stare very hard at me, not the friendly looks. and i was scared at first.</p>
              <p>6) ON 1 day, i just talk up to her and say hi... and get to know her name...and where she works. but i nvr get her number yet...</p>
              <p>7) But she started to act weird, she will ignore me on somedays and smile to me on other days. she no longer look into the glass reflection anymore.... she started to read books!!! lolz</p>

              <p>Act 'dao' and ignore her la...If she's really interested she'll will approach you herself...have you always been the one initiating those conversations with her?</p>
              <p>If she is interested she won't be able to take it if you ignore her for too long and will try to talk to you.</p>

              <p>right now sometimes, she will walk up to me very close and stare at me angryily in the bus or bus stop.</p>
              <p>she did not speak... just stare...?</p>
              <p>but i still did not talk to her ,i just smile and quickly avoid her.</p>
              <p>i feel that i did not do anything wrong to be treated this way...</p>
              <p>yes, she looks pretty to me...</p>
              <p>but i gonna give myself a chance to forget and move on.</p>

              <p>Hi friend,</p>
              <p>You are over-analyzing things.</p>
              <p>First, lets have some facts.</p>
              <p>She rejected telling you her numbers.</p>
              <p>This is fact.</p>
              <p>About "staring" , "looking unhappy" , "why stand so close" , these are all your own impression and speculation. You may think one thing, but the reality is not like that at all.</p>
              <p>I personally think you are over-analyzing.</p>
              <p>She stand close, maybe she wants to enter/ exit easily. She "looks unhappy" maybe because she just wake up and didnt have a good sleep the night before. Etc, etc. Nothing to do with you. And I dont think you should psycho-analyze people's faces and guess their emotions. She may be thinking about her dog, or whatever. Not you.</p>

              <p>i get into the over analysing trap too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if u can see her often just try to make more small talk. ask about wat she likes? wat she likes to do???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If dun wanna ask number ask for msn or facebook lo... take it slow. persist. Be a salesmen and face rejection, no need for face...</p>
