You are no Professor X of X-Men so you cannot read minds, BUT you definately can apply your experience when the next time you decide to go into another relationship.<br><br>Notice more about the guy you want to be with, know more about him, do not rush into a relationship without understanding what is he as a person and in character. I can only tell you from a guy's perspective and from my own views, there are other people who can give you more information.<br><br>I oso not sure is dis da right place to post your question...<br><br>Dear Mods, this da right place?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Moreover, the fact that you did not take the initiative in all 4 relationships could indicate the process of courting you was perhaps more of a challenge to those guys than actually having you as their gf...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
