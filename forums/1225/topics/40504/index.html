            <div class='col-md body'>To me....i'd prefer to let it be.<br>Cos there's no guarantee that even though i got her after her former r/s, it'll end off well...sometimes, it's worse off.<br><br>I guess in everything, people come and go. Of cos to fight or give up the person whom i like is one thing. But to bear the consequences of not even having a chance of being friend again is another.<br>I'd rather be her friend then nothing at all.<br><br>I'd prefer numbing me-self then to suffer in silent, waiting for somebody.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
