You will have your heart broken, probably more than once, and itÂ’s harder every time.<br><br>YouÂ’ll break hearts too, so remember how it felt when yours was broken. YouÂ’ll fight with your best friend. YouÂ’ll blame a new love for things an old one did. YouÂ’ll cry because time is passing too fast, and youÂ’ll eventually lose someone you love. So take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like youÂ’ve never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness youÂ’ll never get back.<br><br>Find a guy/girl who calls you beautiful instead of hot; who calls you back when you hang up on him; who will stay awake just to watch you sleep.<br><br>Wait for the guy/girl who kisses your forehead; who wants to show you off to the world when you are in your sweats; who holds your hand in front of his friends. Wait for the one who is constantly reminding you of how much he/she cares about you and how lucky he/she is to have you. Wait for the one who turns to his friends and says, Â“..thatÂ’s him/her.Â”<br><br>extracted - <a href="http://fillyfally.lah.cc/" rel="nofollow">http://fillyfally.lah.cc/</a><br><br></div>
