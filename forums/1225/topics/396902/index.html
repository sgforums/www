              <p>Hi guys, erm i hav dis problem. 2 days ago, i confessed to the girl i like, and she kinda didnt give an ans, so i asked her to think about it and tell me the next day. So last night, after a concert, i walked her home, and then asked her, and she still said she asked me what kind of ans i wan, so i said" i dont know"( i noe im srsly very stupid), so she started walking slower and slower until we reached the lift, and then she waved goodbye to me, and so i waved back while the doors were closing.</p>
              <p>After that, i got a text from her, saying that she is really sorry as she didnt expect it, and that we'll be better friends. So i asked her do i have a chance, and her reply was, " i dno, coze i cant imagine the 2 of us together."</p>
              <p>End of story, so until now, i have been feeling very very sad, i cried last night but didnt want to tell her as it will bother her. I dun wna trouble her anymore, but at the same time i really want to be with her, what shod i do?</p>

              <p><br>Do that .... question is... are u disciplined enought to stick to it.... cos if not u could become irritating to her. If she changes her mind you will know about it.... persuasion is an unneccessary trait after uve expressed yer interest to her.</p>

              <p><br>From my experience as playboy magnate. I tell you this girl may look for super rich guy but she did not tell on you. Nobody is angry with what you did. So maybe the girl is nice person after all. You did right thing by telling her the truth and asking her if she want to be with you. Now you can live for the rest of your life knowing that you tried, no regrets. Be patience, you will find somebody special.</p>

              <p>to TS: I'm very proud of you that you have done something like that- letting your feelings known to someone you like. It takes balls. Love is a very magical thing. She may not be with you now but you will never know the future. I am not asking you to carry hopes that she will be with you ultimately, but to live your life, and be strong. You're a guy! =) we are all here for you, and definitely you can walk out of this, a stronger person. You can do it!</p>
