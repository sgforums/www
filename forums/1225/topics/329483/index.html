              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Men tend to wind up with life partners who look like their mother, while a woman is lured to a partner who looks like her father, scientists reported </span></strong>on Wednesday.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Heterosexuals are deeply attracted to individuals whose faces are similar to that of their opposite-sex parent, they said, suggesting that this characteristic is rooted in an evolutionary drive.</span></strong></p>
              <p>A team led by Tamas Bereczkei at the University of Pecs in Hungary created a model of facial ratios -- width of jaw, distance between mouth and brow and so on -- comprising 14 facial zones.</p>
              <p>They measured 312 Hungarian adults from 52 different families using this method. Each family included a couple, along with two sets of parents.</p>
              <p><strong>The researchers found a significant correlation in facial similarities between a woman's mate and her father, and also between a man's partner and his mother.</strong></p>
              <p>The team tested the model on faces that were randomly selected from the general population and repeated the experiment with a panel of judges, who also picked out the same pairings from randomly selected groups of photos.</p>
              <p><strong>Interestingly, men and women focused on different parts of the face when they home in on a potential mate, they found.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>A man's lover and his mother tended to have similar fullness in the lips, width of mouth, as well as length and width of jaw.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>But for women, the critical features were the distance between mouth and brow, the height of the face, distance between the eyes and the size of a man's nose.</strong></p>
              <p><em>The choices are driven less by psychology and socialisation and more by evolutionary pressures,</em> suggests Bereczkei.</p>
              <p>Too much genetic overlap -- as can happen with incest -- is an evolutionary no-no.</p>
              <p>But seeking similar genetic traits "may confer individuals with additional adaptive advantages," he wrote.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It could increase the degree to which parents share genes with offspring, enhancing the genetic representation of future generations.</span></strong></p>
              <p><em>Finding similar partners might also help perpetuate genetic complexes that have evolved to adapt to a particular environment.</em></p>
              <p><em>There may be an additional bonus, which probably has more to do with happiness than a genetic imperative.</em></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Human couples who are similar in physical and psychological characteristics are more likely to remain together than dissimilar partners, possibly leading to an increase in fertility," the study concludes.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The research appears in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. The Royal Society is Britain's de-facto academy of sciences.</p>

              i dun agree with this, then how do you explain interracial marriages.
              
              But I do believe in the qualities, that one is attracted to a partner who has favorable qualities similar to parent of opposite sex. seems to be that way for my hubby and i
