              <p>You missed out the most important thing. Talk. Have you ever sit down somewhere such as at coffee joints, beach or park and talk about your past, your feelings and your aspirations? She feels you are cold because you aren't talking to her enough and not trying to understand her enough.</p>
              <p>But, after you have understood enough of her, follow the famous quote:</p>
              <h1 id="page-title">"To be happy with a man you must understand him a
                  lot and love him a little. To be happy with a woman you must love her a

              <p>Age actually don't play an important role. As long as you both get along well with each other. I myself also the same case as you too. At first i tought i was too young to woo a older girl, but i am wrong. We already together for 1 years plus! So go for it!</p>
