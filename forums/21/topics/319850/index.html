              <p>Marvelous .... we really ARE turning into second class citizens in our own home .....</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>he was requested to pay the $20 cover charge.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>His four friends - from England, Germany, France and Finland - filed in for free.</strong></p>
              <p><strong> The reason: They were foreign students on exchange in Singapore, while he was local</strong>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">He had planned a night of revelry with friends at St James Power
              Station last Saturday, but when National University of Singapore
              student Matthew Rao flashed his identity card (IC) at the door of the
              popular nightclub, he was requested to pay the $20 cover charge.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">His four friends - from England, Germany, France and Finland - filed in for free.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> The reason: They were foreign students on exchange in Singapore, while he was local.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">"I thought the IC was for age verification, but the bouncers said I had
              to pay because it was proof I was Singaporean," Mr Rao, 25, recalled.
              He was upset because the policy seemed unfair and discriminatory.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Why should foreign students get different treatment? If they live here, why shouldn't they pay as well?" he added.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ms Cheryl Khong, marketing manager at St James, confirmed its policy of
              giving foreign guests free entry any day of the week if they produce a
              valid foreign student pass. The little-publicised policy has existed
              since St James opened in 2006, but it only applies to Powerhouse, the
              nightspot's main dance room.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ms Khong said the policy aimed to "encourage a cosmopolitan party
              atmosphere for our young partygoers" and added that St James regularly
              hosts parties thrown by local tertiary institutions and students.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Still, Mr Rao said that the incident has changed his mind  about frequenting theclub.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">"I like rules that are fair and  open. If the club can at least publicise those rules on the door, then I'll respect them."</span></p>

              <p>that was a long time, 25 kilos, and a lot more hair ago .... but my ego's not big enough for that okie, I knew a chap, an indian fellow, who worked as a bouncer at ____ just before they went defunct .... I called him up to scream at him on his night off .... i got in after mentioning the fellow to his colleagues of course, but I never went back there again ...</p>
              <p>another place, which I shall not name also .... discriminated against NS botaks ....</p>
