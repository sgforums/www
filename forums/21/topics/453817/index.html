              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore is fast becoming a clubbing hotspot of Asia, and this has led to a rising demand for new nightlife trends.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Veterans said the industry has taken on a new lease of life, with a relaxation of guidelines and the onset of technology.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Buzzing business hub by day, pulsating nightlife by night.<br><br>Asia's clubbing hotspot sees partygoers revel the night away at nightclubs islandwide.<br><br>Clubbing
               pioneers like CEO of St James Holidings, Dennis Foo, said the nightlife
               scene has come a long way from its humble roots.<br><br>"I remember in 
              the 80s, it was a handful at most of bar operators outside the hotels 
              and there were very few people like us. And the real action was in the 
              hotel lobby lounges." <br><br>Co-Director of Filter and Mink, Phillip Poon, echoes this sentiment.<br><br>"I
               remember not that long ago when clubs used to close at 3 o'clock in the
               morning and everyone was scrabbling for after-hour parties at peoples' 
              houses."<br><br>The pace picked up in the past decade as regulations were relaxed, to encourage a livelier and more vibrant scene.<br><br>Phillip
               Poon said: "Licenses have been extended, the government has spent a lot
               more, relaxed on certain rules and regulations so it has become a lot 
              more dynamic."<br><br>Nightclubs are also shifting towards a more entertainment-oriented concept.<br><br>Besides dancing, patrons also expect clubs to offer more variety, such as interactive contests and over-the-top themed nights.<br><br>Zouk
               DJ, Adrian Wee, knows all about living up to the expectations. "People 
              get excited about dancers, pyrotechnics, headliner DJs who are not just 
              DJ-ing, they're entertaining. They get excited when the DJs takes off 
              his shirt or climbs the console or dance really silly stuff."<br><br>Adrian added that patrons are spoilt for choice, and it's no wonder they are demanding more.<br><br>"They
               are like 'oh can I have this music and I want to listen to it now,' so 
              that's what most DJs go through these days because they always get this 
              kind of request and most of the time, I get a bit annoyed by the 
              frequency of the request and how demanding these requests are. If we can
               accommodate, we'll do it. If we can't, then we have to fake or pretend 
              to faint."<br><br>But veterans caution the industry's dynamism can be a double-edged sword.<br><br>For one, trends keep changing, like the infamous bar-top dancing, which Dennis Foo said was a fad.<br><br>"At
               that time, it was forbidden, so (it was) not allowed and everybody 
              wanted to bar top. And today it is allowed and no one wants to go onto 
              the bar and dance anymore because the forbidden fruit syndrome is 
              missing."<br><br>Club owners said social media platforms, like Facebook 
              and Twitter, have also become critical marketing tools in today's 
              nightlife industry.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>

              <p>Sg, small limited place with a nice variety of club genre. But I noticed that you only have a limited amout of spending people. Some of the clubs are very good but the location made it less obvious and the people less inclined to travel there. And most of the people go where the crowd is. </p>
