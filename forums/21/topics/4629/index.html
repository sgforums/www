            <div class='col-md body'>What is the Singaporean entertainment scene?<br><br>Could it be the Youth Park every Saturday with it's cool gigs? How about the Boat Quay and Clarke Quay area with it's array of pubs and discos? Maybe the Orchard Road area as an avenue to drink, play and just kick back?<br><br>Problem is, there is no definite area that is the playground for the Singaporean. There are so many different races and age groups to cater to that the need for specially manicured entertainment scenes for each are created. So which one represents the Singaporean entertainment scene then?<br><br>But firstly, let me explain why I'm raising this point, trivial as it may seem. My friends and I are about to do aa 15 minute documentary on Singapore in a "Lonely Planet" kind of format and with just 15 mins to present our lovely country on tape it's quite a nightmare. We can't decide whether to film the nightlife at Boat Quay or hang out at Orchard Road on a Friday night.<br><br>So perhaps you pertinent, more experienced party-goers could help me out a little and tell me, from a Singaporean point of view, what is the Singaporean entertainment scene? Or could we be so pathetically culturally impaired that we don't have a meaningful arts and entertainment scene at all?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>since u said there's no definite area, might as well show all entertainment spots(if possible). show a bit of everything loh, singapore is like rojak, a bit of everything. show a bit of clarke/boat quay, a bit of orchard rd cafes like starbucks/coffee beans, some arts centre like...like...sheesh, dont think i know any...heehee, maybe show the arts museum, something concert hall(victoria?), substation etc, heck, u may also show one family watching cable tv, that's entertainment too...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore can't be described as having a single place or definately thing that is an entertainment scene.  The whole place is an entertainment scene.  If u look real close, Singapore is basically one big disneyland where people can live and do work...and it's planned like one also...If ur an archi person, u might have an idea of what I mean.<br><br>Singapore is an accumulation of nightlife.  Everyone here has a particular place they go to.  And more people here go out to nightspotsthan in the west becasue it's safer, and because we don't have the whole culture of hanging out at friends houses talking about dumb things...or throwing house parties.  Doesn't happen here much.  The closest thing we have here is the whole chalet thing, but that gets real boring real fast, u know what I mean.<br><br>Try focusing on ur own piece of night life.  Wehere do u go to party. Try and make it more personal.  I know it's a documentary, but u have to do this or else ur 15 minute documentary will look more like a 15 minute commercial for every happening nightspot in Singapore...1 minute per spot.:-)<br><br>Personally, I just hang out at the cafe's on orchard.  There's people and plenty of girls, but cheaper than pubs and discoes.  Tho sometimes, I will go to Zouk.<br><br>happy pubbing man.:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps u could feature it on someone who's VERY serious in the day ( working in perhaps Shenton way or better still the UOB building cuz its near Boat Quay ) then Lead on frm there... Let everyone see how this particular person changes his/her(girls r better choice cuz they could change frm formal office-wear to some kind of wild outfit n this shows the BIG change ) outfit n Go straight out of the office after the O.T to Boat Quay n party like a wild animal [totally diff feelin they project frm the Intense workplace]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the Singapore entertainment scene is what we were talking about. Why suddenly are we talking about nightlife?<br><br>Anyway.. My views.. I dun think Singapore is a mix of rojak. I just think that every country is almost the same. There's no fixed place to party, to listen to bands or to have a good time. It's just that people wanna have fun under different kind of conditions, among different kinds of people, and dancing to different kinds of music.<br>It's more because of multi-racialness ( is there such a word? ) than anything else  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Just my two cents<br><br>------------------<br>Yours Sincerely,<br><br>*~RoMeo~*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>depends on the scope of the shoot and whether you'll be editing it or not.<br><br>if you're talking about a 15 minute lonely planet format with in camera edits it'd be better to concentrate on one area<br><br>if you do have access to editing facities though, it expands your options and the variety of shooting that is practicable as well as the amount of shooting<br><br>if so you might want to segragate it either by the time of the day(corresponding to the said entertainment) or the nature of it<br>rough example would be in the morning, shoot ah pei at tiong bahru coffeeshop(the one where they hang all the bird cages)in the afternoon, maybe fantasy island, lazer quest or something, and the clubs and pubs at night followed by the omni present prata store that opens until 5am which happens to be opposite the road from a lane of watering holes<br><br>it'd be useful to also consider the format you are shooting on to decide of technical problems might intercede with the practicality of shooting(eg format is grainy in low light situations, etc)<br><br></div>
