            <div class='col-md body'>Just curious to know what do you people think about trance music.<br><br>I'm just another trance freak here livin' in Singapore and i realised that not many people here likes trance music... is it too noisy or what is it that is so "not nice" about it? Or maybe is it just preference?<br><br>Another thing is that the trance scene in Singapore is not really "updated". Some tracks that had been released 2 or 3 years ago are being played on national radio. I mean there is no harm playing Good Old Classics but somehow i think that the radio should update itself on it's choice of tracks. There are many tracks which are "hot" and new but not played... not sure why too!<br>(The above is just a tip for people who likes trance music, if the radio don't suit your taste... that might be the problem)<br><br>Actually, i'm spinning trance at home... hopefully get to spin in a club or something. I also hope to get some feedbacks on how you people like/dislike trance, it would be kinda helpful for me be it a positive or negative reply (please reply!). And i also realised that trance are appreciated by Europeans more than Asians, is that true? LOL!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yer can bet yer sorry ass our indigenous folks here find trance totally Greek. Go ask every sick dancing phuck on this island their favourite lead and the answer will be...."OOoooo, I lurve Retro!". Enough said.<br><br>For the ignorant sods,trance music started evolving in the late 80's under three main influences: the first was the electronic new wave/industrial music, the second was the electronic techno disco of Detroit; and the third was the psychedelic music of the seventies. The first step towards what we know nowadays as Trance or Goa. Trance was done in 1988 with the introduction of the TB 303 sound into straight beat dance music, and the amazing effect it was found to perform over people dancing. This effect was further enhanced by the administration of a rediscovered drug called MDMA (or 3, 4 methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine) or as it was popularly labeled on the streets "Ecstasy".<br><br>.:: Honest, yet unmerciful ::.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Brandon,<br><br>On the contrary, I think there are many who like trance music here, it depends on who you're describing. ACtually, trance is such a vague term nowadays, what exactly is your kind of trance? I know of lots of friends into progressive house.<br><br>I have a friend who tells me that his DJ friend at a radio station has his playlist dictated by the powers-that-be at his station, so that tells you how progressive the station is...<br><br>I think an up-and-coming scene is the Jazz-Funk-House/triphop bar scene. It's a natural progression for those older who get tired of trance.<br><br>What do you spin? I'm interested  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>KO</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually i just wanna know more of how the general kinda people will react to trance music.<br>Yea, there are quite a number of types of trance out there but the question is directed more towards "If you had a choice, would you prefer House to Trance?" something like that, preference.<br>Yea, and for what kinda trance i prefer, hmm... try Marco V and Armin Van Buuren from the Netherlands, i think that their tracks are my type of sound. There are also many artistes who comes up with just one powerful track and that's it.. full stop (e.g Airbase's Emotion). Jam X &amp; De Leon creates hard trance which i like too! Yea, not forgetting Tiesto and Ferry Corsten.<br>Erm... as for your friend's radio station... which station is he spinning at? The statement i made on the other post was actually referring to you know... that only one station with electronica sounds... yea yea... you know!<br>Not to advertise but for your info. , i'm currently 19 and spinning nowhere but in my home (training). Using turntables and not CDs. But i'm stuck with a pretty bad mixer, gonna change one soon i guess (by the end of this year). The stuffs ain't cheap. Yea, i spin trance... from hard to melodic, driving trance (one of my fav. genre) and maybe a little of house beats.<br>Okay.. that's for now, erm... something about yourself?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Brandon,<br><br>Yup spinning isn't cheap. I never did because of that and I figured only if I'm going to make money playing gigs that I'll buy a set. I'll stick to software mixing.<br><br>Yes I used to be into the trance you're describing. That's really trance. Unfortunately, I grew out of it (I'm 22), but I know that the rave scene in the states might interest you. There, hard trance (amongst others) is the order of the day, and people get very euphoric, if you know what I mean.<br><br>Right now, I'm diversifying into funk jazz house and bossanova. Actually, I just checked out the band Energy at Bar None today for the first time and had a wonderful night.<br><br>Tell you what, I know of a friend who spins your sort, so if you're interested just email me at woosie@hotmail.com and I may be able to hook you up if you're interested.<br><br>KO</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, i'm quite into the kinda music i'm listening to. In fact, there is a computer software, not sure if you've heard of it or even using it now... it is called "Buzzmachines". This software is free, it is a software which allows you to create your own track with synthesizers and beat generators. Effects are also available. If you're interested, the website is "www.buzzmachines.com".<br>I really hope to spin in a club... hmm... what do you think my chances are? I'm 19 and still studying... i just feel that i do not know where to get started.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it's sad but true that trance music is not catching on as fast as I hope it would be. Seriously, when I was over in Australia for a few months I was instantly converted to trance music the moment I stepped into one of the clubs! There was no turning back.<br><br>For those that are interested, Liquid Room plays pretty good trance music on the weekends (I went last saturday. It was awesome!) but you have to dress well. They have rather... selective entry requirements<br><br>storm</div>
