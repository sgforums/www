            <div class='col-md body'>Well i guess i started crossdressing when i was 4. I will tell my sis 'let's go wear mum's lingerine' and my sis will agree and we will wear them. We will start giggling to each other. We were never caught.<br><br>Once, my mum was out shopping for clothes for me. She was getting frustrated because she couldn't find one suitable for me. Finally she saw a yellow skorts (shorts inside and skirt on the outside). She told me to wear it. The shopkeeper told my mum it's for girls. To which she replied 'never mind. it's shorts inside. anyway, still young.' We eventually bought the skorts and when my father learnt about it, he forbid me from wearing outside. Thus i only wear the skorts at home<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> It makes me thrilled enough.<br><br>When i was 7, i got into the same school as my sis. I started to fantasize about wearing my sis's pinaform. I will get up late at night and wear my sis's pinaform. After which i change school. My sis also change school. as such, my pinaform also change.<br><br>As i grew up, the urge grow and i started to wear my sis's skirts/ dresses even during daytime when no one is at home/ or they are busy doing something. It was great<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.<br><br>Eventually, I got into seconday school. My sis was in a different school but it never stopped me. I continue to wear my sis's school uniform. I also bought my school female uniform by lying to the seller that its for my sis. I also wear the girl guides/netball uniform when my sis was a girl guides and netball player. It was a shiok feeling. I want more.<br><br>Later on, i went to a JC. one bad occasion, i even stole a set of female uniform. I feel thrilled. From there on, i was able to wear skirt beneath my school pants. It was a great school day for me every day. I also went to toilets and started changing to female uniform, enjoying myself before i change back to male uniform. I was very scared to get caught in school. Sometimes, i even wore the school blouse(no pockets) to school but i was never caught<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I was caught finally by my mum wearing my sis skirt at home. Her immediate reaction was gosh you look quite nice on it. Maybe more nice than on my sis(I was thinner). After which she forget about the incident. I continue crossdressing. Sometimes now, i started to wear bra and panties when no one was around. It was choking but still great.<br><br>One day, i need to go to a beach but couldn't find a suitable shorts.<br>My sis offered to help and she lent me her pair of shorts which was obviously for a female. I was stunned. but I wore it outside. I was so happy inside.<br><br>Not forgetting the numerous occasions where my bro and sis said that i am very girlish. Outsiders also call me 'xiao jie' and laugh at me even when i did nothing. My friends also said that i am very girlish and made me wear skirts/dresses for dress competition during my secondary and JC years. It was thrilling to wear something i like in public. i always object to wearing but i always relent in the end.<br><br>Later, i was called up for army. I wish i could train up to be a real man. But it was never meant to be. My officers always said that i am very weak(worst in training) and very girlish. I feel inferior because i couldn't swim, couldn't do well in anything. An officer also told my parents that i am like a girl. don't dare to do this and cannot do it even if i try. To which my parents told me to drop out if the training is too hard and not to overexert yourself. Eventually, i passed and was posted to be a clerk.<br><br>These days, i bought lots of skirts/dresses/school uniforms thro online auction. It was great. But what really eluded me is an army no3 female uniform (preferably airforce's blouse and skirt). I will pay a high price of $50 if anyone wants to sell. 26inches skirts should fit me.<br><br>P/S: i only love to crossdress. I am straight like most of you. I only like girls and has no feelings for macho guys.<br><br>Anyone with crossdress experience care to share?<br><br></div>
