            <div class='col-md body'>It just might work...<br><br>What if you made something more of the whole "Chat Room" idea. I mean lets face it, what are chat room people really like, or rather what do the people talk about or do. In my opinion they piss me off, they're either really cheezy or they lookin for relationships...in other words in my opinion sad.<br><br>So I've an idea, it just might work if I get people interested. Well here goes:<br><br>You know how commercial things r these days, well there's probably a good reason for it, I say lets make a show of a chat room performance. Quite like Survivor, but on the Internet. If we have 4-6 really cool people on it, with own or nick names and we get along really well, people will start wanting to visit to laugh or whatever. We can discuss a whole lot of topics - the thing is it has to be clever/entertaining for us and all who start coming in2 the chat room. We can try it locally and if it takes on...we just might make a name for ourselves.<br><br>Well that's just all I have to say about it, if interested give me your ideas and opinions and lets see just how far we can take it.<br><br>If big enough...Commercialise it!!<br><br>-d79</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dave79,<br><br>I am always open to new idea ........... and I don't mind giving a shot at whatever thing that might be possible.<br><br>But my sincere apologises, i don't quite get some of the things u say, like make a show of chat performance. Ermmmmm do u mean some flash files or something similar........<br><br>And i keep getting the picture like its another of this type of forum is it, when u mean get a few pple who r really interested to start this thing, like as moderators?<br><br>Or r u trying to say in IRC? Sorry, really can't get the picture rite, esp since i dun go into irc often, in fact, almost never now...... care to explain further? So maybe i can give more feedback to u   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But one thing to take note that whenever something is successful, there are bound to be idiots ard to destroy them....... out of jealousy maybe, like in this forum or some chat room........<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Atti,<br><br>thanx for the reply, it's sure been awhile since I wrote that. Btw I luv ur slogan at the end '...EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"' - very cool cute.<br><br>I guess what I meant to say was this idea only works with a) No of ppl say 6 - 12 that r really cool, wether they r funny, unique r unusual. It's not gonna work with just anybody. b) It needs marketing and since we might not have the funds we need ppl to spread the word via e mail etc... or make the chat room something really really cool for ppl to just watch even interact with "us" the main characters. c) IF it does get noticed where to go from there.<br><br>So think of it like the online version of "Survivor" but it's a chat room scenario hence less cost less trouble more work.<br><br>But I stress again we need ppl that will make it work. Teamwork committment etc...<br><br>If u still think it might work or lets take it further gimme a buzz!!<br><br>Tanx for reply - some one can take risks, very cool<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okie, so does that mean irc, like open up a new chatroom in irc, or is it some other form of chatroom? (sorry my knowledge of such stuff limited). If that's the case, as the main character, we have to be online most of the time rite? If not how r u gonna make the thing work?<br><br>Paiseh, i dun really know abt the online version of survivor......<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah likea chat room in IRC, there's no online "survivor" I was meanin it would be like the TV show survivor but online, and yes we would have to be online enough of the time, ... but as I stressed be4 do you or I know ppl that would make it work - make it a success etc... the people we invite r crucial to the success of the project...<br><br>But btw even if doesn't work I appreciate ur concern and involvement in it...thank u I thought knowone would reply, knowing how few take-risk Singaporeans there r!!<br><br></div>
