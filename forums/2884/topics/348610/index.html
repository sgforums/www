              <p>Maybe the chick don't use to the food you fed it that why it mati. But don't worry chick will remember how much you love it. And you will remember it for life for the sweet memory it gave you. It lives in your heart.</p>
              <p>I also got a chick before==&gt; it grown to spring chicken.</p>
              <p>Then my parents slaughter it cos it gets too big to be keep at home cos neighbour complain they heard the chicken sound day and night.</p>
              <p>It kind of irritating especially at night. So papa decided to make into steam chicken.</p>
              <p>I didn't bare to eat it.. but parents tell me. "Chi chi" meat is more tasty compare to market chicken. I guess it is more worst than your case.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway my dog get super upset for sometime cos she lost her pet chicken too. They always play around.. dog always have the chicken head in her mouth and the chicken love it. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/cry.png" alt="cry.png"> </p>
              <p>Please consider your chick lucky. it die naturally not being slaughter lor.</p>

              <p>   Well i used to have chick also a few times i think 3 times all grown up big n healthy . But always never fail to become our dinner cos everytime it start to call in the morning , my mum will bring it to market to kill it . Then she will steam it for our dinner :P First time she steam it , she told us when we were abt to have our dinner that the chicken on the table was our chicken , we din really eat it as the moment we put the meat in our mouth , we couldn't taste anything n really felt guilty , so the 2nd n 3rd time she did that she keep quiet untill we finish our dinner :P .</p>
              <p>    And trust me , if you are going to do anything to your pets , they will know without you saying anything . When my sister bring my tortise to be released , my tortise keep scratching the paper bag she put it into and when she release it into a pond in a nature park , my tortise keep staring at her after swimming for a small round and even went back to her and only after she told my tortise that it is now free to go , my tortise then look at her for awhile more before swimming away but after a few meters ... it stare at my sis again before disappearing into the waters .</p>
              <p>   And as for my pekinese dog , well i admit my mum always feed it unhealthy food and we din buy any proper dog food for it cos my mum always say she feed it chicken drumstick . But actually she usually just feed it chicken innards and half boiled egg . And everytime after it eat the half boiled egg , it will vomit out after a few hours .</p>
              <p>   So to make long story short , when my parents 1 2 " let it sleep " cos it already has heart n bladder problems . That day it keep staring at my mum the whole day , as if saying how could you do this to me ? Then when they reached the vet , my dog actually trembled like it know its end was near . Somehow the vet told my parents that he will put it to sleep on another date , then my parents left leaving the dog with the vet . But according to my sister who visited it at the vet , my dog was still alive and was very happy to see my sister . But during the 2nd vsit , the vet told my sister that this dog dun belong to you anymore , he said that it now belong to another owner which left my sister very puzzled . But well thats end the story of our dog . Hope it really been adopted by another owner who treat it better then us .</p>
              <p>   I also ever rescued a big tortise from a drain before , it bring it home to wash then tried to feed it but it only eat a mouthful of vegetables then refused to eat more . My mum tell me usually they do this so that you will not keep it as they wanted to be free in the wild . So later i put it in my bag and cycled to a lake nearby to release it and .. you should really see the speed that it swim away , it keep swiming untill abt 10 meters away then it turn back to look at me then it disappear into the waters .</p>
              <p>   Never think that animals are stupid , they actually know what you are thinking , its just that they can't speak .</p>

              <p>yea i agree , animals are smart creatures.</p>
              <p>I think it was all my fault as I did not feed my chick properly. I did not think or even care about it . All i did was play my computer games as it was no longer " fun " anymore. Now , I truly regret what I have done and even though I care now , it is too late ...</p>
              <p>So , to all pet owners , please do not follow my footsteps. Treat your pets with love and care. Do not mistreat / ignore it. you will regret it someday if you do... When i found my chick was going to die , it could barely stand up. Thinking it was because he had nothing to eat, i gave him some food and water . He ate a few grains and drank a little water and I think he choked / drowned himself by the water as after drinking it , he lay down and died... Please Please! do not ill treat your pets... I regreted what i have done but it is alrdy too late... so , if you have a pet at home and is ignoring / ill treating it now , pls do somthing about it...</p>
