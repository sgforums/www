            <div class='col-md body'>TECHNICIAN Anthony Tan was horrified.<br><br>A football was flying straight towards his pregnant wife.<br><br>He and his wife were walking on the void deck of their block on Chai Chee Street.<br><br>The 32-year-old quickly blocked the ball with his hands.<br><br>He said: "It missed her stomach by a few centimetres. It would have hit her and hurt the baby had I not stopped the ball in time.<br><br>"My wife was horrified."<br><br>She was eight months pregnant with their first child then. She has since given birth to a healthy baby boy.<br><br>But on that same day in May, as the couple walked towards the lift, a teenager on rollerblades came rushing towards them.<br><br>"I put out my leg and the boy fell right in front of me," said Mr Tan.<br><br>"If I hadn't put out my leg, he would have crashed into my wife.<br><br>"I would rather the pair of rollerblades ran over my foot than my wife."<br><br>Although he was angry, Mr Tan didn't lodge a complaint with the town council, thinking it was just a coincidence.<br><br>Then, just a week later, Mr Tan was pushing his 70-year-old wheelchair-bound father-in-law back to his flat when a football came flying towards the old man's head.<br><br>Again, some teenage boys were playing football at the void deck.<br><br>"I was furious and shaken," said Mr Tan.<br><br>"My father-in-law had had a stroke and the doctor said that if anything were to hit his head, it could endanger his life.<br><br>"I've seen many old people walking around or just sitting and chatting at the void decks and these children just kick the balls around.<br><br>"The void decks have become dangerous places for people to gather."<br><br><strong>LODGED COMPLAINT </strong><br><br>After this, Mr Tan lodged a complaint with his town council.<br><br>"Some policemen came down to check and warned the children not to play at the void decks. But after a few days, these kids were back playing football," said Mr Tan.<br><br>He also found many football marks on the white walls of the void decks.<br><br>"Not only do these children dirty the place and disturb the peace of the neighbourhood by shouting during their football games, they are also a threat to the people walking there."<br><br>Another resident complained about the noise caused by children playing at void decks.<br><br>"They play at the void deck every day, though there's a field nearby," said housewife Madam PC Tan who lives in Tampines.<br><br>"They shout and talk very loudly at the void decks. Especially when they play football on weekends, they scream when someone scores a goal. They don't know they are very annoying."<br><br>Added Mr Tan: "I hope something can be done about this problem. We shouldn't wait till someone is killed. Prevention is always better than cure."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Muz be those Blady Huang Kia or Keleng Kia playing football!!!
