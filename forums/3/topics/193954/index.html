If the manager is brave enough to put him in the field, and this player is a fast learner it's just matter of time he will be a success. Don't always talk's about a player past achievement and claim that they are good, in football a player achievement normally come very late and by the time they are successful most likely they are already near 30's and not able to perform to their maximum as compare when they are young.<br><br>For England, did they achieve anything since 1966?

No player in command  in defence.

            <div class='col-md body'>IF SVEN STUMBLES TO WORLD CUP GLORY IT WILL BE THE GREATEST CON TRICK OF ALL TIME<br>3 June 2006 - reade, mirror<br><br>I'VE CHANGED my mind about Sven Goran Eriksson.<br><br>He's not that Peter Sellers creation Chance The Gardener, who became a US Presidential candidate due to his talent for spouting utter banalities which were mistaken for genius.<br><br>He's more Guy Goma, the Congan who turned up at the BBC for a job interview as an IT assistant only to be mistaken for a recordindustry expert and dragged on to live TV to reveal his wisdom on a subject he knew nothing about.<br><br>After watching the Sven circus lately, I'm beginning to think the Swede turned up at Soho House for the job of chief website archivist five years ago and was offered chief coach instead.<br><br>And whereas in the past he's let the senior players pick the team, now his days are numbered he's decided to see how far he can push his luck before he's sussed.<br><br>His decision to elevate Theo Walcott, ignore Jermain Defoe, persist with Owen Hargreaves, and play key players out of position in alien systems a week before a World Cup he's had four years to prepare for is surely a cry to be caught by the cops.<br><br>He tells us nobody in the England camp is confused. Well, try telling that to Jamie Carragher (below), who was gobsmacked to be told 24 hours before the Hungary game that he was now a defensive midfield player. So gobsmacked he got on the blower to Didi Hamann in Germany to ask him what it is you're supposed to do in that position.<br><br>Try telling it to Michael Owen, who knows as well as anyone that he cannot operate as an isolated attacker. Not even when he's fit. Or Steven Gerrard, who has never played as a second striker before. He's been given licence to forget about defending and feed off the attack, but he's never been asked to play with his back to goal.<br><br>Sven's defenders say he's been dealt a body-blow by Wayne Rooney's injury and needs to experiment with new systems to compensate. If that's true it's the biggest crime on his burgeoning charge-sheet.<br><br>When he inherited this socalled golden generation in 2001 he predicted it would peak this summer. Back then the only Rooney we'd heard of was the one who used to play alongside Judy Garland. So how did he allow one as-then-unknown player to become so pivotal that without him the golden generation loses all shape and purpose, especially when the necessity to find a Plan B without Rooney was spelt out to him in Portugal two years ago?<br><br>It is beyond belief, when you think of all the preparation that goes into taking a team to a World Cup these days (the dieticians, masseurs, dentists, pedicurists, etc), that the one thing he should neglect is a winning system.<br><br>The main reason England won in 1966 was that Sir Alf Ramsey had decided the previous year that the best way to impose his team on the opposition was to play without wingers. So in all the warm-up games that is how he played. It was rigid, it was criticised, but it suited his needs perfectly.<br><br>He structured his squad in such a way that he had two players for every position, and every one of those players knew what was required of them. When Jimmy Greaves got injured he didn't panic and push Jimmy Armfield into midfield, he simply called up Geoff Hurst.<br><br>Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe Sven is simply gaining comic revenge on a country that made him a figure of ridicule, and when it all gets serious he'll hit on an idea that makes us stumble towards the final.<br><br>Maybe when it matters the nucleus of decent England players will take responsibility and fashion a winning system between themselves.<br><br>Maybe come July we'll see Peter Crouch doing a triumphant Kraftwerk dance in Berlin as Sven sails off into the sunset with a puzzled grin and a container-load of Â£50 notes.<br><br>Well Guy Goma pulled it off, didn't he?</div>
