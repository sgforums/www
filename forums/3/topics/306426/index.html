              <p>Here are my own thoughts on the match;</p>
              <p>Tottenham played very well and did a good job of closing down the Man U players. It prevented them from being able to play their game. Tottenham actually were doing well against Man U at Old Trafford in the FA Cup and it was a personal mistake by Dawson that gave the game to Man U. Hence it wasn't surprising to see Tottenham play well against Man U at their home ground.</p>
              <p>Tottenham's goal was well and valid in my opinion because I don't think it was a handball foul by Jenas. For one thing, he was on the ground when his hand touched the ball. Moreover, he could not even see the ball so the contact was not deliberate. Plus, the contact was minimal and didn't even change the direction or impede the motion of the ball. Credit to Aaron Lenon for picking up the ball and good finishing by Berbatov.</p>
              <p>Evra was lucky not to concede a penalty because he was not watching the ball and the ball clearly hit his hand and the ball's motion did change. It wasn't deliberate, but I don't think the referee would be wrong to give the penalty.</p>
              <p>Tottenham showed lots of determination in this match right from start to finish and it was a tremendous team effort. Michael Dawson seemed extra determined seemingly with something to prove after getting sent off in the FA Cup match. But he did seem a bit too eager at times and might have gotten into trouble with the referee if he wasn't careful.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo as well was lucky not to get sent off for 2nd yellow because there were a few rash tackles in the 2nd half that seemed like yellow cards to me. Perhaps the Tottenham players were suceeding in winding him up.</p>
              <p>Tottenham was so relentless and were chasing for every ball that Giggs and Scholes were not able to keep up. With the game going so high tempo throughout, Ferguson needed to introduce the fresh legs of Anderson and Nani. Hargreaves wasn't tiring, but I'm not sure if he was taken off due to injury. Hargreaves was having a first half and it seemed the frustration was getting to him. So maybe subbing him off was a good idea.</p>
              <p>It would have been more ineteresting in terms of a title chase if Man U lost, Arsenal drew and Chelsea won. But oh well.... whatever happens, happens....</p>

              </span></p><p>The fine is imposed any time a team picks up six or more yellow cards in a match, but United will not face any disciplinary action after a number of players remonstrated with the assistant referee after Tottenham's goal. </p>

              <p>Meanwhile, Rio Ferdinand has defended his actions after he and several team-mates confronted the linesman claiming Jermaine Jenas had handled in the build-up to Dimitar Berbatov's goal. </p>
              <p>Ferdinand told the <em>Manchester Evening News</em>: "I thought they were fortunate with their goal. It was handball and how the linesman didn't see it I will never know. </p>
              <p>"I was behind it and I could see it and I don't know how the linesman didn't. That's why I was remonstrating with him. </p>

              Clonemaster, is it so hard for you to discuss soccer properly? Is your footballing really that bad, it's like you're not even trying.
              
              Could you at least read people's posts properly before shooting your mouth off? And showing time and time again that you don't know what you are talking about.
              
              And why is your obessesion with Man U so deep? So deep that you can't even tell me what is it you like about your favourite club or why you support them?

              Actually innosaint, how come to date despite me asking you a few times, you can't tell me why you like Chelsea or why you are a fan of theirs. There is nothing wrong in being a Chelsea fan.
              
              But even after I ask you, you seem more obssessed in talking about Man U instead. Why?
