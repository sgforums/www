            <div class='col-md body'>The whole of england does not rely on just one man, rooney. Engalnd is more than that and i am sick and tired of people saying that if only england had rooney for the paraguay match, things would be different. Well, let me be brutally honest and say that rooney is not as good as everyone thinks he is. have you guys ever carefully scrutinised rooney's playing style. He almost always charges with the ball before blasting it and hopes that god steers it in for him. he is virtually one-dimensional and seems to be interested in scoring beautiful goals instead of lots of goals. He is not a half chance striker like shevchenko or paulo wanchope who can spot and take advantage of half-chances. he is the kind who needs lots of playmaking support before he can score a goal. he needs to develop his game and become more active and dangerous in the penalty area where he can poach a lot more goals instead of charging like a runaway rhino and then blasting to the heavens. I mean, have u seen him score a goal with a header before?? Please do not misunderstand me, i am an england fan and believe that rooney is the best england has to offer but i firmly believe that england needs to play more as a team and to do so they need to refocus from rooney and get a new captain to gel them together. Beckham is no captain material, that honour goes to either gerrard or terry. a new captain can gel the team together to play cohesively. Only then can england become good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i disagree that he is one dimensional player and have to rely on playmakers. Actually he is the playmaker of the england team. the amazing thing about the WC qualifiers is that rooney NEVER SCORED a single goal but his contributions and assists were crucial to the team's success.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He is a player can affect the performance of the team, whether is assist or solo. His temperament do play a part to keep the team work harder and that's wat Beck is lack of. If he is being mark and not given the support from the team he will easily grow frustrated and lost focus. With his kind of character, he can't be a key man. But if the team work together, he can be the man to lead the attack from the midfield. He do command some respect from his team mate at this age. And with his physical advantage, where Joe and Frank is lack of, he is the only men can rub shoulder to shoulder with the big boys, then come the quick owen to support up front. He is the missing link between midfield and striker for a direct attacking formation where crosses is no longer a supply line.</div>
