            <div class='col-md body'>Heh. England with Eriksson &amp; Rooney = World Cup? Dream on. I'm a Rooney fan and I've to admit tthat he's a little overrated. But, I think the partnership or Rooney wif Owen looks promising.<br><br>Eriksson? He's a fool man. It's World Cup already and he's still experimenting. Why Walcott is selected? Ask David Dein(Arsenal Chairman and a top official in English FA). I think the influence is too big. Why not take tried and tested Defoe or even the wonder of the season, Darren Bent?<br><br>For the Paraguay match, y on earth did Eriksson take Owen and Joe Cole off and replacing them with Hargreaves and Downing? He shud take off Crouch! Mind u, Crouch has 7 fouls, more than half of the total number of fouls, and it's obvious that the referee doesn't like the way he wins headers. He shud be off and be replaced by Downing, Moving Joe Cole in the middle to play behind Owen. Cole was the only spark of the nite.<br><br>Lampard always ngei ngei lai(Hokkien). Yes, he can score long distance goal but THERE ARE BETTER OPTIONS AROUND! Wasting possesion will not win u the World Cup.<br><br>Rooney is back, which is a good thing. Cos only him and Cole are able to create sparks with their mesmerising runs. Go England!<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>rooney is nowhere as good as paolo rossi, gheorghe hagi or roberto baggio. He is just good that is all. he is not a god like the names mentioned. How can you guys believe rooney, injured and out of action since 29th of april!! to be fully fit and incredibly when he has not been playing much for so long?? Even if he does play, he will be eagerly picked out by the many black hearted defenders out there who would love to lay claim to his freshly recovered leg. Yoou have seen how ruthless trinidad and tobago are against sweden, avery johnson is not the only player out there who can hack rooney down. If i were ferguson, i would be pissed off with the fact that his career would be endangered by eriksson's insitence of playing rooney. Look at owen, he just recovered and he was never the same as france 98 when he scored that wondrous goala against argentina.<br><br>England needs to play as a team and the refusal to take jermaine defoe along will cost them dearly.<br><br>last but not the least, he is NOT a playmaker. How can he claim to be one when he fouls more often than he creates goals??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ast but not the least, he is NOT a playmaker. How can he claim to be one when he fouls more often than he creates goals??<br>you got anything to back that up??<br><br>I do agree that soccer is a team sport and all needs to play well in order to well.<br><br>take out Rooney, who else you expect to shine in England team?<br>or you see shinning in the first game?<br><br>- Gerrard?? To all Liverpool fans, he played well, cause he intercept so many balls. But wat's Gerrard true value? In the Champion League and FA cup, we saw it, he scored. Blasting the ball into the net. But did he? He played even with a back injury, and because of that, he can't aim well. So final verdict, defensive okie, but his main contribution to England Team, disappointing.<br><br>- Owen?? To all Liverpool fans, and Newcastle, he is the answer, or should I say, was the answer. How many shots he got on goal? I bet I can count on a hand. And when he is sub, he wants to have a showdown with manager. Really good attitude.<br><br>- Couch?? I only saw him, arguing his case again and again with the ref, until he shut up when a yellow was shown. He can do well when defenders are  naive lah. Look at Koller.. That's what height is used. Not for MJ's breakdance impersonations.<br><br>- JCole? He is ice-cold. He looks out of sort. He reminds me of MUFC no7. Doing the unnecessary so many times. Was out of his league when asked to be supporting striker when owen was sub.<br><br>- ACole? Really lack match fitness. Where was the Cole who slice other teams apart? Run into opposing 6 yard and blasting the ball in. He seems so lost.<br><br>- Lampard? He hit two shots. But otherwise, he was looking for JCole to link up but seems okie only. Really expect more from 1st runner up of World player of the year.<br><br>I think England needs a gel, someone to pull everyone together. Someone to play owen through, someone to push the ball up front, and lay it back for a Gerrard or Lampard to hammer home, someone to show his fire and push the whole England team onwards.  It must be a Gunners/Chelsea or Liverpool player's job, Surely, that's not Rooney's role.<br>He is too overweight, shrek-like, brainless, one-dimension, hot-headed, and lastly, don't know where the goal is.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>here are rooney's stats for assists and fouls for last season, 2005/2006<br><br>assists= 9<br><br>yellow cards=11<br>red cards=1<br><br>http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=30921<br><br>http://www.4thegame.com/statistics/premiership/assists/<br><br>If rooney can prove me wrong then i will be happy for england because i support them but i feel, too much emphasis is placed on one player to the point of neglecting teamwork and depriving others a chance to play like jermaine defoe<br><br>he is a good player no doubt but to call him a playmaker, the messiah of england, the one to carry them to the finals is a bit too much for me to endure. If rooney scores against trinidad and tobago, i hope it helps england to win instead of sacrificing his own leg. What us england fans need is for rooney to develop fully into the kind of striker like shevchenko, paulo wanchope, players who can score tons of goals from half-chances. There is no need for rooney to run with the ball so often that he aggravates his injury, he needs to learn how to poach goals instead of scoring beautiful goals. Owen used to be like rooney when he realised that his style of dribbling with the ball ala france 98 against france injured him more often than he would have liked. he developed his game over at real madrid and tremendously improved his heading and jumping abilites which used to his weakness. rooney needs to develop more and learn not to play like a two legged rhino. That being said, he is the best england has now and i will support england regardless of who is playing because he is the best of the lot they have got.</div>
