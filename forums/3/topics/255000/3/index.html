I mean, the whole environment, while emphaising on sports, also help to emphaise the education aspect too. That should be enough to convince parents to let their children bring glory to the nation, and as well as ensuring that they do not neglect their studies.<br><br>When Goal 2010 was introduced, i think it was plain obvious that it was not meant literally that we MUST qualify for the World Cup by then, but instead, it was a benchmark used, for us to gauge by then just where we are in terms of international soccer. When 2010 comes about, the S-League would have been in its 14th year of professional existence. We should see for ourselves just how we fare in Asia by then. And judging from the time since Avramovic became the national coach, I would say we are on track to becoming one of Asia's top 10 nations by that time. At the very least, it should be the bare minimum. Or else, we would have to take a long and hard look at ourselves and ask what's wrong.</div>

The main thing is that if we reach World Cup, don't tell me u realistically think we stand a chance of winning? Look, it will be a happy day for Spore should we reach the World Cup. I doubt most people will expect us to go far after that. And what the fans want is to see committment and pasison from the team. That's something that was missing in the Malaysia team, that's why there was this huge uproar. Don't think its only about the result.<br><br>I for one, will still support the National Team even if they get thrashed left, right and centre, AS LONG AS they show us the fire, desire and passion.</div>
