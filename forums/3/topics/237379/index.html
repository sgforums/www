            <div class='col-md body'>I think some referees are beginning to stand up to abuses by lashing back like Poll in his match against chelsea and the latest in the Wigan and Arsenal game.<br><br>however, the tag of "untouchables" should be removed and Referees should also be judged if they made the wrong decision.<br><br>Imagine Poll giving one play 3 yellow and then 1 red, but he is still referee for many top games. That's a shame and a joke.<br><br>Video-replay should be brought in to justify and no longer are games to be judged by a few naked eyes when so much are at stake.<br><br>Imagine those struggling teams, where it can means survival or down the drain...<br><br>I think much rethink needs to be done...</div>
