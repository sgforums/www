Gerrard should be playing in lampards current position, should be better cos lampard is selfish, he don't pass the ball to owen or rooney, he likes to try shots himself even if the strikers are in a better position than him. Owen today complaint that he is not getting the service of his midfielders. Always long balls to crouch only.<br><br></div>
