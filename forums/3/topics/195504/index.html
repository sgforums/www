            <div class='col-md body'>I think those who curse that England to be knock out early in the competition are hypocrites<br><br>Why? How many here watch and follow Serie A or la Liga closer than they do to the EPL?<br><br>They say they support Chelsea/Manu/Arsenal/Liverpool/Spurs and like players like Terry/Lampard/Cole/Ferdinand/Gerrard/Robinson/Rooney<br><br>But they say they will celebrate when England lose, No harm in that. But they say they don't like England because they are arrogant? Hello! Your fav players are playing for england, Are you saying your fav players are arrogant which in turn mean that players like Lampard/Terry/Gerrard/Rooney who are star players of your supported clubs are arrogant meaning your team is arrogant and everyone deserve to take a smack at them?<br><br>Don't stack on "Oh.. I celebrate when England lose" kind of feeling because 4 postors in the thread already say they don't like England.<br><br>It's dumb, And I saw a very dumb reply in the anti-england thread that I feel sorry for the postor<br><br>It's very stupid</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no need to be so serious.<br>EPL is flooded with so many foreign players, perhaps it's the foreign players in teams like manu, arsenal, chelsea etc that people like that's why they r supporting their national team instead.<br>The most popular players in the arsenal team for example are players like hendry who play for france, van persie, bergkamp (retired) for holland, swiss, ivory coast, togo blablabla..<br>i particularly dislike some of the EPL players like bowyer, dyer, rio ferdinand, lampard, woodgate, ashley cole etc.<br>the kind obsessed with fashion and playboy lifestyle, racist blablabla.<br>i don't know, maybe players in other teams in other leagues also have a lot of this kind of players.<br><br>it's up to personal perference lah, everyone have their own preferences.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by alwaysdisturbed:</div><div class="quote_body">whats the point in supporting a national team with most players 'imported'?</div></blockquote>Lol, few more years down the road, national teams all over the world, esp the richer ones will adopt the same 'foreign talent' strategy as Singapore. Singapore merely leads the way....<br><br>Just take table tennis, countries like USA, Australia, UK plus Singapore are heavily relying on players from PRC.<br><br>You see the point? Singapore has imported players because its rich and attractive.</div>

Because the english are the ones who introduced the game of football to the world. A proud nation, whom refused to participate in WC tournaments until during the 50s because they felt they are too good for the tournament.<br><br>In their first appearance, they suffered a 1-0 defeat to a semi-pro USA national team and was knocked out in the group stage. The win by the US against the English in that match goes down in history as one of the biggest upsets in WC.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>
