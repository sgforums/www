But in the process, they pushed the defenders to the ground.<br>So that's okie with you? if you say fine, then fine lor.<br><br>2) if you did, then you would have seen half the team walking towards the side of field with the coach waving to the players coming off.<br><br>3)I am unsure about tradition, but after acknowledging the goal, you go to start the game with a kick in the middle of field. You kick the ball out and then you start to complain. Make sense to you? Shouldn't you complain immediately after the goal?<br><br>If all your answers are "yes, that's fine with me." Well, that's fine with me too.<br>Just make sure you said fine when your supported team get the same crap, Okie?<br><br>I believe you are unbiased and intelligent fan..right?<br><br></div>
