The club's security officials have studied mobile-phone video footage and there is overwhelming evidence of police heavy-handedness and poor security. It is United's firm belief that the police took a dreadful risk by allowing in supporters who had black-market tickets for other areas of the Lens stadium.<br><br>One fan, Mark Harrison, said: "One young woman fell forward and was crushed against the fence. She was crying and tried to climb over the fence. When all the other fans saw this they started to panic and did the same thing. People were worried it might be like Hillsborough and so they started climbing the fence and trying to get out. The police started spraying us with pepper spray ... The police reaction just made things worse."<br><br>Another fan, Nick Boazuk, said: "I was genuinely scared for my life." </span></div>

Such flexible refereeing may be rare in Le Championnat but given that Thierry Henry has twice scored such goals in the Premiership, and once for France, the French game can hardly be unaware of the practice.<br><br></div></blockquote>hmmm...is there any action taken against Arsenal in both the Premiership matches or the country which T.H scored against..<br>btw...did they react like Lille???</div>

But the English club, instead of distributing the tickets to their supporters on their arrival at the stadium (or) on their descent from the bus, sent them out a month ago.<br><br>"The result - some very good forgeries, which have allowed some supporters to enter the stand reserved for them. All the forged tickets on the night were Manchester United tickets."<br><br>United rejected Lille's claims about the tickets.<br><br>A club spokesman said: "Tickets were distributed by recorded delivery 11 days before the game or for collection from February 1. We would normally send out tickets for our home games at Old Trafford six weeks before the match and we have no problems with forgeries."<br><br>It is understood United will strongly rebut Lille's claims in their report to UEFA and will raise the poor quality of the tickets provided by the French club. </span></div>
