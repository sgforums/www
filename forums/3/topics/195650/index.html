            <div class='col-md body'>After watching last night match, Chelsea's new Â£30million recruit Andriy Shevchenko looks like a waste of money. With Â£30million, they could have got Fernando Torres or someone else younger than Shev.<br>Anyway, he may still do ok but he won't last... cos already 30yrs old, won't improve but can get less effective in a short time. And if expected, chelsea will sell Gudjohnsen, Crespo and with Drobga, their best striker last year asking to leave, cos he knows his chances to play will be limited and also he wants to go to AC Milan (Bigger Club)...

My guess is one of the two Drogba or Crespo will be leaving. So chelsea will still have 2 strikers with one playing only cos mourinho will most likely play 5 in midfield cos too many midfielders... Lampard, Ballack, Essien or Makelele the centre 3 with 4 wingers fighting it out for 2 places. J Cole, Duff, Robben &amp; SWP. So little chance of them playing 2 strikers unless if they are behind which is very seldom.</div>
