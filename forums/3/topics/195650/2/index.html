Since you compare him to Henry, Herny moved to arsenal for 11M 4, 5 yrs ago when he was age 24, 25. Today he is coming to 29. Shev however will be 30 in sep 06, will most likely have 2 yrs at best before he is worth nothing in the transfer market... and no guarantee he can perform well these next 2 yrs too cos players normally slow down when they reach or about to reach 30. You can see that evidently in players like RVN, Folwer, Raul &amp; Ronaldo... who was once world player of the year... all seem to be not as good as they were say 2 yrs ago only... Thats the point.<br><br></div>

Chelsea spoke to sven before mourinho was appointed and not after... Since he was appointed, they have never seek other managers to date. At the end of last season, even roman came out to back mourinho publicly.<br><br>Another thing is, its mourinho who recommend to the board who he wants or don't want. Mourinho himself wanted shev sometime ago alrdy. And he has also said that if the board interfered with the running of the team affairs he will resign. Last year he told the board he didn't want Beck although the board was very keen to get beck for marketing purpose.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>k. point noted on sven. i somehow recalled that sven also spoke with roman during maureen's 1st season in charge. i cud be wrong....<br><br>however, i m not too sure if maureen can have absolute say over club matters. as i said, he knows tt he's in a position tt's much better than any other football mgr on planet Earth. he also know tt they r better football brains than him. for e.g. i rate scolari, rafa &amp; gus as more tactically astute than maureen. anyone of 3 can do a better job than him.  he'll back down when the occasion calls for it, esp. if it's roman. he will want to protect the special position he's in; infinite cash flow, player's disposal, top job in a top league, etc.<br><br>he can choose to walk away (which i believe he will later, i.e. leave chel$ki in an `explosive' way once he wins all that there's to be won), but he'll be a blip in an instant the moment he leaves the bridge. i think he reckons his 15mins of fame is not up yet.<br><br>beck's case was peter kenyon's idea. for that joker, i think maureen can put his foot down. for shev's case, i think there is more than meets the eye. my theory is shevo is the ONE call roman made tt maureen can do nothing about.<br><br>u can do the $ maths, look @ shev's form of late, check his stats, will maureen, astute as he is (as he is perceived by many) buy shev rather than a dime a dozen better players w longer shelf lives? he's not even top 3 in serie a scorer list this season and yet command the price tt he got? at this moment, he is like a `flop' waiting to happen in epl.<br><br>maureen can say anything to make him look good to the press/public when shevo signed. he's got too much ego to let others know that he's pinned down this instance.<br><br>also, club owners backing managers publically is nothing new. how many times this happens and the next, they are shown the door? putting up a good show publically is essential pr, nothing more. not that i am suggesting this maureen will suffer the fate of souness, houllier, etc....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Yes you are right, he don't have much say over club matters but he definitely have the last say on team matters as he have already said, who plays and who don't play is his decision and his alone.<br><br>Mourinho is unlike most manager we see. He is a rather proud man, so he won't accept interference on team affairs... As to the 3 managers that you mentioned, its still subjective. If mourinho were to leave chelsea right now, big clubs will be queueing to employ him with Real Madrid alrdy saying they wanted him.<br><br>There is some truth that roman may be the one that is the driving force behind the shev transfer but if without mourinho accepting, the deal may still not have gone through. Somehow or rather, some people still think shev can still perform at the highest level but i guess mourinho won't mind since the boss is willing to pay that kind of money it still benefit him in some ways, he has more choices to choose from even if its for 1 or 2 yrs.</div>
