            <div class='col-md body'>well, even the chinese had many players there but did not sparkle till Yao Ming..<br>remember, there was a CHINA guy who played in SNG, Ma-Chun, who went to US.but he only played college..<br><br>the key is that there are so many millions of players. and given our physique, we don't stand good chances.<br><br>so what if you can dunk, I bet there are many who can do that..<br>so what if you can shoot 3s, there are many who can do that too..<br><br>the key is whether you have went through a league where it is justifiable that you got the NBA talent..<br><br>perhaps we can send players to europe and if good, draft into the NBA.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and one other point about physique..<br><br>how tall is steve nash, isiah thomas, or their point? 6-2, 6-3?<br><br>now tell me, what positions does a 6-2,3, plays in SNG, centre or guard, denying them the chance to develop ball skills..<br><br>and when we get over 6-6, we become "wood-like" so rigid..<br><br>look at jordan, he was so nimble, fast..</div>
