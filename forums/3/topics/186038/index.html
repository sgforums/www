After the 60 min mark, take off Hleb and bring on Adebayor, push Van Persie to the RM role, making it 4-4-2.Then replace Fabregas with Diaby and Pires for Gilberto.</span><br><br>2) Is there the slightest possibility that Arsenal might win the Champions League this season?<br><br>Yes.<br>3) In the off-season, what players should Arsene Wenger buy? What void needs to be filled? Will Thierry Henry leave Arsenal for Barcelona?<br><br><span style="color: red;">Henry will stay.Wenger will probably buy Torres, a midfielder(van der vaart is a good, cheap choice) and a goalkeeper.I hope he goes for either Landreau or Hildebrand.</span></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They should start to look for a goalkeeper. I think Sebastian Frey of Parma(currently on loan to Fiorentina) is a good choice. A striker like Torres will also be good, considering that they should start 2 prepare for life without Henry, even if he is probably not leaving next season.</div>
