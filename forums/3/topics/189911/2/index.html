FA could have set that rematch was possible but would not affect current league standings.<br><br>Sore losers? Put yourselves in the shoes of the players, and the fans if you were to understand that you lost due to food poisoning. Have you never felt heartbroken when Thierry Henry was stretched out of an important match and lost? What do you think the average Spurs fan would feel to see their players playing after food poisoning?<br><br>Match injuries are part of the game, but I do not believe food poisoning is controllable especially when you dine at a reputable restaurant. Are Arsenal fans afraid of Barcelona, so much so that they believed spurs would claw back into CL with them failing to win in Paris?<br><br>For those Arsenal fans who mocked at Spurs, shame on you.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> </div></blockquote>Spurs raised the issue of food poisioning like any other team would have, even if the consequence of the final game was minimal.

Absurd. There's no juristiction for police to get involved. This is an FA sanctioned issue, within the guidelines and principles of the English FA.
