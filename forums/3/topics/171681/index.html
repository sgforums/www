            <div class='col-md body'>With Australia getting into the Asian Football/Soccer Confederation and being able to take part in the Asian Soccer Competitions namely the Asian Soccer Cup, and with Australia seemingly keen to have closer links to Asia and becoming more closely integrated with the region, I was wondering if Australia should take part in the quadrennial Asian Games. The Asian Games is the one that was hosted by Busan in South Korea last time in 2002 and which will take place in Doha, Qatar next year in 2006.<br><br>After all, besides Asian sports like Sepak Takraw and Wushu, most of the sports that are in the Asian Games are sports that Australians do play and take part in.<br><br>I would like to ask the forumites views and opinion on this suggestion. Please comment, thanks!!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Imagine having to play teams like S. Korea, Japan, Iran and Saudi Arabia. I think it is a mistake for them to come over to Asia. Good luck to them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know others might not agree but I was one of the Australia in Asia advocates. (as you all might guess from my posts asking Australia to host the Asian Football Cup and to consider them to join the Asian Games as well).<br><br>It is not entirely correct to state that it will be more difficult for them to qualify through Asia rather than Oceania. It will be easier if Oceania had direct entry to the world cup but if they had to play off against the fifth placed South American team then it is not really that easy. The fifth placed South American team is as good as or even better than even the best Asian football countries.<br>Uruguay, Colombia, Chile and Ecuador can hardly be branded easy teams.<br><br>Do you know that (and you might be surprised to hear me say this) if I had to choose between Australia gaining direct entry to the World Cup via Oceania and qualifying through Asia, I will actually choose to join Asia and qualify through Asia? Why? Because it will be more beneficial to Australian Soccer in the longer term and bring about a greater benefit to Australia to join Asia and for the A-League Soccer Clubs to play in the Asian Champions League rather than be caught in the Oceania group and play against third rate teams.<br><br>Australia will never improve playing the countries in Oceania like Fiji, Cook Islands and Samoa. By joining the Asian Soccer Confederation it will give them so many more competitive matches which will sharpen their competitive edge and improve their competitiveness. Playing against the strong teams in Asia like South Korea, Japan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain will benefit them.<br><br>The biggest problem the Australian soccer team faced in the past was lack of competition which boiled down to lack of quality opponents to play against in compeitive fixtures. Thats why they stumbled against the fifth placed South American team in the World Cup play offs.<br><br>Another benefit of Australia joining Asia is it will be the fairest way of them to qualify for the World Cup. If they qualify directly through Oceania it will be considered too easy for them and if they join South America it will be too difficult for them, therefore by joining Asia it will be neither be too easy nor too difficult. In a way it is a good, fair solution and arrangement and gives a good balance between easiness and difficulty.<br><br>And one last point I wish to make is that they are geographically closer to Asian than other continents like South America so from the geographical perspective at least, it makes more sense for them to join Asia.<br><br>Feel free to reply.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I understand your dislike of the white ang moh Australians especially for their racist attitudes. I also concur with you that we must not suck up to and give the white people any special treatment. It is because of this attitude that has caused the existence of the belief of white peoples superiority and supremacy over the non white peoples of the world.<br><br>For hundreds of years the white people have been given too much reverence and practiced opression of the non white people and this has happened throughout history, from the killing of Red Indians in America by the whites to the forced slavery of the African Blacks in America to the killing and hurting of Aboriginals in Australia by the white. Though there have been many cases of coloured peoples being cruel and wicked in their ways too (example Genghis Khan and the Japanese during the second world war), throughout history, the whites are hardly saints themselves and are guilty of cruelty and opression too. Another example is the Opium War by Britain against China in the 1800s and the occupation of China by the Western countries (though Japan was also one of the parties involved).<br><br>Thats why we Asians and other coloured people must not give them face and behave in any way to make them feel they are special/superior/surpeme. Our ancestors and forefathers have given them too much face already.<br><br>If there was anything good that came out of Japans conquests during World War 2, it was to show that the whites were not superior and the subsequent capture of hundreds of thousands of American/British/Dutch and Aussie soldiers as POWS showed the whites what it was like to be opressed, enslaved and treated cruelly.<br><br>I did my university in Melbourne, Australia and during my time there I hardly gave the whites any special treatment/behaviour just because they are ang moh and I was in a white peoples society. Treat them like any other race and this will humble them and make them less arrogant. I seldom hesitated to stand up to them and disagree and have any dispute with them when I felt I had the right to do so.<br><br>After all, Australia is not really their land, it is Aboriginal land and they took the land away from the Aborigines. The white Aussies are also laid back in general and not as industrious and hardworking as the Asians/Africans.<br><br>In conclusion and to sum up, I would like to say that the coloured people must show that the whites are not superior to us and we are just as good as or if not, even better than them.<br><br>Thank you for your kind attention.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To other Asian countries, Australia joining the Asia zone just means 1 less spot for the World Cup. It is almost as if they assume that Australia is going to qualify easily. The fact is, with teams like China, Japan, Korea and almost all the Middle East Countries, it will be quite tough. It will benefit both Asian countries and Australia in the long run to have Australia in the Asia zone. Because Australia's soccer players are similar in size to the Europeans, having them as sparring partners will help when taking on the rest of the world.<br><br>The rugby-like scorelines Australia gets in the Oceania region is a big joke. It doesn't help countries like Samoa at all when they just gets thrashed. Now, New Zealand is the only 'big' soccer country in that region, and Australia now can improve their status as a soccer nation in the Asia region</div>
