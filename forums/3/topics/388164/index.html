              <p>http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Sherdogs-Story-of-the-Year-22071<br><br>For
              the last few years, it has been debatable if any U.S. fight promotion
              truly had the merit to call itself the No. 2 organization behind the
              UFC other than by default.<br><br>That changed in 2009, as a regional
              outfit named Strikeforce matured from a four-show-a-year operation to a
              double-digit, major network-broadcasted promotion.<br><br>For its
              staggering growth, which included cable and network TV deals, as well
              as the signing of the world’s most coveted fighter, the rise of
              Strikeforce has been voted Sherdog.com’s 2009 Story of the Year.<br><br>It
              began on Feb. 5, when Strikeforce and the Showtime Network jointly
              announced that they’d reached a three-year broadcast deal for up to 30
              events, with an option for Showtime’s parent company, CBS, to pick up
              four primetime shows at its discretion.<br><br>CBS had been shopping
              for another MMA partnership since Pro Elite, which promoted 20 EliteXC
              and ShoXC events, had closed its doors the previous October buried in
              $55 million dollars of debt. Three EliteXC events had generated enough
              heat for CBS in 2008 to whet its appetite for similar content. Talks
              between CBS and Strikeforce began quietly that December, and the
              promotion is said to have been selected over other established outlets
              like King of the Cage and the UFC, which had met multiple times with
              the broadcast network as well.<br><br>Owned by Silicon Sports and
              Entertainment and 20-year-plus kickboxing promoter Scott Coker,
              Strikeforce had held California’s first regulated MMA event in March
              2006 to a record 18,000-plus attendance. By keeping overhead costs low
              and catering to its sports-hungry San Jose, Calif., market, Strikeforce
              had a reputation for turning profit, something not easily obtained in
              the industry.<br><br>Terms of the deal included Strikeforce’s $3
              million dollar purchase of select assets of Pro Elite Inc. -- of which
              Showtime owned 20 percent -- including the company’s fight library and
              inventories, as well as promotional and marketing materials. Most
              importantly, Strikeforce was given access to nearly 150 EliteXC fighter
              contracts.<br><br>Strikeforce CEO Coker said he and his staff reviewed
              the contracts carefully, noting which fighters might complement their
              existing roster.<br><br>“Out of those 140 to 150 contracts on file, I
              would say 75 to maybe 90 of those guys were from the smaller (ShoXC)
              league,” said Coker. “We thought it wouldn’t be hard to re-create some
              of those fights for Showtime and build guys that we wanted to build, so
              two-thirds of those contracts went away because of that.”<br><br>EliteXC
              champions Jake Shields, Robbie Lawler, standout Nick Diaz and others
              had their existing deals optioned immediately. Coker scrutinized the
              remaining contracts.<br><br>“[We Asked] Is this somebody that can
              become a star, a journeyman, a superstar in sport, and how do they
              currently match up against the fighters that we currently have?” said
              Coker.<br><br>Showtime aired its first Strikeforce event that April
              anchored by a middleweight tussle between Strikeforce attraction Frank
              Shamrock and Diaz.<br><br>Dave Mandel/Sherdog.com<br><br>Strikeforce is no stranger to<br>women’s mixed martial arts.<br>While
              some questioned if the contracts were legally transferable, Gina
              Carano, a star on NBC’s “American Gladiators” and a massive draw who’d
              made no more than $25,000 a fight during her EliteXC tenure, took a
              seat at the re-negotiation table with Coker. Coker pursued “the Face of
              Women’s MMA,” who’d also met with the UFC -- which doesn’t have a
              women’s division -- just one day before Strikeforce’s Pro Elite asset
              purchase. Coker signed Carano to a six-figure contract a few months
              later.<br><br>“In 2006, we did the first regulated women’s bout in the
              state of California between Gina Carano and Elaina Maxwell,” said
              Coker. “It was an amazing fight, a standing ovation. I’ve always
              believed in female MMA fights, and it was personal goal for me to get
              Gina back in the cage with Strikeforce. She’s a star.”<br><br>Coker
              promoted the first female-headlined major U.S. event ever on Aug. 15 in
              San Jose, Calif., where Cristiane “Cyborg” Santos iced Carano in the
              first round to take the promotion’s 145-pound title. Coker continues to
              bolster the promotion’s female ranks and has 135- and 145-pound
              eight-women tournaments planned for mid 2010. Promoting women’s MMA
              distinguishes Strikeforce from other top promotions worldwide, though
              Coker said that’s not the reason he does it.<br><br>“I always believed
              in female martial arts fighting,” said Coker. “To me, there hasn’t been
              a concentrated effort to say, ‘Well, we should do this because these
              other companies don’t do it.’”<br><br>Of all the A-list candidates at
              Coker’s disposal in the EliteXC purchase, Internet backyard brawling
              sensation-turned-fighter Kevin “Kimbo Slice” Ferguson was the lone
              high-profile fighter whose contract wasn’t optioned. Slice had done
              CBS’s best numbers, but was an MMA novice.<br><br>“We had the
              opportunity to pick him up, and at that point, we looked at our roster
              of heavyweights who could fight him,” said Coker. “We just didn’t think
              there was anybody that would match up well with him… Alistair Overeem
              vs. Kimbo? At the time Paul (Buentello) vs. Kimbo? Antonio Silva vs.
              Kimbo? Fabricio (Werdum) vs. Kimbo? I just thought all of those fights
              wouldn’t be competitive and that was the real issue behind it.”<br><br>Coker also questioned if Slice’s hefty EliteXC price tag would be worth it.<br><br>“Is
              he a 21-year-old potential who has a tremendous amount of an upside or
              is he a short-term solution when we’re really in this for the long
              distance race?” asked Coker. “I saw EliteXC walk on eggshells trying to
              match Kimbo… did we really want to be in that situation where we were
              walking on eggshells to match someone? We just didn’t want to do it.”<br><br>Slice
              parted ways with Strikeforce in August and was signed days later to
              appear on Spike TV’s “The Ultimate Fighter 10.” Slice’s inclusion in a
              house of UFC hopefuls brought in record-breaking ratings for the cable
              network, while the 35-year-old fighter’s December victory against
              Houston Alexander live on Spike banked over 5 million viewers as well.<br><br>Still, Coker doesn’t regret his decision.<br><br>“For
              his last fight, I think he’s fighting a guy that’s a weight class
              underneath him and they’ll always be looking for the right match to
              make sure he has the best advantage that he can have,” said Coker. “I’m
              sure we could have done the same thing, but we didn’t want to.”<br><br>Sans
              Slice, Coker made strong in-roads with the Japanese market to secure
              additional high-wattage talent. In early August, Coker announced a
              strategic talent-exchange alliance with Dream, one offshoot of the once
              great Pride Fighting Championships. Dream fighter Mitsuhiro Ishida
              graced the Strikeforce cage in mid August, and Coker’s flexibility with
              non-exclusive contracts has allowed the promotion to tap into talent
              like Jason “Mayhem” Miller and Muhammed “King Mo” Lawal, who both
              compete regularly on the Japanese circuit. Coker has grander plans for
              the partnership as well.<br><br>“The goal is to do a fight in Japan
              with Dream and have the best Strikeforce fighters fight the best Dream
              fighters and then maybe do another fight in America where they’re best
              would come fight our best,” said Coker. “It would be similar to the WBC
              guys fighting the WBA guys. We have a tremendous roster that’s
              improving every day and Dream has an amazing roster. To me, these guys
              need to fight each other. These fights should happen. In boxing, these
              fights happen all the time, so why can’t they happen in MMA?”<br><br>Daniel Herbertson/Sherdog.com<br><br>Strikeforce landed F. Emelianenko.<br>In
              August, another door opened when struggling promotion Affliction
              Entertainment cancelled its Aug. 1 event two weeks out, leaving a cast
              of 20 fighters jobless. The world’s No. 1 heavyweight, Fedor
              Emelianenko, was among the castaways and he was suddenly a free agent.
              As closed-door negotiations with the UFC soured, stalled primarily on
              the UFC’s unwillingness to co-promote with Emelianenko’s M-1 Global
              management, Coker flew to Los Angeles to meet with the Russian company
              as well to try and strike a deal.<br><br>Coker called the three-day
              negotiations, held in a hotel lobby and conference room in Irvine,
              Calif., last August “organic.” Not in the U.S. at the time, Emelianenko
              was represented at the meetings by M-1 Global’s Vadim Finkelchtein,
              Joost Raimond, Apy Etcheld and Jerry Millen.<br><br>A co-promotional agreement was reached for four Emelianenko-headlined events, with an option for additional shows beyond that.<br><br>Six
              weeks later and not by coincidence, CBS exercised its option to
              broadcast its first Strikeforce event on Nov. 7 from the Sears Centre
              in Hoffman Estates, Ill.<br><br>“At that time, I had no idea how much
              (signing Emelianenko) would change the landscape of our company,” said
              Coker. “I’m so happy that we did it because it’s just such a great
              relationship. I’m so glad we pulled the trigger on that.”<br><br>Emelianenko’s
              tense two-rounder against Rogers netted strong ratings for the network.
              The bout was seen by nearly 5.5 million viewers, and became the ninth
              most-watched live bout in U.S. MMA history. CBS will air its second
              Strikeforce event in April, with Emelianenko likely at the helm again.<br><br>In
              December, Strikeforce scored another coup in the signing of the year’s
              second high-profile free agent, former UFC contender Dan Henderson, to
              a four-fight, 16-month deal. At first, Coker didn’t believe he had a
              shot at the two-time Olympic wrestler and dual-division Pride
              titleholder.<br><br>“I thought Dan was shopping around, but that he was
              really going to go back and sign with the UFC,” admits Coker. “We had
              lunch and some informal meetings, but it really wasn’t until I got a
              call from his manager saying, ‘Yeah, we want to be with Strikeforce. We
              don’t want to go back to the UFC. We’re ready to make a deal.’”<br><br>Henderson,
              who makes his debut for Strikeforce on CBS in April, is the first top
              5-ranked fighter to jump from the UFC to Strikeforce. Coker doesn’t
              believe Henderson will be the last either.<br><br>“It’s a message to the fighters that there’s another alternative out there,” said Coker.<br><br>Possibly
              the promotion’s only black eye in 2009 was its inability to corral its
              heavyweight champion, Dutch striker Alistair Overeem, into a title
              defense since winning it in November 2007. Overeem, 29, was twice
              scheduled to put his crown on the line against Rogers and then Werdum,
              but withdrew both times with a hand injury. Instead, the former light
              heavyweight enjoyed a healthy run in Japan, competing in K-1’s year-end
              tournament and for the Dream promotion. Coker’s patience may come to an
              end in the new year.<br><br>“We always knew the fall was going to be
              busy with his K-1 schedule because that’s the way his contract was put
              together, but I want to make it clear that with Alistair we have a
              direct contract and his team have told me that he’ll be ready to fight
              in the second quarter (of 2010),” said Coker. “We’re going to hold him
              to it.”<br></p>

              <p><br><br>Overeem’s
              return will be much welcome, as a heavyweight contender’s bout looms
              between Emelianenko and Werdum, possibly in April on CBS.<br><br>In
              addition, a distribution deal with Shine International, which
              represents “The Biggest Loser” and other hit programming in over 150
              countries, has already yielded soon-to-be-announced deals on Bravo TV
              in the UK, Latin America and Australia, which will provide a widened
              revenue stream.<br><br>Strikeforce also struck a licensing agreement
              with video game juggernaut EA Sports in the latter part of 2009 and
              will be the “premier” fight organization featured in its EA Sports MMA
              game due out later this year.<br><br>With 16 Showtime and four CBS-broadcasted events slated for 2010, on all fronts, Strikeforce’s future looks bright.</p>
