            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho is ready to turn to Gianluigi Buffon in a bid to solve his goalkeeping crisis, according to the Juventus player's agent.<br><br>The Blues' first choice keeper Petr Cech is set for an extended spell on the sidelines after fracturing his skull at Reading, and Mourinho is believed to be keen to bring in an established shot stopper.<br><br>World Cup winner Buffon would certainly fit that bill, and reports that the Italy international could be Stamford Bridge-bound have been given added spice by comments from the 28-year-old's representative, Paolo Fabbri.<br><br>Buffon, who has four years remaining on his Juve contract, earlier reiterated his commitment to The Old Lady, despite their relegation to Serie B, but Fabbri admits his client could be swayed by the prospect of a move to West London.<br><br>"We are aware [Chelsea owner] Roman Abramovich can offer fortunes," Fabbri told the Sun.<br><br>"What he needs is to convince the player it's the right move for him. This is not a financial issue, it's about a chance in life.<br><br>"I don't think he wants to leave Italy, but things can change quickly in football."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Blues blank as Buffon wants to stay at Juve<br><br>Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon is unlikely to leave Juventus at least until next summer, according to his agent.<br><br>A member of Buffon's entourage had raised the possibility that the World Cup winner could move to Chelsea following the long-term injury to Petr Cech.<br><br>However, Silvano Martina, who has represented Buffon for 12 years, believes such a move is unlikely although he admits the player is 'honoured' with the link and that Juve would be tempted by any offer.<br><br>Martina told PA Sport: 'Officially there has been no contact so far.<br><br>'We are very saddened with what has happened to goalkeeper Cech.<br><br>'It's normal that a great club like Chelsea would show an interest or would be interested in one of the top goalkeepers in the world.'<br><br>Martina admits that a Chelsea bid would be tempting for Juventus.<br><br>He said: 'If Chelsea were to make an offer it would be very difficult for any club to reject it.'<br><br>However, Martina believes that Buffon remains firmly committed to the Turin club despite their relegation to Serie B for match-fixing.<br><br>Martina continued: 'Gianluigi's very happy at Juventus. He had lots of offers in Italy and elsewhere this summer and turned them down.<br><br>'But he made a decision to stay in Turin because he wanted to repay the club for helping him become famous and being one of the best in the world.'<br><br>Martina was adamant the player would remain with Juve at least until the summer when he will know whether the club has managed to win promotion.<br><br>'We will obviously be honoured if a club like Chelsea was to make an offer for Buffon but I can tell you that he will not leave Turin in January,' said Martina.<br><br>'We will obviously have to see what happens at the end of the season. We obviously hope that Chelsea don't need Buffon because it would mean Cech has made a quick recovery.<br><br>'I have been with Buffon for the last 12 years and having got to know him well he is one of the best in Italy and arguably the world.'<br><br>Buffon, 28, moved to Juve from Parma in 2001 for a world record fee for a goalkeeper of Â£35.5million.<br><br>Speculation that Chelsea might move for Buffon was raised when another member of his entourage, Paolo Fabbri, told The Sun that he could not rule out a move.<br><br>'We are aware (Chelsea owner) Roman Abramovich can offer fortunes,' he said.<br><br>'What he needs is to convince the player it's the right move for him. This is not a financial issue, it's about a chance in life.<br><br>'I don't think he wants to leave Italy but things can change quickly in football<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea have shown us how to beat Barca - Cannavaro<br><br>MADRID, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Real Madrid's Italian defender Fabio Cannavaro said his side should try and emulate Chelsea when they take on unbeaten Primera Liga leaders and arch-rivals Barcelona in the Bernabeu on Sunday.<br><br>Chelsea defeated the European champions 1-0 at home in the Champions League on Wednesday, and could have inflicted a heavier defeat playing on the break in the second half.<br><br>'Chelsea were stronger than Barcelona. They showed more commitment and belief when going for the ball. We need to play like them to beat Barca,' Cannavaro told a news conference on Thursday.<br><br>The last time Frank Rijkaard's side visited Madrid they produced a superb display to sink Real 3-0, and to make matters worse the home fans then stood and applauded Ronaldinho after he scored the third.<br><br>This time round Barcelona are missing leading striker Samuel Eto'o, who is out with a long-term knee injury, but Cannavaro said there were still plenty of other dangermen in the Barca squad.<br><br>'They still have the likes of Eidur Gudjohnsen, Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho who can score goals,' Cannavaro added.<br><br>'We know all about Ronaldinho, he is a phenomenal player. I don't know how you stop him. When your rival has a forward like that you simply have to cross yourself and hope for the best.'<br><br>Real's tails are up after a remarkable transformation over the last few days. They slipped to their first league defeat of the season with a miserable 1-0 loss away to Getafe last Saturday, which drew widespread criticism.<br><br>But then they put in one of their strongest performances with a 4-1 win away to Steaua Bucharest in the Champions League on Tuesday.<br><br>'There is a greater incentive in Europe than in the league. This is something we have to put right so that we can gain some consistency. He you can't have so many ups and downs if you want to win things,' Cannavaro said.<br><br>Real are fifth in the standings, five points behind Barca.<br></div>
