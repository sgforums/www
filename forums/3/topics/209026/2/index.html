It is understood Arnesen was approached by Porritt's agent Peter Harrison rather than Chelsea making the initial inquiry.<br><br>The Panorama programme said: 'In a meeting with the agent Peter Harrison he [Arnesen] offers a financial inducement to one of the game's brightest prospects, Middlesbrough's England youth star Nathan Porritt.<br><br>'At the meeting, also attended by undercover reporter Knut auf dem Berge, Arnesen says he is willing to offer the Teesside club's 15-year-old Â£150,000 spread over three years to induce him away.'<br><br>Porritt's agent also offers the player to Liverpool, and a club official talks positively about signing him when he is 17. Liverpool too have told the BBC they have not breached any industry rules.</div>
