            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea have too many big name players to field in a single match, now they know having many big names dun really work just like Real Mardrid. Now they start to look for young unknown telant just like Arsenal is doing.<br>It is not easy to keep all the big name in a squad, it is easier to manage a young team. Just like MU in the 90s, Chelsea cannot build the same team as them but to increase the nos. of young players by buying them.</div>

I couldn't progress as a player because you need stability - I never had that.<br><br>"It wasn't the position in itself that bothered me, just the fact I was always changing.<br><br>"I could have stayed on the left and become one of the best players in the world at that position, the same for the right-hand side - but I was never given that chance.<br><br>"You need to be given a whole season in one of those positions.<br><br>"Now, I'm recognised for my qualities in the centre - but that could have happened a lot sooner."<br></div>
