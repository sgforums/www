            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Charlton boss was ready to axe Bent<br>tribalfooball.com - September 21, 2006<br><br>Darren Bent is confident of a revival at Charlton Athletic after this week's Cup win over Carlisle.<br><br>Bent said: "It would have been a tough start even with a full squad if you look at the teams we have played (West Ham, Manchester United, Chelsea, Bolton and surprise leaders Portsmouth).<br><br>"But morale certainly hasn't slipped. Everybody is working hard to put things right and we are confident we will soon move up the league.<br><br>"The manager has come in, made some good signings and we have quite a big squad including a lot of good youngsters who can step in.<br><br>"We are all behind the boss and I'm told he suffered some reaction from the fans after the Portsmouth game on Saturday - although, personally I didn't hear it - and if that is the case it is disappointing."<br><br>Dowie revealed he almost dropped Bent for the Carlisle game after his below-par performance against Portsmouth last weekend.<br><br>"I had a word with Darren but he takes criticism in the same manner as he accepts praise and his face lit up when I told him he was playing," said Dowie.<br><br>"I felt he dipped below his standards against Portsmouth but he was much more like his old self in the cup tie. He's very important for us." </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Axe bent you must be kidding me the services from the charlton midfield is so poor still dare to comment that his perforamnce is below-par.........................it is more like the midfielders problem instead of Darren Bent</span></div>
