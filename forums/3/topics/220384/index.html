            <div class='col-md body'>hey being a manager for an epl club is already versy stressful, what more for a club like chelsea and man u.<br><br>I think mourinho doesnt want a heart attack lar, he wants to enjoy life in his 60s I suppose. he is now working hard for his money, when he reaches 60, he can kiss soccer goodbye and enjoy his retirement without having to worry abt money anymore. everyday go to beach with his family, sun tan and swimming.<br><br></div>
