            <div class='col-md body'>He's hardworking, makes celever runs at times and can score as well. Hard to see why most clubs won't want him. But, for a Spanish club to come after him? I don't think so. In Spain, football is slightly more indiviualistic than in England so he might be seen as a flop.<br><br>Being a Manchester United fan though, i can see why the club is linked with him. Apart from the fact that most hot prospects are linked with the big(ger) clubs, United are in need of midfielders, and strikers and defenders and keepers. But never mind. In the centre of midfield, all will be well if Owen Hargreaves makes an emotional homecoming to a place where he's never played before(club level that is). But, if that doesn't happen, they badly need someone else to cover. Sidwell might just do that, or he might not. But being there to make up the numbers can be a huge advantage, as can be seen with Chelsea.<br><br>Learning from Chelsea, midfielders can play everywhere on the field. In defence, in midfield(duh) and in attack. So it'd be great to have Sidwell at United even though i have no idea how he'd fit in.</div>
