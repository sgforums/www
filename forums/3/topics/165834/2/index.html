            <div class='col-md body'>pls la all u soccer fans dun insult this sport. singapore basketball loses out to soccer simply cos the government does not give enuff support or encouragement. in terms of soccer, i believe singapore isnt very good. and the fact that singaporeans are short and not fit for basketball is bull. in the NBA there are players who are shorter than 190cm. look at allen iverson, the league's top scorer is only 183cm. if ppl are willing to work hard to do well in basketball, then definately basketball will be more popular. i believe we have the talents but we dont have good coaches or facilities. take america for example, they have excellent coaches, superb facilities, indoor courts and gyms. widespread media coverage on basketball. recently i went to china. their TV has advertisements on basketball stuff, and they even have their own pro basketball league. the CBA or chinese basketball assoc.<br>the govt claims bball to be merit sport, i dont see no shit difference now from last time. all talk no action. basketball still not popular. the BAS is so freaking small. 2 courts. whats the damn point? its not even open to public for free i think. unless u pay to play, even if it is, its only a specific period of time. our local mediacorp dont broadcast NBA games like they used to in the Michael jordan era. many ppl claim basketball to be boring after MJ retired but i think it just got better. new talents like lebron or tmac or older players like kobe and iverson are simply interesting to watch. but i dun see whats wrong with broadcasting nba games rather than shows which no one even bothers to watch.<br>one japanese player recently made it to the NBA. his name is Yuta tabuse. he aint very tall. hes not playing now and has dropped out of the league for unknown reasons.<br>i believe singapore will one day succeed in basketball like other asian countries are like china or philippines. just hafta wait and see...</div>

Man U came singapore and trashed us flat last time. i wont say the score but we really got a thrashing. let alone talk about brazil??? and yes, singapore will have no chance to be the US team. however, other countries have beaten them in olympics, european countries - that is.</div>
