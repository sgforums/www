            <div class='col-md body'>sheva is a world-class clinical striker, his record shows.<br><br>but ever since he came to chelsea, he couldn't adapt to their style of play. lampard and ballack were too often clashing with each other. Robben is very ineffective and his body-language suggests that he certainly isn't enjoying his time at chelsea. forget about swp; his career is going downhill; if only he had listen to his step-dad, Ian Wright.<br><br>chelsea are certainly missing duff and his penetrative play. until j. cole returns to full fitness; there isn't much ammunition.<br><br>Drogba at times can be selfish; he doesn't have much trust in his strike-partner sheva.<br><br>I bet if sheva returns to AC Milan; he'll become Italian Serie A's top scorer; at least for a season or two.<br><br>Chelsea is a club which destroys talents. Sad to say; many players or rather mercenaries are wasting their time at chelsea; if only for the money.</div>
