At that time, it was really awesome watching Chelsea as they were tearing teams apart. Most teams would hold back just to contain them, But this season, it is different, seems to lose the pace.<br>But of course, they claim they got more quality.<br><br>Pace and quality is in the balance.<br><br>and now even Essien has to play right back.<br><br>a change or transition??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>more like fitting ballack and svech into the team to justify their purchase.. roman would not be happy if both purchases would end up on the bench... but when robben goes in, the team seem to pick up so much rythmn and pace.. i wonder why robben is always on the bench... lack of match fitness?</div>
