Unlike a certain clonemaster who seems to spend more time hating Man U than liking his own favourite club. But if you want to call others stupid because they are for a more objective view where Chelsea isn't the perfect or best club then you are the one being utterly stupid.<br><br>Just note, my not agreeing with you that Chelsea is a perfect club or the best club does not mean I'm anti-Chelsea.<br><br>Speaking of Chelsea itself, wasn't Mourinho the one responsible for comments that lead to death threats against a referee. And it became so bad that the referee resigned for fear of his life? And what about other things he has said about match officials? Mourinho even complained once when the referee got the correct call not to give a penalty. Can you see how imbalanced your viewpoints and your posts are?<br><br>I am able to see and accept both the good and bad not just about Chelsea. Are you?</div>
