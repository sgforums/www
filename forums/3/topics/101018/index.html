Rio has been steadying the ship... Ruud ,at last, is scoring goals from open play..<br>But there is still some way to go... Giggs has been v poor this season.. listless .. playing with no desire... Keane has been a shadow of himself... his lack of fitness has made him into a "fouling" machine ... giving away needless freekicks... and Ronaldo has to learn to be more unselfish... pass the god-da*n ball when someone is open !!<br><br>Currently , the favs for the CL have to be Barca , Juve n Chelski... Barca has been very entertaining... Juve has the team unity.. Chelski's defence has been top notch...</div>

Maybe he should just focus on defending rather than attacking too much. Yah he slip. Everyone slip, Ferdinand too. It's the pitch condition. But Heinze passing need to be improved.

Don't expect too much magic from him currently. He can play well for one game and didn't play well on the next match. Expect inconsistency for a young player.
