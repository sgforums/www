            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">Alam Shah verdict shows FAS is weak on violence </span></span></strong><br><br>THE manner in which the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) has dealt with the Noh Alam Shah-Daniel Bennett incident is disturbing.<br>It initially indicated its woolliness in curbing senseless violence in the field by limiting the suspension of the culprit's club career to Singapore, so allowing him to continue overseas, possibly with even richer rewards than in Singapore.<br><br>But it is in the matter of Alam Shah's international career that the FAS truly shows its moral colours. Faced with the difficult problem of having to do without the services of arguably its best striker in the more advanced stages of the World Cup, the FAS has finessed its way out by a 'solution' that brings into question its commitment to curbing violence on the field.<br><br>The FAS will allow Alam Shah to play in the World Cup provided three conditions are met. The first two are wayang conditions, and the third is particularly disturbing. The two players and the national coach are to sit down and Alam Shah will be reinstated if all three are okay with it.<br><br>Now, let's remind ourselves of what happened. Alam Shah inflicted vicious blows on Bennett, an incident so serious the victim was dazed and the examining medical officer said it could have resulted in death or severe permanent injury.<br><br>Now in the twisted logic of the FAS, Bennett is set up as the fall guy. If he is not 'okay' (and why should he be as the victim of a vicious attack?), the FAS could say to the fans (of whom I am one, incidentally), well, we wanted to play him but the three could not agree. In the public's mind, the accusing finger would automatically be pointed at Bennett. So the victim of a vicious attack is now set up as a victim yet again. This is the behaviour of the Pontius Pilates of this world and it is disgraceful.<br><br>Here is a situation where the FAS could have sent a strong message to players in the S-League on violence on the field but it ducked the issue because it deemed forsaking the glory of the World Cup too high a price to pay.<br><br>Yet, the problem is not difficult. It is difficult only for men with a muddled morality. In retrospect, it could be seen that allowing Alam Shah to play abroad while remaining suspended in Singapore is a cynical way to let the player continue honing his skills so they will be available in the World Cup while giving the impression that a penalty has been dished out.<br><br>We often read about players bringing the game into disrepute. Yet the FAS has done precisely that. Years from now, when violence on the field has escalated, we will look back at the lack of moral backbone of the FAS in this decision as a major contributing factor.<br><br>Eugene Tan Ying San<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Story/STIStory_193876.html" rel="nofollow">Straits Times Forum</a></div>
