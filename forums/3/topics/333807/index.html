              <p><strong>Table Tennis: Singapore's Olympic heroines will stay together</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Late last week, national women’s table tennis coach
              Liu Guodong rejected a new two-year deal offered by the Singapore Table
              Tennis Association (STTA), and his tenure is scheduled to end on
              December 31. <br> <br> The development followed quickly on the heels of news that women’s world No 6, Li Jiawei, was engaged to a Beijing businessman. 
              <br> <br> Both played key roles to help Singapore end a 48-year wait for its
              second Olympic medal, when the women’s table tennis team won silver at
              the Beijing Olympics last August, and Liu’s decision could well spark
              fears among fans of a break-up of the squad. <br> <br> STTA chief executive officer Chew Soo Sheng allayed fears on Tuesday
              that Wang Yuegu, Feng Tianwei and Li will no longer play as a unit for
              Singapore. <br> <br> Chew, who assumed the post on October 8, said: “They have all indicated
              that they will continue representing Singapore and, to the best of my
              knowledge, there has been no negative reaction to the news (of Liu
              rejecting a new deal). <br> <br> “I spoke to Tianwei (on Monday), informing her of Liu’s decision to
              turn down the new deal. She said she understood and respected his
              decision. <br> <br> “My technical manager Loy Soo Han also spoke to Jiawei and Yuegu (on
              Monday), and they also said the same. They, too, accepted his
              decision.” <br> <br> Wang and Feng are world-ranked No 7 and No 9, respectively, and like Li, are currently playing for their overseas clubs. 
              <br> <br> Liu coached the women’s team to a silver medal at the 2008 Olympics
              but, a few days later, was embroiled in controversy after a mix-up left
              Singapore’s top male player, Gao Ning, without a coach for his opening
              singles tie against Croatia’s Tan Ruiwu, which he lost 4-0. <br> <br> New STTA president Lee Bee Wah lashed out at the lack of
              professionalism and the incident soured the post-Olympics celebrations.
              <br> <br> Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, eventually intervened to help resolve the matter. 
              <br> <br> Liu then began negotiations with STTA over a new contract, but press
              reports over the last two days have indicated he has rejected the new
              offer, describing it as “insulting”. <br> <br> In a statement released by the association on Tuesday, the STTA said
              they had offered Liu improved terms for two years, but failed to
              persuade him to stay. <br> <br> Said Chew: “We offered him an improved package, better than his current one, but he declined. We believe it is a fair package. 
              <br> <br> “However, the door remains open if he changes his mind. We are always willing to discuss things.” 
              <br> <br> Speaking to TODAY, Senior Parliamentary Secretary (Community
              Development, Youth and Sports), Teo Ser Luck, said: “The STTA had
              worked very hard to give him the best possible offer, but we also have
              to understand that we’re competing with others for his services. <br> <br> “Liu has always been thankful for the opportunities here, and we respect his decision (to reject the new contract).” 
              <br> <br> It is believed that Liu has had coaching offers from countries in Europe, South America and Asia. 
              <br> <br> The STTA have drawn up a shortlist of six candidates to take over as
              the national women’s team coach and they are also looking for a men’s
              team coach. <br> <br> “We are looking at coaches from China, as well as those based overseas,” said Chew. 
              <br> “We also intend to promote at least one (local-born) male and female
              player to the national side next year, and those being considered
              include the likes of Pang Xuejie and Zena Sim (both from the Singapore
              Sports School).” - </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/">TODAY</a><span>/ro </span></p>

              <p>Like most Chinese nationals Liu is getting greedy and probably demanding a much better package. Li JW have more rewarding 'balls' to pursue now. </p>
              <p>I think it's better to let him and Li JW go.</p>
              <p>Unlike Li, Wang &amp; Feng are more likable and Feng is going to win an individual medal in the next Olympics.</p>
