            <div class='col-md body'>Man Utd's defence looks uninterested. Ferdinand still pondering if he did the right thing to sign the extension.<br><br>But looks like the midfield is the main culprit, giving Boro too much room to run at them and shots at goal. Not fast enuff to stop Boro's counter attack. Mendieta is not pacy and yest he's allow to have shots atthe centre resulted in one goal and one shot almost into the net.</div>
