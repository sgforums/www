            <div class='col-md body'>That Fabregas has been really impressive in the games he has started so far. Excellent array of passing range, pretty good off-the-ball position at his age.<br><br>If he can maintain the kinda form till the end of the Season, I bet he'll be EPL's young Player of the Season for sure. And who knows Reyes might be top scorer in place of Henry. Dun think Henry is worry abt not scoring enuff goals cos he knows he's been impressive in assisting his teamates so far.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to paperchicken:<br>yes highbury might be a small pitch than other stadium doesnt mean it easy to defend. because the opponent also have smaller gaps for them to pluck against arsenal attacks. the pitch is same size at either end. hehehee<br>when we go manchester where they have bigger field, does that mean our gunners cannot attack as good because highbury are smaller so arsenal cant attack as good. this are manchester /liverpool fans excuses for not able to beat arsenal.<br><br>to me the factor for arsenal success is arsene wenger. seem like most player under his guidance will become very good player. look at the star he is able to nurtured into stardom.<br><br>liverpool fan dont feel dishearted, coz you have got a proven coach of benitz who new influx prove to be very good player such as alonso, garcia which need time to adjust to english game, dont judge them by one game. vieira and pires and henry also take time to become a good player in english game.<br>nos.3<br><br>chelsea, i start to believe their rich and buy them glory. but i hope arsenal can beat them again this season and prove wise spending not splurging can bring success. nos 2<br><br>man utd, im sorry even u buy rooney i still cannot believe you stand a chance for this year title. basically they dont have the depth with the famous gang being dismantle and ageing. whose there to replace giggs, scholes, keane, neveille bros who are getting older. they need ferdinand back, heinz back from injury to shore up their defence.<br>nos. 4<br><br>arsenal treble!!!!!!nos 1 in EPL!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi... great post from "reyes"<br>btw .. a man utd fan here.. and i m nt going to whine abt gunners' success...<br>well.. there is nothing much to whine abt... they r playing football the way it should be played...<br>exciting .. free flowing football... when was the last time we seen such a brillant and exciting team ? i dun think that Man Utd's treble team was more exciting than this very impressive gunners' side...<br><br>at most importantly , they never fails to provide entertainment in each and every week of the EPL... that's how good the gunners are now...<br><br>but let's analyse the arsenal team... and u will notice something... this team nv stops running... for anyone who played or watched football , should know ... Pass the ball into a player whom is unmarked... n how do u get unmarked ? that is to run into empty space... it amazes me to see how hardworking the arsenal is ... being as talented as they r .. Wenger certainly has instilled a very good attitude into his players !<br><br>but for all their "good"ness... there certainly are weakness...<br>Lehmann --&gt; anyone remembered the "gaffe" he made in the CL last season ??<br>Lauren ---&gt; dun ask me why he wasn't send off against norwich ?!?!?<br>Ashley Cole ---&gt; he has been great.. for both england n arsenal<br>Sol Campbell --&gt; still out with injury<br>Toure &amp; Cygan ---&gt; impressive .. but for now onli...<br>Pires ---&gt; has not played much due to Reyes's outstanding form ...<br>Ljunberg ---&gt; the goalscoring threat in the midfield... but sometimes doin nothing at all..<br>Gilberto --&gt; always doin nothing at all !!<br>Vieira --&gt; jus back from injury.. can't judge him much...<br>Fabregras ---&gt; from the 1st few matches , can see his potential.. but i still have some reservations over him... is he as good as you all rated him to be ??? I would like to judge him over the course of the season.... having a few good games doesn't make u into a world-class player !<br>Henry ---&gt; brillant as usual.. but not setting the world alight... yet...<br>Bergkamp ---&gt; this guy jus get better as he gets older... his technique is 2nd to none !<br>Reyes --&gt; player of the season so far... red-hot... brillant close control n footwork.. always managed to wriggle himself free ... no wonder when Sevilla beat Real Madrid 4-1.. Zidane praised Reyes and said that this kid is on skates !! he can fly !!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>after watching arsenal somehow below part performance against PSV and Bolten, i have mix feeling. maybe afterall arsenal are not that unbeatable and seem shaky in defence at times. maybe the return in campbell in few weeks times would solve the problem. on the otherhand i feel, dispite arsenal offdays, they still cant be beaten. what does that tell you.<br>about justin comment:<br><br>but for all their "good"ness... there certainly are weakness...<br>Lehmann --&gt; anyone remembered the "gaffe" he made in the CL last season ??<br><strong>reply : agree, somehow not among the best keeper in the world.</strong><br>Lauren ---&gt; dun ask me why he wasn't send off against norwich ?!?!?<br><strong>reply : he has great overlapping run, good defender, getting sending off is part and parcel of the game, nothing to complain about. should ask the referee not lauren. by the way, gary neveile is worse. more own goal, more red cards and more silly mistake.no hard feeling just need to ask ma utd fans what they say</strong><br>Ashley Cole ---&gt; he has been great.. for both england n arsenal<br><strong>reply : great player, has clinchy as his backup.</strong><br>Sol Campbell --&gt; still out with injury<br><strong>reply : arsenal need him back badly especially against more deadly opponents</strong><br>Toure &amp; Cygan ---&gt; impressive .. but for now onli...<br><strong>reply: toure is been good not only this season but whole of last season. cygan is the weaklink in defence no doubt. really need campbell back.</strong><br>Pires ---&gt; has not played much due to Reyes's outstanding form ...<br><strong>reply: that the point, to rest a player occasional to refresh that why pires has score so many goals already this season, some even come on as subs. that show the depth of arsenal</strong><br>Ljunberg ---&gt; the goalscoring threat in the midfield... but sometimes doin nothing at all..<br><strong>reply: good running in the position esp in the penalty box. agree sometimes did have an off day and abit injury prone.</strong><br>Gilberto --&gt; always doin nothing at all !!<br><strong>reply : cant agree. he is pillar of arsenal unbeaten run. he seem doing nothing but he does little checking back against striker run, hold the ball and distribute to wing man that his job. he is not attacking man. his role is similar to makelele of chelski.</strong><br>Vieira --&gt; jus back from injury.. can't judge him much...<br><strong>reply : cant be judge, he is such proven player like roy keane.</strong><br>Fabregras ---&gt; from the 1st few matches , can see his potential.. but i still have some reservations over him... is he as good as you all rated him to be ??? I would like to judge him over the course of the season.... having a few good games doesn't make u into a world-class player !<br><strong>reply : agree too early to rate him, but i doubt he will get much opportunity for bigger games. maybe in FA cup, league cup and when vieira is injured, edu is on international duty.</strong><br>Henry ---&gt; brillant as usual.. but not setting the world alight... yet...<br><strong>reply : whether he play well for france is not arsenal problem as long as he play fantastic for arsenal is all that matter to arsenal fans. isnt it?</strong><br>Bergkamp ---&gt; this guy jus get better as he gets older... his technique is 2nd to none !<br>reply: my only concern. sure retired end of this season. maybe reyes will be full replacement.<br>Reyes --&gt; player of the season so far... red-hot... brillant close control n footwork.. always managed to wriggle himself free ... no wonder when Sevilla beat Real Madrid 4-1.. Zidane praised Reyes and said that this kid is on skates !! he can fly !!!<strong></strong><strong></strong><strong><br>reply : agree has great footwork and really know how to strike a ball well on a good day. and really off on certain days.<br>must develop a consistant game i hope.<br><br>no offence. just my thought, i have to defend any attacks on arsenal if possible on any reasonable remarks. but admit some weakness also.<br>thanks.</strong></div>
