But the good thing i like about current arsenal team even on off day cant be beaten as yet. yes we have a bad game against PSV and bolten but we beaten PSV and draw bolten. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>man utd mans dont be dishearted. last game against liverpool seem like a good display. but man utd problems hasnt stop yet. keane could be going jail soon. gary neveille is out. but Rio and rooney could be back. somehow i feel rooney will unbalance the whole man utd team. hope that im a wrong. i looking for a good match between arsenal, man utd, chelsea. may the good team win!!!<br>cheers for the EPL.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>im back, recently Arsenal suffer a drop in confidence and form. in fact for those arsenal die hard fans, you would probably know the reason for that. of course some say it is the physiological defeat against man utd. but i beg to defer to just narrow the reason as that.<br><br>it is due to the injury cause to Gilberto and Sol campbell. Gilberto play a similar role as makele of chelsea operating right in front of the central defender providing first line of defence and additional defender when it require. with him injured, vieira often has to run around the pitch making tackles and thus resticting him to support the front players. fabregas is non gilberto, no doubt he is hrdworking but he cant provide that cover for the central defender as he like to go forward. with sol campbell out, the central defender was even more expose with few cover that why arsenal often lack cover in the middle of the park when crosses start coming in.<br><br>i would strongly propose wenger to relook at this strategy while waiting for the gilberto and campbell to return as follows:<br><br>1.Lehmann-- no choice, but we need better goalkeep than him soon.<br>2.Toure :<br>3.cygan: no choice<br>4.Lauren: right back<br>5.ashley cole.: left back<br>6.vieira : central midfield<br>7.Lunjberg: right midfield<br>8.henry : striker<br>9. Reyes/pires :right attacking midfield and provid support to henry.<br>10. Fabregas : attacking midfielder, providing support to the wing men.<br>11. Edu : central midfield with Vieira, relief pressure off vieira.<br><br>these formation will not weaken the arsenal attacks through both wings attack but the the same time will pack the central midfield with fabregas, edu and vieira. not only it will provide some cover for the central defender and slow down attack from the middle and tough tackling from vieira and edu.<br>my choice : 4- 5-1 (in absence of campbell of gilberto).<br><br>wenger please consider my suggestion. only when the midfield is stable, tight, will we stop the defensive leakage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi chillz,<br><br>it does make a difference in formation whether it is 4-5-1 or 4-4-2. else there no reason to set up formation at all.<br><br>4-5-1 is to deal stiffen up the midfield esp against creative midfield team and to protect the defence better. of course it will hinder the attack abit and will rely more on counter attack. of course i dont favour arsenal use this tactics when we are at full strength. but this could be a solution in the absence of gilberto, campbell in the lineup. both are key man in the defensive midfield role and a pivot in central defence.<br><br>I dont like chelsea too, but in view of their current form and how they play in europe, i think they now stand a higher chance than arsenal in winning the premier league. i hope when arsenal play chelsea in few weeks ahead, we can at least have campbell  back in the defence. and gilberto recover soon.<br><br>to be frank too, man utd need to play a little more sportmanship when we meet again in league cup QF. dont resort to diving, stamping of the legs to win games. the team wont get any better.<br><br>May the best form team of the day win always!!!<br><br></div>

Ur comment on Man U is fair, perhaps they did went overboard, but Arsenal has shown that they wasn't able 2 cope with the hardball tactics that Man U 1st employ, at least the young players like Reyes n Fabregas. That's why a lot of teams started using blanket defence n close down the spaces to choke the creative players Arsenal have.<br><br>One thing that Man U n Arsenal lacks currently is a settled defence like that of Chelsea. That's a pre-requsite of Championship winning team. Look at the goal against column of all 3 teams n u get the picture.<br><br>The 2nd point is Man U is going through a goal drought 4 all it's strikers except Van Nisterooy n the midfield is also not contributing. At least teams don't play defensive against Man U since it's defence can b dodgy at times.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Arsenal faced a complete different set of problems as compared 2 Man U. Teams tends 2 clamp up when playing Arsenal as seen by Crystal Palace. Then try 2 hit Arsenal on the counterattacks with fast players. With the current setup, unless Arsenal score 1st, there's plenty of draws staring at Arsenal since their goals has also dried up n with their current dodgy defence, they r bound 2 concede the odd goal from setpieces.<br><br>3rd n final point, the squad depth of both Arsenal n Man U pales in comparison to Chelsea. When the going get's tough, Mourinho can look at his bench n find an assortment of players. This is a luxury that Arsenal n Man U cannot afford at present. There4 unless Chelsea suffer a complete loss of form in it's defence n upfront and also major injuries to key players, they r in the driving seat of EPL for this season n the title is their's to lose.<br><br>All Arsenal n Man U can do is win their games, especially the head-to-head against Chelsea n hope for the best.</div>
