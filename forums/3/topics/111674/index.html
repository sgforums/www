            <div class='col-md body'>If you have not watched 1st leg of the Tiger Cup final or read the papers already let me update you...<br><br>We won 3-1 giving us a 2 point lead.<br><br>What I was most disappointed about are the people who again and again predicted that Singapore would bow out at every stage of the competition. Now that they are very likely to win the Cup, I just want to thank the national team for making these people eat their words. Look at indonesia, they had a full stadium of 100 000 supporting them and our Lions.. OUR LIONS had virtually zero support and I'm not just saying in the stadium but back home as well where the word on the street was that if we were to win... it would be a fluke. Imagine playing against such odds, just imagine.<br><br>For goodness sake Singapore, I'm sure they shamed us all back in 2002 but let us rally behind them again and show our support  come Jan 16 at the national stadium. Let us not doubt them again, we all have our ups and downs ..its only human. From now on we have no where to go but up and this is arguably the best catalyst to kickstart singapore into a world class team. Haven't we proved time and time again that though we are a small nation, we still manage to prevail and emerge one of the very best in many areas? One can again argue that we "imported" players. From what i know, we only have 3 so called foreign players. Didn't we all start at immigrants? Most of us are either 2nd or 3rd generation singaporeans anyway and we are such a young country. Even france with thierry henry, patrick viera have strong links with the ivory coast and senegal.<br><br>I wish that years from now we can all look back on this period where our indomitable lions overcame the odds and won. I wish that people would see this as the very finest example of the Singaporean spirit and what it stands for... Discipline, Persevereance and Courage. Hopefully one more can be added and that is Family. Majulah Singapura!<br></div>
