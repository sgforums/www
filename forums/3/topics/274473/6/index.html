Chelsea having Roman a few years back was one of the best things to happen to the EPL, because it ended Man Utd dominance for quite awhile until last season.<br><br>And as a Liverpool fan, I doubt I would want Heinze to come anyway. He is nearing 30 in 1 or 2 years time, and that would only meant he is a short-term solution.<br><br>Was reading GP post about how other people are living in history. Doesn't he know that whatever happened yesterday or even a few seconds ago are also known as HISTORY? Which means that Chelsea's dominance was also history. What counts is this season, and what they are going to win. Every team is gonna hit a bad patch this season. Man Utd had it, Chelsea is going through it now, and Arsena as well as Liverpool are gonna have it soon. All I can hope is that come the end of the season, either Arsenal, Liverpool or Chelsea will end the season as champions.</div>
