Chelsea having Roman a few years back was one of the best things to happen to the EPL, because it ended Man Utd dominance for quite awhile until last season.<br><br>And as a Liverpool fan, I doubt I would want Heinze to come anyway. He is nearing 30 in 1 or 2 years time, and that would only meant he is a short-term solution.<br><br>Was reading GP post about how other people are living in history. Doesn't he know that whatever happened yesterday or even a few seconds ago are also known as HISTORY? Which means that Chelsea's dominance was also history. What counts is this season, and what they are going to win. Every team is gonna hit a bad patch this season. Man Utd had it, Chelsea is going through it now, and Arsena as well as Liverpool are gonna have it soon. All I can hope is that come the end of the season, either Arsenal, Liverpool or Chelsea will end the season as champions.</div></blockquote>This post of yours merely confirms what I was saying.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

'mudslinger' or 'mudstinger'?<br><br>I think you need to seperate between his tnp letters and the things he posts in forums. The content and tone is so different.<br><br>In any case, getting two 'Letter of the Week' or even 20 of them does not entitle one to be brash and arrogant towards others. I'm sure one's entitlement to be rude and insulting is not dependant on the number of LOTW one has.<br><br>If that's the case, how many letters does one require to be like the clonemaster? Who not only disses Man U but other clubs as well?<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong><br>i dun agree wif many things he praise regarding his team n mocking at others. but being neural, i feel dat wat he stated in the paper were not entirely wrong.</strong></blockquote>I can't quite agree with you regarding how to act being neutral, but that is the way you choose to act. I'm not saying this with reference to just what he post in TNP. If he posted in forums like how he does in TNP, I'm quite sure he won't be getting the kind of reputation he has today.<br><br>Your dislike of Man U is very obvious, but I hope you're not trying to protect him because of that. It has never been his choice of club or his being young that's been the issue. Besides, does being young mean he can be allowed to say whatever he likes? All the more he would continue to sprout arrogance when he is older.<br><br>I feel it's perfectly possible to be neutral and still disagree with GP as a person and as a football fan. Even Chelsea fans dislike GP, which says a lot really. The fact that even rival fans are willing to put aside quarreling with each other to take digs at GP already says a lot.<br><br>Many of the soccer fans here, no matter which club or even no club, are unhappy with him precisely because of the arrogance and the mocking of other clubs you talked about in your own posts.<br><br>I really don't know how to make you understand what I'm saying, it's one of those things where you either see the point or you don't. But the issue has never been about people disliking GP because he is anti-Chelsea, if anything, GP has made more people anti-Chelsea.</div>
