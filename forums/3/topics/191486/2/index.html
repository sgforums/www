            <div class='col-md body'>it is about time that `dogba' cheat leaves the epl, he realised he's at the end of the road alredi with his diving and handball admissions. england has no place for a player like him. he will fare much better in italy where many are like him, actors in the field. he won't be single out every now and then.<br><br>shev may come but he may not be as successful in the epl. it's too physical for a crafty player like him. defenders will close him down before he could even pronounce "roman abr...." ouch!</div>
