            <div class='col-md body'>Didier Drogba has shocked Chelsea by revealing that he wants to leave the Premiership champions.<br><br>The Ivory Coast international has revealed that the aspersions cast at him this season are behind his decision to want to leave Stamford Bridge.<br><br>A number of incidents have led some to label Drogba a 'diver' and the 28-year-old claims he no longer enjoys plying his trade in The Premiership.<br><br>The Â£24 million signing from Marseille believes the constant scrutiny has had a negative impact on his performances and has now revealed his preference for a move to Serie A giants Milan.<br><br>"It's not a joke. I want to move on and avoid all the pressure and scandals here," he told The Sun.<br><br>"Those things hurt my feelings. I want a place I can play freely without any drawbacks.<br><br>"You should know what a player goes through with so much pressure."<br><br>Lyon have already confirmed their admiration of the player and Drogba has said he will only move to a club who can offer him UEFA Champions League football, with Italy a possible destination.<br><br>"I admire AC Milan. But anywhere I go, the Champions League will be there waiting for me," added Drogba.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Unhappy Drogba eyes move</strong></span><br>Friday May 19 2006<br><br>Didier Drogba wants to quit Chelsea and leave the Premiership behind because he is sick of being labelled a cheat.<br><br>The Ivory Coast striker, who is going to the World Cup this summer, has been involved in a number of incidents in the last couple of seasons which has led to him being labelled a diver.<br><br>Now the 28-year-old, a Â£24million signing from Marseille two seasons ago, has had enough. "It's not a joke. I want to move on and avoid all the pressure and scandals here," he told The Sun.<br><br>Drogba added: "Those things hurt my feelings. I want a place I can play freely without any drawbacks.<br><br>"You should know what a player goes through with so much pressure."<br><br>Drogba said he will only move to a club in the Champions League and is eyeing up a move to Italy.<br><br>"I admire AC Milan. But anywhere I go, the Champions League will be there waiting for me," said Drogba.<br><br>(source: <a href="http://www.football365.com/news/story_185657.shtml" rel="nofollow">Football365</a>)<br><br>and various views from readers of Football365...<br><br><strong>Chasing Them Out Of Town...</strong><br>What fantastic news! Didier Drogba is jumping ship from the Wes'Laaaaandan Chavs. This sends out ALL the right messages for the rest of the Premiership. By that, I mean, now all we need to do is vociferously barrack the other cheats like Essien, Carvalho and Robben (etc, etc choose any Chelsea player you wish) and fingers crossed we'll hound them out of the English game also.<br><br>Before any of the Wes' Laaaaandan tradesmen and market-stall types start spouting that it's anti-Chelsea or/and anti-foreign players, I'll openly admit it isn't (God knows Joe Cole can feign the with the best of them). That said, Chelsea are a cancer and the more we can do to cut them out of our beautiful game the better.<br><br>Remember Chelsea fans, if I buy two apples at 25p each and two bananas at 25p also, it shouldn't take you ten minutes and a conversation with Trev' to work out it costs Â£1!<br><strong>Greg Whitehead</strong><br><br>...With Drogba?s admission that he wants to leave Chelsea because of fans (even his own) getting on his case over his constant and persistent cheating, diving and overreacting, can I just take this opportunity to thank and congratulate every last fan who took the trouble to boo him. The Premiership will be no worse off without players like him.<br><br>Pundits and the like generally overlook diving and cheating (see the scant publicity over Eboue's blatant dive in the CL final) and brush it off as part of the game. Well it shouldn't be a part of the game and it doesn't have to be.<br><br>In this instance, assuming Drogba goes through with his threat to leave, fans have shown that they can do something about these idiots. No fan wants to see players, even their own players, diving to win games. It makes the players and club look foolish.<br><br>Take Porto beating Celtic in the UEFA Cup. The stand-out memory from that game is not a goal or an outrageous piece of skill, it's the bitter taste left by the time-wasting and diving of the Porto players. I for one wouldn't want a trophy won by my team tainted by accusations that it was won by cheating. I know Ruud and Ronaldo have reputations for diving. Ronaldo in fairness is not nearly as bad as he was at first. He shouldn't be at it at all and I won't be happy until he stops it completely.<br><br>Fans have now shown with Drogba that they can do their bit to get the cheats out of the game. Don't let up on them come the new season.<br><strong>Gav Kirwan, MUFC</strong><br><br>...You've got to love Didier Drogba wanting to go to Italy. He admitted he was a cheat on national TV, but is now hurt that people call him a cheat and wants to go somewhere where they all cheat as much as possible. Then he'll be able to dive, kick, spit, flounce around like a big girl all he wants and they'll think he's great.<br><br>Has anyone seen that clip where Paul Ince got sent off for Inter Milan? I forget who they were playing but they were waiting for a corner and one of the other team, who was about five foot away, went down in a heap clutching his face. The ref charged in and sent Ince off! I bet Drogba could reproduce that, and if he could it'd be great because it was bloody hilarious!<br><strong>Andy Lahan</strong><br><br><strong>Dear Mr Drogba...</strong><br>So you don't wish to be labelled a cheat then...??<br><br>Well I have some suggestions that might or might not prove useful to you...<br><br>a) Don't cheat<br><br>b) Don't cheat<br><br>c) Don't cheat<br><br>d) If you can't manage to stick to any of the above - at least don't come out on TV afterwards and admit you cheated!<br><br>What a donkey!!<br><strong>Richard Casey, Manchester</strong><br><br><strong>More Sympathy For Footballers...</strong><br>You have to wonder how the average Premiership footballer manages to avoid buckling phsycologically under the sheer strain of it all. Take poor Didier Drogba, for example. As if having to put up with four half-days and one full day's work for around 30,000 quid a week (neo-slavery, as Ashley Cole's lawyer would call it) isn't bad enough, he has to endure the fact that people call him a cheat. When he cheats.<br><br>Outrageous, I call it, and probably an anti Chelsea/fox hunting/animal testing/Iranian nuclearweapons neo-Consevative Bush conspiracy, if you ask me.<br><br>Still, the man has a dream. He wants to play in a wonderful world where his feelings aren't hurt, and he can play more freely without any drawbacks.<br><br>Non-football translation? "I want to live in a world where no-one criticises me, whatever I do, and I can act as I please without any consequences."<br><br>Sounds lovely, doesn't it? After all, I can't think of a more deserving person to acheive that utopia.<br><strong>Andy Woolnough</strong></div>

He should know that in a team like Chelsea, nobody is indispensable. With their money, they can get replacements very quickly.<br><br>If he wants to go, then it will be better for the league. Dirty tricks are no good, whether you are Chelsea fan or not.  The same thing applies to Essien who may not be too happy with the arrival of Ballack and Mourinho's assurance of Lampard's place in the squad.  Could they be leaving together?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
