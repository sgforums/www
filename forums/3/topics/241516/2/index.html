            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Cristiano@Red_Devils.com:</div><div class="quote_body">I'll do a break down prediction.<br><br>QF<br><br>Milan v Bayern: Bayern is not enjoying a particularly good season, lying 4th in the bundesliga. Milan currently occupying 6th in serie A, but is enjoying a winning streak in the league and closing on 4th place. They are also more consistent in the UCL this season than Bayern. Although Bayern has the adv of playing the 2nd leg at home, i think Milan will emerge from this tie as close winners.<br><br>PSV v Liverpool: People are saying that Liverpool got lucky when they drew PSV in the q-finals, but i beg to differ. PSV has been pretty consistent in europe over the last few seasons, and the experience accumulated should make them a tough unit to beat. They also have the psychological advantage of having seen off an english team in the previous round. Having said that, Liverpool should have more hunger to win, as they are already out of contention for all domestic competitions. The UCL is now their sole chance of glory this season. And with Rafa Benitez at the helm, they can beat any teams in knockout ties. This should be a close tie, with pool getting some away goals in a close first leg, and finishing the job at anfield.<br><br>Roma v United: This is the toughest qf tie to predict, due to various reasons, namely because this is the first european encounter between the 2 clubs. Adding to it is the uncertainty in the availability of forwards in the United team in early April. Records of both teams in recent european seasons hasnt been good; First time Roma reaches the qf stage, and the first for United in 4 seasons. Considering the worst scenario for United, with only Rooney and Smith the only available forwards for this tie, it would be hard for United to carve out goals, esp the important 'away goal' in the first leg. They also have the distraction of maintaining their lead in the league, while Roma have no such worries as they are lying comfortably in 2nd in the serie A and have little hope of catching league leaders Inter. However, SAF and his men plays a different game in europe this season, and they are more tactically sound, as demonstrated in the tie against Lille. Added to the fact that they are an overall more experienced team and also have home advantage in the 2nd leg, they should just nick this tie.<br><br>Chelsea v Valencia: This tie will go Jose Mourinho's men's way. Suspension of key Valencia players from UEFA due to the round of 16 brawl against inter will aid the blues. Chelsea should be able to build a good lead to go into the 2nd leg, and play out a draw at the Mestalla. JM is hungry to beat his previous best record at chelsea of a semi-final appearance 2 seasons ago.<br><br>SF<br><br>United v Milan: At this stage, league distractions and fixture overload should prove too much for SAF's thin squad. By this stage, forwards Saha and Solskjaer shoud be back in the team. But ironically, this would also be the stage that they would bow out to a superior Milan team.<br><br>Chelsea v Liverpool: Yet another Blues v Reds european tie. Rafa has a slightly more superior head-to-head tie with mourinho in recent seasons, but i dont see Mourinho falling twice to the same opponent at the same stage of the same tournament. 'Revenge' in the mind is their best element of success. Blues to edge out the reds in this semifinal tie, and book a final place alongside milan<br><br>Final<br><br>Chelsea v Milan: I'm no Chelsea fan, but i got a feeling that this might just be their year. How many times have u seen Jose Mourinho lose a major cup final? (Correct me if i'm wrong, but according to my memory the figure is zero, during JM's 3year reign in english football) This will also mark the perfect farewell for 'the special one'.... Too much drama?</div></blockquote>The top half of my predictions have all came true.. Now time for the semis!<br><br>It's blues versus reds once again... this time round chelsea get to play the second leg at home, let's hope that they can triumph this time.. especially as it could possibly be the final swansong for JM in blue.<br><br>Milan vs United... i hope united can prove my earlier prediction wrong by ousting milan, but it would take a much bigger effort than the qf tie against milan's italian counterpart Roma. So let's keep our fingers crossed...<br><br>Something to add on about the english league this season. Somehow it appears to be turning into a Chelsea vs Manchester united season, with all other 18 teams in english top flight watching them compete against each other on all fronts, barring the carling cup which has considerably lower significance. This could be a highly possible scenario of the final rundown of the season:<br><br>UCL final: Che (ENG) vs ManU (ENG); to be played at Athens<br>FA Cup final: Che vs ManU; to be played at wembley<br>EPL: With 3 rounds of action to be played, United still unable to shake off the chase of Chelsea, leading by just 3 points (or less??)<br><br>What a season...<br><br></div>

I doubt so....<br>Hence...it will be a EPL and Champions League for SAF...and Jose will nick the FA Cup... as for Liverpool, they got themselves to blame for the early slip in the season....<br>but, watch out for them the next season..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>United has forced a superb result last nite with a last gasp 3-2 win over European giant AC Milan! Now the hopes of an all english final has increased, but the job is not completed yet. With a depleted squad at the moment, Ferguson would need to motivate his men further in order to avoid defeat at the San Siro and hence make it to the final.<br><br>Tonight: Chelsea vs Pool - Time for JM to exorcise the ghost of UCL semis elimination 2 yrs ago at the hands of Pool. Go Chelsea go!!!<br><br></div>

I had wanted to show this Chelsea clone that his fav club had players who dived as well. So gave him a few videos for ref.<br><br>Then GP comes and gives me all these links about Man U players when I'm not even a Man U fan. I mean, I would get the logic if he came up with clips of different players diving. But the fact that he only bothered to search for Man U related clips says a lot about his mindset already.<br><br>Could have searched for players like Diouf, Ortega.... But no.... at least 5 links all Man U.</div>
