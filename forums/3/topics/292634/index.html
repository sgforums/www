That is why he will go with Lampard, Barry, Gerrard and Beckham."<br><br>However, BBC Radio 5 Live correspondent Mike Ingham believes McClaren will drop both Beckham and Robinson.<br><br>"In the past McClaren has indicated early on that Paul Robinson will be his number one choice. He hasn't done it this time and I have a hunch it will be Carson.<br><br>"I think Beckham will be seen as an impact player from the bench.<br><br>"England will play 4-5-1 when they're defending and 4-3-3 when they have the ball and Beckham cannot play in a 4-3-3 because he doesn't play high enough up the pitch."<br><br>One player who will definitely not feature is John Terry - although the England captain did take part in training on Tuesday.<br><br>"There has been a great uplift with the players coming in on Sunday and especially with John Terry coming in and training with the boys," said McClaren.<br><br>"It's always important to have all the players together. We'll have John, Rio Ferdinand, Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney together with us on Wednesday.<br><br>"We've started together and we'll finish together." </span><br><br></div>

And he has plenty of experience of this kind of crunch match, with his last-minute free-kick against Greece that booked England's passage to the 2002 World Cup still a vivid memory.<br><br>Crouch is convinced his best chance of scoring the goals on Wednesday that would make him an England hero lie with Beckham.<br><br>"He's still one of the best at delivering from set-pieces or out wide, so for someone like me who scores the majority of my goals from crosses he certainly a player to have," Crouch said.<br><br>"He's a fantastic player for me. The last time I started for England against Estonia he created a goal for me.<br><br>"With someone like him, I just know I need to get into the box because, given half a yard, he is going to whip a cross in. An early cross is perfect for me and David always provides that."<br><br>Injuries to Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney have left Crouch to shoulder England's attacking responsibilities. It is a challenge he is relishing.<br><br>After several years as a figure of fun in the English game, the giant forward's record of 13 goals in 23 internationals has earned him respect but now he wants to be the main man.<br><br>"It's exciting for the players who are picked on Wednesday," he said. "They will have a huge chance to be a hero and put England through to the tournament.<br><br>"It's something you dream of. It would be nice to be remembered for the sort of goals that Michael Owen scored in the World Cup or David Beckham against Greece.<br><br>"Apart from a silly dance there's been a few great moments. But I haven't had a chance to play in a defining match when we can get to the finals. When given the chance I'm sure I'll be capable of doing that."<br><br>Under Sven Goran Eriksson England were serial quarter-finalists in major tournaments but, if they do make it to next year's finals in Austria and Switzerland, Crouch has no doubts McClaren's team can win the competition.<br><br>"We've got good enough players. It's time to show how good we can be," he said. "We all believe we have the capabilities to win it and there's no reason why we can't."<br><br>While Joe Cole hopes to spend next June and July helping England live up to Crouch's boast, the winger is ready to send his Chelsea team-mate Tal Ben Haim for a more low-key holiday.<br><br>Cole promised to pay for Israel defender Ben Haim's vacation if his country did England a favour by beating Russia on Saturday.<br><br>Ben Haim duly obliged and Cole has lined up a trip to one of England's less glamourous seaside resorts. He said: "Yeah, I've got him a few brochures for Clacton-on-Sea. He'll have a great time.<br><br>"Seriously, I'm a man of my word. It started off as a joke, and he'll probably say I don't have to do that, but I'll send him and his wife somewhere nice. I'm sure we can cut a few corners!"</span></div>

Although we only need a draw to go through, I've never believed in playing for one.<br><br>'Yes you have to be cautious at times but if you play for a draw it can breed a negative approach. It's better to take the game to the opposition and keep them on the back foot.<br><br>'You might only end up with a draw - which will be okay in our case - but that is better than trying to hang on to what you started with.'<br></div>

This season, carrying on from the back end of last season's games with Brazil and Estonia, we've found a style of play that has suited us.<br><br>"There's a belief there. Apart from 10 minutes in Russia, when we didn't play well and conceded two goals, we've performed for the last 10 games. We want to keep that going against Croatia.<br><br>"We might need only a draw but I think we'll go out to attack the game. Whether we play 4-4-2, 4-3-3 or 4-5-1, the aim will be to go out with good intentions to win this game.<br><br>"It's a dangerous, dangerous game because Croatia have got nothing to play for. That fact could be an advantage or disadvantage. It could go either way.<br><br>"Their players are very good technically and will want to come and express themselves at Wembley.<br><br>"We've got the game of our lives here so we do have to play well. This isn't a game where we can go in and think we can sneak it and not play well.<br><br>"Each and every one of us has to turn in seven or eight out of 10 performances at least. We have to get in their faces.<br><br>"Everyone will have a few butterflies but you have to put that to the back of your mind and concentrate on the the job at hand which is getting a result."<br><br>Cole also revealed he owes Chelsea team-mate Tal Ben-Haim a free holiday after promising to pay for a holiday for him if Israel defeated Russia.<br><br>He quipped: "I've got him a few brochures for Clacton-on-Sea.

I feel on top of my game.<br><br>"In the period between the England game with Russia and the one in Austria, over the last four or five weeks, I have felt very strong.<br><br>"Maybe what has contributed is that I came back very fresh from my time off because of injury.<br><br>"I had several frustrating weeks on the side-lines and came back when I was fit and available raring to go. I feel fresh because of that and sharp."<br><br>Lampard went on to discuss how the feel-good factor is prevalent in the camp, now England's qualification hopes are back in their own hands.<br><br>Fantastic feeling<br><br>"Now things are back into our hands in terms of qualifying there is a fantastic feeling in the squad," he concluded.<br><br>"Since I've been involved in the squad when there's been a big game on which qualification hinges, like in Turkey a few years ago, we've managed to get the right result.<br><br>"We've performed better in the bigger games, especially the ones to qualify for major championships and we can do it again against Croatia.<br><br>"We can beat Croatia.
