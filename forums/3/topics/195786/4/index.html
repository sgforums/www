            <div class='col-md body'>Against small fries teams like Paraguay and T&amp;T why not be complacent? Reserve the energy to take on no brainer technical ability teams like Args. These no brainer teams work so hard physically... England needs to conserve their energy to face them. Hope England can make them run around in circles until they run out of steam.<br><br>Then Becks effortlessly make a cross and Crouch heads it in or Owen / Rooney  slam it in. Either that or Gerrad without all that running like the Args simply finds a gap 30 metres out and hits it in at the corner of the goal. Beautiful... intelligence, brains, strategy.</div>

Although u can see the fluid passing of the Args in the first few minutes, but Serbia has one of the best defensive records in the qualifyings, won't u expect it to be a tight match?<br><br>of course u predicted it correctly in this case</div></blockquote>Because I saw the Serbs play with (was it) Holland? Holland nowhere near Engalnd's class but won anyway. But mainly because the Args passed so fast and accurately. I turned to my friend who was watching with me and I said: Look at that? How can the Serbs stop them? My friend agreed and said, no way.<br><br>He continued watching and I go and do other more interesting things.</div>

If you need to bet more and more to get the same excitement then you are in trouble... it is called tolerance and you are on the way... to hopelessness..... see my sig below.</div>
