And we'll beat Chelsea 2-0 this time."<br><br>Boss Frank Rijkaard has ordered his stars to meet Chelsea's physical power head-on to secure a vital win and keep them on course to qualify from Group A.<br><br>And Messi revealed he will seek divine inspiration to avenge the Blues' 1-0 win 13 days ago, courtesy of Didier Drogba's sizzler.

And I hope to God I score!<br><br>"We're facing a great team with a great boss - but we're up for this."<br><br>Barca will look to test Chelsea's third-choice keeper Henrique Hilario, who was in top form at home.<br><br>Hilario's last game in the Nou Camp was for Porto in their 4-2 loss in 2000.<br><br>But Messi added: "He made some great saves at Stamford Bridge."</span><br><br>too arrogant</div>

Drogba came off at Bramall Lane with a foot injury, and Shevchenko missed the game with a thigh strain.<br><br>For Barcelona, Lionel Messi is hopeful of a return to the starting line-up. He missed the weekend victory against Recreativo with an ankle injury, but the Argentina forward is now back in training and could replace Ludovic Giuly.<br><br>Gianluca Zambrotta and Lilian Thuram, Barca's high-profile summer signings, will also be hoping for recalls after being overlooked last weekend.</span></div>

He chooses that and he has been very successful with it. I can only have respect for that."<br><br>European champions Barcelona face Chelsea at the Nou Camp on Tuesday in a Champions League Group A match.<br><br>Barca are in joint second spot in the group, level with Werder Bremen on four points, and five behind Chelsea after their 1-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge two weeks ago.<br><br>"We have already played several times against Chelsea and we know how they play," Rijkaard said.<br><br>"They are not as quick as they were in the counter-attack two years ago.<br><br>"They have some players with a lot of talent. Chelsea are playing in a different way, with Michael Ballack closer to the opponent's goal. He has freedom and Michael Essien and Frank Lampard can overlap him.<br><br>"The main thing is that when they don't have the ball they are very well-organised, they do not give away much space and it's difficult to do something against them."<br><br>It is the third successive season that the two clubs have been drawn together in the competition.<br><br>Chelsea knocked Barcelona out 5-4 on aggregate at the first knockout round stage in 2004-05 but the Spanish club won 3-2 on aggregate last season en route to winning the final against Arsenal in Paris in May. </span></div>

Mick McGiven was present on Saturday evening to watch them win their 8pm League game against Recreativo Huelvo in front of 72,000 spectators.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Immediately after ChelseaÂ’s press conference and training session, Barcelona will arrive to hold theirs.</span><br><br>It is sunny and warm at present, just over 20 degrees centigrade.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">BarÃ§a name squad and discuss Chelsea<br>Tuesday, Oct 31, 2006<br>The 4-4-2 system adopted by Chelsea for many games this season, including the authoritative 1-0 win over Barcelona a fortnight ago, has caused a stir in Spain.<br><br>While the more flexible approach to team shape this campaign has not gone unnoticed in England (JosÃ© Mourinho returned to 4-3-3 for his three selections since that win), there has been little suggestion that the balance between defence and attack has been altered significantly.<br><br>In Barcelona that is not the case. Triggered by words from BarÃ§aÂ’s Mexican international defender Rafael Marquez, the perception among some in the city is that Chelsea are holding back more.<br><br>Marquez said on BarcelonaÂ’s official website: Â‘They appear to be less dangerous than last season going forward. They played with (Joe) Cole and (Damien) Duff on the wings last season and now they play more through the middle.Â’<br><br>JosÃ© Mourinho, Frank Rijkaard and Lionel Messi were all been questioned on the subject on the eve of the latest meeting.<br><br>Mourinho defended the ability to switch to 4-4-2 as simply a team strength.<br><br>Â‘Last season we were always 4-3-3 as a philosophy, as a system. This season we are able to play in different ways.<br><br>Â‘We play 4-4-2, we play 4-3-3,  we play in a diamond, we play in two lines. The team is much more mature in tactical terms so I believe the team is better.Â’<br><br>Neither BarÃ§a manager Rijkaard, nor their teenage attacking protÃ©gÃ©e Messi, appeared keen to echo MarquezÂ’s words when asked.<br><br>Â‘ChelseaÂ’s playing system has changed,Â’ said Rijkaard, Â‘but it is still a very solid squad and in terms of danger, they are still winning all their games.<br><br>Â‘Chelsea has not lost its solidity, so in this sense it is as strong a team as ever and the results are there.Â’<br><br>Â‘If Chelsea have a lot of new players this year, it is still a great squad,Â’ added Messi. Â‘Just like last year it was a great squad.Â’<br><br>Messi himself looks set to be involved in TuesdayÂ’s game having missed BarÃ§aÂ’s last two outings with an ankle injury picked up against Real Madrid.Â‘I have trained well and didnÂ’t feel anything,Â’ he said.</span></div>
