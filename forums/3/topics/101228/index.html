            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I know this is the EPL generation but I am still crazy over the NBA even without MJ.<br>This season just started 2 days ago and I invite people as crazy as I am over basketball to join this topic and we can talk about the results.<br>(Very sian cos at my office everyone watched EPL and no one wants to discuss about NBA!)<br><br>Lets start with the 2 following topics<br><br>1. Anyone saw Grant Hill's stats for Orlando magic? Its amazing for a guy to come back with seemingly no rust after all the surgery. Compare him to Antonio Mcdyess of Detroit and you'll get my point. Think Orlando stand a chance in the East?<br><br>2. Is this the end of Sacramento Kings? They lost horribly to Spurs and before that to Dallas and both were by huge margin.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that Peja is shooting horribly but the problem with him is he is a streak shooter. You have to play fast tempo and let him have many shots cos when he cools down, he may just lose the touch. To accomodate for Webber's ankle and Bard Miller, king's pace is a bit slower which affects his touch more. They have to work the chemistry out cos I don't think Peja is going to excel in another team.</div>

Kobe seems to feel that he is the boss now... the rest of the posse has to listen to his orders...<br><br>Shaq joining Miami.. shd be easier for the Heat.. as the rest of the Eastern Conference teams have always been disappointing (bar Pistons n Pacers)..<br><br>Hope to see a Shaq VS Kobe Final.. but dun think will get the chance...<br><br>P.S.

Not particularly interested in what other teams is doing, but Spurs are practically with same team, should be able to do well. As for Celtics, Ainges have been hiring and trading, too much players movement. Getting to the playoff will be their aim again this year.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>Have anyone check out the Jazz? There haven't lost a game. Carlos Boozer is averaging double double with &gt;20 points per game. And man, look at Kirilenko averaging more than 5 bloks per game !!!!!!!!!!! And he had 8 blocks against Denver and Lakers. He swatted Kobe twice and the ball almost went out of bound! I am a renewed jazz fan now. Just imagine if they get their PG back and a solid centre.<br><br>Team that I am dissapointed in is Rockets. Knew this would happen but love Yao and T-Mac. Hope things gets better with a real PG like Bob sura. Notice what happen to Sacto when Mike Bibby replaced Jason William?<br><br>Kobe isn't doing so bad and Dwae Wade is killing everybody. That kid can shoot!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shaq's trade to Miami has transformed the Heat to major title contenders instantly. Miami vs Detroit Eastern Conference Finals looks very likely.<br><br>As usual,its a lot tougher in the West. San Antonio will still be favourites. But I won't rule the Lakers out,despite having an almost overhauled new team of players. Any team with Kobe Byrant must'nt be overlooked.<br><br>I agree that Houston has been disappointing. Im not the biggest fan of Yao Ming. He's really quite overhyped and over rated really. It will take him a lot more effort and time for him to replace ONeal as the leagues most dominant center. Im actually sceptical that the TMac Yao 2 punch will work out.<br><br>LeBron James.Boy wonder but not in the right team.0-3 in their first 3 games, I wonder how long Le Bron will stay in Cleveland. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
