"Growth for most other clubs in the table has tended to come more from broadcasting and match-day income. Here, Real Madrid have broken the mould."<br><br>Real have generated commercial revenues on the back of big-name players such as Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and Robinho, who are part of a wider strategic plan to sell the football brand around the world through shirt sales and licensing deals.<br><br>The Spanish club's commercial revenues of Â£83.7 million eclipsed United's by Â£35 million.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Smart But Destroy Real Madrid Football Heritage But Now Real Madrid Quite Good Under New Coach Not So Lazy As B4  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> </span></div>
