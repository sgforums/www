            <div class='col-md body'>I think lots of people donÂ’t like him, even including some of the Chelsea fans. No doubt he is too proud and arrogant, but you have to appreciate his intelligence. Currently he is one of the best in the world. He is also a very hardworking manager, imagine the amount of preparation work he has done before every match.<br><br>Compare to our dear Fukerson, he is a shame to EPL. When Arsenal dominating, when Arsenal enjoying their 49 unbeaten run, this Fukerson provoke Wenger, provoke Viera, fight with Arsenal. Then now Chelsea is the king, he wants to be friend with Arsenal, no dignity? Really donÂ’t have, really shame on him.<br><br>He hopes Arsenal beat Chelsea to enable them to chase for the title, why? A superman needs to rely on somebody else to help him to fight? If stupid Man U is good, do they need to be like that? This is really disgrace to Man U. Man U is just another rubbish club that rely on other club to beat the king them to "look better". They SUCKS!<br><br>Then again, compare Fukerson to Morinho,  Morinho is a proud sh!t, but how about  Fukerson? He is a very humble person? He only good for using his mouth to start war, use his mouth to lick ArsenalÂ’s boots to make friend? Remember, even fight with Gerard Houllier? If Morinho is a piece of sh!t, then I can tell you, Fukerson is not more than a piece of bird sh!t.<br><br>You think Morinho won is just because he has unlimited funds? Then you should admit you only have 1/100000000 of his intelligence.<br><br>PS: Initially thinking of putting the title: Fukerson no dignity, he is good at licking Arsene Wenger's boots! But think twice, maybe some Man U monkeys not happy with this.... then start another thread to scold me, then run don't know where, and need to find a place to hide, so pitiful. Just like Fukerson, no dignity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You've simply answered yourself within your 1st paragraph. Proud, arrogant. That's why so many fans dislike him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>You just don't go saying publicly you want to win the league before Christmas, or that players are cheating, referees are dishonest, stuffs like that.<br><br>There is no doubt that Mourinho is an intelligent manager in terms of football. In fact, I think he is probably one of the better managers at player management . But however intelligent you may be, if you're an arrogant brat, it's always going to be hard getting people to like you.<br><br>Honestly, Ferguson and Wenger aren't much better themselves. Ferguson is not unfamiliar with the media bashings and clashes with other managers. Wenger, I still remember the invincible tag he labelled on his Arsenal side not long ago, only to be gunned down and lost the title that very season. Shades of arrogance coming in flashes from the Arsenal manager.<br><br>If you've been a football fan long enough, you'll realised that its usually Mourinho, Sir Alex and Wenger that land themselves in trouble with the FA, press or amongst themselves. That's ought to say something doesn't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Oh and btw, I seriously do feel that an unlimited transfer budget was actually a major reason behind Mourinho winning the League. If Ranieri had stayed one more season, I believed that he would have won the League too. Seriously. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

There is no question that Lampard is the player he is today because of Mourinho. Joe Cole too.<br><br>But both players weren't exactly as poor under Ranieri. They were still doing well. Lampard was still scoring goals and creating chances under Ranieri. Cole was showing glimpses of brilliance when called upon. Terry was a regular under Ranieri.<br><br>The thing about Chelsea is that they are a really strong side. They've got 2 good players for every position. Put in a half fit Lampard, Cole and Terry, you've still got a probable championship winning team.</div>

Djemba Djemba and Kleberson failed miserably. Phil Neville could not wait for his turn. Whether or not Smith will be converted successfully into an effective holding midfielder, only time can time.

Carvalho, Ferreira, Tiago, Drogba, Essien and Del Horno. But just calculate the amount of money he was able to spend to lure players that would never have been allowed to leave their clubs if not for the ridiculous transfer fees. Now that's financial power.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>And I haven't got started on Tinkerman's signings yet. Duff? Arjen Robben?

Been going through a rough patch at the moment but everyone goes through such spells one time or another in their footballing career. Veron has been disappointing. No doubts about that whatsoever, but all clubs get their fair shares of disappointment. Chelsea paid a lot of money for Meteja Kezman. He did not do too well either.<br><br></div>
