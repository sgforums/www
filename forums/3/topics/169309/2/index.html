Proud, arrogant. That's why so many fans dislike him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>You just don't go saying publicly you want to win the league before Christmas, or that players are cheating, referees are dishonest, stuffs like that.<br><br>There is no doubt that Mourinho is an intelligent manager in terms of football. In fact, I think he is probably one of the better managers at player management . But however intelligent you may be, if you're an arrogant brat, it's always going to be hard getting people to like you.<br><br>Honestly, Ferguson and Wenger aren't much better themselves. Ferguson is not unfamiliar with the media bashings and clashes with other managers. Wenger, I still remember the invincible tag he labelled on his Arsenal side not long ago, only to be gunned down and lost the title that very season. Shades of arrogance coming in flashes from the Arsenal manager.<br><br>If you've been a football fan long enough, you'll realised that its usually Mourinho, Sir Alex and Wenger that land themselves in trouble with the FA, press or amongst themselves. That's ought to say something doesn't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Oh and btw, I seriously do feel that an unlimited transfer budget was actually a major reason behind Mourinho winning the League. If Ranieri had stayed one more season, I believed that he would have won the League too. Seriously. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>Regarding Ranieri winning the title if he had stayed for one more season, I beg to defer. A well liked manager he is, but a manager to bring success even with a blank cheque book he is not. The moment Valencia (Spanish League Winners and UEFA cup Winners under Benitez) appointed him I knew that it will be hard for them to win the La Liga again least the UEFA cup. Indeed Valencia finished bottom of the CL group and was not even in the top 4 of La Liga come the end of the season. When Benitez left Valencia, the situation is different from when Mourinho left Porto. Following Mourinho's departure, core players from the CL winning side Deco, Cavarlho as well as Paolo Feriara lef the club as well. But for Valencia, no players left, unless for those snubbed by Ranieri. Ranieri is quite a good manager, but he doesnt have enough quality to bring a team to another level, one look at his track record(before he came to Chelsea) says it all. Well just my humble opinion  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
