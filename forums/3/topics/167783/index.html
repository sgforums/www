ALL SUCKS!</div></blockquote>Hafizul, ur comments abt the red devils are obviously biased as all forumers know.. but i do agree w u on the over confidence part..<br><br>The truth is.. i have watched the entire 90minutes of the match.. and i see a lack of 'fire' in a lot of players, even those experienced players who have been through the glory days and had always played like warriors laying their life down for the team when on the field.. but not anymore.<br><br>There are too many players playing below par. Are they too arrogant and over-confident that Benfica are 'sure-eat' opponents? Or are they simply not good enough to play on the big stage? I guess "Sir" alex fergie dont have much time left in the club to answer these questions... he himself seem to have lost the drive, even during the game last night, when he seemed so calm (or helpless??) even when his team is 2-1 down and desperately need to move up a gear or 2 to produce the goals they need to qualify. The substitutions he made, with the exception of perhaps Richardson for O'Shea, proved to be futile (Saha looked like a clown, trying to perform overhead kicks at inappropriate situations; Park JS failed to provide the spark required to re-ignite a dying side)<br><br>The following is the ratings i would like to give the Man United players for that match.<br><br>Van der Sar 6 (conceded 2 goals but cant be blamed for either of them)<br><br>G.Neville 6 (provided assist to scholes, but besides that, did not venture up the wings as much as he used to do)<br><br>Ferdinand 6 (distributed play from the back instead of making rash clearances like his defensive partners)<br><br>Silvestre 5 (poor marking resulting in 1st goal from Geovanni; too many indecisive passes in United's own backyard that puts his teammates in trouble)<br><br>O'Shea 5 (Poor defensive ability cruelly exposed by the tricky wingers of Benfica; poor defending led to 1st goal being crossed through his legs)<br><br>C.Ronaldo 5 (Cant tell which position was he playing at, as he was everywhere on the pitch.. did SAF gave him a free role to roam abt? i dont think so.. And at times he seem more interested in showing off his footy skills rather than providing the passes that his team desperately need; a poor return to his homeland)<br><br>Scholes 7 (The only bright spark in midfield, constantly asking for the ball and dictating play; His opening goal look like singapore sch boys playing street soccer standard though  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>Smith 6 (Solid in the middle, but as usual, lack the penatrative passes to his teammates up front, and also dont have ability to distribute cross field passes like Scholes)<br><br>Giggs 5 (Can only say one thing.. i think his engine rusty liao, dont even run at defenders anymore when the ball is at his feet and down the wing)<br><br>RVN 6 (Very helpless and lack of proper service)<br><br>Rooney 7 (The only player who gave his all and fought for every ball for the entire 90minutes)<br><br>Subs:<br>Park JS 5 (he did nothing)<br>Saha 4 (clown, a waste of time and money)<br>Richardson 6 (did rather well but SAF only gave him 5 pathetic minutes to rescue the team)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Indeed it is a surpring result. But give credit when its due to Benfica, they played as a collective unit and played like thier lifes depended on it. For Man Utd, apart from Scholes and Rooney whom tried hard, the rest were just not good enough to cause problems for Benfica. The substituitions made by Sir Alex didnt cause much of a problem for the Benfica defense too.<br><br>True Man Utd had most of the possession, but they never look like penetrating the well organized Benfica defense, but in contrast, whenever Benfica had the possession, they always look dangerous on the break.<br><br>But alias at the end of the day, Benfica may not go far in the CL, but what they have done is prevented Man Utd from going to the next round.<br><br>Some serious changes have to be made at Old Trafford and the alarms bells are surely ringing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I can only think of 1 reason...Wasteful Possesion.<br><br>Despite Benfica only having 39% of the overall possesion, they still managed to pull off 4 shots on target; 1 more than Man Utd, who had 61% of the possession throughout the game. IMHO, C.Ronaldo should be benched, Park should be given a more influential role in the team, and Giuseppe Rossi ( who has been scoring quite a bit for the reserves) should be given a runout in the Squad, maybe as a Super-sub. Although i'm not a Man Utd fan, i can't help but feel sorry for them..first Vodafone cancels their sponsorship deal with the club, then this happens..not to mention their still paying off the massive debts caused by Glazer..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not really surprising.<br><br>How the high and mighty have fallen.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think many of you people are underestimating Benfica. True, they are not a great team and they are struggling in their league. But they do have a certain standard and if the likes of Wolves and Norwich can upset Man U there's no reason why Benfica cannot do the same, especially when the ref is kelong and the Man U players are like ****.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>damn! i saw the post match...the 1st goal for benfica is both rio ferdinand and van der sar's fault...ferdinand didnt even put pressure on the running man..of course he can do a diving header...and van der sar...wat kinda goalkeeper is he... the ball didnt go by the corners of the goalpost..is was like so near to him and he didnt even make an effort to dive...2nd goal ok la..a reflection so cant blame him too much...</div>
