            <div class='col-md body'>Extracted from MSNBC<br><br>LONDON (AP) - England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson thinks he has finally discovered the correct roles for midfielders David Beckham, Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard.<br><br>He'll test out his new formation against Argentina on Saturday.<br><br>Accused of blundering his way through qualifying for next year's World Cup finals in Germany, the Swede appears to have won over some of his critics.<br><br>Now, Eriksson said he is planning to field his strongest available lineup against Argentina in Geneva.<br><br>"We are meeting one of the best teams in the world,'' Eriksson said. "It's important for our confidence that we do well in this game and important for the England fans as well. If they see we can play good football against Argentina it gives us more hope for next summer.''<br><br>Eriksson has had major problems trying to fit in his three favorite midfielders. Now, he's set to play a 4-4-2 formation with Tottenham defender Ledley King in a holding role.<br><br>Beckham is set to start on the right, Gerrard on the left and Lampard behind a front two of Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney.<br><br>King debuted in his new role in last month's 2-1 World Cup qualifying victory against Poland, which helped already-qualified England win its group. He only played because Gerrard had a leg muscle injury.<br><br>Although England now has several top center backs and a reliable goalkeeper in Tottenham's Paul Robinson, the team's bid to win the World Cup for the first time in 40 years may come down to how well Rooney plays.<br><br>The Manchester United forward, who is only 20 but a Premier League player for four seasons, has scored four goals in 11 Premier League games and created several others. He is also willing to help out his defenders.<br><br>One of Eriksson's rivals, Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann, warned Tuesday that England should not expect too much of the young striker.<br><br>"I hope that fans and the media do not burden him with the expectations of an entire country,'' Klinsmann said. "He is surrounded by other established and accomplished players, who can and will, contribute to the team's performance.<br><br>"Wayne Rooney is, undoubtedly, one of the most talented young players in the world today. Rooney is that rare player who appears to play by intuition and is able to change the course of a game with powerful runs, strong shooting and incisive passing.''<br><br>With many of his squad based in Europe, Argentina coach Jose Pekerman can call upon the likes of Juan Roman Riquelme, Juan Pablo Sorin and Roberto Ayala as well as striker Hernan Crespo, who plays for English champion Chelsea.<br><br>England won't face teenage striker Lionel Messi, however.<br><br>The 18-year-old Barcelona star was ejected barely a minute into his Aug. 18 debut - a 2-1 victory over Hungary - for elbowing an opponent and is suspended.<br><br>England's games against Argentina became more intense than ever after Diego Maradona's "Hand of God'' goal at the 1986 World Cup finals.<br><br>The playmaker punched the ball into the net while jumping alongside England goalkeeper Peter Shilton. Maradona also scored the other goal in Argentina's 2-1 triumph in Mexico City, dribbling past almost the entire England team.<br><br>Beckham was shown the red card during the 1998 World Cup meeting which Argentina won on penalties. Four years later, his penalty in Japan earned England a 1-0 victory in Sapporo.<br><br>Ledley King in holding midfield role...er....how about that...</div>

Being a versatile and good player, Gerrard can play anywhere across the midfield. Of course his best position is no doubt central midfield, but if he needs to  play on the right for the sake of the team, I'm sure he will.<br><br>For Eriksson, I think its more of the clash of playing patterns and trying to get the best out of both Gerrard and Lampard. Both Lampard and SG are similar in a sense they are most dangerous going forward. The central midfield tends to get exposed when both players move up naturally. We all know SG can play the holding position but playing him there will not maximise the offensive strengths SG can give to the team. Thats why Eriksson is trying to experiment with SG on the left.<br><br>Sometimes its does make you wonder if SG and Lampard can playwell together in the same team.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He might as well just drop Gerrard.......... that guy used to play well with Lampard, but for the past few years he has been less and less willing to defend the midfield and that has caused England's midfield to have a lot of problems. Playing King is a step in the right direction, but the real person he should be looking at is Parker, not King.</div>

I agree parker shall be the one to try out the holding role.</div>
