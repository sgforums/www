            <div class='col-md body'>i tink lakers, 76ers, cavaliers and miami are out of the question... lakers and 76ers have few good players, altho 76ers have kyle korver, a 3pt specialist, chris webber and of cos AI, they dont seem to be doing too well... cavaliers have lebron, hughes, zydrunas, damon who are quite good, however their team needs some time to get accustomed to each other after that they will own man!!! miami i think canot cos shaq isint doing too well this year. altho they acquired new good players like jason williams who give superb passes =P they also need time to adjust. i think the detroit and SA will most probably win again. rockets also no hope yet... sad =( the pacers not doing too well too. they need reggie =D</div>
