              <p class="first">LONDON, June 17, 2008 (AFP) - Cristiano Ronaldo
              appears to be edging closer to joining Real Madrid after reports in
              England on Tuesday claimed the Manchester United winger is ready to
              demand a transfer after Euro 2008.</p>
              <div id="adlrec"></div>
              <p>Ronaldo
              has made it clear he would like to sign for the Spanish champions if
              they meet his wage demands, but United are determined to keep the
              Portugal winger.</p>
              <p>United reported Real to UEFA for trying to
              unsettle their prize asset but Bernd Schuster's club are still ready to
              make Ronaldo the highest paid player in the world if he can persuade
              United to bow to his wishes.</p>
              <p>That has led to a stand-off between the two clubs that Ronaldo appears set to resolve himself.</p>
              <p>He
              could be set to hand in a transfer request or even refuse to report for
              pre-season training according to the Times, who report that Ronaldo
              told a source he "would do everything in his power to perusade United
              to sell".</p>
              <p>The former Sporting Lisbon star is expected to issue a
              further statement, outlining his intentions as soon as he finishes with
              Portugal's Euro campaign.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo only signed his current 120,000
              pounds a week contract with United 16 months ago but he could expect to
              at least double that sum if he switched to the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>United
              boss Sir Alex Ferguson claimed earlier this month that he would let
              Ronaldo rot in the reserves rather than be bullied into selling him.</p>
              <p>He
              is unlikely to be tempted to change his mind by reports that Real are
              ready to offer Brazil winger Robinho as part of the deal.</p>
              <p>With Ronaldo appearently determined to quit, the saga could turn ugly.</p>
              <p>The
              Daiy Mirror reports that a close friend said: "Ronaldo has made his
              mind up now and feels it is just time to wait before he announces what
              he will do - which is to go to Madrid.</p>
              <p>"The announcement about
              Cristiano's future will be the next step, but it won't happen until the
              end of Euro 2008 for him and Portugal.</p>
              <p>"He is determined to be
              the master of his own future. The decision has been made and now it's a
              case of everybody getting in position for the future - even if United
              aren't yet ready to sit down and talk to Real."</p>
