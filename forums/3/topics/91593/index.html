Bec whether its school or CC or whatever, the number of times that particular customer will order from you is limited to a few times per year at most.  So unless there is high repeat orders, it makes no business sense to locate your business near any particular customer unless rent there super cheap etc.  Also if it is bulk sales and not 1 off walk in customers, then the location again is not so critical.  Why?  Bec people looking to buy in bulk will be willing to travel some distance to obtain it bec of the quality/design/price advantage.  But if its a 1 off for walk in customers, then location becomes important... then it willhave to be somewhere where there is high pedestrian traffic of the right mix who will be interested in your product.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Perhaps? Is it necessary? Usually I just shop around.. With a little luck, I should be able to get a nice design I like which is around the same price or maybe even cheaper? Ain't really into 'special effects' when it comes to jersey... More into the 'design' and material.. </blockquote>The pt is tt u get to choose yr own design, while u dun get to do so for other shops. Others tt are currently providing garment design customization haven't gone beyond e extend of iron-on and dull fabric paints yet.<br><br><blockquote>Not necessarily? Of course everything is negotiable... There're pretty much quite alot of such shops around.. Competition is HIGH... And how often do you see such huge events? What you need would be 'connections'... Or a VERY GOOD COMPETITIVE PRICE / MATERIAL... </blockquote>Quite true abt e benefits of connection. I've no idea how to go around it, but it's nt putting mi get great advantage at e moment. Companies like adidas or nike might already have such special shirt prints, but they haven't(or dun intend to) start doing customing for clients yet.<br><br>Thanks ppl for da answers! At last i've something to submit.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
