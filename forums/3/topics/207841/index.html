            <div class='col-md body'>Well, we will all know the answer by tomorrow morning 7am when the transfer market shut.<br><br>Actually I think its quite possible, cos these 2 players donÂ’t want to return to Brazil, their owners intend to sell them at a very high price that I think only Chelsea can afford to pay but not willing. So the next best thing for their owners is a loan deal but big clubs donÂ’t like to take players on loan so along came West Ham to fit in.<br><br>Do you all think West Ham got a chance to challenge for the premier league crown or a champions league spot with them?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It has been confirmed, no joke!<br><br>In one of the most surprising transfer deals ever sealed in English football, West Ham have signed coveted Argentina stars Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano - beating off competition from Manchester United, Arsenal, Bayern Munich and AC Milan. And Portsmouth.<br>The pair will join the Hammers from Brazilian club Corinthians on a season-long loan but it could become permanent if all parties are happy, though whether West Ham could afford them is unclear, since both carry price tags in excess of Â£15m.<br><br>Tevez broke the news of the transfer on his official website. "Carlitos Tevez - along with his former Corinthians team-mate, Javier Mascherano, has signed - a contract to play with West Ham United of England," read the statement.<br>The move is nothing short of sensational: never before have two world-class players yet to reach their prime - both are only 22 - rejected a host of elite clubs in order to join a middling one.<br><br>It is unquestionably a major coup for Pardew and gives last season's FA Cup runners-up one of the most impressive-looking squads in the Premiership.<br><br>With the addition of Tevez, a prolific striker who's capable of being both subtle and barnstorming, Upton Park is now home to one of the most fearsome strikeforces in England. The Argentinian will surely be an automatic first choice, leaving Pardew the luxury of choosing between between Dean Ashton - when he returns to fitness - Bobby Zamora, Marlon Harewood, Carlton Cole and Teddy Sheringham.<br><br>Their midfield will also be formidable, with Mascherano, who Sir Alex Ferguson reportedly rated as the world's most worthy recipient of the "new Roy Keane" tag, likely to slot in alongside Reo-Coker, Benayoun and Matthew Etherington.<br><br>All of a sudden West Ham look an excellent bet to win this season's Uefa Cup - and have been transformed into genuine contenders for a Champions League spot.<br><br></div>

Realistically, only Chelsea can afford that kind of money but they have already bought Shev for $30m so they probably won't want to spend that kind of amout again as their interest is in defence now.<br><br>Since they cannot get the price they wanted, they may have decided to wait till next year cos these 2 are still rather young at 22 yrs old only. So they may have decided to loan them to a smaller club for a year cos these 2 don't want to return to Brazil and big clubs don't like to take players on loan and realistically, tho West Ham's deal come with an option to sign them after their loan deals end, few belief they can afford them. Even the takeover of Aston Villa F.C. costed Randy Lerner Â£62.6m only and these 2 players cost around $60m?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>understandable if its a loan deal, to put them on the shopping windows to entice bigger buyers.<br><br>but the move is now permanent.<br><br>dont think west ham can afford half the original asking fee (even for one tevez).<br><br>if there isn't some special agreements between the clubs, corinthians' owner is nutz.</div>
