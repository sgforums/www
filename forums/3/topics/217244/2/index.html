All the talk about Reading being the next Wigan is rubbish. 4 losses on the trot already. They are good enough for the Championship but still not good for the EPL.<br><br>Charlton, i think the fact that they sign too many players during the transfer window is hurting them. The team needs 2 gel, and the players signed ain't exactly world-class transfers. Traore is a joke at Liverpool, and what can he do at Charlton i don't know. Also, Iain Dowie is still too green an manager. He brougHT Crystal Palace down, and I already felt during that time that putting someone inexperienced to be in charge of a Premier League team is suicidal.<br><br>Watford's problem is that they depend a lot on the players who brought them up last season, and the signings made do not strengthen their team as much. </div></blockquote>lets not ignore the fact that reading have played most of the top teams.<br><br></div>
