Does McClaren play a half-fit Owen or a fully-fit and more effective striker without as big a reputation as him, say Defoe or AJ? I'll give you one thing abt McClaren though, i bet he's fantastic at paper football because he noes how to put all the big names in. In real life, doesn't seem to be working is all i'll say. We'll just wait and see.</div>
