            <div class='col-md body'><strong> The coming season will be remembered for the return of the title to the Anfield trophy room. Man United fourth? Spurs fifth again? Remember, you read it here first on Sportingo.<br><br>Rafa Benitez has led his Liverpool side to their first title in 17 years, thanks chiefly to the goal-getting of Spaniard Fernando Torres and the assistance of 'Captain Fantastic' Steven Gerrard. A season of dominance culminated with a last-minute victory over Spurs, a result that cost Martin Jol's side dearly as it left them just behind Manchester United in the all-important fourth spot.<br><br>Rafa's record signing Torres (a snip at Â£28m) has been the catalyst for Liverpool's rejuvenation, along with performances of note from Jamie Carragher and Peter Crouch, whose little-and-large partnership with the former Atletico Madrid man has been nothing short of magical.<br><br>Arsenal's draw at sixth-place Sunderland kept them ahead of United and cemented their place as runners-up in a season that seemed destined for failure following Thierry Henry's move to Barcelona - the Frenchman guiding his new club tp the La Liga title and the Champions League final against Real Madrid. Arsene Wenger resisted the urge to follow Henry to Spain and has seen his young side perform admirably and offer the only real challenge to Liverpool this season.<br><br>The Reds also have the FA Cup Final to look forward to next week, when they take on a West Ham side who have defied the odds to hold on to Carlos Tevez (Â£115k a week seems to have worked) and avoid relegation.<br><br>Chelsea are in something of a disarray as Jose Mourinho has already announced his impending move to take over at Barcelona, with Frank Rijkaard rumoured to be replacing him at Stamford Bridge. A home defeat to Bolton may also have been the last time we see Frank Lampard in a Chelsea shirt as he seems destined to move to the Nou Camp.<br><br>On the plus side, Andriy Shevchenko looks to have silenced the critics who felt that after last season's calamities his career was stumbling to a conclusion. He managed to finish as top scorer whilst Didier Drogba has been out for most of the campaign following a serious injury picked up after that infamous 'dive' he performed whilst challenged fairly by Wes Brown.<br><br>United supremo Sir Alex Ferguson will have regretted letting Giuseppe Rossi leave for Juventus and not having adequate cover for Louis Saha (who has managed just six minutes of first-team football this term) and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Rossi led Claudio Ranieri's side to the Serie A title.<br><br>A late penalty miss by Jason Koumas earned Martin O'Neill and Aston Villa a spot in next season's UEFA Cup and inadvertently gave West Ham the points they needed to avoid the drop. Villa fans were doubly glad as Koumas's miss consigned Birmingham back to the Championship, where they will be joined by Fulham - relegated by mid-March - and Derby, whose time in the Premiership was destined to be a short one following a three-month spell without a victory.</strong></div>
