            <div class='col-md body'>Replying to Jasmine17 , how i see Heskey ? He's a different payer from his Leicester's days ! That's maybe GH deploy him as a physical , aerial forward , rather than Owen type of style ! He's more like owen in his Leicester's days ! Now he played like John Fashanu !<br><br>He's quite handful when set-pieces , corners ....Aerial bombardment , holding possessions....and defending qualities ! Other than that......i really dunno why we spent 11 millions pounds on him !<br><br>But please don't asked me why SG Ericcsson likes him so much !<br><br>I wouldn't mind if he's not in England squad !</div>
