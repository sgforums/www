            <div class='col-md body'>if Liverpool comes up against Manchester United in the Champions League final, the only difference is there is gold on the line, as Manchester United is an english side and liverpool, is also an english side. the reason Liverpool won Chelsea in 2005 is because of 2 factors, their defence and tactics, of course with a little big of luck. But up against Manchester United, Manchester United have a undoubtedly attack force and i think that they would play the match as if it were an EPL match, and Rafa Benitez has not mastered the English game thus if the final is between Liverpool and Manchester United, it would be Manchester United's as Liverpool cannot match their speed and firepower</div>

Kinda forgot about that. Must have been sleepy. But then again, they didn't try their best for the 6-3 match. Fielding Dudek and some other players who weren't playing regularly. It's like they weren't even trying. Tactical backfire on Benitez's part.<br><br>But you're sure to see them go full force for the matches ahead.

            <div class='col-md body'>But the point is the players are bought. The price does not really matter. Icefatboy seemed to suggest that man u's whole team is "home grown" . It is in fact, as he mentioned an "assembled group of mercenaries". Believe that man u is second in rank when it comes to spending.....fact is man u themselves are big spenders...it is just that chelsea gave them a taste of their own medicine in recent years. Few years back..man u will splurge whenever they do not get the title. Nobody said that they bought the title then.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On the discussion about talent that is bought and talent is 'home-grown', I agree that with all the top teams, talent is bought. I don't believe any team relying only on internal talent can reach and maintain it's position at the top.<br><br>To be the best, you have to also get the best from elsewhere as well. You can't always look inwards although that would give you a good foundation and structure, but to grow overall you need to look outside as well.<br><br>But even after buying all the best players you can, it takes a good manager to get them to be able to play together. I feel Mourinho and Ferguson both have done well in getting the best out of their signings and having their signings work well as a team. Real Madrid didn't have poor managers, but the problem was that the players had more power than the manager. Also, the Real Madrid Board didn't treat their managers with very much respect. It didn't matter how good the manager was, somtimes, the manager just doesn't have the respect or co-operation of either the board or the dressing room.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>home/club grown talent is not a realistic model anymore. in the internet age we live in, everyone wants success `yesterday'. no such thing as coming thru' the system....no can wait. if so, it will be a rare one or 2 players. like it or not, one needs to dipped into the transfer market to get the best players.<br><br>what's impt is to pay a fair value for the players. when u reach fantasy football type of transfer game like chel$ki, tt's when u question the sanity of it all.</div>
