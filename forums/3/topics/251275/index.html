            <div class='col-md body'>Man U can afford 2 slip up in at least 1 match of their remaining 3 matches. Chelsea have 2 win all 3 remaining matches, 2 of which are against Arsenal and Man U. When Man U was about to come back from 2-0 down to win 4-2, u know that the difference between Man U and Chelsea is the hunger and desire to win. Chelsea's lack of reinforcements during Jan did them in, but give Man U credit. They played above themselves all season, their defence and Cristiano Ronaldo were the main reason this season why Old Trafford will be celebrating the title.</div>

Manchester United did played above themselves to be in the position they are today but i'm pretty sure Chelsea is just as eager to land the EPL title as ManU or just about any team playing in the league.<br><br>but having said that i think the main person thats responible for Chelsea failure (thats if they eventually lost out to ManU) is probably Mr Russian himself, his insistence on having Shev playing in the team when its obvious that JM's assembled Chelsea is more suitable playing with a out and out striker with two wingers and an attacking Midfielder as support rather then the present formation, with Shev and Ballack playing in the team, Chelsea had to do away with wing play and also the effectiveness of having 2 defensive midfielder backing an attacking midfielder, so guess even the ultra rich man is have to go according to the old saying, don't fix anything that ain't broken!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am a Liverpool fan for the last 23 years of my 30 years of life ever since I knew what was soccer haha...<br><br>I hate Everton (compulsory haha!).<br><br>I hate Man Utd for their arrogance. I wun say all, but most Liverpool fans take this rivalry with Man Utd really seriously and it pains us to see Man Utd running away with titles and getting all the glory. Man Utd will always be my eternal target of hate. No way of reconciliation till i die.<br><br>I also hate Chelsea for somehow their reluctance to say others are better than them. They are good, very good in fact but they are not the best all the time. And it irritates us football fans to see a team who is living in illusion that when others win, it is a fluke and they are the God chosen team to win every championship every year.<br><br>And as much as i hate to admit, Man Utd played damn well this season. They are outstanding. When i watch them play sometimes, i wish my Liverpool can play like them but of cos, Liverpool will always be Liverpool, they are special to me. But no one can deny the forms of Man Utd players esp Ronaldo. Like Drogba, he has also decided to dive less and show the world what they are really capable of. The difference is that Ronaldo looks like bringing the title back to Old Trafford.<br><br>Give credit where credit's due. Next season, I hope, with fingers crossed, Liverpool can be up there with these 2 and contending for the EPL which we all sorely want.</div>
