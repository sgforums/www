            <div class='col-md body'>well, saw the 2nd half. saw the drogba goal, so identifical to the one scored against Liverpool.<br><br>well, you got the win. well done.<br>just a gentle reminder, just the group stages hor.<br><br>anyway, anyone got the stats? from what I saw, formation for Chelsea was 9-2. all hands on deck. Not a pretty sight considering English EPL double champions and at Stamford Bridge. But I guess JM must have realise that if you can't beat them, you may as well, park the bus in front.<br><br>technically, Barca is superior, it is not often the Chelsea got pressed like that, but I guess that they missed Eto or a Larsson (an old head who knows how to draw defenders out). Well, English clubs all got their deserved results.<br><br>now to EPL.</div>
