You don't have capacity to think beyond what you choose to read. Go under Google and select soccer. Don't just cut and paste from tribalfootball. You are too gullible.<br>Read more. If you are able to treat this as a positive feedback, your maturity up there else, no comment.<br><br>I understand your passion, your love for Chelsea. And as a football fan, I welcome that. But you need to see both sides of the coin, not just your tunnel vision. Even though, I support MUFC, I have to respect what Liverpool has achieved in the past, their 5 European cups. But if you ask whether I like Liverpool, I once asked a liverpool fan to give me a jersey so that I can put it as my toilet seat. But we still need to be civil in our talks.<br><br>I believe you welcome mature verbal sparings and not just below the belt hitting, right?<br><br>So open up, if chelsea is so good, why do others dislike them? Then answer them with your passion. you may win some, but you may fail. But that's the joy of verbal sparring.<br><br>finally, be it you win in this forum or in another, CFC gain nothing and lose nothing. They don't even know you exist.<br><br>So let's enjoy..
