            <div class='col-md body'>i do agreed that Chelsea seems to have on purpose did something on to their field last season to make it unfair to Barcelona as well as a couple of other teams playing before Barcelona, however, adding sand to grass is indeed something that is nesscary in order to make the field less water logged, like what golf fairways/greens are, during construction period millions dollars of sands are being place on to the soil surfaces prior to planting of grass and sand are again added to make good a water ponding area, of course sometime by just adding sand will not help and other measures will be taken to recifity the ponding so to just says that Chelsea added sand on to the pitch again this year to Cheat is probably too strong a word to use but they have been doing lots of things that are generally pretty strange as far as fair play is concern.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>
