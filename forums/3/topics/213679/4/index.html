"The one from Del Horno left me terrified. It could have done great damage to me if my foot had been grounded. So I jumped.<br><br>"He's no longer there, so that's one less I have to worry about. Never in my life have I entered the field frightened. I always try to do my best and it doesn't worry me what team I'm playing or who is marking me.<br><br>"Everyone loves playing the big games.

"I am motivated not to waste this opportunity. It does not worry me that it is against our main rivals, Barcelona. I am preparing to stop them as much as I can."<br><br>At least he won't have any problem communicating. With Paulo Ferreira and Ricardo Carvalho in front of him and manager Jose Mourinho on the bench, it will be like Little Portugal at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Hilario, 30, said: "This has been my first time out of Portugal and in a big city like London it makes me feel much more comfortable to have people from my country around.<br><br>"I understand English but don't speak it so well, so if I need to do something with my house or for my family, it really helps. They have shown me how things work here, told me about the schools for my kids and really helped with my adaptation to life in England."<br><br>Mourinho brought in Hilario in the summer because of a shoulder injury to Cech.<br><br>The Chelsea manager said: "He is a good keeper that I trust at this level. I always said that with the number of matches we have we need three goalkeepers ready to play. At this level we can't have a young boy or a player with little experience on the bench. I know his experience and he has good quality." </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Pre-BarÃ§a training complete<br>Tuesday, Oct 17, 2006<br>Didier Drogba, Claude Makelele and Ashley Cole are injury concerns heading into WednesdayÂ’s big Champions League match, but all three completed a full training session on Tuesday afternoon.<br><br>Speaking in his press conference leading up to the Barcelona match, JosÃ© declined to repeat his famous team-naming prior to a game in Camp Nou two seasons ago.<br><br>I cannot tell you my team because I am not sure the players I have available,Â’ he said. Â‘I need a training session to see if Makelele, Drogba or Ashley Cole can play.Â’<br><br>Cole injured his ankle in EnglandÂ’s match last Wednesday and Makelele has not played since FranceÂ’s game the previous Saturday. The players took part in all aspects of the session on the Stamford Bridge pitch that followed the press conference.<br><br>It is not a game to make a lot of changes. It is a game that we are going to play with the same mentality as normal. We are trying to get the three points,Â’ promised Mourinho.<br><br>We are in a good situation in our group but is not a game where we try to get one point.Â’<br><br>The match will be as big as any played in Europe this week but will not carry with it the same pressure cooker intensity of the previous Chelsea-Barcelona Champions League encounters.<br><br>Mourinho believes the fact it is a group game and not a knockout tie may help the spectacle.<br><br>It is a slight difference from the game last year. It gives an opportunity to see some great football, some calmer football - a great chance for quality to shine through because the teams arenÂ’t fearful of the situation.Â’<br><br>For one player, the game will have added significance. Hilario (pictured) will be making his Chelsea debut in goal.<br><br>He is calm, he is prepared and he is taking his time,Â’ reported Mourinho. Â‘He is no kid. He has played game after game in the Portuguese first division, and he has also played the odd  Champions League game.<br><br>From last Saturday when he found out he was playing, he has been busy at home preparing, looking at Barcelona games on video.<br><br>He came here knowing he was going to be third choice. Normally third choice keepers are anonymous but now he is going to get a great chance to play against the Champions of Europe.Â’<br><br>Michael Ballack rejoins the squad having been absent at the weekend, serving the last game of a three-match domestic ban.<br><br>All supporters are urged to be inside Stamford Bridge as early as possible to make it one of those special European nights.</span></div>

It is expected to happen at 7.30pm.<br><br>Gudjohnsen left Chelsea in the summer for nearly Â£10m after six years with the club. He won two Premierships, two Charity Shields and a League Cup, and he was someone whose affinity to the club and with the fans was always evident.<br><br>Chelsea is delighted to have this opportunity to welcome him back and show how much he was appreciated.<br><br>The game with Barcelona is going to be a special occasion in addition to this with a flag placed on every seat for fans to wave in support of the team. If you are coming, please take your seats early to help project the atmosphere and to show your appreciation to a favourite Chelsea son.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Allow me to answer as a football fan.<br><br>Firstly, stop cut and paste all these articles.  just paste the URL and we can go there to read.<br><br>Secondly, stop using stats that are favourable to you.<br>I saw the stats that you compare MUFC and Chelsea.<br><br>I challenge you, included all the facts when EPL first started till today, and for fairness sakes, include all top 3 teams of each year.<br>If your team is not there, please put a zero.<br><br>thirdly, One thing, Ghimpheng, you believe what is written. You don't have capacity to think beyond what you choose to read. Go under Google and select soccer. Don't just cut and paste from tribalfootball. You are too gullible.<br>Read more. If you are able to treat this as a positive feedback, your maturity up there else, no comment.<br><br>I understand your passion, your love for Chelsea. And as a football fan, I welcome that. But you need to see both sides of the coin, not just your tunnel vision. Even though, I support MUFC, I have to respect what Liverpool has achieved in the past, their 5 European cups. But if you ask whether I like Liverpool, I once asked a liverpool fan to give me a jersey so that I can put it as my toilet seat. But we still need to be civil in our talks.<br><br>I believe you welcome mature verbal sparings and not just below the belt hitting, right?<br><br>So open up, if chelsea is so good, why do others dislike them? Then answer them with your passion. you may win some, but you may fail. But that's the joy of verbal sparring.<br><br>finally, be it you win in this forum or in another, CFC gain nothing and lose nothing. They don't even know you exist.<br><br>So let's enjoy.. Peace.<br><br></div>
