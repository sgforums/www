He's confident at the moment and he can't stop scoring.<br><br>"It's great when you see a striker in that mode because balls drop to him; balls deflect off him, like they did for the last one."<br><br>Drogba pounced for his first when Levski keeper Georgi Petkov failed to hold a shot from Mikel John Obi.<br><br>He supplied a neat finish to a strong turn for his second and completed his treble when he diverted Lampard's shot into the corner with a flick.<br><br>Lampard said: "I don't know if he meant it or not but you have to give credit to him. It doesn't matter how they go in.<br><br>"He scored a mixture of goals. The first was a striker's instinct goal, the second was a real quality finish and the third was the lucky one that good strikers do score."</span><br><br></div>
