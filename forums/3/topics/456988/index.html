              <p>Okay basically I will just start off with what the reason was for starting this thread. Straight to the topic, I want to participate in the upcoming 100m or maybe 200m race in the next Olympic games in Rio. </p>
              <p>I know this may sound ridiculous but I hope you can hear me out. I've been holding onto this dream since I was 12, now I'm the age of 15. By the time 2016 comes I'll be 19, being able to qualify for the Olympics. However, I have not recieved the information of how to advance from being a student to eventually going to the Olympics. </p>
              <p>I won't brag about my timings in each of the 100m or 200m, as I find it pointless but I've been training diligently and will continue to in the next coming years, whether I can seize the opportunity or not. I may not have broken the 10 second barrier yet, but I believe with the proper coaching I can receive, I'll be able to do better.</p>
              <p>So here's where the problem comes in. I don't know how to get sponsers or any recognition. Probably my first break will be when I enter JC, where I'll be able to take up track and field as a sport. But for now, I'm unable to do so, so whatever I can do is just to train by myself. </p>
              <p>I need information of how can you exactly ''qualify'' for the Olympics, how do I even get into the Singapore team. If anyone has information of this, I'd really appreciate it if you can share it with me. </p>
              <p>I hope you won't criticise me of my dream, because I know one thing for myself is that impossible is nothing. So I'll keep pushing, persuing my goal until I reach it some day. I just need the proper and right information to advance forward. </p>
              <p>Thanks :)</p>

              <p>thanks so far for the reponses. @troublemaker2005, from what I know our Singaporean athelete who took part in the 100m for the Olympics this year got a personal best of 10.46. My main goal is to first break the 10-second barrier which will be a pretty great achievement if I can do so. </p>

              <p>aim to beat your school teams firts, then slowly by school or association team, then singapore. though if you can get into the teams they may provide guidance or trainings if they see the never give up attitude and potential in you. near the tiiming i should say its just how you can manage to get notice and into the teams.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>10 seconds? No one in Singapore has come anywhere close to 10 seconds. Ever. Maybe 10.3 or 10.4, but not 10....if you are really that good, a national coach would have spotted you by now....from then on its all training until you can make the Olympics. 10 sec I believe gives you almost a guaranteed place in the semi final and a very good chance of making the final of the 100m :)</p></div>
