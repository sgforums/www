He certainly did alright for the bulk of 97/98 when he filled in for Keane and on the handful of occasions subsequently (it was a fitting tribute he skippered United to their finest hour in his last game  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> )</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fergie always chose captain with a fierocious attitude , players like Bryan Robson , Roy Keane , Paul Ince and Peter Schmicel all very aggressive ones .<br><br>Bryan Robson not too bad , still sometimes he argue with referees ....<br><br>Those gentle fellas just have to wait awhile for their turns .... so Wayne Rooney temperament just nice for Fergie .</div>
