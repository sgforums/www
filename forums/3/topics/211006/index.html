            <div class='col-md body'>JOSE MOURINHO insists Andriy Shevchenko has no excuses for the slow start to his Chelsea career.<br><br>Shevchenko is being overshadowed by strike partner Didier Drogba following his Â£30million move from AC Milan.<br><br>Blues boss Mourinho has made it clear he expects better from the Ukrainian superstar, who became ChelseaÂ’s record signing in the summer<br><br>Mourinho said: Â“I expect to see a better Shevchenko with the same Drogba. Â“Didier is right where he has to be, very strong physically and available to fight in every aspect of the game.<br><br>Â“He is scoring goals, working in defence and attack, helping out at set-pieces Â— everything.<br><br>Â“Sheva knows I want more from him. He wants more from himself.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t think he can say he has had problems adapting to our style of play because at the moment we are using the system he played all his life at AC Milan. Because we donÂ’t have two pure wingers to use at the moment, we are playing 4-4-2 with a diamond and two players in attack.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s exactly the same as Sheva had in Milan. But he is an absolutely beautiful player and I know he will come good.<br><br>Â“He will score goals and will finish the season among the PremiershipÂ’s top goalscorers.Â”<br><br>Shevchenko, 30, netted on his Chelsea debut against Liverpool in the Community Shield and was on target in the 2-1 loss at Middlesbrough.<br><br>But the Â£130,000-a-week striker has not looked like scoring in his last four games, while Drogba has gone from strength to strength. It was DrogbaÂ’s stunning strike which fired Chelsea to a crucial win over title rivals Liverpool at the weekend.<br><br>Drogba said: Â“That was my best goal since I came here.<br><br>Drogba, a Â£24m signing for the Blues, is enjoying the best form of his life right now.<br><br>He has learned to stay on his feet after being branded a diver last season and now he is reaping the benefits.<br><br>Â“He had problems when people accused him of going down too easily but he is over that.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>watching the game agst Liverpool, Shev's pressence isn't felt.  he is not as fast, he is not as powerful although he is taller than Drogba.<br><br>Or maybe, the opponents are marking him more tightly given his "reputation" which, in a way, frees up Drogba.  But really, for 30m, you will expect him to "touch" the ball more often.<br><br>Or maybe he hasn't really recovered from his injury....will we see him being offloaded next season like Veron ?</div>

Every Friday before a game I'm still scared whether I'm going to play or not.<br><br>"It's been a risk coming here because if I don't get in the Chelsea team, I could lose my England place.

We just need a bit more time."<br><br>Reflecting on his thumping volley against Liverpool, Drogba feels it was the best goal he has scored during his Chelsea career.<br><br>The Ivory Coast ace added: "I think it is my best goal since I am here. Not only my best goal, but a very important goal because of the way we won this game.<br><br>"Okay, it is an individual action, but it is a good win for the team, so I am happy to score this kind of goal.<br><br>"This is the kind of goal I used to score when I was in Marseille. I've got a good feeling about my body at the moment and I always want to play.<br><br>"I hope there will be more goals. Even when you score a good goal, the most important thing is to win the games."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Andriy Shevchenko won't be able to do well in the EPL. To be fair, he is already 30 yrs old, been playing in Italy league for more than 5, 6 yrs so too used to the slower pace.<br><br>Here is a player that most of us have seen him played occasional a few yrs ago in italy. A few yrs is a lot of difference to a footballer especially between the age of 26 to 30. At 26 to 28, he probably was at the peak of his football career. As we have seen with most players, especially strikers, they tends to start going downhill when they reach around 29 to 30. You can't beat mother nature.<br><br>But he was once a top striker so he probably will do ok still with his experience but not too much, but for $30.8m is over-priced though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>his movements definitely seems to be much slower than what he used to be. And he is 30yrs old too...getting old too, so can't run as fast as he used to. Anyway i think drogba and crespo used to have slow starts to their epl careers too...just give sheva more time and the goals will start coming.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be fair, he hasn't been getting much service from the midfield...<br><br>Looking forward to Robben and Joe cole's return to fitness...that should spark Scheva up..</div>
