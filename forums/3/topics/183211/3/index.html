Even if they don't win the title, winning all the remaining games will give them reason to hold their head high at the end of the season.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the in-word now is simulation, not cheating.<br><br>i am a MUFC fan, and from the days where MUFC players crowd around referees, most clubs do have some history.<br><br>But moving ahead, we really need to come down hard. But where is the line?<br><br>Sometimes, I do see players really going down but becos they want to protect themselves, so they fall in a way that depicts cheating and they get cards for that.<br><br>If you want to charge Drogba for that handball, throw the book at defenders who fling themselves at the ball, they should be charge for handball too.<br>They are doing that with intent.<br><br>It will be interesting now that so much talk is on this, that the next EPL games, referees will be more eager to draw their cards.<br><br>This can be improved, (I did not say Solved) by using modern technology, like cameras. I note that in recent EPL games, for balls that are close to goal-line, there are actual repeats to show whether the ball cross the goal-line or not.<br><br>So why can we use that? I know in Rugby it is being used.<br><br>one referee,and two linesmen, can't cover all 22 players. Use technology.<br><br>With that, i believe managers will have their mouths clammed.<br></div>

Basically it's Chelsea . The problem is with the club , educating them how to cheat . Look at the statistics , Barcelona , WBA and Man City recently .<br><br>I agree with Sir Alex that players that dive (very obviously ) should be sent off immediately and players that crowded around referees causing problems to him should have points deducted. I am very sure Chelsea is at the bottom list in regards to fair play.<br><br>Drogba , what a wasted talent , superb skills and eye for goal but his character is a big let down .<br><br></div></blockquote>In fact Man Utd is the first team to use the crowd the referee tactics, well maybe now Fergie has learnt his mistakes.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>all players cheat one way or another.  it is the duty of the match officials to catch them.<br><br>if they get away with it we have to accept.  it is part of the match.<br></div>
