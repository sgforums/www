            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;"></span>  I have nothing to say about Chelsea. They are sore losers... They send Drogba in and he tries to use his hand to score and that Robert Huth had to tackle so hard that he got himself a red card. Chelsea is becoming more and more aggrasive and violent on the pitch. The no. of red cards can prove it. And when Chelsea lose they blame everyone but themselves.... So what if they win the EPL again this year, they won't get the respect they deserve.... Even though I have 2 admit Jose Mourinho did quite a job to make Chelsea a dominant force in England but it looks like his plan is back-firing....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed with the bad antics of Mourinho and his players.<br><br>I dont support any clubs in England, but the emergence of Chelsea to neutral EPL fans like me is a good thing. I certainly wouldnt want to waste monthly subscriptions on a League that we know who will win even before the season kicks off (Man Utd dominace years).<br><br>Well hopefully Man Utd, Liverpool and Arsenal or maybe some surprise package provide better challenge to Chelsea next season. If not, its back to the boring old days where a club dominates the title for years. But at the end of the day, which fan doesnt hopes his club dominates and win things?</div>

They are sore losers... They send Drogba in and he tries to use his hand to score and that <span style="color: red;">Robert Huth</span> had to tackle so hard that he got himself a red card. Chelsea is becoming more and more aggrasive and violent on the pitch. The no. of red cards can prove it. And when Chelsea lose they blame everyone but themselves.... So what if they win the EPL again this year, they won't get the respect they deserve.... Even though I have 2 admit Jose Mourinho did quite a job to make Chelsea a dominant force in England but it looks like his plan is back-firing....</div></blockquote>errr... sorry ar...<br>its william gallas...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Toon men slam Chavski divers</strong><br>Wednesday March 22 2006<br><br>Alan Shearer hit out at Shaun Wright-Phillips and accused the Chelsea winger of diving as Newcastle crashed out of the FA Cup.<br><br>Wright-Phillips appeared to overreact to a challenge by Robbie Elliott which earned the Toon defender a second yellow card.<br><br>It soured Shearer's final game in the FA Cup as Chelsea won the quarter final 1-0 and booked a place in the last four.<br><br>Shearer said: "It was a blatant dive. There was absolutely no contact and I thought that at the time.<br><br>"I have seen it again on a replay and it was definitely the case."<br><br>The Newcastle skipper was booked for arguing with the decision in the last minute of normal time.<br><br>Newcastle's caretaker manager Glenn Roeder was also angry with Wright-Phillips and suggested the player's father Ian Wright would also not be happy.<br><br>Roeder said: "My view is crystal clear. Wright-Phillips took the ball past Robbie Elliott, who immediately turned his body sideways to let him go.<br><br>"He is an experienced defender - but Wright-Phillips knows he has beaten him and he's on the ground.<br><br>"He made no attempt to run past him at all.<br><br>"I am disappointed with the young man - and I don't think his dad will be too pleased either.<br><br>"What disappoints me most is the contrast between two incidents in the game.<br><br>"Kieron Dyer was 'scissored' in the corner but he gets up straightaway and he is not looking for a foul or a booking.<br><br>"Then we have the sending-off incident. They are at two ends on the spectrum of fair play.<br><br>"I am sure the other manager will have his opinion - but that is mine."<br><br>Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho refused to speak after the game.<br><br>Roeder added: "For me you should just play the game of football.<br><br>"If you are fouled, go down. If you are not fouled, don't."<br><br>The incident overshadowed Shearer's exit from the FA Cup. It was his last chance to win a trophy in the colours of his home town club because he will retire at the end of the season.<br><br>Roeder said: "Alan set his heart on getting into the last four but conceding an early goal to the Premiership champions disappointed us.<br><br>"For Alan to lose the game 1-0 and not even have an opportunity to take them back for a replay at St James' Park has to be a disappointment.<br><br>"But he won't want any sympathy. Alan is not a sympathy man, just look at his career and look at his life.<br><br>"He will shake himself down, pick himself up and work hard towards his retirement before he comes back into the game in football management.<br><br>"I don't know whether that will be in one year's time or six or seven years but Alan can still win the FA Cup one day. Why not?<br><br>"When he comes back into management, I am sure it will only be at this club and this club has the capability to win it even though the last time they did it I was not born."<br><br>John Terry scored the only goal of the game after five minutes and the Chelsea skipper was thrilled to record a win after defeat in the Premiership at Fulham on Sunday.<br><br>Terry said: "It was important to get a good early start and we did that straight from the kick-off.<br><br>"We turned them around and squeezed them and that set the tone for the whole game.<br><br>"It's not about revenge for last year. The most important thing is that we are in the hat for the draw on Friday and we are pleased to bounce back after a very disappointing result at the weekend."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm a Man United fan to start with...<br><br>its a 12 pt gap now but united have a game in hand plus another game with them in weeks to come... assuming we can win both, the gap will be a 6 point gap... to drop 6 points doesnt mean chelsea has to lose 2 games... they just need to draw 3 to drop 6 points too... not a high chance but isnt entirely impossible either...<br><br></div>
