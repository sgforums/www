            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">I think Jose.M just state the fact that Fulham Players did pressurized the referee to rethink of his decision and Fulham Fans who went over the fans and celebrate it make Jose.M more furious.......I can see where Jose.M is coming from...........When Jose.M Lose To Man Utd And Middlesbrough......did he say anything I don't remember Any ? Fulham fans and players behaviour make Jose.M and I don't think he a bad loser @ all..........<br><br>I remember when they lose to middlesbrough they said that they were outplayed by middlesbrough the 3 goals said it all...........but Chelsea will bare this in mind and next match with middlesbrough will never be the same again but Jose.M did not comment that middlesbrough was lucky or chelsea deserve the victory<br><br>I fully respect Jose.M even though he little arrogant and proud but I can see why that he is but he is usually a nice guy according to the chelsea players and I also think so.........And Chelsea Is never a Disgrace To football............Better than those clubs that accept match-fixing........Seria A had lots of this cases just in case you are not aware</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea and Morinho have bought lots of negative publicity in under 2 seasons, but credit to morinho, he gave Fulham and Coleman credit for the victory. He did the same after the boro match also.<br><br>In the papers recently, morinho also gave a rather 'humble' interview saying that he's not very special.<br><br>Hopefully,it'll be the start of fewer controversial press interviews. The antics of the chelsea players has got to improve though.<br><br></div>

SWP is a good example.  i dont like it that chelsea is inflating the market prices.  i dont like mourihno's attitude too.<br><br>but i do like the fact that chelsea has now become a championship-winning team.  hopefully liverpool, man u, spurs and arsenal can provide a challenge in future.  it will make my scv subscription more worthwhile.<br><br>think of those days when man u were winning the premiership.  only man u fans were enjoying.  damn sianzzz.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do you really think Chelsea will be where they are with the money they got from the rich Russian Billionaire ? They are damaging the transfer market , spending a lot of money like nobody's business.<br><br>The reason for their current treatment from others ( teams, referees)  is because no one really respects Chelsea now adays, they are becoming a hatred team in England worse then Man Utd (when they were champions ) or Arsenal. Look at what they have done to Barcelona ( Not just this season , last season too) &gt; Chelsea in my opinion is like a circles  filled with clowns.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi all,<br>In a way, I do agree with Mourinho. The ref blew for a goal, and then later, no goal. He said that the ref was pressured to disallow the goal. he is correct.<br><br>but the one person who knows it is a handball did not speak up, -&gt; drogba.<br><br>Like Rossi in Italian league, he admitted it was a hand-ball and the goal was disallowed. But Roma still won 2-1.<br><br>Well, these things you can't teach players.<br><br>And from my angle, everyone wants to beat the champions. So chelsea should be prepare for any punches below the belt if any.<br><br>Well, if the same happens to MUFC or Gooners or Loserpool, the managers will also make the same noise.<br><br>But what gallas did, I don't approve, sticking his studs into another players' shin. Gallas is a top class player, so I don't think it was a mistake.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Let's face it, the real champions of English football are man utd and liverpool. chelsea is small fry...cooking in the billions of russian money"<br><br>well, I agree and disagree to some extent on this.<br><br>Chelsea is the current EPL champions, and going to be the next one. I respect their abilities, cause they proved over 38 games, they are better than anyone else last season.<br><br>They got beaten by Barca,one of the top teams in Europe, no shame in that.<br><br>For history sake, there is a phase.<br>Liverpool was fanastic in 80s, MUFC in 90s, and now, maybe Chelsea.<br><br>Liverpool is 5times European Cup winners so highest in English Football.<br>Next is MUFC, with 2 or Forest, I am unsure.<br><br>MUFC has the most wins in FA cup.<br><br>Gunners won the league without losing a game.<br><br>MUFC won the real treble, with the League, FA Cup and European Cup.<br><br>So history wise doesn't favour Chelsea, but currently, they are the best team.<br><br>As a MUFC fan, I do hope that whatever happens, more talents will flow into EPL. As as someone pointed out, then our SCV is worth it.<br><br></div>
