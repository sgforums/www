            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal in crisis??<br><br>next year we are probably going to see a new arsenal team.<br>why??<br>1.Cole could be going to chelsea. this is very likely however it will probably release much funds to arsenal for purchase niemi from southamton and probably a good central defender.<br><br>2. reyes leaving arsenal to madrid. this is very likely as he hoax radio could make him a villian in the arsenal team citing arsenal players as" bad player".<br>could result in player +cash exchange.most likely owen in another direction as i cant see real selling raul or ronaldo. however . Scolari or Guti is also possible candidate.<br><br>3. EDU leaving to valencia.<br>summer transfer window see him failing to go valencia because valencia cant afford 1 million pounds. end of season make him free agent. i think he has sign undertable agreement to join FOC end of season and get bonus in return(eg campbell from tottenham).<br><br>4. bergkamp retiring.<br>this could be his last. i think will be his last. time for this much respected figure to retire and play more with his son.<br><br>5. either alumnia or the german keeper will go.<br><br>6. Robert pires could leave. he is 32 and has slow down and play second fiddle this season mainly coming from sub bench.<br><br>who could be coming??<br><br>1.niemi from southampton. good and steady.<br>2. shaun wright phillips but too highly rated and expensive.<br>3. muniche from porto. link for possible move to arsenal but vieira last minute to stay arsenal make the deal collapse.  could reignite to replace edu.<br>4. owen in the player + cash deal for reyes.<br>5. good central defender. maybe ledley king from spurs? personally i like a black defender from bayern. i forgot his name but i think bayern going to sold him after this season. should get him FOC!!.<br><br>just my opinion. wish you arsenal fan out there can post your thoughts too.<br>all thoughts welcome!!<br><br></div>
