            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BrUtUs:</div><div class="quote_body">how u noe he wun win wif gunners? its jz hard to predict cos arsenal got the youth n wif PV it could be a gd mix... as for cole, wat for keep a player wif tis kind of attitude? he claim he 'loyal' but he caught red handed with chelsea at hotel.... this guy already lost his mind but gunners gd enuff ot offer him improved contract then now money cole still come up wif tis action so hw can u say dun value english players? cole was also inexperienced too last time n now he turn out ok so it will take time to get experience for the new boys.... antigunners rite? </div></blockquote>Well we wouldn't would we... but we all belief and acknowledge that his chances of winning something would be much greater if he went to Chelsea, Barce or maybe even Real right.<br><br>Its not that the gunners was good enough to offer him a new contract, its more like they were making sure that they wouldn't lose him without getting a transfer fee. If it was money that he wanted, he could have easily not sign a new contract last year and walk away for free this year and still get a huge sign on fee for himself rather than Arsenal right... Instead after he signed, he said<strong> "The board 'rewarded' me with an insult and threw years of loyalty back in my face." </strong> That is what he is disgusted by.<br><br>We all don't know the real story as to why he met chelsea in the first place, was he tricked or otherwise and what the Arsenal board promised him before he sign his new contract too... But we will all know very soon when his new book is release as he said...<br><br><strong>""I'll reveal the shattering truth about who fed me to the sharks. It changed my view forever on the club I regarded as family." </strong><br><br>I am not an anti-gunner  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> i like their style of play actually but... its just that every story has two sides to it. The question is, Why did he sign a new contract if he didn't want to stay? You don't sign a new contract if you don't intend to stay right... and After signing less than a year, why does he want to leave? There must be good reasons behind it and money definitely isn't it as i have pointed out earlier.<br><br>We will all know very soon what actually happened when his new book is release.<br><br></div>

He could very well be going back to the EPL now that Juve is relegated... and at a even bigger club than Arsenal too. Yes i agree that we cannot predict but we can consider chances far greater or far less than right. For instance, a chelsea team without Terry, Lampard would be weaker than a team with them right?<br><br>Anyway, fabregas is coming good and like you said now he is a regular not only in arsenal but also spain. But that's  the problem. I don't see him staying with Arsenal very long... at most another 4 yrs but possibly in a year or two he will be going back to Spain. Young players from major league countries in Europe would probably like to go back to their home country if they have a choice to play for their top teams. He left Spain cos he couldn't get into the first team in his home country but if he could now, he probably will. Fabregas is still learning and in a year or two time he would be a good midfielder. But unfortunately, arsenal do all the hard work and will lose him to some spainish team ready to take him back when he is ready.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ashley Cole is to persist with his plans to leave Arsenal when he returns from honeymoon, despite ArsÃ¨ne Wenger's insistence that he wants him to stay. The Arsenal manager, speaking after the friendly with Barnet on Saturday, described their relationship as "reparable", but Cole is so disgruntled by Arsenal's reaction to his meeting with Chelsea last year that - according to quotes used to publicise his forthcoming autobiography - he is determined to move abroad or resurrect the transfer to Chelsea.<br><br>Arsenal's other World Cup players are due to report for training on Thursday but Wenger had permitted the England defender to return later because of the honeymoon following his marriage to the Girls Aloud singer Cheryl Tweedy.<br><br>Wenger said he did not intend to have talks with Cole about his comments that "Arsenal hung me out to dry, using me as a scapegoat to get back at Chelsea" and that he was "insulted" by the board's treatment of him but cites his successful experiences of persuading key players who have been tempted to leave in the past to stay. Cole's relationship with the club has been damaged to such an extent, however, that he is unlikely to change his mind.<br><br>"When Ashley Cole comes back, the most important thing is to work hard and not to talk too much," said Wenger. "We have shown many times we can keep our best players when we want to do it. The last one we have shown that with is Thierry Henry."<br><br></div>
