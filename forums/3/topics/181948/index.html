            <div class='col-md body'>Record of English clubs vs italian clubs are pretty good in past years. Arsenal has met both Inter and Florentina in past matches.<br><br>The last time Arsenal met Florentina in the UCL, they lost to a solitary Batistuta goal despite dominating the match in both the home and away legs, missing a penalty and peppering the goal posts with over 30 shots on target. To the extent that even then Florentina manager Giovanni Trappatoni admitted unreservingly that Arsenal didn't deserve to lose.<br><br>As for Inter, a 3-0 win at highbury was reversed by a 5-1 trashing in the San Siro, evidence of a Thierry Henry masterclass. And judging by the quick maturing of their junior players, and Juve's tendency to play on the counter, Arsenal just might sneak through.<br><br>Lyon-AC Milan will be a good match up though. Would like to see Lyon shake off their 'darkhorse' title and put one over their illustrious opponents. They have enough strength in depth to tighten the screw on AC Milan and finish the job on the away leg.<br><br>Barca should make short work of Benfica unless they concede early goals and Benfica defends in numbers. Or if Simao Sambrosa is on top form to really run the Barca defence ragged.<br><br>Inter-Villarreal should be pretty even as inconsistent Inter clashes with another inconsistent Spanish underachiever. UCL seems to bring out the best in Villarreal though...boring boring match anyone?</div>
