              <p>Wonder if this would come thru....Byron Scott as Head Coach of Lakers.....Magic johnson is the Executive VP for the Lakers so it might happen. He might brings back the FastBreak.</p>
              <p>The other news clip is that LeBron might cross over to the Knicks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Byron Scott, who was an on-court mentor to Bryant when Kobe was a mere Jedi trainee, is rumored to be waiting out Jackson before making a decision on his coaching future.

But Jackson figures to unload a decision before LeBron makes the world stop spinning long enough to announce his destination</em>.</p>
              <p>I still think that Phil will stay for 1 more year to see thru transfer of coaching to the next coach.</p>

              <p>Last Stand........Coach Phil Jackson will sign up for 1 more year to close its career. Byron Scott has sign up with the Cav.</p>
              <p>I really doubt the Lakers is going to get 3 peak with the way all the Big and Tall player are coming in.  </p>

              <p class="hn-byline">By The Associated Press (CP) – <span class="hn-date">17 minutes ago</span></p>
              <p>LOS ANGELES, Calif. — Steve Blake says he has agreed to a contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
              <p>Blake told Portland radio station 95.5 FM on Friday that he has a four-year deal with the two-time defending champions, who might lose starting point guard Derek Fisher in free agency.</p>
              <p>NBA teams can't sign players until next week.</p>
              <p>The veteran point guard could replace the 35-year-old Fisher, who won his fifth title with the Lakers last month but is an unrestricted free agent. Fisher said he would like to return to the Lakers, but could be looking for a bigger deal than the team could offer.</p>
              <p>Blake, a seven-year veteran, played for Portland and the Clippers last season.</p>

              <p><br>most likely Rookies to run around.....might as well be a 3 man team....ha ha ha. It is not easy to coach 3 mega players and it is not easy to play with 3 mega players in the team....</p>
              <p>Also alot of expectation will be riding on these 3 guys. What if they lost that would be career wrecking......including the coach.</p>
              <p>You can check which team is playing with them in their regular season......i think that high performance team would still need  top down within the team. All equal does not necessary meet the performances and if any hipup they have to face the media.</p>
              <p>It will be interesting to Watch next season basketball.</p>

              <p>Thing is, if they're going to share the ball, i really do not believe they should have gotten all 3 of em. Probably Bosh and Wade + other good players is better then LBJ and the rest filled with veterans or rookies..They even have to give up Michael Beasley to clear cap space..Because all 3 of em are used to being the go to guy in the league, so why pay the maximum for someone who will have his numbers cut down due to sharing of the ball? It really doesn't make much sense to me.</p>

              <p>Pat Riley might want to deploy  "Fast Break" Basketball as he did it with the Lakers in the 80s. That required Speed in transition basketball.</p>

              <p>Pat Riley probably want to break up the Kobe - Fish

              <p>I think Pat Riley still see Lakers the team to beat next
              season, and also his ego probably can't stand Zen Master

              <p>Fisher is a perfect fit for the new Miami Heat because the ball handlers will clearly be LBJ and D Wade, so all they need is a point guard who has experience and can shoot the 3 and you will expect him to have many open looks with D Wade and LBJ commanding double teams..</p>
              <p>But still, i feel that all their numbers from last season will probbaly only be at 70% considering they have to share the ball, what they need now is a centre who can play D and rebound.</p>

              <p><br>one of the Tall guy will need to fill the shoes of the center...don't u think so.  with all the fisacol from Lebron it would be interesting to see if Fisher swim to the other coast.</p>

              <p>Lakers needs to clear salary space, letting go of shannon brown and farmar will go a small way to do it. But ir eally guess they need a backup point guard that can actually defend and shoot a 3 because fisher is getting old, and asking Kobe to guard young and quick guards like Rondo will only make him less effective.</p>
              <p>For example if Lakers plays the Heat, Artest will be guarding Lebron, then Kobe guarding Wade, which you know will only drain Kobe physically and mentally.</p>

              <p>they will keep shannon brown he can run. i think Lakers still have Lamar, Gasol  and Andrew to rotate...other than Kobe.</p>
              <p>i think Andrew will be a critical player next season....he has 2 phsychological barrier to cross....his leg and playing the big guy.</p>

              <p>Fisher cited his personal relationship with Kobe Bryant in particular in his statement:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>At the end of the day, there’s one person I could not turn away from. Kobe Bryant asked me to stay but supported whatever decision I made. He and I have played together for 11 seasons, came into the league together as kids, and has been loyal to me even when others had doubts. We have won five championships together.</p>
              <p>I have decided to continue with Kobe, continue with our teammates and the fans of Los Angeles. While this may not be the most lucrative contract I’ve been offered this off season, it is the most valuable. I am confident I will continue to lead this team on and off the court. Let the hunt for six begin…</p>
