He was voted England's best player at the World Cup. Better than Gerrard or Lampard, these 2 will come with a transfer fee of $30m each so $13m still a bargain. But if it was from an english club to another english club it would have costed more.<br><br>Anyway, Hargreaves is still younger than Gerrard and Lampard and he played in last nightÂ’s 4-0 win over Greece and he was voted "Man of the match" even tho Gerrard and Lampard were playing.</div>
