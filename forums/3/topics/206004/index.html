            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson is still hoping Manchester United can wear down Bayern Munich's resistance to selling Owen Hargreaves.<br><br>The England international has emerged as The Red Devils' leading midfield target before the close of the transfer window.<br><br>Bayern are determined to resist the overtures of the Premiership club, despite Hargreaves acknowledging a desire to move to Old Trafford.<br><br>Ferguson understands the German champions' stance, but hopes to persuade Bayern to part with the 25-year-old.<br><br>"There is nothing I can tell you," Ferguson told PremPlus after United had started the new season with a thumping 5-1 win over Fulham.<br><br>"We are trying hard, but they are very stubborn and resistant are Bayern Munich. I can understand that and we can only do our best.<br><br>"I think we want to build a strong squad of players and there are key elements to that and that is certainly the case with Owen."<br><br>If United fail to complete a deal for Hargreaves, Ferguson is optimistic his squad has the depth to cope with the challenges which lie ahead this season.<br><br>He added: "We have a terrific squad. You saw the centre of midfield today was excellent.<br><br>"Michael Carrick is coming back, hopefully, next week and it gives us more ammunition.<br><br>"I'm very satisfied with the squad as a whole. We have 20-odd players and that is hopefully enough."<br><br>Wayne Rooney scored twice in the romp over Fulham and Ferguson was left to lament the fact that the striker will miss the next three games through suspension.<br><br>"It was a great start to the season, but unfortunately we don't have him for the next three matches," continued Ferguson.<br><br>"We have to cope with that and we will do. It's disappointing, but that's why we've got a squad of players.<br><br>"We have got to handle these situations the best we can and we will do that."<br><br>Louis Saha, an Ian Pearce own goal and Cristiano Ronaldo also helped The Red Devils to an easy victory which pleased Ferguson.<br><br>He concluded: "I think it's probably our best start to a season, scoring five goals. I was very pleased with the performance and the work rate was good. You can't be any more pleased than that.<br><br>"The making and taking of goals was excellent throughout the match and we played with great confidence and belief."</div>
