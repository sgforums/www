              <p><strong>Manchester United star Ryan Giggs was accused of an eight-year affair 
              with his brother’s wife as the fall-out from his ill-fated gagging order
               became ever more damaging.<br><br> The Daily Mail reports Giggs, formerly regarded as the model 
              professional and committed family man, found his reputation further 
              sullied by tawdry details of the relationship with his 28-year-old 
              sister-in-law Natasha.</strong> <strong><br><br> He had been cheating on his wife Stacey with her before she began dating his younger brother Rhodri, a Sunday newspaper claimed.</strong> <strong><br><br> It said Giggs slept with Natasha the day after his eight-year-old 
              daughter was born, and again the day after the arrival of his 
              four-year-old son. The affair was alleged to have continued until April 
              9.</strong> <strong><br><br> To underline 37-year-old Giggs’s folly in taking out his notorious 
              injunction over an alleged fling with former Big Brother housemate 
              Imogen Thomas, his sister-in-law said it was this which spurred her to 
              break her silence.</strong> <strong><br><br> "When I found out he was cheating with Imogen too, I was really hurt," she told the News of the World through a ‘friend’.</strong> <strong><br><br> "I know that sounds really strange, but he wasn’t just cheating on 
              Stacey, he was cheating on me too. Our relationship was just about sex 
              to him."</strong> <strong><br><br></strong> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Jesus christ! even his brother's wife also dun let go! This is the kinda "hero" our ManUre fans are worshipping??</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Guess his own wife this time really no choice but to divorce him. I wonder Giggs own bro can even forgive him! I'll bet Fergie even also gonna find it hard not to retire him!</span></p>
              <p>His new banner reads:- "Ryan Giggs - Tearing his bros gal apart since 1991!" LOL!</p>

              <p>Well, it takes two hands to clap.</p>
              <p>If Ryan Giggs had been cheating on his wife, then Natasha Giggs had been cheating on her husband. I've got zero sympathy for the woman.</p>
              <p>In all this, the real victim here is Rhodri Giggs. Imagine being betrayed by both your wife <strong>and</strong> your brother.</p>

               Natasha, his brother Rhodri’s wife, while flirting with the 49-year-old
               at family gatherings.<br> <br> Friends claim relatives had a “frank exchange” with the married dad-of-two who is said to have brushed off the ­accusations.<br> <br> A source close to 34-year-old Rhodri said: “It was a great source of mither amongst the Giggs’.<br> <br> “Some of the family felt Ryan was getting a bit too close for comfort to
               Lorraine and words were exchanged. Certain people accused Ryan of 
              flirting with her whenever they were together and things eventually came
               to a head.<br> <br> “Ryan laughed it off, saying they were getting the wrong end of the stick, but things were heated.”<br> <br> The unmarried ­footballer at the centre of the fresh claims played alongside Giggs for almost 100 matches under Ferguson.<br> <br> Natasha is said to have confessed to devastated Rhodri and a friend last
               week that she had an eight-year affair with brother-in-law Giggs.<br> <br> She claimed they regularly slept together after first meeting at a
