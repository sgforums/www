No, there's nothing great about walesa - but perhaps, unsubstantiated "great upsets" taken off annals which you've never seen(and know nuts about) and would like to go on and on about would be better served in another thread you could always create so as not to spoil your warped version of the beautiful game.<br><br>Moreover, there's every chance you could have a utopian discussion which could prove more fruitful amongst you lot of football historians as well and no, you still wouldn't be great enough to spoil the beautiful game IMO just yet(since there's hardly anything "beautiful" to talk about if you chose to talk about things you've never seen)...</div>
