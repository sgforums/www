AIG is willing to give almost 15M a year to have their logo on their shirt. Its the highest shirt sponsor deal in England and only lesser to 1 or 2 clubs, Juventus's is one of them... Their shirt sponsor, a oil company from Libya but that one is now over too now that Juventus has been relegated to second division football.<br><br>It make more sense to go with AIG since they are willing to pay so much. Their old sponsor "Sharp" could not even offer them 3M a year. Times have change, You go with the person that can pay you the most for your shirt deal... And AIG is the biggest insurance company in the world.<br><br>This way, you won't need to sell your stadium name and history away like some other club.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

A contract will remain unless both parties are willing to end it. One party alone cannot withdraw unless the other party compromise it and In this case, it wasn't...<br><br>Vodafone may be a big company but it is a known fact that they are losing lots of money in recent years now that the handphones industry in Europe is more or less saturated. They even made a record lost last year in their business report.<br><br>They may have consulted with man u and gave them the permittion to seek a new sponsor if they can get a better offer than theirs. That is the reason why AIG came in. If Man utd couldn't get a sponsor better than Vodafone's $9m a year, Vodafone would still have to remain as sponsor until their contract ends. But if man utd had a even bigger offer and Vodafone is not willing, man u will still have to stick with Vodafone for the next 2 years. So in a way man u got lucky and had an early release from their contract.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Vodafone is a public listed company and they had to make such announcement so that it gives the Man u board a legal right to look for a new sponsor or otherwise if they changed their minds after a new sponsor is found a lawsuit could be brought against the Man u club.<br><br>Anyway, this issue turned out very well for man utd. The moment they started looking, companies were queuing to sponsor them... the indo tycoon internet gambling/tobacco firm wanted to sponsor much more than AIG's but Man utd didn't want to be associated with a gambling/tobacco firm as their sponsor that is why they when with AIG.<br><br>Anyway, AIG is a even bigger company than Vodafone and they are sponsoring more than any other clubs in England is getting.</div>
