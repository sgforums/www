            <div class='col-md body'>First it was Owen, then Gerrard now Lampard... These fellows got no honour at all. They are now criticizing sven for their WC exit. Its as if it was only his fault... When a team fail, its the responsibility of the whole team and not just one man.<br><br>I can't believe that this Lampard actually dare to criticize sven... Maybe he should take a good long look at himself in the mirror and ask if he played well or not during the WC! when he himself was one of the biggest under-performer for them during the WC. How can he be critical of sven when he was the manager that give him his England chance, played him all the time, even during the WC when he was playing badly too.<br><br>It must be really sad for Sven to find out someone you brought out and put your trust in can stab you in the back once you turn away. It just shows what kind of character this Lampard is... I bet he wouldn't be saying all this if Sven was still the Manager of England.<br><br>A really lousy character this Lampard have, just disgusting. How can you trust this type of people again. Mourinho better be careful or one day he get stub in the back also.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe he is trying for a shot to be captain also... as it has not been decided yet and since Terry &amp; Gerrard are strong contenders, he try to speak up to get notice... But a cheap shot!<br><br><strong>Lamps' autobiography, being serialised in the News of the World, reveals he hopes to rival John Terry and Steven Gerrard as the successor to skipper David Beckham.<br><br>He said: "I have had the privilege of captaining Chelsea on a few occasions and have enjoyed it.<br><br>"I would love to do the same for England. If I was called on I know I would do a good job.<br><br>"It's more difficult than ever to be captain of England with the kind of press scrutiny that exists at all levels.<br><br>"Everyone has an opinion about you and your life, but I know I could handle that."<br><br>Lampard, though, reacted angrily during Germany 2006 when he was slated by many for his mediocre World Cup form.</strong><br><br>So will we see a Captain Lampar?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, if you think they are all doing this with the sole purpose of only trying to impress Steve McClaren.<br><br>The ones talking are mainly in the running for the captain post namely, Terry, Lampard &amp; Gerrard. At least Owen had the balls to say it before Sven left... The other 3 waited until sven left then shoot their worthless thoughts out as if they didn't play a part during the WC.<br><br>What a disgusting thing to do for Gerrard &amp; Lampard at least Terry only said good thing about Steve McClaren and not badmouth Sven after he is gone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lampard? Haha.. I couldn't care less about that fella. Before he starts shooting at Eriksson perhaps he should take a look at his own shooting record at WC2006.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>In any case, my vote goes to John Terry for the post of captain.</div>
