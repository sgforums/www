            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Blackburn's Warnock wants error-prone refs suspended<br>tribalfooball.com - March 18, 2007<br><br>Blackburn Rovers fullback Stephen Warnock is demanding suspensions for error-prone refs after Saturday's defeat against West Ham.<br><br>Warnock feels referees must be made more accountable for their decisions after Howard Webb gave West Ham a ridiculous' penalty and then, on linesman Jim Devine's say-so, awarded them a winning goal when the ball never crossed the line.<br><br>Webb enraged Rovers even further by issuing a second yellow card to David Bentley four minutes into stoppage time for deliberate handball.</span><br><br>It was his second caution and he now misses his side's next match - the small matter of a trip to Manchester United. That was the last straw for Warnock, who fumed: "Refs are supposed to be professionals, earning a professional wage.<br><br>"But they feel that if they say sorry it's like admitting they've done wrong and they could lose a top game next time. Yet that's exactly what should happen. Bents is going to be suspended for one game because of one of this referee's bad decisions. Refs don't miss a game, though, when they do far worse things - and they should do.<br><br>"When Bents is sitting out our game against Manchester United, that ref will be running around on some pitch without a care in the world. They are getting away with murder. I think it's ridiculous. His performance just sums up what we're up against with a lot of referees these days. We see the same thing time and time again.<br><br>"The number of mistakes he made was shocking but he's not going to apologise for what he has done. I've always said I don't really agree with goal-line technology, yet after this I'm starting to change my mind. It was blatantly obvious their second goal should never have been given. It was never over the line. There was also a handball by Lee Bowyer in it and Carlos Tevez was in an offside position.<br><br>"If the officials can't pick up on one of those things between them, you wonder what game they are watching.<br><br>"I could clearly see Tevez stood on the line. He was right next to me and I had a clear view of the ball.<br><br>"When the ref blew his whistle, we all thought it was for a free-kick to us for handball or offside. It was only when the West Ham players ran to celebrate on the side of the pitch we realised he'd given a goal.<br><br>"Their penalty was almost as bad. Brett Emerton tried to get a block in and Tevez fell over his own feet. You could see him kick his own standing leg and the replays proved that.<br><br>"It wasn't Tevez's fault. He didn't dive. He couldn't stay up after getting in a tangle. But there was no way Brett made any contact with him. You can't give a penalty unless you're pretty sure about it. Or at least you shouldn't do. It was another shocking decision.<br><br>"It all comes back to the old scenario. They haven't played the game at this level, so they don't understand it."<br><br><span style="color: red;">Agree ref Standard really drop alot this season</span></div>
