            <div class='col-md body'>CARLOS TEVEZ and Javier Mascherano joined West Ham in a sensational double transfer and told SunSport: Â“We canÂ’t wait to take the Hammers to new heights.Â”<br><br>The Argentina World Cup superstars, pictured yesterday in a lift at the posh Docklands Marriott Hotel, signed permanent deals from Brazilian side Corinthians.<br><br>Striker Tevez and midfielder Mascherano, both 22, turned down Manchester United and Arsenal to join the Hammers.<br><br>Upton Park boss Alan Pardew said: Â“ItÂ’s a monumental day for us. This deal will give us a real chance to compete with the very best teams in the Premiership and in Europe.Â”<br><br>Tevez said: Â“I have been looking for a move to England and, despite speculation about other clubs, West Ham came in with a more suitable offer for Javier and I.<br><br>Â“I am now looking forward to playing in England. ItÂ’s a great challenge and we are both aware of the great tradition behind the West Ham colours.Â”<br><br>Their arrival is the most stunning English club deal since TottenhamÂ’s capture of Argentina stars Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa after the 1978 World Cup.<br><br>It is understood West Ham paid only Â£1million to sign them for one year. They are then available for a joint Â£30m if all parties agree.<br><br>The playersÂ’ registrations are part-owned by Media Sports Investment, who also own Corinthians.<br><br>MSI is headed by Iranian-born tycoon Kia Joorabchian who made an unsuccessful Â£70m bid to buy the Hammers last year.<br><br>Super-agent Pini Zahavi and race horse owner Michael Tabor, a lifelong Hammers fan, are also thought to be involved in the deal.<br><br>If Joorabchian now decides to meet West Ham chairman Terence BrownÂ’s Â£130m asking price, he will have the final say on the future of both players.<br><br>They put pen to paper at the Cumberland Hotel in Marble Arch at 5am yesterday before joining the Argentina squad for SundayÂ’s friendly clash with Brazil at ArsenalÂ’s Emirates Stadium.<br><br>United boss Alex Ferguson is apparently fuming he was unable to raise the Â£14m to sign Tevez permanently.<br><br>Tevez is nicknamed Apache after the tough Buenos Aires neighbourhood Fuerte Apache in which he was raised.<br><br>He is scarred from his right ear to his chest after an accident with boiling water as a kid.<br><br>Tevez was top scorer in Athens with eight as Argentina took Olympic football gold in 2004.<br><br>He was also a scoring substitute when the Argies thrashed Serbia &amp; Montenegro 6-0 at the 2006 World Cup.<br><br>Tevez, ArgentinaÂ’s footballer of the year in 2003 and 2004, cost Corinthians a South American club record Â£12m 20 months ago.<br><br>He has a fiery streak that will remind fans of Hammers legends Billy Bonds, Julian Dicks and Paolo Di Canio.<br><br>Once the deal became public, West Ham were approached by Manchester United and Arsenal over captain Nigel Reo-Coker.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe there's really some truth in West Ham = Chelski's parking club.<br><br>1m pound? No matter how you look at it, there's something fishy about it. Ah well, at least I'm glad Liverpool already played them once in the league. Man U and Arsenal got to be careful about losing points against West Ham.<br><br>Oh, and I bet both will be "injured" for the two matches against Chelski.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
