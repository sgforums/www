            <div class='col-md body'>Wednesday February 21, 7:41 AM<br><br>Tempers flare over United's controversial Champion's League football victory<br>Manchester United snatched a vital 1-0 Champions League last 16 first leg victory in controversial circumstances against French side Lille.<br><br>Ryan Giggs scored directly from a quickly-taken free-kick with seven minutes left but that incensed the Lille players who were still trying to construct their defensive wall.<br><br>The game was briefly held up by protesting Lille players at Lens' Stade Felix-Bollaert as the home side seemed set to walk off the pitch.<br><br>Their behaviour incensed the United manager Sir Alex Ferguson.<br><br>"I have never seen that before in all my years in football," steamed the United handler.<br><br>"That is a disgrace and UEFA have to do something as that was pure intimidation of the referee.<br><br>"Its a disgrace. However whether we should be awarded the tie is an area I wouldn't go into. It will take an hour or two for me to digest what went on out there. They the Lille players tried to get my players to go off the pitch and that is disgraceful,"; added Ferguson, whose players have been known for intimidating referees over penalty decisions down the years.<br><br>However Fergie's outburst drew short shrift from Lille counterpart Claude Puel.<br><br>"I don't know how that man (Ferguson) can allow himself to comment like that about this. He should have said nothing," stormed the 45-year-old.<br><br>"The team wished to make a complaint about the goal and didn't want to leave the field. They were just making a protest.<br><br>"In France the tradition is to make a protest at the first pause in the game and then after the match."<br><br>It was an unfortunate way to end a thrilling second half that swayed back and forth.<br><br>There was a brief spurt of activity during the first-half at the United fans' end of the stadium as four away supporters scaled the pre-Hillsborough style fences and tried to unbolt the gates.<br><br>They were quickly apprehended by the French police and despite some sustained goading from certain fans, the match proceeded without another incident.<br><br><strong>I look forward to Lille players taking the ball in penalty area &amp; chiong into the goal, thus taking this controversy to the next level!</strong></div>
