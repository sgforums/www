            <div class='col-md body'>Its up to individual preference and views, so I will respect your opinion on EPL. Just like my preference is Serie A.<br><br>And look thru my post, u can see that I never indicate in any part stating that which league is the better or lousier.<br><br>Aruging on which league is better has become a very boring topic already. Tired to talk about this issue.<br><br>I'm just stating to look around the world. There are players all over the world. There are so many exciting players. European football gets more recognition, very simply because there's where big money flows. South American football is nice to watch as well, TO ME.<br><br>Sorry for being off topic. Back to the topic, I think I didnt really answer the question in my previous post. Kaka is not as good as Ronaldinho in conclusion, because he is not as influential in games, like what Maradona, Pele, Cruyff, Beckenbauer or even Zidane during his prime used to have.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ronaldinho has no peers in the last third of field. Heck, he can even scores while in stationery position. Has all the attributes of a attacker.. fast, agile, visionary, purposeful and scores goals. Also, his determination deserves a mention too.<br><br>Kaka is somewhat one of the best midfielders of his generation.
