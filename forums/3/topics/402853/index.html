              <p><a href="http://mmajunkie.com/news/19604/strikeforces-fedor-emelianenko-im-not-a-fan-of-the-ufc.mma">http://mmajunkie.com/news/19604/strikeforces-fedor-emelianenko-im-not-a-fan-of-the-ufc.mma</a><br> <br> Top-ranked heavyweight Fedor Emelianenko said today that he doesn't  
              think much of the promotion that's so aggressively courted him for more 
               than three years.<br> <br> "I'm not a UFC fan," Emelianenko said when asked if his June 26  
              headliner against Fabricio Werdum at "Strikeforce: Fedor vs. Werdum" is 
               more relevant than an a UFC title-unification bout between champ Brock 
               Lesnar and interim title-holder Shane Carwin at UFC 116.<br> <br> "I would invite all the fans to watch our fight, which I believe is more
                important," he said through translator Steven Bash.<br> <br> The winner of Emelianenko (31-1 MMA, 1-0 SF) vs. Werdum (13-4-1 MMA, 2-0
                SF) is expected to fight current Strikeforce heavyweight champion  
              Alistair Overeem, who in May defended his title against Brett Rogers.<br> <br> Overeem and his managers have sparred in the press with Emelianenko's  
              representatives over the potential bout and have traded accusations as  
              to the the long-anticipated fight's delay.<br> <br> Emelianenko, who this past August signed a three-fight contract with  
              Strikeforce after intense negotiations with the UFC, did not back off  
              his statements when later asked to clarify.<br> <br> "I'm not a fan of watching [the UFC's] fights," he said. "Compared to a 
               lot of the commercials and promotion in anticipation of their fights,  
              and compared to a lot of the shows I've seen, there seems to be a lot of
                negativity involved in their shows.<br> <br> "So I'm just not a fan of watching their programs."<br> <br> It was the first time Emelianenko took a direct shot at the UFC's  
              product. In the three years since the Russian became a free agent with  
              the shuttering of PRIDE Fighting Championships, he shied away from  
              criticizing the industry-leading fight promotion.<br> <br> UFC president Dana White alternately has blasted Emelianenko and coveted
                his services.<br> <br> "I've signed Brock Lesnar, who came from the WWE, James Toney from  
              boxing – he's a nut chasing me all over the place – Tito Ortiz, whom I  
              hated, and he hated me," White told MMAjunkie.com (<a href="http://www.mmajunkie.com/">www.mmajunkie.com</a>) 
              in  an interview following UFC 115. "I've kept Chuck Liddell, kept Matt 
               Hughes, kept Rich Franklin, when they were all champions. Anderson  
              Silva, I've dealt with all the crazy [expletive] with him.<br> <br> "But I can't sign Fedor? How is this possible that I can't sign this  
              guy? It's not possible. These guys don't want to fight the best in the  
              world."<br> <br> Emelianenko said his dislike of the UFC stems from how its fights are  
              presented and the fighters it employs.<br> <br> "I think a combination," he said. "And also, in some ways, (it's due to)
                the actions and the behavior of a lot of fighters from the UFC. It  
              takes away from the sport."<br> <br> In the past, Emelianenko's manager, Vadim Finkelchtein, has addressed  
              White's claims. But today, the manager and M-1 Global president was  
              silent.<br> <br> Strikeforce CEO Scott Coker said today that "Strikeforce: Fedor vs.  
              Werdum" has crossed the 10,000 mark in ticket sales, and he expects a  
              full house at the HP Pavilion in San Jose, Calif., for the event.</p>
