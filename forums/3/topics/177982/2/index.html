Sometimes jealously and some arrogant fans plays a part in influencing a rival fan's perspective of a dominant team.<br><br>Man Utd's domination of English football during the mid-90s attracted millions of fans as well as anti-man utd fans. These anti-man utd fans similarly labeled Man Utd as arrogant and smug, at the end of the day, the cycle goes on... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a different read from another angle.<br><br>BORO v CHELSEA - BRIGGSY'S VIEW<br><br>Roles were reversed it seemed yesterday at the Riverside. It was Middlesbrough in red that were playing like the league champions. The 3-0 drubbing of Chelsea was on par with MourinhoÂ’s worst managerial career defeat and it proved that the untouchables are beatable.<br><br>Boro lined up in a 4-5-1 formation, with Morison, Downing, Rochemback and Mendieta providing the attacking outlet with big Yakubu up front on his own. He had played that role superbly with Portsmouth. We were barely taking our seats when we were back up celebrating. Chelsea won a throw-in deep in their own half, Ricardo Carvalho received and lost the ball in the same moment and Fabio Rochemback was on hand to take advantage, playing a quick one-two with Yakubu. Rochemback then turned inside John Terry and placed a shot which squeezed under Petr Cech. 1-0!<br><br>You could see the confidence come streaming back. Confidence does wonders in football and many underestimate the importance of it. Some take the blase approach that because you get paid Â‘xÂ’ amount your confidence should be rocket high and it's simply not true. ChelseaÂ’s best chance of the half came when Essien had a wild swerving shot from wide left which Schwarzer could only parry into CrespoÂ’s path, then made a fantastic save to deny Chelsea an equaliser. Chelsea were limited to shots from range and played plenty of possession football in front of us, rather than in behind us. We looked perfectly comfortable with this.<br><br>It was 2-0 on the stroke of half time when the ball was played up field to Yakubu who got the better of Carvalho then had his shot blocked, which fell to Downing who still had a lot to do. He turned inside the defender and calmly slotted the ball home on his right foot. The Riverside exploded with celebration and although many of us did not believe the score line, no one could question whether we deserved it. The goal came at a crucial time and will have made McClaren's half-time team talk slightly easier. The boro players went off to a standing ovation at half time and what a boost that will have given them.<br><br>Another boost was seeing the influential George Boateng back in the fold. WeÂ’ve missed him just as much as Chelsea missed Makelele. The game was put beyond any doubt when again the ball was played up to Yakubu whose strength was too much for John Terry. The Yak turned inside then simply breezed past Terry like he wasnÂ’t there and then had the composure to calmly place the ball into the net. 3-0!! Not many would have expected 3-0 with just over an hour played against the league champions. Riggott and Southgate were our rock at the back, limiting Crespo and Carlton Cole to the odd chance.<br><br>Every single Middlesbrough player played immensely and the shining light for me was Rochemback who proved why he was voted PortugalÂ’s player of the year. He nearly scored a fantastic goal that will certainly be a firm contender for goal of the season. He belted it from wide right and it looked destined for the top corner, but for a fantastic save by Petr Cech.<br><br>The players were given a rapturous reception at the end and fully deserved it. I donÂ’t think IÂ’ve seen a better all round display than we gave yesterday. Everyone had a smile on their face Â– fans, players, management. It was one of those days that you just know donÂ’t come along very often, and by God did we enjoy it.<br><br>The midfield worked their socks off, stopping Chelsea playing their own game. The key ingredients to the victory were simple Â– attitude and organisation with quick precision counter attacking football. Rumours going round of disharmony in the squad and how McClaren has Â‘lostÂ’ the dressing room were well and truly blasted out of the water yesterday. Team spirit has always been evident when McClaren has been in charge, none more so than yesterday, with every outfield player celebrating the goals.<br><br>Its been a poor season with injuries and losing Zenden dented the club's plans. Rochemback has taken time to settle, time which we havenÂ’t had at the moment. Losing an influential player like George Boateng reduces the solidity of the team, and the frustrations on and off the field has added extra pressure on McClarenÂ’s already depleted team. But McClaren has to be credited for the way he has handled the pressure. His squad has stuck together and yesterday's result showed how much hard work has gone on behind the scenes. I hope the fans lay off McClarenÂ’s back now and let him get on with his job. Even a little support may not be out of the question?<br><br>There is clear daylight between us and the bottom three now but we must not get complacent. If we can take points from West Brom and Birmingham then the threat of relegation will be a long distant memory and weÂ’ve still got a lot to look forward to this season. ThereÂ’s the small matter of Europe and we're in the final sixteen of the FA Cup with a very good chance to advance to the next stage. Many say this has been a horrendous season. I myself have said it but it just goes to show how McClaren has raised standards on Teesside. So let's stop the infighting and unite behind the club, because this could still be another season that we will not forget, for all the right reasons.<br><br></div>
