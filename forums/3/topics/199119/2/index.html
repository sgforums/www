            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a Spurs fan since 1994/1995 season , the era of Klinsmann , Dumitrescu , Popescu and Sheringham and has been one ever since. Spurs finished in top 10 only twice for the following seasons and just won one Carling Cup and been through various managers such as Gerry Francis , Christian Gross , Glenn Hoddle etc. Not so much of a glory hunter I hope?<br>And I was a Sweden fan since 1994 world cup and Czech fan since 1996 , both teams did not exactly performed wonders for the previous tournaments either.. They are fair weathered fans out there definitely but they are die hard ones as well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Not a second team can make them turn their head around .<br><br>Glory hunter ?

            <div class='col-md body'>Ya I agree with you on this, although ferguson did not totally give up youth development. Wes brown ,rossi, fletcher, o'shea are all from the youth setup.<br><br>Maybe it's because of the wealth , which makes it less necessary to rely much on                            the academy or young players.<br><br>If arsenal aso develops into a rich club, maybe wenger will also start to buy more big name players.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well with wenger's talent in spotting raw talent,i believe that day where arsenal need to buy big names to produce result will not be near.Just look at theo walcott,his latest signing from a lower division club,he look just like a very potential replacement for henry if ever the day come for henry to take the path of viera.</div>
