I know a chap who proudly admitted that he used to support Liverpool and then switch to Man Utd and two season ago Arsenal. Not sure whether his support has moved to Stamford Bridge already. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Everton is considered a big five in the EPL (traditionally speaking) but we have experienced more relegation issues than glory. As far as I can recall, our glory for the last decade was to win the FA Cup in 1995 (just over a decade ago) and pip Liverpool to 4th spot two seasons back.</div>
