Didn't Alex Ferguson spend around the same amt for Wayne Rooney too(inclusive of future payments 2 Everton)? And then what about this season? Anderson, Nani, Tevez in total cost how much? Not to mention that players like Yorke, Keane, Jaap Stam were signed to the club at transfers fees that were considered to be a large sum during their time. Man Utd did it in the past, when they were probably the wealthiest club during the 90s, so why are u so upset with Chelsea shelling up big money for players?<br><br>Thing is, Jose Mourinho deserve respect too. He didn't win the CL with Chelsea, granted, but he had won it with Porto before. I am not going to argue with u the money he spend buying the players because its true, but it seems as if u are doubting his capabilities as a manager. It is 1 thing to sign big name players for big bucks, it is another trying to get all these big name players 2 play as a team and win trophies. That was what Real Madrid failed to do when they had the Galaticos.<br><br>IMO, leaving Chelsea(or sacked) is the best thing for the club and Jose. Whoever is the next manager, the most impt thing probably would be that he is a puppet of Roman.</div>
