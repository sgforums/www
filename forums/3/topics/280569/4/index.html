            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Wenger saddened by Jose exit</strong><br>by Tom Adams, 21 September 2007</span><br><br>Arsene Wenger has described Jose MourinhoÂ’s shock exit from Chelsea as not Â‘good news for footballÂ’.<br><br>The Frenchman has had many a verbal tussle with Mourinho over the past three years but was disappointed to see his rival leave Stamford Bridge after much intrigue on Wednesday night.<br><br>It is believed that Roman AbramovichÂ’s desire to see Chelsea play attractive football superseded his pleasure at MourinhoÂ’s constant stream of trophies, leaving both parties forced to push through a divorce that will see Mourinho net a huge compensation payment.<br><br>Whilst Wenger has not been short of a barb or two in MourinhoÂ’s direction regarding his style of play in the past, the Frenchman still feels that the departure of the Chelsea boss after three years in the hotseat reflects badly on the game at large.<br><br>"It is basically sad because I feel Mourinho is a manager of quality," said Wenger.<br><br>"I am a great believer in technical stability and therefore I don't think it is good news for football."<br><br>Wenger has also insisted he holds a great respect for Mourinho, despite threatening him with legal action in 2005 after the former Chelsea boss accused him of being a Â‘voyeurÂ’ .<br><br>"We didn't get on the best but recently it has become better,Â” Wenger added. "That does not hide the fact I respected what he did and the quality of his work.<br><br>"Of course he is a great manager. He arrived when Chelsea were on the way up; they had a good side already and he did something more and made them winners.<br><br>"He deserves a lot of credit for that because it is never easy to win and in England it is maybe more difficult.Â”<br><br>Wenger has further revealed he enjoys a good relationship with the man who has been appointed to succeed Mourinho, Avram Grant.<br><br>"I know him very well from Israel. I have very good relations with Avram," Wenger told the clubÂ’s official website. "When he was manager of Israel he visited some clubs and he came here through some common connections we had and since we have had very good relations.<br><br>"He is a very talented coach. I don't know if he is just filling in or will take over for the longer term but we will see what kind of changes he makes."<br><br>Meanwhile, Russian businessman Alisher Usmanov has revealed he is keen to up his stake in Arsenal to over 25 percent, after recently increasing his share to 21 percent.<br><br>Usmanov, in league with former Gunners vice-chairman David Dein, has been increasing his stake steadily and now hopes to hold a blocking stake Â– a portion of the club high enough to make the day to day running difficult without a proportion of shareholder support.<br><br>"I want to be in a position that will allow me a blocking stake and will then wait for it to go up in value," Interfax news agency quoted Usmanov as saying in a broadcast on Ekho Moskvy radio station.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Extracted from http://sport.setanta.com</span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even as a Man Utd fan, I'd be the first to admit there's something special about Jose Mourinho - and Chelsea probably don't realise just what they will miss out by letting him go.<br><br>Maybe, it'd take a couple of years - after many more silly firings a la Real Madrid style - for them to realise the value they had in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Special One</span>.<br><br>People could go on talking about Abramovich's millions transforming Chelsea, but all you need is look back at Chelsea's first title-winning campaign to realise the source of the transformation - Mourinho basically inherited a squad vacated by Ranieri (with the exception of Ferreira, Drogba and Carvalho, I can't recall any of those in the squad at the start of the 04/05 season being Mourinho's signings) and transformed a bunch of inconsistent opportunists into a tight-knit unit infused with an insatiable desire for success.<br><br>Time will tell, but I'm quite certain this isn't a step forward for Chelsea...</div>
