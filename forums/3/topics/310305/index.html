              <p>He has fought 56 bulls, sliced off 106 of their ears, and his face and
              body bear the scars that are testimony to his many years in the
              bullring. <br> <br> The statistics would be impressive for any veteran matador but
              Michelito, the star performer in the bullring in Lima, Peru, is only
              ten years old. <br> <br> Michelito, whose full name is Michael Lagravere Peniche, is forced to
              ply his grisly trade in Mexico and other Latin American countries
              because he is still too young to perform in Spain, where the minimum
              age for matadors is 16. <br> <br> <img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_01/MichelitoL_468x444.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em>Michelito battles with a one-year-old bull in the ring at Lima, where the young matador is a superstar</em><br> <br> Michelito first began bull-fighting when he was just five years old. <br> <br> "Ever since I was young, lots of bullfighters visited my house and I went with my dad to the fights," he said. <br> <br> "That's how I developed a taste for bullfighting." <br> <br> At the weekend, Michelito defeated four bulls at Lima's bullring, considered the oldest in the Americas. <br> <br> "When I'm facing a bull, I don't think about anything else. I'm focused on what I have to do," he explained. <br> <br> His remarkable feats at such a young age have reignited the debate over the use of child matadors in the ring. <br> <br> Last year, a 14-year-old matador called Jairo was almost killed in the
              ring when a bull's horn pierced his lung and passed just inches from
              his heart. <br> <br> The practice is unlikely to come to an end anytime soon, however. Child
              matadors can rake in substantial fees for their feats – money which
              usually ends up in their parents' pockets. <br> <br> Jairo was reportedly paid £3,600 per bull for his fights in Mexico and
              was said to have earned £146,000 a year, according to a Spanish
              newspaper. <br> <br> His mother, Diana Peniche Marenco, said he preferred capes and swords as a toddler to toys. <br> <br> "As a mother, of course I'm concerned. But this is what he wants to do," said Peniche, who manages a bullfighting ring. <br> <br> Promoters see child matadors as a lucrative way of bringing in more spectators and tourists to the region. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <em> Source: Daily Mail UK, Mar. 7, 2008</em></p>
