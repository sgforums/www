            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>Furious Henry hits out at referee</strong><br><br>Arsenal captain Thierry Henry was disgusted with referee Terje Hauge's display as his side's Champions League hopes were ended by Barcelona in Paris.<br><br>"I was kicked all over the place. Carles Puyol and Rafael Marquez should have got yellow cards," he said.<br><br>"To defend against me with a yellow card - it's not the same game any more. I expected the referee to do his job. I don't think he did."<br><br>Henry reacted angrily when asked to comment about his Arsenal future.<br><br>Interviewed pitch-side, he said: "I'll start to think about it tonight."<br><br>But later, all he would say was: "Listen - Let's talk about some proper questions."<br><br>Gunners manager Arsene Wenger admitted Henry's decision could be crucial to Arsenal's future.<br><br>"We have many young players in our team. We have a big future as a big team but we need Thierry Henry to achieve that," he said.<br><br>"He has such an influence on our side and can help us become a major force in the world.<br><br>"He said he would sort it out before the World Cup and there's not long to wait now."<br><br>Henry has long been linked with a move to Barcelona and he had a long conversation with opposition striker Samuel Eto'o after the final whistle.<br><br>But Eto'o said: "It was a private thing. We're friends, if we'd lost I'd have been sad but happy for him that he'd won."<br><br>Meanwhile, Henry continued to express his unhappiness at the referee's performance.<br><br>The Arsenal captain shook his head as Hauge went to collect his medal at the trophy ceremony, while the Arsenal fans inside the Stade de France booed.<br><br>However, Henry did agree with Hauge's decision to send off Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann for a professional foul on Samuel Eto'o after 18 minutes.<br><br>"It was a clear sending-off for Jens but if they didn't want us to win, they should have just said it from the start," he said.<br><br>"It was more than difficult. Next time I'm going to learn how to dive maybe."<br><br>But Henry, who was also upset that he was booked for a second-half challenge when he appeared to win the ball, said he was proud of Arsenal's efforts.<br><br>"Everyone was talking about Ronaldinho before the game. I didn't see him today and I didn't see Eto'o," he said.<br><br>"Henrik Larsson made the difference by setting up two goals. That was the key.<br><br>"We can be proud, we can be more than proud but I'm sorry, some of the refereeing today was horrendous." - BBC News</blockquote>So, is a silly umpiring decision going to spell the end of Henry's days as a Gunner? I hope not. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why is everyone saying that it's either an allowed goal but no sending off, or disallowed goal but sending off?<br><br>It SHOULD be sending off AND allowed goal!<br><br>That's how advantage works, no? It was a sending off offence, so the keeper has to go no matter what. But the referee has to choose whether to play advantage or give a free kick. If he plays advantage and allowed the Giuly goal, it's to the expense of the free kick and NOT the sending off.<br><br>We've seen so often that referees play the advantage, only to come back later when play stops to book the offending player. How is it different in this case?<br><br>So why is Arsenal complaining? Their keeper is rightfully sent off, and they got lucky that the goal was disallowed. And I'm not even mentioning the blatant dive by Eboue that led to the Campbell goal.</div>

All the crap.<br><br>now, all come back to haunt Gooners...

            <div class='col-md body'>This is my post-match analysis.<br><br>I would say arsenal sort of self-destructed...somehow.<br><br>haha! lehmann from hero to zero.  (self-destruct) It was majorly his fault! haha.<br><br>Anyway, he deserved to be sent off! It was a clear professional foul. Eto'o had a clear sight on goal and lehmann had no choice but to bring him down, because Eto'o was too fast and nimble for that geezer.<br><br>Useless old f*ckin' fag anyway. Kahn should be NO. 1, not that useless 'lemon' keeper. Bet germany will not win the WC with that eccentric a*shole playing. LOL!<br><br>But anyway, Giuly's goal which was from an OFFSIDE position and rightly so, did not stand.<br><br>And arsenal's goal was conjured from a blantant dive resulting in a free-kick.<br><br>The goal from Sol Campbell; was an opportunist strike. Anyway, barca are not known to be good headers of the ball. Campbell beat Marquez and Oleguer to the ball. I guess Barcelona's reasonable headers would still be Puyol and Marquez. And yes, Larsson.<br><br>Eboue is a f*ckin' diver, and he rammed his studs straight into van Bronckhorst's balls! lol. wtf?! ok.. i mean near there... And when he was tackled, he can still be rolling 5-6 rounds on the pitch! WTF?! It's like as if he's been headshot and would rolling down a steep hill. immatured play-acting kid!<br><br>Henry was disappointing; he should have scored on the couple of occasions when presented with 2 glorious chances. On his tackle on van bommel; although he got the ball, his tackle was kinda heavy. and that's just a minor controversial decision.<br><br>Ronaldinho wasn't at his best; i guess it was partly due to the man-marking strategy Arsenal deployed. But still, his killer passes were a constant danger to Arsenal's rearguard.<br><br>Giuly was good. Making good runs and having good shots on goal.<br>Rijkaard's tactical decision to deploy Eto'o on the left and Ronaldinho in the centre upfront was to actually confuse the Arsenal defence. And also to exploit Campbell's lack of pace, although Toure and Eboue covered up for it.<br><br>The turning point was Rijkaard's substitutions.<br><br>He was smart to bring on Iniesta.<br>This boy can dictate play/tempo, spray killer passes, and making telling runs. He's one of the young, brilliant spanish kids to emerge under the class of fabregas, fernando llorente, jesus navas, etc.<br><br>Belletti's substitution (in) was actually a safety precaution. Oleguer was substituted (out), because he was on a caution, and Rijkaard decided not to take any risk to keep him on. Surprisingly, he scored the winner as he was one of the most unlikely source.<br><br>Larsson's substitution was one of the major turning point. His two brilliant touches made a mockery out of Campbell and Cole.<br><br>Cole's late sliding tackle missed the ball completely, and he succeeded in only sending Belletti off the pitch but not the ball. Stupid idiot. It was clear that he was having problems dealing with Giuly; and moreover he wasn't match-fit enough, so why did the dumb professor Wenger played him and not Flamini?<br><br>The first  Barca's goal scored by Eto'o; although argurably offside, was actually campbell's fault. I give the benefit of the doubt that the goal was actually offside.<br><br>When Larsson released the ball, Eto'o was in line with the Arsenal defence, but his pace took him to the ball before anyone could reached it, and he placed the ball in between the little gap left between Almunia and the near-post.<br><br>Again, i would say that's spells self-destruct. Almunia was poor. Very, very poor. His positioning was pure sh*t.<br><br>Belletti's goal; which was a shot which went through his legs and rebounded into the roof of the net, was because of his poor positioning. Wenger's a real crap buyer when it comes to experienced players, but i have to say he is good at spotting unpolished gems.<br><br>And his tactical decisions were erratic. Playing defensively against a great attacking side like Barcelona is like shooting yourself in the foot when faced with an agressive and hungry lion. It was naive to say the least.<br><br>Arsenal's defence was pure sh*t; thinking that they can soak up all the pressure and hit Barca on the break was kinda far-fetched. Kind of.. because Barca still left gapping holes at the back which Arsenal did not exploit successfully.<br><br>His substitutions were all wrong! Fabregas was controlling play well; and why did he sub in Flamini for him? He couldn't do anything; he's not a player who can change things in an instant. It is Reyes and Bergkamp and to a certain extent, RVP.<br><br>But Reyes came on too late; thus he doesn't have any time to make any impact.<br><br>And why didn't the great dennis Bergkamp make his swansong appearance for Arsenal?! He could really turn the game on its head with his killer defence-splitting passes.<br><br>To be honest, Barca proved too strong for Arsenal. They deserved to win the CL anyway. Now the question is; will Henry stay or go..?<br><br></div>
