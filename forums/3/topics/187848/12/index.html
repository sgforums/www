            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Ref doesn't regret Lehmann dismissal<br>By Ian Ferris - May 19, 2006<br><br>The referee in charge of the UEFA Champions League final, Terje Hauge, has stood by his decision to send off Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.<br>Hauge has insisted that he had no option but to red card Lehmann for a blatant foul.<br><br>"The goalkeeper was going out of the penalty area and was taking down the attacker from Barca, taking him away from a goalscoring opportunity," the official told Sky Sports News.<br><br>"That is a red card situation.<br><br>"I was close to the situation, I whistled and after the match the red card was correct.<br><br>"Three to five seconds later the ball was going into the net and if we had waited three, four or five seconds more we could have accepted the goal to Barcelona.<br><br>"I don't regret it. I had to take the decision from my position. You can discuss the situation but cannot regret it as referee of the day."<br><br>Thierry Henry and Arsene Wenger have also said that Barcelona's equaliser should have been disallowed for offside, but Hauge is refusing to accept criticism for that decision.<br><br>"I saw play going very fast from my position and cannot see any offside," he explained.<br><br>"I have an assistant who takes that decision. He was in line, and if I'm not sure the benefit of the doubt goes to the attacker." </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">technically right,but he should have used the advantage rule instead..........this would also make him technically right and spirtually right</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Blatter adds to referee criticism</strong><br><br>Fifa president Sepp Blatter has added to the criticism of Champions League final referee Terje Hauge.<br><br>Blatter claimed the Norwegian official was wrong to send off Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann, and in the process disallow a Barcelona goal.<br><br>"He was too quick to blow the whistle. In certain actions, and not just in the goalmouth, he should let the advantage and finish the action.<br><br>"He can then come back and blow the whistle," said Blatter.<br><br>The Fifa president was critical of Hauge's whole performance, not just the decision on which the game hinged.<br><br>Blatter added: "It was a great game but it was not helped by the refereeing from the very beginning.<br><br>"He should have let the goal stand, given the goalkeeper a yellow card then the match is still 11 against 11, and it's an open game because it is 1-0."<br><br>"At such a high level we expect at Fifa and in the World Cup that such situations will not occur."<br><br>But Uefa director of communications William Gaillard defended referee Hauge.<br><br>Gaillard said: "I'm not sure he made mistakes. Technically, he was right to send Lehmann off.<br><br>"Perhaps if he had waited half a second more and been less quick it would have had a different outcome.<br><br>"These are the circumstances of life but technically he was right."<br><br></div>
