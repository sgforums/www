            <div class='col-md body'>JOSE FURIOUS AT GALLAS EXIT - REPORTS<br><br>Jose Mourinho was reportedly involved in a 'furious' bust-up with Chelski chief executive Peter Kenyon over William Gallas' move to Arsenal in a swap deal for Ashley Cole.<br><br>According to The Daily Mirror, Mourinho felt 'undermined by Kenyon's decision to allow Gallas to join their bitter Premiership rivals against his wishes' and 'was unhappy at the way he believes the French defender bullied Chelsea into letting him go.'<br><br>The rows were reputedly so heated that they put 'Mourinho's long-term future at Chelsea in serious doubt.'<br><br>Gallas went AWOL during the summer after growing disenchanted with life at Stamford Bridge. While Kenyon believes that the capture of Cole in return for Gallas plus Â£5m represents a coup on Chelski's behalf, Mourinho was palpably less enthused by Gallas's departure on the same day that Robert Huth's move to Middlesbrough was finally sanctioned.<br><br>An injury to either John Terry or Ricardo Carvalho would leave the Premiership champions severely stretched in the centre of defence, and Mourinho's mood is unlikely to have been improved by the realisation that not only has Gallas' arrival solved Arsenal's defensive crisis but his proposed partnership with Kolo Toure is set to be one of the most formidable in the league.<br><br>According to The Daily Mail, Mourinho and Kenyon had several rows throughout the day as the midnight transfer deadline loomed on Thursday.<br><br>The paper claims that 'Mourinho did not want Huth to be sold before Cole was signed, and the pair also clashed over the proposed sale of Wayne Bridge to Newcastle. Bridge believed Chelsea had agreed to sell him after talks with Kenyon, but Mourinho wanted to keep him as cover for Cole.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> Peter Kenyon - CEO = Businessman</strong><br><br>Decided to override Mourinho and sell Gallas, a player who refused to play for Chelsea again and had only 9 months before his contract ends. Reason is despite making a $20m offer to Arsenal for the player Chelsea wanted A cole, it was rejected. He was only available with a part exchange involving Gallas. Therefore, decided to let him go and save $15m for Chelsea despite Mourinho dead against it.<br><br><strong>Jose Mourinho - Manager = Team Chief Strategist</strong><br><br>Was adamant that Gallas stayed and rot in the reserve cos he felt Gallas bullied Chelsea into letting him go and needed to be taught a lesson. But he didn't consider about the money that would go to waste if it was done his way. It seems like there was an ego match going on between Mourinho &amp; GallasÂ… and Mourinho &amp; Kenyon. In the end, Gallas &amp; Kenyon got their ways.<br><br>So who is right and who is wrong?</div>

Tho AC milan wanted him, they didn't make any offer.<br><br>I am sure Kenyon wanted to make Gallas stayed back too otherwise the deal would have been settled long ago rather than waited till the last day, last minute for it to happen...

They didn't think much of him... while Terry &amp; Carvalho was getting all the big praised, reviews and the big salary, he was getting nothing. Low salary, never received the acknowledgement like Terry even though his performance was way better... no new contract until he wanted to leave than they started to treat him with more respect.</div>

He is a man who can stand up for himself.Â”<br><br>Simbert, who lives in the West Indies, will attend FranceÂ’s Euro 2008 qualifier against Italy in Paris tonight before watching Gallas make his Arsenal debut against Middlesbrough on Saturday.<br><br>Former Blues boss Ranieri also branded Chelsea liars.<br><br>The Italian, who signed the French defender from Marseille back in 2001, said: Â“I cannot believe these stories.<br><br>Â“I signed William and he was always a good professional Â— on and off the pitch.<br><br>Â“Of course, I donÂ’t know what has happened in the last two years.<br><br>Â“But this is incredible and I donÂ’t believe it.Â”<br><br>Gallas, 29, who moved to Arsenal just minutes before last weekÂ’s transfer deadline, has denied ChelseaÂ’s claims and accused them of Â“lacking classÂ”.<br><br>Furious club chiefs claim the central defender made a series of bizarre threats to the Blues in an amazing feud with boss Mourinho.<br><br>In a statement, Chelsea bigwigs insisted Gallas:<br><br>HAWKED himself round, searching for the highest bidder.<br><br>THREATENED to boycott their FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool if he was not offered a bigger contract.<br><br>WENT on strike for the new seasonÂ’s opener Â— against Manchester City.<br><br>WARNED he would score an own goal or get himself sent off if the club tried to discipline him.<br><br>Blues fans bombarded the clubÂ’s website yesterday to voice their disgust at GallasÂ’ departure. One wrote: Â“I'm all for calming down and getting things into perspective but this one doesnÂ’t sit easy.Â”<br><br>Another fan said: Â“If what the club has said about him is not true, then he will sue the club for defamation of character. If he doesnÂ’t, then weÂ’ll know where the truth lies.Â”<br><br>But some fans have taken the clubÂ’s statement with a pinch of salt.<br><br>One supporter said: Â“Gallas deserved as much money as the rest of ChelseaÂ’s overpaid stars.<br><br>Â“The statement from the club about this really is pathetic.<br><br>Â“Chelsea has a wage structure? DonÂ’t make me laugh.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s a bloody joke. The people running this club are toxic.Â”<br><br>The FA have decided not to intervene in the row between Chelsea and Gallas.<br><br></div>
