              <h3>FABIO CAPELLO has a mammoth task to win back the hearts and minds of the
                       
                      England players left disillusioned by him during four weeks of World Cup
                       
                      debacle.</h3>
              <p>The Italian has clung onto his job after the FA backed him to carry on.</p>
              <p>But a month locked inside Camp Capello has stretched the loyalty of even
                       those 
                      players who believe he is the right man to lead England.</p>
              <p>And today Sport of the World lifts the lid on a World Cup campaign which
                       saw 
                      the England camp riven by PARANOIA, haunted by FEAR and relying on the 
                      SUPERSTITION of sticking to the same kit as a plank for success.</p>
              <p>Seven days after the most crushing World Cup defeat in England's 
                      history, the 
                      majority of the squad feel, despite the FA's vote of confidence in the 
                      Italian, there has to be a sea-change in both Capello's man-management 
                      and 
                      tactics.</p>
              <p>One senior player said: "We all bought into the manager's ways in 
                      qualification because everything he said and did brought us success.</p>
              <p>"The question many of us are asking is why he forgot most of those 
                      principles 
                      once we got to South Africa.</p>
              <p>"Everything he'd done before went out the window. It got to the stage 
                      where 
                      some of us were asking why Fabio had sent his clueless twin brother to 
                      manage England during the World Cup."</p>
              <p>While few players have publicly put their heads above the parapet 
                      following 
                      England's humiliating exit at the hands of Germany, their private 
                      thoughts 
                      make fascinating reading. And much of the blame is heaped at Capello's 
                      door.</p>
              <h4><strong>Intense</strong></h4>
              <p>Another player admitted: "A lot of us loved Fabio for the way he turned 
                      things 
                      around after Steve McClaren but can't understand why he destroyed so 
                      much of 
                      what he'd built.</p>
              <p>"One of the things everybody admired during our qualification games was 
                      his 
                      attention to detail. We knew everything about the opposition, how they 
                      played, how their set-pieces worked, how they liked to defend and 
                      attack.</p>
              <p>"We would have DVDs on the opposition, we'd go through them and the 
                      build-up 
                      to matches was very intense.</p>
              <p>"During the World Cup that attention to detail was missing. We would 
                      have team 
                      meetings and we'd watch a DVD of the game we'd just played and go 
                      through 
                      it. But it didn't matter what the opposition were playing, we were stuck
                       
                      with the same old 4-4-2 even though nobody believed it was the right way
                       to 
                      play.</p>
              <p>"It was as if Fabio had gone a bit crazy. He looked much older than he 
                      had 
                      done before. His English grew worse the more angry and frustrated he 
                      became. 
                      He cut himself off from even the senior players he used to trust, and 
                      wouldn't change anything.</p>
              <p>"The World Cup was almost too big for him which is mad when you think of
                       
                      everything he's done.</p>
              <p>"He was obsessed with people not knowing the team. He grew paranoid 
                      about 
                      revealing it even to the players who WOULD be playing.</p>
              <p>"None of the goalkeepers were sure what was going on in his head and 
                      even 
                      before the Germany game nobody knew who was going to play between 
                      Matthew 
                      Upson and Jamie Carragher."</p>
              <p>Capello would only name the team in a meeting five minutes before the 
                      squad 
                      left the hotel even though leaks and rumours had already reached the 
                      players.</p>
              <p>"There's no point in being paranoid," one source pointed out. "The 
                      players 
                      just wanted to know what the team was and settle into a pattern."</p>
              <div class="inline-image-left-280"><img title="ROONEY: Couldn't 
                      control his temper" src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00128/rooney_hug_280x420_128763a.jpg" alt="ROONEY: Couldn't control his temper">
              <div class="caption">ROONEY: Couldn't control his 
                      temper</div>
              </div>
              <p>That paranoia was made public one day when Capello exploded at 
                      photograhers 
                      who he thought were being overly intrusive before training.</p>
              <p>Capello's regime even included banning the players from ordering room 
                      service, 
                      not trusting them to comply with the diet devised by the FA's 
                      nutritionists.</p>
              <p>The fact players were forced to spend long periods alone in their rooms -
                       
                      sometimes up to four hours at a time - raised the frustration levels 
                      purely 
                      because Capello did not trust them to relax properly without an imposed 
                      curfew.</p>
              <p>While many of the Italian's dictats were based on science, his decision 
                      to 
                      stick with the all-red kit to face Germany stemmed simply from his 
                      belief it 
                      was a lucky strip after England beat Slovenia wearing it in their last 
                      group 
                      game.</p>
              <p>Small points when taken at face value but it amounted to an atmosphere 
                      where 
                      even the biggest names were scared to approach him in case it affected 
                      their 
                      place.</p>
              <p>The situation reached breaking point after the dismal goalless draw with
                       
                      Algeria and John Terry's infamous press conference where he claimed that
                       he 
                      - and others - would be telling Capello some home truths in a crisis 
                      meeting.</p>
              <p>One fringe player said: "The news filtered back about what JT had said 
                      to the 
                      press and a lot of the big boys went mad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Suddenly, there were players who thought they could make sensible 
                      points too 
                      s***scared to open their mouths. The manager was basically untouchable 
                      and 
                      from that moment nothing changed."</p>
              <p>That incident also strained the relationship between Terry and Steven 
                      Gerrard 
                      with the Chelsea skipper, having picked up on vibes Gerrard was none too
                       
                      pleased with his stance, tackling the captain over it.</p>
              <p>There was definite unease between the two but whispers of a slanging 
                      match are 
                      wide of the mark with Gerrard keeping his own counsel.</p>
              <p>The serial frustration, however, DID manifest itself in the behaviour of
                       Wayne 
                      Rooney. One moment the Manchester United striker would be on fire in 
                      training, the next he grew so angry with himself and his inability to 
                      alter 
                      games that he was almost uncontrollable.</p>
              <h4><strong>Strange</strong></h4>
              <p>Another player admitted: "Wazza was struggling because he'd never known 
                      anything like it before.</p>
              <p>"Nothing he did in games was working, he couldn't control his temper in 
                      training and his behaviour was strange, to say the least.</p>
              <p>"Capello didn't seem to have any answers. He just kept telling Wazza to 
                      play 
                      the same way and seemed happy when he was good in training but didn't 
                      change 
                      anything when it was obvious the team needed Wazza in a different 
                      position. Only Terry knew the truth behind it"</p>
              <p>"Nobody around him has the courage to tell Capello the truth, they just 
                      tell 
                      him what he wants to hear. In fact, the manager doesn't want to listen 
                      to 
                      anybody, he's just stuck in his ways all the time."</p>
              <p>It even got to the stage where some players were openly debating who 
                      ought to 
                      replace Capello after the World Cup, with the likes of Jose Mourinho, 
                      Guus 
                      Hiddink, Harry Redknapp and even Jurgen Klinsmann mentioned in 
                      dispatches.</p>
              <p>But there remains a core loyalty amongst the senior players - thought to
                       
                      include Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Rio Ferdinand - who back the 
                      decision to keep faith in Capello. They know, though, many things have 
                      to 
                      change.</p>
              <p>As one senior player summed up: "Everything Fabio did before the World 
                      Cup was 
                      perfect. Everything he did during it was mad.</p>
              <p>"The players are just about with him. Well, most of them. But he has to 
                      be 
                      willing to listen and learn, not just think his way is the only way 
                      because 
                      obviously that's been shown up."</p>
