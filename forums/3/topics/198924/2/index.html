            <div class='col-md body'>The Portugese are being targetted unfairly. Most of the players dive from time to time to gain an advantage or to try to influence the referee to make a decision that will be to their benefit. Its just that the Portugese are pretty bad divers.. Admit it , Ballack dives , so does Owen and even the Henry himself and some of the Brazilians as well such as Robinho and even Ronaldinho falls down at the slightest touch. Gamesmanship is used by many coaches. Its just that the Portugese did it pretty badly. And seriously if it was Ronaldo instead of Henry who was tripped for the penalty in the same situation, the whole world would have blasted him for diving. But when its Henry , little or no noise is being made..</div>

But in the Portugal team almost half if not all of them dives or play act.<br><br>Once you start to have a reputation people will alway doubt you. Henry didn't have a reputation as a diver so referees tend to believe him when in doubt more than some players who have a reputation for diving. Because if you see a player constantly diving, how can you believe them if you are not sure?<br><br>That Henry incident with Spain will not be remembered very long but the Portuguese one will last a long time, maybe till the Euro 2008 or even WC2010. People will alway associate Portugal with diving for a long time to come...</div>

I am not just mentioning one incident or two, Its like everytime they take to the field kind of thing.<br><br>No one wants to always be remembered as a Dirty-team, Divers, Cheats ! Any team that wins it in such a way will never get the respect that comes along with the title, in fact, you will always be the butt of jokes as you can see now that people are making fun of that stupid boy and his team of actors &amp; divers.<br><br>I rather Singapore not to even qualify than play in such a way to get in cos people have eyes, they can see for themselves. At the end, Its just down right shameful to be playing in such a way or associate with it.</div>
