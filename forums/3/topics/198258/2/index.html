            <div class='col-md body'>Actually during Euro 2004, Carvalho was the player who injured Rooney during the Portugal vs England quarter final match. Hmm.... for a young man with raging hormones and a well-known fiery temper, I am convinced wat he did was intentional.<br><br>In football, there are a lot of dirty tactics used such as provokation, etc. Rooney had a furstrating match and with such a fiery temper, he is extremly easy to be povoked. Other noticeable players who can play such mind games to cause people to be sent off are Savage, Dickov, Gronkjaer, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

Allowing his bruised ego to get ahead of that will only play to the opposition's advantage and they will continue to seek opportunitistic ways to get him sent off.<br><br>A good professional learns quickly from their mistakes; let's see how quickly Rooney learns from his.
