He however gave Sir Alex a lot of headache by seizing his chances when coming on as a substitute. Gradually, SAF played him in a more withdrawn midfield role which he excelled in. His predatory skills in the penalty box was a result of his early development as a striker. Very cool finishing.<br><br>As for Lampard, from his days as a midfielder in West Ham to his current role in Chelsea, he is more effective than spectacular. And there are easily many other effective English midfielders.<br><br>Scholes for me any day.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Scholes is better with his passing and shooting, his vision is legendary.. whareas Lampard can only score goals.. his assist is not alot too.. compare to scholes or Ronaldino.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They shared one common thing:<br>Both do well in their respective Club but unspectacular in their 3 Lion jersey. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Lampard like a German mid player... effective, efficient and scores from long range. Scholesy has better vision and puts in more thru passes, a playmaker.</div>
