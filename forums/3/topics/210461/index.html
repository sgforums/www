No one is saying the self proclaim "The Special One" is not a good manager but unlike the other good managers, he will come with a baggage load of his nonsense that will make others dislike the club he manage.<br><br>Just look at the accusation he has made against others in the EPL, he started with Man u, than he move on to Liverpool, than to Arsenal... He didn't just attack to club, he attack the person personally as well. Called Wenger a voyeur, said Rafael Benitez's Liverpool was lucky to beat his Chelsea in the CL semi-finals and refuse to shake his hands till this day...<br><br>Chelsea was never a club so many people dislike even till Ranieri left. If anything, Ranieri was a nice and polite guy and he was still around when Roman Abramovich came. The majority of people don dislike Abramovich, if anything, most people find him interesting. But Mourinho is a completely different breed.<br><br>Even in Europe, he goes around accusing not just Managers but even Referees even when his team win matches he said they get more yellow cards than others... let alone if he lose. UEFA referees chief Volker Roth said after Mourinho's alleged role in the retirement of top official Anders Frisk. Frisk quit after receiving death threats from Mourinho accusations, and Uefa referees' committee chairman Roth said: "We can't accept that one of our best referees has been forced to quit because of this. People like Mourinho are the enemy of football." Frisk walked away from football after officiating for 16 years.<br><br>Its not everyday that UEFA referees chief would come out and make a comment like Jose Mourinho is an "enemy of football"<br><br>You don't hear him going out and say Rafael Benitez or Wenger or Fergie or Anyone else is an "enemy of football" do you?<br><br>Despite all the titles Chelsea have won, actually not very much... 2 league title only right if i am not wrong, there is no point if more people start to hate the club. Cos ultimately, the clubs long term being depends on their ability to get new fans support which is the opposite currently at Chelsea. You just compare Chelsea &amp; Barcelona, both are doing well but why is it that more people thinks highly of Barce than Chelsea? And Barce win without the nonsense...<br><br>As for good managers, there are still a lot and better ones around, Marcello Lippi, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Capello, Wenger, Martin Jol, Guus Hiddink, Rijkaard just to name a few.<br><br>Rijkaard and Mourinho joint their respective clubs around the same time, He has spent much lesser money at Barcelona than Mourinho at Chelsea but Rijkaard has since taken Barcelona to 2 Spanish Champions titles, a UEFA Champions League title &amp; 2 Supercopa de EspaÃ±a. But more importantly, Barcelona is seen to be respectable in the world whereas Chelsea is distaste in England and across Europe now... What a great difference, he is really "Special".<br><br><strong>Just some of the "Special's" comments.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Please don't call me arrogant, but I'm European champion and I think I'm a special one."<br><br>"We have top players and, sorry if I'm arrogant, we have a top manager."<br><br>As we say in Portugal, they brought the bus and they left the bus in front of the goal." - after a 0-0 draw with Tottenham Hotspur<br><br>Everybody wants Chelsea to lose a game. When they do they should declare a public holiday."<br><br>"I think he is one of these people who is a voyeur. He likes to watch other people. There are some guys who, when they are at home, have a big telescope to see what happens in other families. He speaks, speaks, speaks about Chelsea." - on ArsÃ¨ne Wenger </span></div>

He also received a 7-month ban but within 2 1/2 months, Mutu signed a new five-year contract with Juventus on January 12, 2005, despite still being banned from football until May. Upon hearing he had joint a new club, Chelsea tried to get a compensation but since they were the ones who sacked him, they didn't own his contract anymore. Mutu when on to join Fiorentina in 2006 and Juve got 8 Million Euros for him.<br><br>Crespo was bought for 17m pounds, he stayed for the first year 03/04, when to Italy the next 04/05 on loan. The following year 05/06, as AC wasn't willing to pay a transfer fee he returned to chelsea. This year 06/07, he heads for Inter. Tho chelsea claim that he is still a chelsea player and they can recall him back next year as he is on load, most don't think he will be back. No transfer fee was gain.<br><br>Juan SebastiÃ¡n VerÃ³n, chelsea paid 15m pounds for him. He only stayed in chelsea for a year, played for them only 7 games and scored 1 goal total. He was loan out to Inter for the next 2 years, and during these 2 years... Chelsea had to share pay part of his huge 90,000 weekly salary as inter wasn't willing to pay so much... which later inspired Spurs with the idea to try and get Duff (70,000) the same way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Del horno joint in 2005 for Â£8 million, left in 2006 for 4m pounds. Only player they got back their money was kezmen.</div>

Then when other fans dislike chelsea's attitude, they will pick on other things to criticize like roman's limitless cash.<br><br>Even when Roman was around with Ranieri was in charge, I dont remember many people disliking chelsea. If anything, there was popular support for chelsea's CL campaign.<br><br>Why? Because, Ranieri is a friendly and honest manager.
