He also received a 7-month ban but within 2 1/2 months, Mutu signed a new five-year contract with Juventus on January 12, 2005, despite still being banned from football until May. Upon hearing he had joint a new club, Chelsea tried to get a compensation but since they were the ones who sacked him, they didn't own his contract anymore. Mutu when on to join Fiorentina in 2006 and Juve got 8 Million Euros for him.<br><br>Crespo was bought for 17m pounds, he stayed for the first year 03/04, when to Italy the next 04/05 on loan. The following year 05/06, as AC wasn't willing to pay a transfer fee he returned to chelsea. This year 06/07, he heads for Inter. Tho chelsea claim that he is still a chelsea player and they can recall him back next year as he is on load, most don't think he will be back. No transfer fee was gain.<br><br>Juan SebastiÃ¡n VerÃ³n, chelsea paid 15m pounds for him. He only stayed in chelsea for a year, played for them only 7 games and scored 1 goal total. He was loan out to Inter for the next 2 years, and during these 2 years... Chelsea had to share pay part of his huge 90,000 weekly salary as inter wasn't willing to pay so much... which later inspired Spurs with the idea to try and get Duff (70,000) the same way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Del horno joint in 2005 for Â£8 million, left in 2006 for 4m pounds.

A blind man can see that. Remember when United were losing 3-0 at Stamford Bridge last season. With two minutes to go, he gets up, and shakes Alex Ferguson's hand. Two years ago, no one would have done that.<br><br>"The manager wouldn't have liked it. But he would have taken that on board. That's what good managers thrive on, that kind of slight. People love to criticise Mourinho, but I like Chelsea. They're well organised; they know their jobs." </span><br></div>

I'm looking forward to that."<br><br>6) I understand that they are in different leagues, but as the initial point was they both took over their clubs about the same time and Rijkaard has been just as successful if not more without spending as much as Mourinho. There league may be different but the CL is the same right.<br></div>

Barcelona got no complete squad ok fyi. Before Rijkaard won the Spanish league title in 2005, Barce was a down and out giant, they didn't win the La Liga for 5yrs until 2005 and they are not like chelsea can buy a few expensive players in one season and if it don't work out can pack and sell cheaply.<br><br>They probably buy 1 expensive player and a few mid-level ones at most. Rijkaard re-builded the whole team and apart from winning the 2 league titles, he also got the CL before Mourinho.<br><br>I am surprise you are not even aware that mutu joint Juve after chelsea sack him...

Do read carfully my friend, i am not the want using offensive language here... if any, you should be pointing it out to him/you... rather than me... go read his/ur earlier post. He said read!!! ass! So i only assume he was asking he arse to read right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I agree with you it not important but since you pick it up to discuss, and got your earlier facts wrong and contradict me by saying <strong><span style="color: green;">"i am sure that chelsea did gain something out of mutu transfer i remembered" </span></strong> i was just letting you know the facts of your club better only.<br><br>Right or wrong move is not the point here. The point is the player was punish with a ban for 7 months by Fifa for his behaviour. Chelsea had a few alternatives, they could have either kept him for 7 months without pay, or kept him 7 months with pay or partial pay, under these 2 options they will still be holding his contract and is entitled to a transfer fee. Or sack him, terminate his contract, meaning he no longer has a contract with the club.<br><br>Since they choose the 3rd option and stop paying him, which is totally all right they should then not expect to get a transfer fee for him right? After all, a fee is paid only when a player's contract still exist and in this case, it no longer...  He needs to make a living also right, why do they still want to stop him from joining another club when they no longer owns his contract? So they expect him to end his football career?<br><br>Lastly, i thought i remind you again that next time, you should see carefully before signing in as the wrong guy to answer peoples posts so this way you won't be discredited.<br><br>Fyi, i was replying to lalaTearz and not you ghimpheng. Anyway congrats chelsea won you should be happy. See i am a nice guy also.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>
