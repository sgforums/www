            <div class='col-md body'>Hehe.. I think I still playing FM2004 sia.. Anyway players so many but most important tactics le.. How ah? Why my defence leak so many goals.. I probably got the best defenders in the game (yr2013 already so new age defenders hehe). But most of the opponent goals cross then, got unmarked players in the box. Like my defenders all don't know how to defend liao but their marking tackling heading all 17 -20. Any idea on the team tactics and individual instructions?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

If you fail to do so, The chairman will personally sign the players<br>-- Advanced AI, have a crazy tactics that scores 5 goals every match? AI now adapt and steal your tactics<br>-- Players not listed for loan, Can be loaned if the club allows<br>-- Players now can be exchange in a player for player deal<br>-- Business minded chairman will sack you without reason if you sign crap players<br><br>Tell me CM, Has those..

            <div class='col-md body'>I've tried the previous version of FM and so far, things jus get better n better.<br><br>The very first FM i own is the 2001/2002 version. There're lots of flaws on this version. For example, if u wan to train ur players, u simply click the "boost" button n pray hard that ur player wun get injured. Very unrealistic and the value of ur player will soar if u successfully "boost" the player's stats.<br><br>The next version is slighly better. With clearer and sharper match graphics and the training function changes. Managers can simply set watever attribute they wan their player to work on and FM will automatically increase or decrease the player's stats.<br><br>This latest version is really the best of the lots. Although it seems too unrealistic for players to move that slow on the match. I think they shud remove the function whereby manager is not allow to buy players from their fiercest rivals. Chelsea do try n sign Gerrard haven they?<br><br>FM wins CM hands down. CM is really too simple to be costly. CM's graphics are really child's play and only FM has the function for manager to view the match and make substitutionas if it was real life.<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>

It depends. This version of FM, the AI is much smarter. Unless the player plays regularly or is young n impressive, otherwise, the unwanted player will leave ur club for free when his contract is up.<br><br>Well, of cos u can kapo players!<br><br>There're 3 ways actually.<br>1. If the player is already available on a free transfer(Bosman ruling)<br>2. Clause in contract. If the player is good enough n has a release clause dat allows him to leave for a club that is of higher division for free.<br>3. When the player's contract is almost up, u can directly talk to the player n ask them to join u for free. I missed out on Fernando Torres. He left Atletico Madrid for Real Betis for free. =(<br><br>If ther're any questions regarding FM 2006, feel free to ask me.
