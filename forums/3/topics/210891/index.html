            <div class='col-md body'>tribalfooball not creditable, better to read espn, sky sports, the sun sport or other English base news. But Fergie did said part of those, it was reported some time back already, just after the WC. He did said Both Rio and Owen Hargreaves were England's best players at the WC" which was true of course. And he also did rates Rio Ferdinand ahead of Chelsea captain John Terry. Chelsea's good defence last year was alot due to Gallas, and at England level, he had Rio to cover for him.<br><br>If anyone who is unbiased had watch the WC will know the mistakes Terry made. Anyway, the season is long and now without Gallas, we shall see. We have already seen a lot of holes in the chelsea defence compare to last year. Liverpool had a lot of good chances last night... If not for Peter cech, chelsea may not have won or could have even lost. Peter Cech is a good keeper.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do you know that in 2004, Chelsea tried to tap-up Rio Ferdinand the same way they used with A cole.<br><br>In an extract from his explosive new book RIO MY STORY, Ferdinand reveals that he feared his United career was over after being pictured leaving a London bar with his agent Pini Zahavi with Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon in the background.<br><br>I FEARED the worst when the picture was in the papers and decided that I would go and see the manager when I arrived for training and explain.<br><br>I couldnÂ’t say a lot because I was in the wrong. I just said again, Â“Boss, I donÂ’t want to sign for nobody. I want to sign for Man United. I told you at the beginning I want to sign for United.Â”<br><br>The meeting went on for 15 minutes and he was going: Â“You know how people will interpret it. It doesnÂ’t matter what you said.<br><br>Â“It doesnÂ’t matter if you were talking about the price of milk, the time of day or the colour of the table you were sitting at. ItÂ’s just so stupid of you to go there and meet Kenyon.<br><br>Â“Once you walked into the restaurant and saw him there, you donÂ’t sit down, you go straight back out again.Â”<br><br>I can see itÂ’s hard to believe, without me explaining it, but itÂ’s the truth. I didnÂ’t want to sign for anyone other than United.<br><br>What made it worse was that it was not long after the news about Chelsea supposedly having a meeting with Ashley Cole. Not only were the papers saying that I wanted to go to Chelsea, which was rubbish.<br><br>I was naive. I couldnÂ’t believe anyone would think I would be organising a move to Chelsea over dinner and drinks in a packed restaurant and bar.<br><br>Sometimes you allow yourself to trust in the system and hope that people wonÂ’t interpret incidents in a certain way. But often they do.<br><br>I understand why the public thought there might have been something in it and it was definitely a mistake on my part. I should have left when I saw Kenyon there.<br></div>
