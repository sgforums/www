              It was surprising to see that there was no sports forum, so I'm posting this amusing article from Australia and the swim suits Olympians are wearing now.
              
              (As an aside- i find it incredible that a forum on buses is second  in popularity in SGForums. I cant think of a single first world country that would have buses in the top 5, but no sports)

              "Budgies: an endangered species
              
              Marissa Calligeros | August 8, 2008 - 2:28PM
              
              A bunch of Brisbane blokes have braved the winter chill in a push for the return of the humble 'budgie smugglers' in Beijing.
              
              The group paraded through the CBD in traditional swimming briefs in a mock protest against Olympic swimmers donning controversial LZR Racer bodysuits as part of a radio stunt led by Triple M's breakfast team.
              
              "Bring back the budgies! Bring back the budgies for Beijing!" the chorus of barely clad men, including host Greg "Marto" Martin, chanted to an amused crowd of shoppers and city office workers.
              
              "It's time for today's 'soft' swimmers to harden up and stand proudly on the blocks.
              
              "If they are good enough for Warwick Capper they are good enough for our Olympians.
              
              "What was it that led Warwick Capper to become the leading goal scorer of the late 80s?
              
              "Did Kieran Perkins need to hide his nipples in (1996) when he stopped the nation for gold? When Duncan Armstrong and John Sieben went for gold in (1984) and (1988) all they had was Laurie Lawrence with a rolled up newspaper and a pair of smugglers."
              
              The group, which included breakfast cohorts Sami Lukis and Ian Skippen, claimed full body swimsuits were an "assault against good sportsmanship" and "completely unAustralian."
              
              Onlookers Erica Armagnacq and Kathy Ellison said they had no reservations about seeing our primed swimmers sport a pair of lycra nickers.
              
              But as for Aussie blokes on the beach...
              
              "It depends on their physique," Mrs Armagnacq said.
              
              "But my partner certainly won't be allowed to step out in a pair."

              wow, it must have been very far down the list.
              
              Fireice- i saw you locked a topic by another forumer who had a thread about the % of children who have non Singaporean male and female parents. You said they must do a search and if they duplicate a thread 3 times, they are banned.
              
              I note there is another topic on women serving NS which already has hundreds of posts- but this topic has been duplicated many times in the past, including by myself.
              
              Any reason that topic is not locked?
