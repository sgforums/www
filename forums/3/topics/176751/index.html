That is the level of football I want to play again."<br><br>Murphy was on the sidelines at Charlton which fuelled talk of a rift with boss Alan Curbishley.<br><br>And Murphy admitted: "Charlton obviously let the move happen so you can read into it what you want.<br><br>"If anything, they have given me the chance to better myself which I suppose, in a way, is good of them, because they did not have to do that."<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><br>I think he too ambitious</span><br><br></div>

My players, my young players, are not used to that, which is why at times they sat back in the second half.<br><br>"We need to learn that we can win at big clubs now so perhaps next time we won't do that.<br><br>"I told them at half-time we needed a third goal."<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Winning Arsenal @ highbury is indeed some acheievement as the only team that did it this season other than west ham was Chelsea Not Even Man Utd Win @ Highbury</span></div>

I don't think Sol has a problem with his physical fitness but he is not well.<br><br>At half-time I had other worries. You want your players to stay, but there are exceptional circumstances when you can understand what he did tonight.<br><br>"He was not being disrespectful to the club or the team but he was just very, very down. It isn't working for him at the moment.<br><br>"That was the only issue he had tonight, his confidence is not at the highest at the moment.<br><br>"Taking him off was a gamble because I had no other defenders on the bench."<br><br>To add to Campbell's anguish, England boss Sven Goran Eriksson was watching at Highbury.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">This is a unprofessional behaviour !</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal boss Wenger ready to play Walcott<br>tribalfootball.com - February 4, 2006<br><br>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has hinted he'll give Theo Walcott a debut today against Birmingham City.<br><br>Wenger said: "Walcott has been lively, alert and is playing with belief. He deserves to be involved through his performance rather than the amount of his transfer fee.<br><br>"He has a lot of good ingredients in there with his movement and his timing of runs. And he knows how to use his pace. That is the first intelligence - how to use your qualities.<br><br>"I can't believe he has been playing only since he was 10. You would think a guy who started that late would have a problem with his touch but not at all.<br><br>"It's too early to say what impact he can make. He has been with us only two weeks.<br><br>"But he's capable of coming on, scoring and making a difference. He has scored in training but it's difficult as you never get the intensity of games and the harshness of the competitive nature of the Premiership.<br><br>"The good thing is we are going through a difficult patch and one of the positives is the youngsters come into the team when it's not a Rolls-Royce.<br><br>"It's chaotic. That toughens them up. It's not too bad for the youngsters not to start on the red carpet."<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Walcott might save Arsenal Season....</span></div>
