              <p>Actually they have been pushingÂ to introduce MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) into the Olympics... for those who don't know, it's a fighting sport in which there are as little rules as possible and you can do almost anything you want from striking to grappling to submissions.</p>
              <p>Which is actually pretty much like an original sport in the ancient Greek Olympics called Pankration.</p>
              <p>It is probably safer then boxing though, given instead of the goal being to punch your opponent in the head until he's knocked out, you can end the fight using a lot of other methods like submissions or chokes which are far less damaging, and more realistic too.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>In the modern times Pankration could still be seen in cities like Smyrna and Constantinople even in the beginning of the 20th century. It was after the burning of the city of Smyrna by the Turks that caused many of the Athletic associations including those who practiced and taught Pankration, to scatter to mainland Greece and other parts of the world and try to rebuild their lives. Of those Pankratiasts that went to Greece, life was unmerciful given Greece's poor economic and political stability and providing for their families was the foremost priority. It was then where Pankration took a back seat to the reality of survival for those old Pankratiasts.</p>
              <p>The revival of pankration was essentially the innovative effort of Kerios Grandmaster Jim Arvanitis, world recognized today as the "father of modern pankration." A visionary considered far ahead of his time, Jim cross-trained in a number of martial arts and combat sports before it was common to do so. This included Western boxing and wrestling, combat judo, and muay thai. He extracted the best techniques from each and, using his research of what remained of the legacy of his ancestors, reconstructed ancient pankration into a modernized form. It was Arvanitis who reintroduced the combat sport at a time when such practices were criticized in favor of the more traditional Asian styles such as karate and kung-fu. MMA and even pankration in Greece would not surface until more than 20 years after Arvanitis appeared on the cover of <em>Black Belt</em> magazine. It was through this ground-breaking article that he and writer Massad Ayoob first exposed pankration to mainstream martial arts.</p>
              <p>Pankration has also periodically been reintroduced in the modern Olympic Games, but not with much success due to scarce participation. Given the rise in popularity of <a class="mw-redirect" title="Mixed Martial Arts" href="/wiki/Mixed_Martial_Arts"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Mixed Martial Arts</span></span></a> around the world in recent years, interest in the sport has been renewed and even talks about entering MMA in the Olympics under the banner of pankration.</p>
              <p>In the lead-up to the 2004 <a title="2004 Summer Olympics" href="/wiki/2004_Summer_Olympics"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Athens Olympic Games</span></span></a>, a modern non-nude version of pankration was tipped as being a new sport in the Olympiad, especially due to its being an event in the ancient games. However, its application was not approved. The International Olympic Committee was unconvinced that Greece could handle the total number of sports proposed. To placate the IOC, the organizers removed all new medal sports and pankration missed out.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Erm I don't think it's wushu but something more specific. Wushu is a catch all term for chinese martial arts of which there are literally so many styles it's impossible to name them all.</p>
              <p>But yes it's possible to use "dim mak" death touch like moves but the problem is that you cannot rely only on them because they are not entirely reliable. Some people can do down very fast from a single hit of this type while others are not affected at all. And of course some of it is simply total BS being taught by shady sifus and mac dojos.</p>
              <p>There is this famous clip of this sifu who claimed to be able to use his chi abilities to knock out or stun opponents from a single touch or even from a distance, and even had a showreel of him talking down many people (his students)Â using this style, he also claimed a 200-0 win/loss record and put out a $5000 challange to any MMA fighter to spar with him in a competition.</p>
              <p>As it turned out, one dude picked up the offer and pwned him within one minute. And the thing is from the look of the sifu and his students who were there to support him, they were totally shocked and at a total loss of words. Apparently whatever they trained in could affect each other but had no effect on an ordinary person who didn't follow their style. You can see the clip here:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEDaCIDvj6I">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEDaCIDvj6I</a></p>
              <p>So there you go, death touch and nerve pinches aside, you still need to know your basics and can't leave them out.</p>
              <p>There a is modern, full contact chinese kung fu sport and it's called Sanda, and for all purposes it's practially like MMA (but then again MMA is another general term) and Chinese fighters usually go up with sanda kung fuÂ against Thai muay thai fighters full contact.</p>
