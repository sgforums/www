            <div class='col-md body'>You are a narrow-minded, judgemental little racist piss brain without half a mind to think for yourself (that goes for everyone who wants to tell the Koreans to stop eating dogs).<br><br>How is eating dog any worse than eating chicken, fish, shark, pig, sheep, or any other animal for that matter???<br><br>Leave the Koreans alone. I'm sure if some ang moh from overseas told you you can't eat your favourite dish anymore because they think you are very cruel, you'd be pissed too. I think that as long as they are not eating -your- dog, or other human beings, whatever they eat isn't any of your fcking business.<br><br>So quit being a closeminded dimwit and wake up your bloody idea.<br><br>HAIYAR.</div>
