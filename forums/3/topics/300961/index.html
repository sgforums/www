'It was like a funeral it was so quiet.<br><br>'You need the crowd to create a good atmosphere. It is all right saying the players can make the crowd respond but in some situations, like this one, the crowd have to get behind the players.<br><br>'I think there have been days like this in the past. It happened some years ago, when we were dominant. The crowd have come to be entertained. It doesn't help us.' </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Sir Alex upsets Manchester United fans<br><br>Old Trafford is like a 'police state' which leaves supporters paralysed by fear, a spokesman from the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association claimed on Wednesday.<br><br>United boss Sir Alex Ferguson compared the atmosphere at Tuesday's Premier League win over Birmingham to a funeral, urging fans to back the team more vocally.<br><br>Those comments have upset the IMUSA's Colin Hendrie, who accused Ferguson of 'a lack of understanding' of the plight supporters face.<br><br>'I think he could benefit from sitting in the ground,' said Hendrie, who believes Old Trafford stewards come down too hard on fans who stand at moments of excitement.<br><br>'You can't stand up to make a noise. If you try to stand up, you've got stewards who are ejecting you, they're taking your season ticket away from you.<br><br>'It's almost like a police state in a football ground now and if you do stand up, people will take your arm, put it behind the back of your neck and throw you out of the ground.<br><br>'Under those circumstances, what atmosphere does he (Ferguson) want?<br><br>'The only atmosphere we've got is one where we're a little bit frightened of losing Â£1,000 for the season ticket we've paid for.'<br><br>The noise level in the stadium as United laboured to a 1-0 win over Alex McLeish's strugglers yesterday was non-existent at times, a fact gleefully pointed out by the visiting fans.<br><br>Sitting in the directors' box as he completed a two-match touchline ban, the lack of atmosphere was even more noticeable to Ferguson.<br><br>So, just over seven years after former captain Roy Keane laid into United's 'prawn sandwich brigade', Ferguson had his say.<br><br>'The crowd were dead,' complained the Scot. 'It was like a funeral it was so quiet.'<br><br>Hendrie revealed Ferguson's comments had not gone down well with his fellow fans.<br><br>'A lot of people are pretty upset, because it shows a lack of understanding about what it's like to be a football fan in 2008,' he said on Sky Sports News.<br><br>'Fergie's going back to the days 10 years ago where it was absolutely fantastic, you could stand.<br><br>'But you can't do that now and the football authorities need to make up their minds whether they want to have fans sitting neatly in a row not being able to do anything or if they want an atmosphere in the football grounds again.'<br><br>Hendrie pointed to the example of United's neighbours Manchester City, where he claims stewards are far more tolerant.<br><br>'It's actually not against the law to stand up. It's to do with the terms and conditions on the ticket,' he explained.<br><br>'The interpretation of that rule is different at different grounds.<br><br>'For example, at City, they've actually got a singing area.<br><br>'Because you're allowed to stand in moments of excitement, what they say at City is, 'If you're standing up singing, you're obviously excited, so carry on singing'.<br><br>'That doesn't happen at Old Trafford.'<br><br>The club have, however, rejected any notion that stewards have been asked to adopt a heavy-handed approach.<br><br>In the four games prior to Christmas - against Everton, Derby, Fulham and Sporting Lisbon - it is claimed that just three fans were ejected from Old Trafford in total.<br><br>A United spokesman said: 'Any suggestion of an ejection policy for persistent standing is simply not borne out by the facts.'<br><br>The club have also denied that the atmosphere at the 'Theatre of Dreams' is being muted by a high proportion of corporate fans - the assumed target of Keane's prawn sandwich jibe.<br><br>Of the 76,000 fans who can pack into the stadium, 86%, United claim, are fans paying the normal ticket price.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Glazer treatment has been unfair - Fergie<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson has branded criticism of the Glazer family by Manchester United supporters as 'unfair'.<br><br>The Glazers' Â£790million takeover was greeted with outright hostility by some sections of United's massive fanbase.<br><br>Brothers Joel, Avram and Bryan needed to be smuggled out of Old Trafford under police supervision when they completed their buyout in 2005.<br><br>Although the viciousness of the opposition to their involvement has reduced, family members can still be the subject of isolated attacks on their visits to Manchester and rebel club FC United, set up as a direct result of the Glazer takeover, continues to attract huge numbers for their position in the English football pyramid.<br><br>Chief among the current complaints are rising ticket prices, a refusal to speak to the media on any meaningful basis since Joel Glazer conducted an interview with in-house station MUTV in the aftermath of the takeover and a failure to outline the true scale of the repayments on the mammoth debt that has been lodged against the Old Trafford club.<br><br>The latter concern may be addressed later this month, when United are expected to smash the world record profit figure for a football club, which the Glazer family will no doubt use to back up their belief the Red Devils legacy is in safe hands.<br><br>And Ferguson would not disagree, claiming the family have always been firmly supportive and pointing out the stability at United compared to the problems which have existed at other clubs recently, notably Liverpool.<br><br>'At a number of clubs there have been problems with friction between managers and owners but you can see how smoothly the United ship is running as far as that is concerned, despite early hostility over the Glazer family's ownership,' he said.<br><br>'Those protests were unfair because they weren't given a chance but the Glazers kept their cool and our owners have been nothing but supportive.<br><br>'Good teamwork starts at the top and I am happy to say, that is what we have at Old Trafford.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fergie And The Fans: He Can't Have It Both Ways<br>Sir Alex Ferguson should think about what he really wants before lashing out at Manchester United supporters<br><br>Many of Wednesday morningÂ’s newspapers featured back-page splashes of Sir Alex FergusonÂ’s attack on Manchester United fans.<br><br>Speaking after his sideÂ’s 1-0 win over Birmingham City, Fergie likened the atmosphere at Old Trafford to a Â“funeral.Â”<br><br>The Scot wasnÂ’t the first to criticise home supporters either, after Roy KeaneÂ’s much-publicised assault on the prawn sandwich brigade eight years ago.<br><br>Both Ferguson and Keane are right: the atmosphere is not what it once was. This isnÂ’t to say that crowds cannot lift themselves anymore for crunch big four clashes or those all-important Champions League semi-final nights, and many clubsÂ’ (including UnitedÂ’s) away supporters remain superb.<br><br>But week-to-week the atmosphere at many Premiership grounds is far from spectacular. Some clubs are better than others, and given the vast number of fans in attendance you could argue that Old Trafford is the worst of the lot.<br><br>But what does Fergie expect? Whatever your take on the money-making machine that is todayÂ’s Premier League, it is indisputable that English football is more popular now, to a global audience, than it ever has been. Few teams have embraced the revolution more than Manchester United.<br><br>In days past the noise at Old Trafford (or any ground) emanated from the large swathes of ordinary, working class folk, fans who paid just a couple of pounds to stand on decrepit terraces and scream their lungs out. The passionate, long-standing, regular supporters have slowly but surely been eliminated from Premier League grounds.<br><br>All seater stadiums have gone some way to killing the atmosphere at many grounds Â– itÂ’s harder to be so loud when youÂ’re hunched over in your seat than when youÂ’re jumping around on a terrace Â– but it is ticket prices that have really crippled the traditional supporter.<br><br><span style="color: green;">The father of a friend of mine was an Old Trafford season ticket holder ever since the club introduced the concept. Increasingly frustrated by the rapid rise in annual prices, UnitedÂ’s latest policy of forcing fans to buy additional tickets to all cup games Â– regardless of whether or not the matches actually take place Â– proved the final straw. He handed in his ticket.<br><br>The club donÂ’t care, and why should they? Football has become a money game. If he wonÂ’t pay the outlandish sums demanded then someone else will. Over 75,000 pack into Old Trafford every week and itÂ’s rare to see a seat empty. United have alienated the true core of their support to bring in money from richer, albeit less committed supporters. ThatÂ’s their choice; Ronaldo wonÂ’t play for free, after all.<br><br>But United cannot have it both ways. Keane was rumoured to be earning Â£55,000 a week at the time of his attack on the Old Trafford crowd. That money has to come from somewhere. Fans in modern football have been accused of sitting still and waiting to be entertained, but is that not their right when theyÂ’ve forked out Â£33 for a cold plastic seat for a game against Birmingham?<br><br>Before criticising the fans, Ferguson needs to consider what it is he would prefer: a positively swaying Old Trafford crammed with vocal supporters who are United born-and-bred or a world-class football team featuring talents like Rio Ferdinand and Wayne Rooney, who incidentally each cost the club in the region of Â£30m.<br><br>Clubs in Germany regularly subsidise ticket prices so that for Â€7 or Â€8 (yep, about Â£5) noisy but less affluent fans can watch top-flight games in designated (standing) areas behind the goal. Sure, there are no mega-money signings, but it does improve the atmosphere Â– IÂ’ve watched many games in both countries and can attest. ItÂ’s also a tremendous way of introducing young fans, who are any clubÂ’s future, to the match-going experience.<br><br>If any club has the ability to afford ticket price subsidies for poorer fans, it is Manchester United. But the club has chosen not to, so Fergie should sit in his Old Trafford dugout, watch his superstar team and enjoy the funeral-like silence.</span><br>Chris Williams</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fans fill Old Trafford for every match, the team is consistently successful and yet the atmosphere is more akin to a library, says Colin Shindler<br>The Guardian<br>January 3, 2008 12:18 AM</strong><br><br>Oh no, Fergie's upset again! Weirdly, this time it is not the fault of the referee or the Football Association or an Arsenal player throwing a cheese and tomato pizza at him. The culprit appears to be those terrible people, the Manchester United supporters - not the good citizens of Kuala Lumpur but the very ones who go to Old Trafford.<br><br>It cannot be much fun being a United supporter. The poor dears are heartily despised by the rest of the football world, commercially exploited by the most rapacious of all clubs, famously abused by their former captain and now roundly condemned by the manager.<br><br>I would be tempted to dismiss Sir Alex Ferguson's description of the Old Trafford atmosphere as "like a funeral" by easy reference to the majority of the crowd being tired, having travelled for 24 hours from their homes to get to Manchester, were it not that other grounds are experiencing this phenomenon with increasing frequency.<br><br>It is in the interest of the media to tell us that we are watching football in the best stadiums in the world, that the Premier League has the best players and that we should regard it as a privilege to fork out up to Â£50 to watch. It is not difficult to "enhance" the crowd effect on the soundtrack or to cut a highlights package that emphasises the end-to-end excitement of the football so beloved of marketing men. Mix that with the hysteria of the commentators and it is hard to escape the conclusion we live in the best of all possible football worlds.<br><br>In the days when the only football on television was to be seen on Match of the Day or The Big Match we watched our teams in rotting steel hulks but we packed together in cosy familiarity and relative discomfort. We did not yearn for more boxes or better toilet facilities. We just wanted to beat United.<br><br>Besides, who needed toilets when at the back of the Kippax Stand at Maine Road there was a large brick wall on which was painted in large white letters the warning "COMMIT NO NUISANCE". What better exhortation could there be to men and boys who had been trapped on the terraces with full bladders and no sense of public shame? "You wouldn't do that at home would you, son?" inquired the policeman foolishly. "Course not," came the scornful reply of the urinating child. "What d'you think the grid outside our 'ouse is for?"<br><br>And that is the point really. Maine Road was like "our 'ouse" to all us City fans. As was Burnden Park and the Baseball Ground and Highbury and The Dell to others less fortunate who had not witnessed Bert Trautmann in his pomp. We had been going there all our lives and its history was our history. "Can I mind yer car, mister?" was a familiar extortion racket perpetrated by tiny mafiosi - a tradition as comforting as meatless steak-and-kidney pies and "Sack the Board" demonstrations.<br><br>Eastlands is a beautifully designed stadium but you cannot design a soul. Maine Road had few toilets but a wonderful soul. On big nights as you hurried along the streets of Moss Side the noise would suck you into its embrace and surrendering to it was like wrapping yourself up in an enormous aural duvet. The Emirates and the Reebok and the rest are all so beautifully designed but it will be decades before they are "home".<br><br>It is not impossible to fill Eastlands with noise. United have lost there three times in the five matches they have played and each time the City of Manchester Stadium has rocked with the pleasure. However, on a regular basis, whatever the size of the crowds, the new stadiums seem incapable of sustaining that desirable wall of noise. They prize health and safety above all else and, after Hillsborough and Valley Parade and Heisel, who could argue?<br><br>But Old Trafford is not a new stadium. It has been greatly remodelled but it still stands a hundred yards from Lou Macari's Fish &amp; Chip Shop. The supporters fill the ground for every match, the team is consistently successful and yet the atmosphere is more akin to a library.<br><br>So does Manchester United's OAP manager need a hearing aid to go with his pacemaker? Are the crowd anxiously scanning departure times for Kuala Lumpur? Or could it be that the fault, dear Fergie, lies not in the crowd but in the team? Mancunians have always paid their money and said: "Right, entertain me then."<br><br>So I applaud all you Reds. You have paid your money and have a perfect right to sit on your hands. Next time you go to Old Trafford, lads, keep your traps shut. There is a funeral going on there.<br><br>Â· Colin Shindler is the author of 'Manchester United Ruined My Life'</div>
