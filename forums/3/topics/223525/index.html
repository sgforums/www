I cannot see it was a penalty for love nor money.<br>"He did it again afterwards with a free-kick against George Boateng."<br>Ronaldo should have been yellow carded on both occasions<br><br>After watching television replays, Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson said the penalty was justified.<br><br>"Schwarzer is trying to avoid it, but would Ronaldo have scored? I think he would, but anyway it was a penalty kick."<br><br>It is not the first time Ronaldo's sportmanship has been questioned.<br><br>Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard labelled the winger "a disgrace" for his part in Wayne Rooney's sending-off at the World Cup.<br><br>Gerrard was furious when Ronaldo got involved after Rooney appeared to stamp on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho.<br><br>"Sadly a dark side stains Cristiano Ronaldo's game," wrote Gerrard in his autobiography. </span></div>

But it seems to be a handful of players at the centre of it.<br><br>"It makes referees' jobs so difficult. I can't comment on the referee's decision because I don't know what his view of it was.<br><br>"He felt from the view he had there was contact. But it is clear for everyone to see there wasn't.<br><br>"I guess that is the first time I have been really angry as a manager. When there has been an injustice it makes you feel that way.<br><br>"I am in the fortunate position where he isn't one of my players. It is not for me to comment."<br><br>United boss Alex Ferguson stuck by his initial view that ref Chris Foy was correct to award the spot-kick.<br><br>He said: "I've just seen it and it looks as though the goalkeeper didn't touch him.<br><br>"But it's the intent - what could he do? He's going to be carted anyway. I think it's a penalty."<br><br>Southgate (right) reckons the decision was a crucial moment - even though James Morrison cancelled out Louis Saha's spot-kick only for United's Darren Fletcher to head the winner.<br><br>The Boro boss added: "I've probably said as much as I should have about someone else's player but I do feel aggrieved it gave us a mountain to climb in the game.<br><br>"My players have given everything and you never know how a game is going to pan out.<br><br>"But the first goal in any game in this division is crucial and we were playing well until that point. It knocked the stuffing out of us." </span></div>
