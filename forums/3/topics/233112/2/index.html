            <div class='col-md body'>Didnt know anything about Singapore soccer throughout the 90s and only started watching again when they played Japan at Jalan besar where we were all glued to our TVs expecting Japan to hantam Singapore at least 5 goals.That night my friends and I were at a soccer pub in Tokyo when suddenly Singapore scored though Indra Shahdan.I intinctively shouted GOAL!!! and then my friends asked me if I was ok with the drinks....because 10 years ago I became a Japanese Citizen.I tell you it was really funny to be shouting goals when the two teams were scoring but in the end Singapore lost 2-1.Fandi Ahmad could have been the best but he didnt go all the way because he was too attached to the local kampung footbal scene.....so up till now nobody in Singpore can claim the title of Soccer King.Intimi Dickson has got good potentials...I dont know I saw an African player running around the Japanese Defence  in that game maybe it was him.And that was the first time I realise that the Singapore team really need more foreign talents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow the name Wong Kok Choy suddenly brought me back to nostalgia and then I started recalling names like V.Kanesan or something like that Malek Awab,T pathmanathan,K Kannan and how David Lee let in the first goal in Kallang stadium when Singapore played Kedah before that the Lions were never beaten before........at Kallang the thundering noise created by 60,000 fans was enough to shrink any rival goalkeeper balls to the size of dried raisins and that was how Kallang Roar got its name.</div>
