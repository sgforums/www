            <div class='col-md body'>tribalfootball.com - February 27, 2006<br><br>Chelsea captain John Terry insists the Premiership - and not the Champions League - is his top priority this season.<br><br>He said: "We did a double last season - the Premiership and the Carling Cup - but if you were strong enough to back me up against a brick wall I'd have to admit there is only one top domestic double and that's the Premiership and the FA Cup.<br><br>"Manchester United and Arsenal have achieved that. It's a target for us."<br><br>And Terry had not given up victory in the Nou Camp either, where Chelsea must overturn a 2-1 first-leg deficit to remain in the Champions League.<br><br>He said: "We won at Old Trafford twice last season, we've won at Highbury this season and we've won at Anfield. Now we will just have to go and win at the Nou Camp."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea's Robben furious with refs<br>tribalfootball.com - February 27, 2006<br><br>Chelsea winger Arjen Robben fears his reputation is preceding him after being denied a penalty in Saturday's 2-0 win against Portsmouth.<br><br>"I was quite furious not to get a penalty, everybody could see it was a penalty," he said. "I just wanted to put it in but got a push, went to the ground and thought it was a clear penalty. I hope everybody gets treated the same, but I know that it doesn't always happen in football.<br><br>"Some referees have to think about treating every player the same, even if it's Ronaldinho or another player from a Premier League club. Every player is the same, it doesn't matter how good you are. You have to be treated the same and that doesn't happen every time. I've doubted some decisions that have gone against me but it's not just me, it's all of the players."<br><br>The Dutch winger added: "I don't want to speak about diving a lot.<br><br>"I don't read or hear everything but people can think what they want to think. I let them think what they want. I know how it is, I just play football, play my game and if some people want to say some stupid things they can.<br><br>"Criticism is normal because I play for a big club like Chelsea. Everyone wants us to lose and sometimes people are not fair in the way they look at Chelsea compared to the way they look at other clubs. But I like it as well because it means we're going very well and I'm happy about that."<br><br></div>
