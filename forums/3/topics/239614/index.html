            <div class='col-md body'>It'd be hard to pick one over the other, but personally, I'd prefer Mourinho over Wenger simply on the basis of the human qualities he exhibits.<br><br>Like him or not(and I'm a Man Utd fan), there's something special about Mourinho IMO. His charisma, charm, an uncanny ability to infuse confidence and trust in his players wherever he goes says a lot about the man himself - for me, he's a cross-breed between Ferguson(for his man-management) and Wenger(for his tactical nuances) and he stands out in his own right...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Like Diamonds, they themselves are diamond, but without expert care, they can end up either on a lady's fingers or as a cutting tool.<br><br>Now you want to micro and say the last few years.<br>Rem, soccer is a very real game. You can be a legend but if you can't work with the management out you go. It is the same everywhere.<br>Look at Vieira or Pires or even Duff.<br><br>Please don't be so one-sided lah.</div>

No one is suggesting that Mourinho is anything other than a brilliant manager and winning the Champions League with Porto proves that.<br><br>It is not Mourinho's fault either that Chelsea's owner Roman Abramovich is willing to throw millions at being successful.<br><br>If Abramovich loses interest then Chelsea are in trouble, but Mourinho is making hay while the sun shines. But it still takes skill to build winning teams and Mourinho has done that at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Wenger, meanwhile, is different. He has had to balance the books while working on a limited budget. That is what sets Wenger apart. He has taken control of the club on all levels and that is why if you gave every manager the same resources then Wenger would come out on top.<br><br>He has built and rebuilt several teams at Arsenal, bringing in Nicolas Anelka, Emmanuel Petit, Marc Overmars and Patrick Vieira and selling them for a huge profit.<br><br>That is great management and Wenger also creates teams who are a joy to watch and play with great style.<br><br>No one can underestimate the job he has done at Arsenal, turning them from "boring, boring Arsenal" into the Premiership's great entertainers. He has transformed the whole style and image of the club.<br><br>Now you look at the latest crop of kids who will play in the cup final and the one thing that stands out is their technique. That is also a tremendous tribute to Wenger's methods as a coach.<br><br>Look at two players as an example. Emmanuel Adebayor (below) arrived at Arsenal and gained a reputation as a rather ungainly and wasteful striker.<br><br>He has grown, matured and improved into a top striker.<br><br>Then there is Denilson. Sir Trevor Brooking has been banging on about technique and a simple comparison between Denilson and, say, Theo Walcott, says all you need to know about the difference between English kids and Brazilians, Italians and Spanish.<br><br>Bang a ball really hard into Denilson's feet and he kills it stone dead and can knock it straight on. It might take a second touch for Walcott.<br><br>That is not belittling Walcott or his ability and there is no doubt that he is at the right club to improve. But Arsenal have bought potential rather than the finished article.<br><br>But if you look at what Wenger did for Thierry Henry who has developed into the best striker in the world it once again tells you much about the manager's abilities.<br><br>This game, though, will come down to what happens in midfield and Chelsea's mix of experience, power and strength against Arsenal's youth, technique and skill.<br><br>I believe it will be a draw after extra-time and then it will be penalties. A fascinating contest, a clash of cultures and showdown between two great managers.</div>
