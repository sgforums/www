            <div class='col-md body'>Between the two? Tough choice.. Mourinho got something but then again I can't really say much. With Porto he did wonders.. winning trophies.. but the team footballing style didn't impress me much. Don't talk about Chelsea. I feel that Chelsea is a team that was assembled with money so really can't say much about the manager but then again Mourinho did what Ranieri couldn't do. But Wenger impresses me more. As a Man U fan, a rival manager in the EPL whom I would be a afraid of is Wenger. There is probably a reason why his name, Arsene and Arsenal sounds pretty similar haha.. He is what Arsenal is. Flowing, technical, flair football. Anelka was super deadly when he was with Arsenal. Fits in the system perfectly until he got greedy and wanted more. Bergkamp is a genius. And now, Henry who is like super god like! The future looks really bright for Persie, Fabregas and Walcott. Not only Wenger has an eye for these gems, he polished them so brightly and he created a footballing system that brings out the best in these gems. If one person whom I would really love to take over Ferguson would be Wenger but of course that would be impossible.. Henry is officially my idol...</div>

And look where he brought them to in Europe before he joined Chelsea. Porto was nothing in Europe before Jose. It seems that a lot of people forgot that he brough them to Euro success before he joined the billionaire team. To me, that's already proof that he is a good manager.<br><br>If u want to talk about great managers, look no further than Bill Shankley, Sir Alex Feguson etc even though i am no Man U fan.<br><br>Wenger has a good eye for young players, but I seriously think that his tactics is questionable. A good attacking side is nice to see for the football fan, but what's the point of playing attacking football if u can't win trophies? Barcelona is the only good attacking team in recent years that prove that u can win trophies and play attractive football at the same team. True, Arsene's team has gone 1 season unbeaten before, and he has won FA Cups and league titles for his team before, but in Europe, he still lacks behind SAF, Jose Mourinho and even Rafa Benitez.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ARISE THE LOT OF YOU, AND WELL DESERVED<br>Oliver Holt 07/03/2007<br><br>I HAVE never agreed with the honours system. Too often, it rewards the rich, the privileged, the useful, the backside-kissers, the friends and acolytes of politicians, the craven, the vainglorious, the insane and celebrities who use their charity work to make even more money for themselves.<br><br>This government, sadly, has made the system worse. Not just because of the whiff of venality that has accompanied the Cash for Honours scandal but also because of its eagerness to shower various OBEs, CBEs, MBEs and knighthoods on sportsmen and women in an attempt to use them as vehicles for vote-winning.<br><br>When Ellen MacArthur was nearing the end of her last round-the-world race, for instance, it was revealed she was to be made a Dame before she'd even set foot on dry land.<br><br>But I have also seen the happiness and the pride that an honour can bring, particularly to so-called ordinary people from whom the oxygen of recognition is often withheld.<br><br>Earlier this year, I saw the anticipation of the father of Richard Hudson, a record-breaking swimmer who happens to have Down's Syndrome, when he was planning his son's trip to Buckingham Palace to collect his gong.<br><br>That's partly why I hope the 25,000 people who have signed a petition pushing for a posthumous knighthood for Bob Paisley get their wish.<br><br>They, and the MPs who are supporting them, are right when they say that Paisley was the greatest manager English football has ever had.<br><br>They are also right to point out the iniquity of the fact that while Sir Alex Ferguson was recognised for winning one European Cup for Manchester United, Paisley won three for Liverpool and was ignored.<br><br>While they're at it, I hope they start agitating for a posthumous knighthood for Bobby Moore, too. And George Best. And Brian Clough. And Jock Stein. And Bill Shankly. And Bill Nicholson.<br><br>Many were the great football men who were never considered for honours in the time before politicians realised that paying lip-service to the game was worth a couple of decimal points in opinion poll ratings.<br><br>And if we can right some of the wrongs of the past and give men like Paisley, Clough and Moore their due, so much the better.<br><br>Some might say such widespread retroactivism would make a mockery of the system. The answer to that is the system is a mockery of everything it should be already.<br><br>So I hope the campaign succeeds and that we bestow belated honours on Paisley and the rest of those who were unjustly overlooked in the past.<br><br>But even more than giving honours to the deserving dead, I hope we learn from the mistakes of the past and give them to the deserving living.<br><br>Why, for instance, has Jimmy Greaves, one of England's greatest ever goalscorers and a member of the 1966 World Cup winning squad, never received an honour?<br><br>Why did this government consider it right to give an MBE to a spin doctor who helped win London the 2012 Olympics by forgetting to mention it might cost Â£10 billion and yet leave a man like Greaves unrecognised?<br><br>Greaves scored 44 goals in 57 matches for his country. His strike rate was phenomenal. It's still unmatched.<br><br>Is it because he was flawed, like all the rest of us, that he was overlooked? Is it because he was an alcoholic? Well, he's beaten that as well. Make him Sir Jimmy Greaves. And what about Paul Gascoigne? What about Gazza?<br><br>What about the genius who made football fashionable and attractive again in this country?<br><br>What about the guy who helped to lead the English game out of the darkness of the Eighties, the guy whose tears launched a thousand foreign takeovers and made younger players not fit to lace his boots into millionaires overnight?<br><br>He was the best player of his generation and now he is being allowed to stumble around on the periphery of the game, alone with his problems, apart from some help by the PFA.<br><br>What about him? Think what it might do for him after all the issues he has had with self-esteem and alcoholism. For his contribution to our game, he deserves to be Sir Paul Gascoigne.<br><br>There are so many more. What about Bryan Robson, who never gave anything less than his all as England captain? What about Terry Butcher? And Nobby Stiles? And Roger Hunt? And Alan Ball?<br><br>What about Ryan Giggs, who has been such a magnificent player for Manchester United?<br><br>If we're going to have an honours system, let's knight them now. That way, we won't have to try to correct more of the same injustice that was visited on men like Paisley and Clough</div>
