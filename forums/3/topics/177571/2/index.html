But now they are 2 young talented players, whats the use of going to there warm the bench?? Look at SWP, his world cup dreams look bad to me. No use if u are gd but no chances to prove yourself.</div>

Its like choosing a side where u know u have limited chances to perform and u have to show ur worth once u get e chance. Its a confident decision and one i feel only players with calibre and confidence in their own ability will consider.<br><br>Swp for example. I duno whether its purely for the money. But with robben,cole and duff in the side and he choose to move.<br>I would feel that he wants to be with the best..training and playing with the best week in week out. He would defintely learn something from them. As for a regular playing place, he would have to train harder to earn it. Its very fair..u play well u start. Im sure mourinho will start swp if he plays like robben..<br><br>So the matter of choice...Hmm kinda like choosing a school. Choose a good one risk not achieving results or join a weaker one where u perform yr in yr out...I would choose the former....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well cant really say whether a young player join chelsea/ man utd or arsenal is a better choice than the other.<br>it really up to the player of his preference.<br>1. money driven?<br>2. supporter of the club themselves<br>3. better career advancement(win more trophy),<br><br>chelsea as groom lampard, terry, cole into world class player from unpolished material.<br>SWP is overwhelmed by the stars around him so he shy to shine. he should have join arsenal instead but he is blinded by money offer to him by chelsea.<br>Adu and orbi, cant judge them much. from the way they treat the matter blew up between man utd and chelsea. only can judge them by the name. ADU and ORBI<br></div>
