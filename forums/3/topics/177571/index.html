            <div class='col-md body'>It is true Walcott likes Arsenal more than Chelsea. Before the move he already spoke of his admiration for Arsenal's super striker Thierry Henry, I think that is another major big factor for him choosing Arsenal over Chelsea besides being afraid of not being able to cement a first team place in a star-studded Chelsea side. A smart move by the talented youngster  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Not every big player or talented youngster likes to go Chelsea, just like Ronaldinho's preference of Barca over Man Utd or Alberto Gilardino's preference of Milan over Juventus. There is simply nothing wrong with choosing Arsenal over Chelsea.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi HafizulKMS,<br>If you are a talented young player, would you like to play, develop and grow with a team of super players like those with Chelsea, or you like to play with bunch of flops, jokers, and old coconuts, like those with Man U?<br><br>I totally agree with you.<br><br>would you like to play with a team who won the league twice or you rather play with a team that won the league more than twice? But I respect that Chelsea is the flavour of the year now. (sorry, here, we must wait till the game against west ham before they confirmed twice EPL league winners hor).<br><br>I believe Chelsea is doing something good in developing youth players cause they believe their money can't attract good players anymore.<br><br>After a while no body wants to play just for money. They want more than just a EPL medal or FA cup. So good players will drift out of EPL.<br><br>It will be sad loss for EPL,  if Henry leaves for you won't see his genius anymore, or for that matter, Rooney, StevenG or even FLampard.<br><br>Cause in Italian League, Spanish League, week in week out, you playing against the best in the world. No offense to EPL.<br><br>And I believe even Roman knows that.  Soon, his interest in EPL will dwindle, and well, he will move on.where he can rub shoulders with royalty like spain, or the italian giants. And then Chelsea will dry up.<br><br></div>

If the player is good and confident, they should join Chelsea. Players like Rooney and Ronaldo who is with low self confidence should join lousy club like Man U.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HafizulKMS:</div><div class="quote_body">It depends. If the player is good and confident, they should join Chelsea. Players like Rooney and Ronaldo who is with low self confidence should join lousy club like Man U. So that they can play regulary.<br><br>If you are on the bench with Chelsea, it's simply means that you are not good enough. I don't see Roben or Cech on the bench often.<br><br>Chelsea is the best choice, unless the player do not have belief towards himself.<br></div></blockquote>Well, that's not quite true also. Players like scott parker, glen johnson, SWP. Not good? Parker has shown his true potential only after joining newcastle, while the latter two are rotting in the reserves and only get games when mourinho feels like letting them play. A shame really, to me it looks like a waste of english talent.</div>
