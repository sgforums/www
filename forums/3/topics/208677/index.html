            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">tribalfooball.com - September 04, 2006<br><br>Newcastle striker Michael Owen headed for surgery in the United States on Monday promising he would make a full recovery from his knee injury.<br>Specialist Richard Steadman carried out one procedure during the summer to repair the 26-year-old's cartilage and prepare Owen for ligament surgery.<br><br>The ?17million frontman will undergo an operation to mend his ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in Colorado later this week before starting the long haul back to fitness.<br><br>Owen said: "I will be having the operation done in a couple of days, and I'm confident that with positive thinking, I will be back and as good as ever.<br><br>"It's an operation that needs to be done, it's the cruciate as everyone knows, and to be honest, I'm looking forward to it because it is a chink of light for me."<br><br>He has managed just 11 appearances for the Magpies since his move from Real Madrid in August last year.<br><br>He told the club's official website: "I have been basically biding my time since the first operation to prepare for this one and once it is out of the way, I can get on with the rehabilitation.<br><br>"At the start of the rehab, it will just be about getting the knee moving and trying to keep up my general fitness, but it will get tougher as I get nearer to a comeback.<br><br>"The plan is to get as fit as I can through the rehab so I don't have to play in too many reserve games or practice games, and my obvious aim is to get back into the first team as quickly as I can." </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">hope that he can return soon he is one of my favourite player even though he not chelsea player but he a great striker to me</span></div>
