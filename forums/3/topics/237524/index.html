The rules are clear if they swear at an official they will be sent off.<br><br>"If the boot is on the other foot and a referee is using abusive language at players, it should be taken very seriously and investigated thoroughly. If proven, action should without doubt be taken immediately against the referee."<br><br>Bean, now a football disciplinary consultant, added: "Without a shadow of a doubt there would be serious implication for him."  </span><br><br>wonder if Phil Dowd will be punish if really found evidence that he did swear</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">WIGAN FURY AT REF RAGE<br><br>SIX Wigan players have given details of referee Phil Dowd's alleged 'F'-word comments in a dossier to be sent to the Football Association.<br><br>Manager Paul Jewell has compiled a report of the foul-mouthed comments from the Staffordshire official in the stormy defeat at Arsenal and it is being delivered to the FA after they decided to charge the boss with improper conduct.<br><br>Striker Lee McCulloch claims he was told 'f*** off, you moaning b******' while Ryan Taylor was warned after a second complaint: 'F*** off, who do you think you are talking to?'<br><br>Advertisement<br>The dossier claims skipper Leighton Baines - later booked for dissent - was on the end of a straight swearing remark as were Matt Jackson, Australian Jospi Skoko and Emmerson Boyce. Other players like Chris Kirkland and Fitz Hall heard the stick.<br><br>Wigan want to put the record straight and are also concerned that officials can talk to them like that - but not 'stars' at bigger clubs.<br><br>Jewell said: "I will be fighting it all the way. If I just shrug my shoulders at injustice it comes across that I don't care.<br><br>"We're living in a democracy, that's why we fought all of those wars, and I don't take things lying down.<br><br>"The only regret I have is the refereeing decisions. If we could turn back the clock I think Phil Dowd would change his mind."<br><br>Jewell was incensed by Dowd's performance, specifically his refusal to award a penalty when Mathieu Flamini appeared to bring down Emile Heskey when Wigan were 1-0 up, before losing 2-1.</span></div>
