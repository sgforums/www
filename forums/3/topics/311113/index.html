              <p>Singapore’s first official paintball tournament, the Singapore
              Paintball Novice Series (SPNS) 2008 will be held in the island state’s
              largest and newest paintball arena, Red Dynasty Paintball Park on 30
              March 2008. <br><br>This three-on-three tournament will be open for
              registration to all people residing in Singapore. “The aim of this
              tournament is to create paintball awareness in Singapore and to allow
              more people to take up this activity as a lifestyle sport” states Jane
              Koh, who is the President of the Paintball Association (Singapore) and
              the Singapore representative in the Paintball Asia League Series (PALS)
              which organized the World Cup Asia 2007. As the tournament director,
              she points out that paintball is not only an exhilarating sport to
              play; it is also one which is exciting to watch.<br><br>This tournament
              will create an opportunity for like-minded people to come together and
              pit their paintball skills against each other, thus increasing the
              community of paintball players in Singapore. The tournament has an
              expected turn out of twenty teams. <br><br>Ben Seow otherwise known as
              “King” within the paintball community is a member of the Singapore’s
              First Paintball Team, believes that this tournament will allow
              Singaporeans to experience playing paintball in a competition format
              which will help people to understand more about the sport. He believes
              that it will also allow the paintball standards in Singapore to improve
              and grow. With more than two hundred paintball teams in Malaysia, he
              hopes to see more paintball teams carrying the Singapore flag when
              participating in regional paintball tournaments.<br><br>The SPNS will
              be a three leg series which will be organized in the months of March,
              June and September (dates to be confirmed) in 2008. Teams can either
              choose to play in any leg or commit themselves to the entire series in
              which they will accumulate championship points for the Grand Champion
              award. Each team will comprise of five players roster with three first
              team players and two reserve players. <br><br>Being a novice
              tournament, this event will be evenly contested and provide a good
              platform for participants to understand and appreciate the sport
              better. <br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>A new beginning... as there is NO CENTRE LINE FOR THIS TOURNAMENT! </strong></em></span></span></p>
