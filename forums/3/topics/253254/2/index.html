Just like any club would. Be it Barcelona, Real Madrid...... I say they are all in it for the money.<br><br>Sometimes, business in modern world is like that. You have to do something humanitarian or socially beneficial to raise your profile. Like how some companies have adopted charities.<br><br>It's also no secret that China has been opening itself up and is always a market any business wants to explore, not just soccer itself.<br><br>Also, not speaking on Chelsea specifically, all these club activities in other countries be it friendly matches, soccer clinics, soccer schools are aimed at promoting the name of the club, raising it's profile. It's not the money earned from the activities itself, it's the merchandising even after the club has left. You like how pop starts do 'xuan chuan'?<br><br>If you read papers about a year back, you would also know Asia is regarded the Holy Grail in soccer betting. I don't how to explain it, but it links to why European soccer clubs are looking towards furthering their brand name in Asia as well.<br><br>As for improving asian soccer itself, there is more than one way to do it. Giving money/grants is one thing. Clinics are like gifts in kind rather than in hard cash. Matches, even friendly ones, expose asian players to a better or different type of football when playing against these teams. There is no real learning experience like a match itself.<br><br>I know Ghimpheng that end of the day, you idolise Chelsea and they can do no wrong to you. You are not without your point on this issue but maybe to give you a more balanced view.<br><br>But coming back to topic, the issue is just about clash of schedule. That's all. If you ask me, I think AFC has severly overeacted to this. They are not without their reasons or concerns, but I think it could have been handled differently. Which is why I think Bear said that AFC is disgraceful as well.<br><br>Sepp Blatter himself said this<br><blockquote>'m sure if such a case will be presented to the club, Manchester United, that the organisers of the tour will understand such a situation.</blockquote>I don't know if you just want to take a pot shot at Man U or just want to put in a good word for Chelsea. All I'm saying is to take things into totality and perspective.<br><br>Besides, it's an invitation to Man U to play there, they did not come in insisting to play on that date.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One thing about tours is that the club's players need a pre-season anyway, so might as well help the club earn money doing it. Besides, helping the club in financial pursuits is a player obligation anyway. Liverpool was to have an Asian tour too after winning the Champions' League 2 seasons ago. They had to call it off because they had to play all the qualification rounds of the UCL.</div>

Also, his approach is different. He didn't come out and say things that were so deeply negative towards Man U. Any further and it'll almost be like defamation.<br><br>Still, I don't think legal action would be warranted for the negative comments, but the deeply negative comments were uncalled for as well. It does reflect badly on AFC to not handle this more tactfully. Two wrongs don't make a right in any sense.<br><br>Between organisations, I believe there are more diplomatic ways to get your point or request across.</div>
