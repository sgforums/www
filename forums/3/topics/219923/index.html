            <div class='col-md body'>personally i don't think he's going anywhere for time being.  Chelsea pays lots of cash for him &amp; with his age, he's probably viewing this as his retirement stint to earn some roubles for his retirement.<br><br>unless Chelsea decides to offload for another bigger player, he should be there for one -  two more seasons to come.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dunno the actually reason why he was sold off to Man Utd but back then the Manager of Leeds is pretty strict with his players, and of course there is no way one could really understand what he is think lor.. like his days in France, winning so much but causing just as much problems and also "retired" once before he comes to England for trial.. he is a winner and once he feels tat he has done enough he will want to step down rather then being replaced.. which i seriously think he wouldn't be even playing another 1-2 seasons for Man Utd back then.. but well.. guess all these makes him special lor..</div>
