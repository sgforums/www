            <div class='col-md body'>Fabio Capello has resigned as manager of Italian champions Juventus, fuelling speculation that he is to return to Real Madrid.<br><br>If he does indeed join Real, Capello, a renowned disciplinarian, will be faced with the task of reviving the fortunes of a side that has not won any silverware since 2003. He will also help to decide on the futures of David Beckham, Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos. "In 1996 Capello brought six signings and won the league, overcoming a situation which is similar to the one we have today," said Calderon the new Real president.<br><br>Capello would work with Madrid's new director of soccer, former Yugoslavia international Predrag Mijatovic, who played under him during his previous spell with the club.<br><br>Mijatovic says he has already signed pre-agreements with Chelsea forward Arjen Robben and Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas to bring them to Madrid. He has also been negotiating with AC Milan to sign Brazil's Kaka.<br><br>So is Robben leaving Chelsea for Real!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>

CalderÃ³n took charge on Monday and the Spanish club are expected to make an offer for the 19-year-old who helped Arsenal reach their first Champions League final last season.<br><br>If he moves to Real he is likely to have Fabio Capello as his coach after the Italian left Juventus yesterday, seemingly to pave the way for a move to the Spanish capital.<br><br>So the 3 names that they mentioned, FÃ¡bregas, Robben &amp; Kaka... don't know which one they will get, or all 3.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>

He is already getting 100,000 pounds a week so maybe 110 or 120 at most but they can save on a transfer fee you know... So the 10 or 20 extra per week is nothing compare to a about 30M pounds transfer fee they have to pay upfront if he wasn't a free agend.</div>

Mourinho may have complained but he knows that robben is the one that can change a game more than the rest and the other 3 compare to him.<br><br>Fabregas case is worst, getting 20M for him is no reward at all... The guy is becoming a very good playmaker and he is only around 19 or 20 yrs old. Even at 20M he is still under value considering that he can play for another 12 yrs. Even if Real use his service for 5 yrs, they can still sell him in 5 yrs time much more than the 20M that they paid Arsenal for... Even Arsenal can sell him for 20M or maybe more in 5 yrs time.</div>
