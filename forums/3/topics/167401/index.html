There's still the English Premier League he's eyeing. Winning it will prove his success in England.<br><br>It will be just as massive a boost if he can get Liverpool back on track. Few can argue that that process is well on its way and I just don't see Rafa giving it all up at this moment.<br><br>Rafa's still young for a manager. After 10 years, he'll still only be 55. There's plenty of time left in his managerial career.<br><br>Lastly, I seriously doubt nationalitiy will have anything to do with his decision to move to Madrid. He's more intelligent than that.<br><br></div>

I agree that winning a cup compeitition and a league is different but I'm just using the example to illustrate that nothing is impossible.<br><br>It may be an uphill task, but that does'nt mean that the manager, players and fans will stop dreaming and working towards that goal.<br><br>Things have been looking up for Liverpool recently. Players are maturing, quality players have been brought in, the team is gelling, and more players are expected to join in January. The team will become stronger.<br><br>With the Kraft investments imminent, things could change.<br><br>5 years ago, you'll be the biggest joke if you said that Chelsea will win the EPL. Never say never. You just never know in football.</div>
