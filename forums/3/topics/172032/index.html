I did not understand it."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>he felt the club didn't want him so he left..but i really do kinda doubt that vieira is like a ronaldinho to barca or terry/lampard to chelsea..its just that alot of arsenal problems have been from their own mistakes in which even if vieira was there he can't stop it..seriously gilberto,lauren,cygan soo many mistakes between them, and their poor finishing?as if vieira can help solve it..</div>
