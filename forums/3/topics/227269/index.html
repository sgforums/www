            <div class='col-md body'>Former S.League aristocrats Geylang United have identified their backline as the key to resurgence as they seek to end a three-year run of finishing outside the leagueÂ’s top three.<br><br>The 1996 and 2001 league champions had finished the 2006 season second from bottom, one place lower than their final position the year before.<br><br>Along the way, the Eagles had conceded 62 goals in 30 league games, or an average of 2.07 goals per game. Only bottom club Sengkang Punggol had let in more.<br><br>The statistics mark a far cry from GeylangÂ’s more glorious days, when they were regular title challengers and had conceded no more than 1.32 goals on average each season.<br><br>The Geylang management, frustrated by the teamÂ’s poor defensive record in recent years, has taken action by putting the backline as the section most warranting attention.<br><br>Of the ten players retained for the 2007 Eagles squad, six are in the defensive department, including club captain Noh Rahman and national No.2 custodian Hassan Sunny.<br><br>Razaleigh Khalik and S. Rajendran are also among those staying at Geylang next season, after the club was robbed of their services for substantial periods of 2006 through injury.<br><br>In addition, the club has acted to further strengthen its defence by signing defender Dennis Lim, one of SengkangÂ’s better performers this season.<br><br>Eagles coach Lim Tong Hai confirmed the clubÂ’s plans as he spoke to sleague.com at the clubÂ’s annual childrenÂ’s football camp, co-organized with South East Community Development Council.<br><br>Â“The direction the club wants to take should be clear,Â” said the former national defender.<br><br>Â“There is a certain system we have decided we want to play. Obviously, we are keeping or trying to get players who we think will fit into that system.<br><br>Â“You can see that we didnÂ’t do that well this year defensively, so weÂ’re working to buck up in that area. Apart from what is done, other measures are currently in the pipeline.Â”<br><br>Recent rumours have linked the Bedok-based club with a shock swoop for former Home United and Tampines Rovers defender Aide Iskandar, who will be out of contract on 1 January 2007.<br><br>The national team captain will not be returning to Malaysian Premier League side Johor FA, who had merged with Pasir Gudang United last month to form Johor-Pasir Gudang.<br><br>Aide was one of Johor FAÂ’s two foreign players in the previous Malaysian Premier League season, the other being former Woodlands Wellington midfielder Ahmad Latiff.<br><br>When asked about the rumoured move, Aide confirmed that he is currently talking to the club, but said no deal had been confirmed as yet.<br><br>Â“Yes, there have been talks,Â” acknowledged the 31-year-old.<br><br>Â“Nothing has been agreed yet between both parties, though. IÂ’ve heard people saying the deal is done, but thatÂ’s not true.Â”<br><br>AideÂ’s statements were echoed by Lim, who also revealed that the club may be considering alternative targets from overseas to further beef up the teamÂ’s backline.<br><br>Â“I wonÂ’t deny it; we are indeed in the midst of talks with Aide,Â” said the 37-year-old.<br><br>Â“HeÂ’s a big name, and hopefully things will turn out fine. We are also considering the possibility of signing a foreign defender as well, and that will add to our options.<br><br>Â“It shouldnÂ’t be a problem to our current players. Fadhil and Noh Rahman can be used in different positions, so we can fit in all the talents we have without leaving too many out.Â”<br><br>On the attacking front, the Eagles will welcome back Syed Thaha, who had joined the Young Lions early this year after impressing for Geylang at Prime League level.<br><br>The 21-year-old is expected to offer some stiff opposition to Razali Johari on the left wing. 23-year-olds Lau Meng Meng and Che Mukammil, should they be promoted from the Prime League squad, will further add to the challenge for places.<br><br>But Lim has quashed suggestions that he would be rushing several members of his Prime League-winning team into the S.League squad, believing that the youngsters still have room for growth before they are ready for senior action.<br><br>They will thus be working under former Eagles forward D. Tokijan, who has recently joined the club to succeed Lim as Prime League coach.<br><br>Â“There is no rush to promote this yearÂ’s Prime League boys,Â” said Lim.<br><br>Â“Most of them are only 19 or 20, and are still eligible to play at Prime League level. We would like to see how they would develop under our new Prime League coach.<br><br>Â“Tokijan is coming in to help us out, and I think heÂ’d like to work with these boys to see what theyÂ’re like. WeÂ’re looking forward to seeing them continue their growth.<br><br>Â“Of course, if the opportunity is there for them to be promoted, weÂ’ll think about giving them the promotion. But some of them are also entering the force for National Service, so we will have to see whether we can sign them.Â”</div>
