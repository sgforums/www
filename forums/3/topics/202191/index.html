The remotest allegation against him came <strong>years</strong> after the alleged event was supposed to have taken place. Landis, on the other hand, was tested positive right after he won the Tour de France - I mean, it's not rocket science to figure the allegations against Armstrong were remotely weak and feeble at best and ludicrous at worst; as opposed to Landis' testing positive in the immediate aftermath of the test(the test results - A sample, at least - were released less than a week after Stage 17).<br><br>That said, while I'm not going to be drawn into a debate with regards to the integrity of those conducting the doping tests, I think events like that do reaffirm the integrity of other top athletes(in other sports) even more - think along the lines of the Roger Federers and Tiger Woods...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
