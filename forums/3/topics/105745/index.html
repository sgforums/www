Judging from the time of ur post, i was still out there!<br>ahahahah....<br>Took a grand total of 4hours and 40mins...<br><br>Juz had roti prata and fried carrot cake for lunch....Theres goes all the running this morning!!<br>hahahahah....<br><br>It was really fun....*the start, at least*... Only had problems during the ECP portion *which was expected* and was really really struggling at the 38-40km mark...<br>My entire body felt like cramping up and i even sat at one of the benches along the way.... I pretended to do some stretching but all i really wanted at that time was to sit down... ahhaha...i dun noe why...<br><br>The last 2km, i ran with this lady... if she didnt come along, i think i would have walked all the way back to the padang.. hahaha.... really thankful for her...<br><br>Now, the sole of my feet are arching real bad but i really had fun... I mean, ONCE in a lifetime and i did it already... ahhahah....<br><br>Shall now go ponder if i should do it again anytime soon...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey spencer..<br><br>I experienced walking  much much earlier than u..(esplanade stretch) becoz of stitches. Its funny how it hits u suddenly.. But i realised it disappear after drinking (water/isotonic drinks)...<br><br>Walking at 14km mark was so paiseh...<br><br>From then on, it was a combination of jog and walk with some serious walking along the geylang stretch (along the traffic)... My body was simply not working between the 37km - 40km stretch...<br><br>YAyaya...i have to agree on the part of the old man and fat girls and weak looking girls... DUn underestimate them.... They are stronger (mentally) than i thought... There was this plump girl way infront along the ECP stretch running with her BF or husband.... they juz kept going and going and going... Never caught them during my run... hahah...<br>I guess thats why they say... ' Its about the mind, never about the body'<br><br>'MIND OVER MATTER!'</div>

My god, and i always thought Chio girls dun run. How wrong i was...<br><br>Guys, u know something amazing, the caucasians are much much more supportive than singaporeans. Which is rather sad since the run is held in singapore...<br><br>There was this incident at ECP when this 'papa' was riding bike with family along the closed cycle way, i heard this caucasian couple pleding with them to get off the ride way so that the runners can run....and all the 'papa' said was 'yaya, i know...' My god... Oh well... I bet that guy was more interested in getting his bicycle rental fee worth while...<br><br>Life is good....

I just came back from a week long holiday in Bangkok. Anyway, I went into the race feeling quite good. I started slow as i planned and was running strong for the first 2.5hrs straight when my legs began to get a slight cramps. It was easy to ignore at first but as i continued to run/walk through it, but it got progressivley worse.<br><br>By 32km, i had a really major cramps, on both legs, decided then not to risk serious injuries and just walked to the finished line. I finished in 6hrs 16mins. Crikes!! I know could do so much better.<br><br>Overall, a good experience. I have a much more healthier respect for the sport now, and know personally it IS hard on the body. I know for certain i have the endurance and fitness to run long distance but i need to put in the long hours of training so i would not get legs cramps during race day.<br><br>I'm gonna run the half-marathon in KL in March. That should be fun <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
