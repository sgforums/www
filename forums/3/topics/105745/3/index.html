            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah... my point exactly.... no offence to the KL marathon organizers. but I think when running overseas must be more careful. Will therbe proper medical care if something go wrong. I think for people of our fitness levels, it is highly likely something might happen if we push.. come on admit it, we are not super fit. and a Full M is very hard on the body.<br><br>Also must factor that we will be running in alien environment and will have differnt diet and lodging from home... also never run in KL before.<br><br>For eg, I have ran in ECP, Marina Esplanade for both training and races before so quite familar. and if cannot tahan just take a cab home. But in KL how???<br><br>But of course this is an additional challenge also to stretch yourself to a higher level.<br><br></div>

I don't know, maybe this marathon after-effect still playing havoc on my body.<br><br>I got approached by one of the personal trainer to take up Manila Adventure racing of some sort next year. This involves multi-discipline sports like sea swimming, trail running, kayaking or what-have-u. Wohooo! SOUNDs LIKE FUN!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Faqua and everybody,<br><br>8-)<br>I think I put on a bit of weight because I went for a Japanese BUFFET. All you can eat... I wollop the salmon and prawns like nobody business.<br>Not only I was celebrating my Singapore marathon, I was also celebrating my first  Aquathlon finisher medal !! Can read about my Aquathlon adventures at www.jroller.com/page/penguin<br><br>8-))<br>Coming back to the Singapore Marathon ...<br>I would like to say .. I honestly tried to chat with all the Singapore girls that I could see in front of me as I did my galloway run walk style of 5/1. It was like that new concept of SPEED DATING where one tries your luck and within a few minutes .. you know if its a hit or miss.<br><br>But coming to the punch line .. there was only 2 PRETTY  Singapore girls that I was so AFRAID  to chat with.<br><br>Anyone remember those  JINGLE BELL girls. One of them was Shereen. I was drafting them ...  about to make contact when I saw the words<br>SALVATION ARMY  written on their arms. Well.. I know that if I tried to chat it would probably be all about ... God.  And if I want to get a date .. it would probably be at the Church.<br><br>8-)<br>Hmmmm...
