I just came back from a week long holiday in Bangkok. Anyway, I went into the race feeling quite good. I started slow as i planned and was running strong for the first 2.5hrs straight when my legs began to get a slight cramps. It was easy to ignore at first but as i continued to run/walk through it, but it got progressivley worse.<br><br>By 32km, i had a really major cramps, on both legs, decided then not to risk serious injuries and just walked to the finished line. I finished in 6hrs 16mins. Crikes!! I know could do so much better.<br><br>Overall, a good experience. I have a much more healthier respect for the sport now, and know personally it IS hard on the body. I know for certain i have the endurance and fitness to run long distance but i need to put in the long hours of training so i would not get legs cramps during race day.<br><br>I'm gonna run the half-marathon in KL in March.

I tried their webbie www.klmarathon.gov.my earlier but seems not up yet. I understand can register online from 1/1/2005 onwards. My heart aching to enter another race oredi. I love running but I love running with a goal better. Helps me to get up on cold morning when i rather sleep than run.<br><br>I met an american who did the jeff galloway (?) run/walk method during the marathon. he really swear by it. His PB was 4hrs plus but for s'pore marathon, he did like 5hrs 38min. his race fell apart when he started to get a bit wozzy i think.<br><br>I love the way those african runners can run so fast. they impress me with their effortless running. Actually i met a south african lady who did a 3hrs plus time during the marathon.  This after taking some time break from the sport, but then she has been to quite a few marathons. super woman.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All Fuqua. Welcome back.....<br><br>I borrowed Jeff Galloway's book from the library.... he emphasized about the run/walk technique... he specifically said that one should walk during the early phases when you don't feel tired and not walk when you feel tired...apparently walking uses a different set of muscles and let your running muscles rest while u r still covering distances by walking..he had a lot of computation on speed and formulas to show that you are better off walking a bit.... There is a lot on training for marathon as well. I think his book is more practical and the language simple. there are some other marathon books which i picked up which are too complicated!!!<br><br>if you wait until tired then walk.... too late.... that is the theory... I read that after my SBR 1/2M and didn't really have a chance to put in practice until the Stand chart full M. And I find that at the initial stage I sort of go with the flow with everyone runnings.... kind of hard to walk and have everyone overtake you. So I run and forgot about my game plan.... I think I only start taking walking breaks at the ECP at which time I am already tired.....<br><br>I think the program will work.. but need practice and discipline.....<br><br>Fuqua,<br>Tell us about the kl marathon when u come back. do they have 1/2M?</div>
