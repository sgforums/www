            <div class='col-md body'><br>I thought he said he might consider the options as he felt  some old injuries were acting up and he had to solve the injuries 1st before deciding whether to carry on plying for Celtic or just retire.....  Anyway he is already a legend at OT so whether he play for Celtic is just for entertainment and only a short period of time not a long one.... Sooner or later Celtic will have 2 find a replacement just like Man Utd is doing right now.</div>

Because of Ruud's passion and determination he would not keep his mouth shut.<br><br>"Ruud can go far, - sometimes too far. And that has worked " against him at United."<br><br>But Van Hanegem also believes his friend made a basic error in his judgment of the United boss.<br><br>"Ruud was completely overwhelmed by Sir Alex when he first got to know him. When Ruud got injured the first time he was going to move from PSV Eindhoven to United, Ferguson kept in touch with him all the time.<br><br>"Ruud really appreciated that. He found it amazing that the biggest man at the world's biggest football club showed such a nice side. But now Ruud has come to realise, I hope, that Ferguson's caring had nothing to do with a human touch. It as only because Ruud was a world-class striker and Ferguson was desperate to get him.<br><br>"Now Ruud has found out the hard way. He, has also realised that Ferguson has a funny way of ditching his biggest stars. Ruud has seen what happened to David Beckham, Jaap Stam and Roy Keane."<br><br>Another of Van Nistelrooy's closest friends added: "Last summer, Ruud was worried that the United team was not strong enough to ' challenge for the top trophies and he had opportunities to move to a club that would help him achieve his dream of playing at the highest level in Europe. "He went to speak to the manager about this. Sir Alex begged him not to leave and told him he'd build ' a great team around Ruud.<br><br>"Now, less than a year later, Ferguson has come out with the most outrageous excuses to remove Ruud from the club. Ruud feels betrayed." </span><br><br></div>

Because of Ruud's passion and determination he would not keep his mouth shut.<br><br>"Ruud can go far, - sometimes too far. And that has worked " against him at United."<br><br>But Van Hanegem also believes his friend made a basic error in his judgment of the United boss.<br><br>"Ruud was completely overwhelmed by Sir Alex when he first got to know him. When Ruud got injured the first time he was going to move from PSV Eindhoven to United, Ferguson kept in touch with him all the time.<br><br>"Ruud really appreciated that. He found it amazing that the biggest man at the world's biggest football club showed such a nice side. But now Ruud has come to realise, I hope, that Ferguson's caring had nothing to do with a human touch. It as only because Ruud was a world-class striker and Ferguson was desperate to get him.<br><br>"Now Ruud has found out the hard way. He, has also realised that Ferguson has a funny way of ditching his biggest stars. Ruud has seen what happened to David Beckham, Jaap Stam and Roy Keane."<br><br>Another of Van Nistelrooy's closest friends added: "Last summer, Ruud was worried that the United team was not strong enough to ' challenge for the top trophies and he had opportunities to move to a club that would help him achieve his dream of playing at the highest level in Europe. "He went to speak to the manager about this. Sir Alex begged him not to leave and told him he'd build ' a great team around Ruud.<br><br>"Now, less than a year later, Ferguson has come out with the most outrageous excuses to remove Ruud from the club. Ruud feels betrayed." </span><br><br></div></blockquote>looks like he's the nxt to b booted...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This season Ruud's form not so good and Roy Keane's departure halfway in the season may have affected him a lot.<br><br>Like Roy, he actually also want good for the club, buck up, be more consistent, get good players in, but maybe rub Alex Ferguson the wrong way.<br><br>For Fergie, no open criticism of teammates allowed, if you affect team morale, you are out. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
