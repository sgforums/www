            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like people in Europe are also fed-up and are now planning how to control chelsea's unfair and unreasonable behaviour... If all goes as their intention, very soon chelsea won't be able to use cash as a means to success. They will have to depend on real team management skills rather than cash and proper club management from the CEO in order they make profit rather than lost every year.<br><br>Looks like UEFA main aim is Chelsea. Cos no other club currently is losing money every year and yet spend the most as well. Since June 2003 when Abramovich became the owner of Chelsea, he have spent Â£276m on players alone and made losses of Â£228m on club.<br><br>If the rule were in place today, chelsea would only be allowed to spend no more than $30m a year.<br><br>So maybe Abramovich may lose interest in football in a few years time when he realise he has no more advantage and move on to a more expensive sport like F1 motor racing which he is rumour to have an interest too.<br><br>If all goes as Uefa's plan, then Mourinho better get ready to pack his bags and jump ship cos if not very soon he and everyone else will know he is not so Special after all.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><span style="color: olive;">ROMAN'S FACING A CASH CAP<br>By David Mcdonnel<br><br>CHELSEA are facing a curb on their seemingly limitless spending power in a move designed to ensure they cannot buy whoever they like with Roman Abramovich's millions.<br><br>Growing anger at Chelsea's ability to dominate the transfer market through Abramovich's huge personal fortune has led UEFA and EU ministers to devise plans to ensure greater fairness.<br><br>Chelsea are currently allowed to run up massive losses as a business while spending vast amounts of money on players because they are bankrolled by Abramovich, who is worth an estimated Â£10billion.<br><br>But plans to limit spending by clubs in accordance with their annual turnover could see Chelsea's total spending in a season reduced to just Â£30million - the amount they spent on Andriy Shevchenko this summer.<br><br>Sports minister Richard Caborn attended a Brussels meeting which discussed reining in Chelsea and ensuring the double Premiership champions are not allowed to dominate because of their unique financial strength.<br><br>Caborn said: "There is support for the idea of introducing a better relationship between income earned by clubs and the amounts spent."<br><br>Under Abramovich, Chelsea have spent Â£276m on players and made losses of Â£228m.</span><br></div>

Cos at present and since 2003 when Abramovich came in the transfer fee of players have all gone up. There was a time around 2001-2003, where transfer fees were going downwards. Even players like Thierry Henry was going at 10.5m only... Today we see Theo Walcott a player that didn't even had much first team experience can cost 12m.<br><br>If the club continues with such purchasing... At the end of the day, it's the fans that will suffer as the club may have to increase ticket prices to keep up with their expenses. Cos presently, maybe 1 small club benefit from chelsea's interest but 50 others suffer at the same time.<br><br>Whichever way we look at it, it will be a good move for football across europe i belief as smaller clubs will also be able to afford better players as more players will be sold at a lower fee. This effect may also make the overall league more competitive.<br><br>As this is currently only in the planning stage it may take afew yrs before anything happens giving clubs time to adjust. But of course if nothing changes... Clubs like chelsea won't be able to last long too. Reason unlike other top clubs, they are not self sustainable, they are being kept up there with artificial means.... They depend on Abramovich $10b pounds to maintain their club. If anything happens to Abramovich or if he loses interest in Chelsea, then everything will be over in a short time.<br><br>Though Kenyon has said they plan to be a profitable club in time to come, i find that very difficult cos every year Chelsea's expenses in the transfer market is getting bigger and bigger without much return when they release them, and even their players salaries (4 players on more than 100,000 pounds a wk, about 6 to 7 players between 70 to 90 k weekly) is enough to make the club bankrupt let alone their highest paid Manager at $6m a yr, double the amount McClaren gets managing England and also their... Super paid CEO Peter Kenyon needless to say, line himself up with a fat pay cheque too.<br><br>Top clubs like Liverpool, Man u, Arsenal and even Spurs &amp; Newcastle will and has last longer over the years at top level. They won't come a time when they will be burden by huge... players, manager &amp; managements and Directors salaries... Abramovich will also not be getting any richer after he sold his guaranteed money making business, the oil production company Sibneft to the Russian gov to get into Russian President Vladimir Putin good books.<br><br>Anyway, Abramovich have already spent more than half a billion of his 10b worth and he also don't have a bottomless pit... he also has a wife and 5 children to think for... and now without an easy money making oil production company to give him a regular income, he may have to think twice about the kind of money he throws into Chelsea in a few years time.</div>

Overall, they want the club to be well run and if its not making a profit, it cannot spend more than the cap amount. Remember Leeds! It just means that those clubs not making money cannot spend so much. Chelsea is not making much money and it is still allow to spend 30m. Other clubs like Real Madrid currently the most profitable club in the world would definitely be allowed to spend much more than chelsea.<br><br>Of course clubs like Man u (2nd most profitable club) and Liverpool, Arsenal are allow to spend more too as their club yearly profit is much more than chelsea after deducting all their expenses including players salaries.<br><br>So don't worry, ronaldino can still leave if he wants to. But maybe he won't cost so much as the market may not have many clubs willing to pay 30 over million kind of price anymore.</div>
