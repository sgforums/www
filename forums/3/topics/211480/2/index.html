Very similar to the english &amp; scottish set where only celtic or rangers are above average and may manage mid table in EPL.<br><br>In the Portuguese league, normally its either porto and benfica and sometime lucky there is sporting. The rest just exist to make up the numbers to form a league.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Yeah he got lucky that a generation of good portuguese players emerge around that time. If given another try, he may not be able to do it again as most of them have either gone on to better clubs or retired.<br><br>Anyway, luck plays an important part in winning too. Remember Denmark? They didn't even qualify for the 92 European Championship but then they were invited last mintue as Yugoslavia who made it to the finals were excluded as a result of hostilities in their country.<br><br>The most amazing thing was a team that didn't qualify and no one gave them a chance, actually when on to win the European Championship. Then there is Greece also. They were seen as the "no hopers" that probably wouldn't make it pass the first round... and what happen? I think we all know right.<br></div>

Back to your question, Maybe... but it very much depends on whats the club's yearly turnover. The 30m is base on chelseas' not for everyone.<br><br>At United their turnover is much higher so... their cap could be higher too but doesn't mean they will cos they are normlly prudent and won't make 50m purchase every year.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shall be all the big name clubs too over confident when played against porto the season when they won the UCL. As for porto lost the title after JM left its partly due to most of the core players left too, not just coz of JM.  i will show him respect if he bring a so-so club to become one of the most fear club, but that does not include chelsea.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
