            <div class='col-md body'>Can't really agree that Crouch and Rooney form a more effective partnership. Crouch is certainly no finisher. We all saw that. And once in a blue moon and against lesser opponents does he provide the good odd pass. Pool fans will recall his lacklustre performance in the FA Cup Final. This tall fella hardly plays well in big matches. And Rooney, definitely a worldclass player but he is no predator, not "a fox in the box." And if u partnered this two together, where are the goals going to come from? Long shots? Hello.. as if Lampard and Gerard and even Joe Cole are not taking enough pot shots. What England needs now is balance. (no pun intended since Crouch is often off-balance) But balance in the sense, u need a playmaker who makes the crucial passes and packs a powerful shot like Rooney and centre midfielders like Lampard and Gerard to keep the midfield engine running, Joe Cole to provide the incisive runs down the left, Beckham to make his pinpoint crosses and YES a worldclass finisher like Owen to finish off the moves. Form is temp but Class is perm. Owen may not be as fast but he still scores goals in loads and he scores them not with sheering pace of yesteryear (Argentina legacy) but with his footballing intelligence and finishing ability. No offense to the Toon army but England provides better service for Owen. But yet it is not the case, too much balls have been played long to Crouch, who mind u is not in the same league as a creator compared to Rooney and a finisher compared to Owen. Asking Crouch to create or score is like asking M. Jordan to score from a direct freekick ala Becks. It will be a sad day for England and Rooney if Crouch do become his England strike partner.</div>
