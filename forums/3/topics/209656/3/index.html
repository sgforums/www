It set the tone for the whole season early on.<br><br>"If you can win a big one early, it can be a massive statement.<br><br>"We know the other teams will be watching to see if we can go out there and play well against Liverpool and win.<br><br>"If we do, the likes of United and the rest will have to stand up and pay attention to us and what we're about.<br><br>"United are playing well at the minute but they've got to keep winning.<br><br>"We're aware Liverpool got a bit of a thumping in their derby, which was a massive game for them.<br><br>"So I'm sure their players and fans will be very upset after Everton.<br><br>"They will all be travelling down here to come and win. It's vital that we go out and pick up another three points.<br><br>"I know it's so early on in the season but it is important we keep on doing that - especially at home, which has been a fortress for the last three seasons. We're going into the Liverpool game with a lot of confidence." </span></div>

But boss Arsene Wenger has been boosted by the news that defender Kolo Toure will be fit after he also suffered a hip injury on Wednesday.<br><br>Wenger said: "Kolo Toure will have no problem on Sunday. Thierry and Robin are a bigger problem. We have to wait.<br><br>"Robin has a hip problem and there is a major doubt about him."<br><br>The loss of strikers Van Persie and Henry would be a massive blow to the struggling Gunners at Old Trafford.<br><br>They have just two points from three games while leaders United have won all four of their Premiership matches. </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Benitez assured ahead of Bridge visit<br><br>Rafael Benitez believes Liverpool are 'ready' for another showdown with Chelsea which could reveal whether his summer spending spree has begun to bridge the gap with the champions.<br><br>The Reds may well have won their last two games against Jose Mourinho's men, in the Community Shield and last season's FA Cup semi-final, but the Blues boss would dismiss those defeats as merely cup action.<br><br>The real thing - Premiership points - have so far proven elusive to boss Benitez and his men.<br><br>Liverpool face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday without a single point from four league meetings between the clubs since the Spaniard and his Portuguese antagonist first crossed swords in their adopted English home three season ago.<br><br>Benitez wants to end that run and foster better relations with Mourinho following the pair's failure to indulge in the traditional post-match handshake after recent games.<br><br>This will be the 12th time the clubs have clashed in the Mourinho-Benitez era and Benitez is prepared for the latest instalment.<br><br>'We are ready now for Chelsea,' he said. 'You can never be sure because Chelsea are a very good team but we feel ready and we are planning to go there and win.<br><br>'I have no problem shaking hands, I'll give him (Mourinho) the opportunity to shake hands if he wants.'<br><br>Benitez will no doubt rotate his squad again, and it appears certain captain Steven Gerrard - left out of the starting line-up on Tuesday for the Champions League draw with PSV Eindhoven - will start the match.<br><br>Who Benitez opts to play in central defence is another matter.<br><br>Daniel Agger played very well there in the Community Shield success in Cardiff in August, and was outstanding in the Reds' first clean sheet of the season against PSV.<br><br>This could earn him the nod over the veteran Sami Hyypia.<br><br>Benitez said: 'Now we will see who is ahead. For Eindhoven, Danny was ahead of Sami in my thinking. But that may not be the case in the future. Other times, Sami will be the one in the forefront.<br><br>'Danny did very well in Holland, but that was one match, Sami has done well for several years at Liverpool. Everything depends on who we play and how we analyse what is needed.<br><br>'Danny has quality and played well against Eindhoven - we will have to decide who plays on Sunday.'<br><br>Full-back Steve Finnan sees the Chelsea match as crucial to Liverpool's early-season confidence, saying: 'Now it's Chelsea next and we haven't got the best results against them at Stamford Bridge in the league over the last few years, so we it will be nice to put that record right.<br><br>'We need to kick on in the league now, so it's important that we get something there. I don't go along with the theory that if we lose there we can forget about the title. It's only our fourth game and we can go on to do well.<br><br>'But, if we want to be contenders - even if it won't be a deciding match - we need to start winning matches there.' </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Wenger - We need Old Trafford challenge<br><br>By Richard Clarke<br><br>A trip to Old Trafford is not what most managers would want after a slow start to the Premiership campaign but ArsÃ¨ne Wenger feels his side needs the challenge.<br><br>Arsenal have just two points from three domestic games this season. On each occasion they have found it difficult to break down opponents with entrenched defences. Occasional sloppiness in their own backline has not helped either and WengerÂ’s side have spent much of the time chasing the game.<br><br>However the dynamic will change on Sunday; Manchester United will not sit back at Old Trafford. And that is just the way the Arsenal manager would like it.<br><br>Â“I want to win,Â” he said. Â“I feel it will be a different game to the games we faced until now. At the moment we've played more games agianst teams who try to catch us on the break, refuse to come out and refuse to play. This time it will be a more open game so maybe more interesting for us and for people to watch as well.Â”<br><br>Arguably Arsenal best two performances have come on their European travels. However Wenger refuses to accept it is easier to play away.<br><br>Â“I don't feel like that,Â” he said. Â“But it is interesting to play away from home now in a big game because we just did well in an away game and maybe the challenge is what the team needs at the moment.Â”</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Robben back as big guns prepare to battle<br>Friday, Sep 15, 2006<br><br>As the Premiership gears up for its biggest weekend of the season so far, JosÃ© Mourinho welcomes back Arjen Robben into his squad for the visit of Liverpool.<br><br>On what is being dubbed Â‘Grand Slam SundayÂ’ by broadcasters showing the games live, ChelseaÂ’s match is followed by Man United versus Arsenal as the teams the Chelsea manager expects to finish in the top four go head-to-head.<br><br>Â“I think it is nice,Â” he said looking forward after FridayÂ’s training. Â“I would prefer one game on the Saturday and another game on the Sunday so I could enjoy it by seeing the other game,Â” he smiled, Â“but it is always enjoyable for people who love the game, these big matches between the big teams.<br><br>Â“Chelsea and Liverpool played on Tuesday in the Champions League, Man United and Arsenal played Wednesday so the resting time is exactly the same for the teams that play each other.Â”<br><br>If Chelsea and Man United are both victorious at the weekend then we would be sitting on 12 points, Man U on 15 with Liverpool stuck on 4 points and Arsenal 2.<br><br>Â“And if the opposite happens? Arsenal beat Man United and Liverpool beat us?Â” questioned Mourinho. Â“I think we cannot go with the ifs. It is just the beginning of the season.<br><br>Â“Points are important, especially for the teams that are coming from behind. If they lose again they will start to be in a difficult position, but all four are good teams, all are better this season than last - more players, better players, better solutions Â— I donÂ’t believe after Sunday a loser says it is over for me.Â”<br><br>Joe Cole, who scored in three of the last four Premiership meetings between Chelsea and Liverpool will be kept out of SundayÂ’s home game by his knee injury.<br><br>He attempted a comeback in the closing stages of TuesdayÂ’s game versus Werder Bremen, playing the last ten minutes. That was after injuring knee ligaments in ChelseaÂ’s first pre-season game in America.<br><br>However the player now needs further recovery time before playing again.<br><br>But Mourinho has announced that Arjen Robben will be involved in SundayÂ’s match. He is back in the squad for the first time in three-and-a-half weeks having recovered from a calf problem.<br><br>Mourinho said: Â“I like to play with people wide. I think Robben played a very good game against Man City and after that we were waiting for more but the next game against Middlesbrough, he was injured in the warm-up.<br><br>Â“After that, I was four consecutive matches without him. I like to play with people wide so I need him back. Again we donÂ’t have both Robben and Cole at the same time. But we have one of them.Â”<br><br>Mourinho believes being denied both his most-selected wide players for any game this season is one of the factors that has prevented the side hitting top gear yet.<br><br>Â“It means we havenÂ’t had the chance to use different styles of play during a game,Â” he explains.<br><br>Â“The first problem is to keep our level of performance during 90 minutes, because we played much better against Charlton and Werder Bremen in the first-half than the second-half.<br><br>Â“The second point is about automatic movements Â— like playing with a blindfold.<br><br>Â“You need to know what your fellow players are doing. You need to know when you make a cross and Shevchenko makes his movement, that he goes to this space or he wants the ball in that spot. It is the kind of routines we need.<br><br>Â“Any day, any game, Shevchenko will go there and score two or three goals and is again in a scoring period,Â” Mourinho believes. Â“But we need to work collectively, like we trained today.<br><br>Â“Today we trained like we never did this season before. It was one of the few days we have had to work tactically and on co-ordination in the team. We had a very good session today and next week we will have again two or three days like that because we play Sunday and then Saturday.<br><br>Â“This is the kind of week we need, especially the new players to feel better inside of the team.Â”<br><br>Mourinho gave progress reports on two of those new players Â— Khalid Boulahrouz, right-back for the last three games, and his new left-back, Ashley Cole.<br><br>Â“I know that BoulahrouzÂ’s best position is central defence but we have in Ricardo and JT, two great players for that position, doing very well for us.<br><br>Â“I feel safe by having Boulahrouz in the squad because he gives me protection in case of problems with these two players, but at the same time, defensively he is very, very safe.<br><br>Â“I normally say in relation to this type of player, he is a player of no mistakes. When I say no mistakes, of course sometimes the mistakes will come but overall he is a player that plays very safe in the game. He gives us a lot of security.<br><br>Â“In terms of the group, Ashley Cole is feeling very good. This is an easy place to adapt to. In terms of football, it is not so easy. He played for Arsenal in a certain system and a certain philosophy for a long, long time and I can imagine it is hard to come here and with a click of his fingers, be at his top level. But he is improving and again the work we are doing today has been important.<br><br>Â“We have to wait but while we are doing this work, if we can do it without losing points, that is perfect. If you donÂ’t lose points now and your best time is still to arrive, you can be very positive.Â”</span></div>

I will shake his hand. I prefer to talk about football than these small things. I'll give to him the opportunity to shake hands if he wants. We'll go down there and be his guests on Sunday. At the end of the game, I will wait and see if he offers his hand. If he does, then I'll shake it. Not a problem.<br><br>"For me it's time to finish with this situation. People should be talking about football. We should be talking about things on the pitch, not matters off it."  </span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">RAFA: CHELSEA GAME WON'T DECIDE TITLE<br><br>Steve Hunter 15 September 2006<br><br>Rafael Benitez has dismissed claims that the Chelsea game on Sunday is a must win affair for Liverpool and has insisted there is a long way to go before the Premiership title race is decided.<br>"I'm surprised so many people are saying if we lose, the title will be impossible," claimed a bemused Benitez. "I know if that happens, people will say we have no chance, and if we win they'll say we are in a race. It's still too early for this.<br><br>"Last year we won one of the first six league games but finished the season with 82 points and came third. This time, I wouldn't be surprised if a team with 75 points finished first.<br><br>"The Premiership is much stronger this year and a lot of club have improved. All the top clubs may have more problems.<br><br>"Last season Chelsea won many games, but I don't think it will be so easy for anyone this time. More teams will beat each other, and already some of the top teams are having difficulties at the start of the season.<br><br>"I promise you I am not looking at the table now, after just three games. The time to analyse the table is in another two months, and then you will see how the team is progressing.<br><br>"You never know whether it's a good or bad time to play them until after the game. It's never easy playing two games in a week, but at least we've been able to train with the players, talk to them and analyse things. That's better than our preparations for last week.<br><br>"Maybe after the result in PSV, our confidence is better. It's a big test for us, but we can be sure the motivation of the players going into the game is really good.<br><br>"These are the games the players like to play. They want to show we are strong and improve the results against the top sides in the Premiership.<br><br>"Last season we had problems in the league games against them and we want to do much better.<br><br>"We've done a good job against them in the cup and now we want to do the same in the Premiership. The cup is always different. Both teams know there can be no draw, and it makes a difference to the tactical approach. It's a different type of game in the Premiership, with different problems."  </span></div>

But Mourinho is still waiting for an apology from the Spaniard.<br><br>And asked whether he would accept Benitez's handshake, he replied: "It depends. If it's not with feeling but just to make a nice picture for the cameras, I'm not ready for that.<br><br>"I am not a hypocrite. The values I pass to my children are very direct on that.<br><br>"I don't care what people say or think about the image. I care about the human feelings.<br><br>"If the feeling is positive and he realises that in the past some comments should not have been made, I'm more than ready to shake his hand.<br><br>"If I go home and say, 'I made one or two comments about Benitez I shouldn't have' and he does the same, there are no reasons to have a bad relationship.<br><br>"Then in the tunnel, away from the cameras, we shake hands, maybe hug, speak two or three minutes and it's over and done. But, if we are hypocrites, we don't speak in the tunnel or even look at each other but go out and shake hands in front of everybody.<br><br>"Then the next day everyone says that Mourinho and Benitez are very good friends. But I am not the man for that."<br><br>Mourinho is not exactly losing sleep over his popularity and admitted: "The managers I like, I care about. If one of those guys goes to the Press and makes negative comments about me, I will be sad.<br><br>"But I don't really care about the people I only know because I see them for two minutes before a game.<br><br>"When I don't like somebody it's because I know him very well. So I cannot dislike other managers if I meet them maybe five times in my life.<br><br>"There is either a mutual respect or one of us has said something that has broken that respectful relationship. But this is not about Mourinho against Benitez. We've never had a direct personal confrontation.<br><br>"There were some words, some interviews, that were not nice but he should not be worried about that."<br><br></span></div>

The build-up, the atmospheres, the individual battles that can happen on the pitch, the history between the clubs.<br><br>"It all adds to it. In recent seasons it has warmed up on the pitch and, off the pitch, there is always added spice."<br><br>Ferdinand's personal favourite came two seasons ago in North London.

A few of their players had something to say, Roy Keane had something to say and then we went out and did the business."<br><br>We have had the Battle of Highbury, the Battle of Old Trafford and even the Battle of the Buffet.

I only found out the other week it was Cesc Fabregas who threw the Pizza!"<br><br>victory over Arsenal tomorrow will leave them 13 points ahead of the Gunners.<br><br>But Ferdinand has a word of warning. He said: "We got off to a great start last season and then stuttered.<br><br>"For me a good start is 10 or 15 games unbeaten, not just four or five wins at the start. That is what we have to aim for."<br><br>Having said that, Ferdinand accepts United are a better bet for lifting the title this season than last.<br><br>He said: "There is a greater cohesiveness about the team this time around. The maturity in the squad makes you believe something can happen this season.<br><br>"Players have taken more responsibility on their shoulders and are warming to that." </span></div>
