Used to have an abundance of good strong centre-forwards at one time (Shearer, Fowler, Teddy, Scholes (striker/midfielder), Owen).<br><br>Its hard for Rooney to play alone cos he plays his best off another fellow striker. His performance in Portgual 2004 was great because of the foil which Owen provided.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Base on Owen record, he should be an out and out striker but the goal coming from him is lesser and lesser for country and for club.<br><br>A player need to improve, someone had said Rooney style of playing I think it is even more easier for pro to understand him and more easier to handle him.<br><br>The mind set for England team need to change.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a good player not only must have good skills but have sportsmanship as well, i dont see rooney anywhere near this. a good striker scores goals and is consistent in most of the matches.. since people are making such a hoo ha out of him why doesnt our mr "best player of england" perform?<br><br>i guess ppl are living in the world of epl now. totally oblivious of whats going on around the world. them thinking of rooney playing so well in the epl and in the end gets pwned by other countries. time to know who is torres, villa, podolski, messi guys...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The thing about rooney is that he thinks he is that damn good so much so that he even got the balls to scold beckham for not performing well when he himself sucked. he needs to know how to play football properly, he needs to improve even further. henry used to be like him until he started to improve and now he is one of the most complete guys around, head, corner kicks, free kicks, solo goals, simple goals he can all do. rooney needs to wake up his idea or else jermaine defoe would score more goals than him to be the number one striker around</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lionel messi was out for 3 months with a thigh injury but he came back in the last 15 minutes to score 1 and create 1 against serbia<br><br>totti was only 70 percent fit as declared by himself but he was inspirational in guiding italy so far.<br><br>rooney had 7 weeks for a minor injury to his smallest of metatarsal to recover which he himself said was onlly painful for 5 days after the incident and was already walking and running thereafter. He played and played and i have seen nothing but WWE action from him in stamping on someone's penis and push ronaldo IN FRONT of the referee. it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure just how looney that was and that caused england to suffer with 10 men. Who knows with 11 men they could have scored 1 crucial goal but no, mr incredible hulk had to ruin it by becmoing stone cold steve austin in front of the referee. Before he demands respect, he must respect others.<br><br>Beckham may be one-dimensional but there is no doubt that he is up there with the best when it comes to freekicks and corners. He works hard out there and you can see it in his eyes that he really wants england to go through not becasue of his goals but with his effort. The guy played on with dehydration against ecuador and despite being a veteran of 3 world cups, he got himself lectured by rooney for not performing well when he himself has been playing rubbish soccer. Where is the respect from rooney for beckham?<br><br>when he was substituted in one match, he threw childish tantrums, kicking bottles, punching walls. Is this the behaviour of someone who is a professional??Does he impy that he is untouchable and should never be substituted when he has been ineffective???<br><br>There are many questions about rooney but i am sorry to say, he is a good footballer full stop.nothing more or less. He is not up there with torres, klose and not even in francisco fonseca's league. He can never be because he is too stubborn to know his limits. Eric cantona is allowed to be arrogant because he works hard off and on the field and is damn good. Any man u fan can tell u that cantona was well-known for staying behind for an hour to practise even more after every training session. His skills make manchester united into what it is today and rooney is no cantona</div>
