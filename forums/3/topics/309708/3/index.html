              <p>a best diver would be one who dives and gets the call from the ref. so following this logic, C Ronaldo is not the best diver, but however, he is a famous diver because of his skills,tricks and mainly his first season in the EPL.</p>
              <p>that being said, he has cut down on it a lot this season and he i don't think that it is a coincidence that he good run of form has come at a time when he hasn't dived so much. besides the thing bout Ronaldo is that he tends to go to ground too easily when slight contact is made last time, not the real dive like what pires did before.</p>

              <p><br>If you had bothered to listen instead of being so fixed on your agenda, you would have realised what I was really against. This post of yours only proves what I say about you and those other people out there.</p>
              <p>And it's not just in the soccer forums that you are like that, that is how you conduct yourself in other parts of sgforums as well.</p>
              <p>You are the one setting yourself against anyone who doesn't agree with your agenda, no matter how hypocrtical it is.</p>
              <p>I tried to tell you nicely and I gave you lots of chance to understand, and to think you even dared say you consider me a friend. Even though I knew how shallow and how meaningless is the word 'friend' to you, I respected you and gave you way just because you said it. I knew you didn't mean what you say, so I gave you chance to understand.</p>
              <p>But apparently, all that matters is your agenda and the people you want to go against. Friends are just people you make use of to get at people. I may have been angry with you before in the past, but now I despise you. Touch your own conscience (if it isn't eaten by dogs) and think about it.</p>
              <p>You can be anti-Man U, anti-Chelsea, anti-Arsenal, it's the way you conduct yourself. Acting gentlemanly and claiming you stand for this, you are against that. Pui!</p>
