            <div class='col-md body'>JOSE MOURINHO has stoked up his bitter rivalry with Liverpool by writing off their chances of snatching ChelseaÂ’s title.<br><br>The Blues boss still bristles when anyone mentions their Champions League semi-final defeat at Anfield in May 2005 and last seasonÂ’s FA Cup semi-final KO.<br><br>But while Mourinho believes Rafa BenitezÂ’s Kop aces are capable of posing a threat, he fears Manchester United and Arsenal MORE.<br><br>And he put the boot in even further when he insisted the Gunners and United play BETTER football and have invested wisely in quality players.<br><br>United this week finally landed Michael Carrick from Spurs in an Â£18.6million swoop while Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has added Â£6.8m buy Tomas Rosicky to his impressive group of hungry youngsters.<br><br>Mourinho said: Â“I still believe Man United and Arsenal will, in spite of the fact Arsenal finished fourth and Liverpool third, still be the better teams.<br><br>Â“The quality of their football, the way they play, the improvements in their squads, it all adds up.<br><br>Â“United will improve a lot by having Michael Carrick. HeÂ’s a very, very good player and he will improve them.<br><br>Â“United have had some problems since Roy Keane went to Celtic but they have already a very good team.<br><br>Â“They donÂ’t need to go out and buy 10 new players to improve their team, they just choose the right players for the right position.<br><br>Â“I think itÂ’s the right choice to get Carrick. HeÂ’s a big improvement for them and I think they can be a very strong team.<br><br>Â“Arsenal were not successful in the Premiership. But you can say they had success because they reached the final of the Champions League playing very good football.<br><br>Â“They have a very good group of players and some young players with great motivation. Rosicky is also a very important player for them and can bring them the right kind of quality.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t want to compare Rosicky to Dennis Bergkamp because Bergkamp was more than special.<br><br>Â“But there is no doubt Rosicky can bring that kind of quality to the left side.<br><br></div>

Cannot base on these kinds of matches to gauge.<br><br>Anyway, all these teams will be strong, Man u, Liverpool, Arsenal and maybe also spurs... to be honest i don't think any team can really beat Chelsea to the championship... unless they lose Gallas.

I think its because Kenyon must have told him his style is making (Kenyon's job tought in trying to make chelsea a popular club in the world) because Chelsea have become the most hated club not only in England but also in Europe with his problems with Barce, the accusing of referees and throwing their money around but still got friends lah, he still got a few in Sam Allardyce of Bolton &amp; Alan Curbishley of Charlton. They said he is a nice guy.<br><br>Anyway, I also can't stand his arrogant behaviour but dislike him for whatever reasons you still have to give him credit for making chelsea a winning team.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool striker Peter Crouch has laughed off Jose Mourinho's comments that the Reds won't be involved in next season's title challenge.<br><br>Mourinho believes only Arsenal and Manchester United will be capable of taking Chelsea on but that's exactly the kind of attitude the Reds want to hear.<br><br>Crouch said: "We haven't said a single thing about Chelsea and have been concentrating solely on ourselves.<br><br>"If Mourinho is talking about us again, we're obviously on his mind. We're confident when the season starts we'll show what we're about.<br><br>"How many teams in the Premiership will be playing with two out-and-out wingers this season?<br><br>"We've got some of the best passers of the ball in the world, never mind the Premiership. There are no better passers than Steven Gerrard and Xabi Alonso and everything we do at the club is all about receiving the ball and playing a good style."</div>

They are slowly exposing their weakness at the back.</div>
