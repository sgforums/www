No one wins forever, no dynasty last forever.<br><br>I guess now u chelsea fans have to specfiy when u start supporting chelsea, if not they will say u guys are glory hunters. Hmm wonder those who are critising the current glory hunters (new chelsea fans) are glory hunters them selves, those glory hunters from the Treble Man Utd time or even those from the 80s liverpool time or some 49 games unbeaten Arsenal fans? Remember guys, there are also alot of chelsea fans whom supported chelsea during the zola period (before abramovic period), dont be a stereotype and classfy all chelsea fans as GLORY HUNTERS or ARROGANT. I am not a chelsea fan, but i felt its unfair to some of the true chelsea fans out there. What if it is you, think about it..Just because your friends or the media or some pundits hate chelsea doesnt mean you have to jump on the bandwagon.<br><br>Is it the current fashion to hate chelsea, your friends hate them you dont hate you lose out ?

Kevin Keegan brought to the EPL ?<br><br>5-0 whipping of United at St. james ? Phillipe Albert scoring the final nail of coffin ? Flamboyant Ginola ? Controversial Asprilla ?

Souness isn't the right man to lead Newcastle to any sort of success... and with Alan Shearer around.. it seems like he is the one picking the team, not the manager.. afterall he is/was the Golden Boy of English Football..<br><br>As for best team arguement.. i dun think there is any point arguing over it.. Any team can beaten on any day.. Just because you have won the Champions League, doesn't mean that you are the best team in Europe.. but alot of Liverpool fans dun get that...<br><br>Chelski was the most consistent team in the EPL last season, therefore they were definite worthy winners... and this season too (or so it seems)..<br>but the greatest fear is whether any team can even put up a challenge against the cash-rich Chelski and Motivator Mourinho ...<br>Currently it seems like not even the Professor or Sir Hairdryer can mount any sort of title challenge..<br><br>United We Stand  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>anyway, apart from some other oversea good teams,a potential candidate maybe chelsea itself if they get too cocky for their own good.That is when individuals start to become selfish,go for personal glory and stuff.</div>

How many good players they have currently?

            <div class='col-md body'>should not take nation into consideration as chelsea is only a club but they are sure can compare against the like of the nations listed by you guyz but it highly unlikely nation would face club in any competition @ all @ most only friendly that all..........................<br><br>Juventus and Bayern Munich And Ac Milan And Barcelona and Real Madrid seems to be the only possible candidate to beat chelsea.....</div>
