Flood midfield and defence. Get everyone behind the ball. Play counter-attack.<br><br>The fact is in EPL, no one can hope to challenge their strength in-depth. Liverpool lost because they went up to attack (like an entertaining team should) but got caught cold by the speed and precision of Chelski's breaks.<br><br>All it takes is for the next few teams to stifle their play, crowd the ball out, get a few 0-0 draws and get Jose mourinho rattled, complaining on how teams play defensive etc etc, bump the team abit and then they will start to lose.<br><br>European teams that could beat them include AC Milian, Juve, Barca etc</div></blockquote>Yeah..
