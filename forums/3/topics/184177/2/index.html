            <div class='col-md body'>well  wenger couldn't groom pennant properly...<br><br>and its well known that he doesn't really fancy english players,cuz they aren't technical enough for his team which requires alotta flair and not so much of the physical side of the game..<br><br>matthew upson is another one..<br><br>now i'm just waiting to see whether theo walcott will make it or join the long list of wasted english talents at highbury..</div>
