All they want to do is contain the damage and prevent arsenal from playing their passes.<br><br>But fact of the matter is we didnt play pompey which means we had 9 days of rest and the other teams we played in the EPL were struggling. We still have to stand the test of Man U and aston villa upcoming.<br>But we still pwned juve last nite.<br><br>P.S. Proud to be a gooner fan.</div>

You are a youngster and u want to play first team football when there are more experienced vets around...Its their own choice then...<br><br>Wright is a perfect example..I see a future for him back then when all he had to do was learn his trade from seaman and prove himself when the chance come. And that chances do come, seaman will eventually leave arsenal...Impatience..I bet terry wasnt whining when leboeuf and desailly were hogging the centre back roles...<br><br>A short playing career...Guess thats whats stopping players from waiting for their chance and therefore waste the opportunities..</div></blockquote>It depends on the manager as well, whether he can explain his plans to his young players.

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Another Syrprise win for Arsenal. I feel that Arsenal is becoming more of Liverpool. I think that if they carry on like this, they might win the Champions League. They're playing style is the same as when they 1st became chapions. But I have 2 admit that Juventus did not poise much threat.</div>
