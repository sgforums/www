He doesn't appeal to any England fans that I know!<br><br>Chelsea supporters will disagree, of course. Top tip if you've never been to Stamford Bridge, don't get a seat behind the goal. We did it once and me mate Tony Thompson got right on the end of a Fat Frank special. Thirty rows back he was.<br><br>Take a seat on either side of the pitch instead - sure you're in danger from a Shevchenko special if you're there but he won't be playing much next season so I reckon you're safe.<br><br>On to Talinn we go to face Estonia. Frank says we fans must be patient 'cos Estonia are far better than Andorra. What, better than a bunch of amateur hill farmers and hackers who play the game as if you get to cash the ref's cards in at the end of the match?<br><br>I said to the missus we had to be able to beat them Estonians. She warned me that public schoolboys are dead good at sport. Be a very lame joke if it weren't true. Bless 'er.<br><br>Estonia is a tiny country with a crap football team. It'd be harder to turn a mattress over. Stop bleating, Lam!<br><br>The astute ones among you may have twigged that I'm not Frank's biggest fan at the minute, although I have to say I find all<br>the booing a bit juvenile. Still, if all else fails there's a bright future for the lad in panto.<br><br>Any road, Becks is back - back for good by the looks of things, like Take That God help us - and you know that England are at least going to create some old-style chances.<br><br>It'll be a performance from the Eriksson days - tepid, predictable, downright annoying but saved by a Beckham free-kick and an Owen toe-poke. 2-0 says I.<br><br>But when we come back from our summer holidays, McClaren, and your not so doughty lieutenant, Tel, can you do three things, PLEASE?!<br><br>1. Never pick Phil Nev again.<br>2. Bench Frank and leave Gerrard to do the meaningful stuff.<br>3.

            <div class='col-md body'>comment by tom7573<br><br>posted 50 Minutes Ago<br><br>right what people have got to get is that we dont need a player sitting infront of the back four. England have enough world class centre backs to handle the strongest attacks. As to the whole lamps and gerrard thing i agree with most of the nation, get rid of lamps, hes is in no way a better attcking player then stevie. Bring in a more solid midfielder like scott parker, maybe that will give gerrard the allowance to make forward runs, without compramising the rest of midfield. As for the front two against Estonia, in a 4-4-2 formation, it should, in my opinion, owen and crouch. crouch has shown that he has a great touch and you can hoof the ball to him when there backs are against the wall. And could someone please tell me why david james has been overlooked for the england squad again. hes played alot better then robinson this season, and hasnt shown any sights of his clamity james counter part. thankyou for alowing me to rant bbc, xxx</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>comment by Rafa Beniteth<br><br>posted 50 Minutes Ago<br><br>Me and a mate were talking about Lampard on Friday during the match - we both agreed that before he was one of Eriksson/McLaren's "untouchables" - i.e. when he actually had a point to prove, he was in brilliant form for England. This also roughly co-incided with Chelsea being bought by Abramovich and going on their mad initial spending spree - and Lampard subsequently upping his game and not only keeping the new arrivals at bay but managing to stay in the starting 11 for god knows how many consecutive games.<br><br>So he's fundamentally a good player who's good at what he does, he just needs a good old-fashioned kick up the backside, and with the combined benefits of better balance for the team (assuming we play 4-4-2) - he needs to be dropped from the starting 11, and I don't mean some grand jesture of exile like Beckham's, just dropped for a few games, benched, whatever, but he needs to learn to fight for his England place, like everyone else should for that matter.</div>

A few of them like Gerrard, the defence and becks are still brilliant in recent times but we havent really seen games where they realy imposed their authority on.Hargreaves looks to be promising but havent realy seen his club form yet..<br><br>Anyhow i think England really damn strange.Their national league boasts of the fastest and most exciting style of playing but why didn the current England team capitalize on that? They need to have a unique style like what top national teams have - Eg Holland and Total football, Brazil and Samba style, Italians and their famed defence...</div>

Put enough big names in and you just might win it. That's what fans and 3rd rate coaches do.<br><br>A good international coach must be willing to drop big names and choose players that fit his playing philosphy. Look at Sir Alf Ramsey, England's World Cup winning gaffer. he dropped some big names and changed his team to bring the best out of the available crop.<br><br>Whatever it is, it is glaringly obvious that unless someone like Allardyce becomes England manager, things stay stagnant. Worse if McClown stays where he is.<br></div></blockquote>agree wif u. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
