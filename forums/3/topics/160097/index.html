            <div class='col-md body'>Man Utd great players like scholes, keane, giggs, gary are growing up into their 30s, credit to them for bringing successes to man u in the 90s and early 2001 and  2003 (last league title) and 2004 (fa cup).<br><br>yet replacements for keane is alan smith and klberson was sold to benfica so hastily. where are the present replacement players for keane and scholes? I can understand ronaldo and park / richardson are the replacements for becks and giggs, where are the central midfielders to replace keane n scholes for the long term? dun tell me its fletcher? where are the youth players from the reserves? SAF needed to buy quality midfielders to replace keane n scholes, yet he bought djemba and klberson who were flops.<br><br>Man U weakest link is in midfield. cant bear to see the sight of keane n scholes rotting in midfield now, after all, they were splendid in the 90s.<br><br>I am afraid Man u might follow the path of liverpool after they last won the title in 1990. failure to replace barnes, rush, nicol were their downfall.<br>I am afraid the same will follow man u, unless SAF buy big on midfield.<br>chelsea midfielders r the best in epl, maybe one of the best in the world 2.<br><br>what do u think?<br><br></div>

I felt Man Utd might even play like a wounded animal next week, and who knows might pull off a victory against them, remember Man Utd is a master of playing against big English teams? But a victory over Chelsea doesnt really mean anything because when big team play against big team, the result might go either way. But certainly it will give them a confidence lift.<br><br>I felt Man Utd wont be like liverpool, once rooney and ronaldo become more older and more experienced they will be strong again. But currently maybe they will be like Arsenal, too many young players in the first team, and no one to replace influential players like Keane and Scholes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Man U is in a decline? U can say that. But u can look at it another way. Man U is actually stagnant. In recent years, which world class player has arrived at Man U? Wayne Rooney, Ruud, and maybe, Edwin Van Der Sar. That's all. but it didn't help them much, because it is in the midfield where they need reinforcements. Ronaldo, Park Ji Sung, Paul Scholes, Darren Fletcher, Kieran Richardson and Roy Keane don't really inspire fear in the opposition. Teams like Chelsea have a world class midfield. Makelele, Lampard, Essien, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Joe Cole, Damien Duff, Arjen Robben to choose from. That is the midfield any team in the world would want.<br><br>And then, there is chelsea factor. Man U, Arsenal have fought each other way too long, that they didn't expect the emergence of Chelsea last season. Now, u see Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson spend a lot of time in the press trying to talk about Chelsea, rather than worry about their own team. Mourinho, in contrast, cared more about his own team, than bothering to respond to them. Arsenal and Man U spent too much team worrying about Chelsea, that they forgot about other teams. It affected the players, and that's why Man U/Arsenal are now losing to teams like Blackburn, Boro, West Brom.<br><br>Man U needs two more midfield players, preferably guys in the mould of Ballack or Vieria, who can create chances and plug the defensive holes. But even then, it may not amount to anything this season, as it seems a foregone conclusion that Chelsea is running away with the league title. But next season, if they can learn not to let chelsea affect them, and sign a few new players, things may change.</div>
