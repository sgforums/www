            <div class='col-md body'>Ahhh..was furious with spurs man.... I guess there was nothing wrong with the 1st goal...By "right"..play should go on since the ref did not stop play..But often players shows sportmanship in the way that they would let players receive treatment and not exploit injuries to opponents.<br><br>But  the game is often played the "left" way and i would be sure that arsenal would kick the ball out of play in that situation. Look against villareal...<br>But no excuses...Wenger gambled on a weakened team and that decision would prove to be costly should arsenal not win the CL.<br><br>Henry though pulled 1 back but we all know that a point is just not good enough and spurs will continue to hold the intiative. But arsenal come on...U have gotta keep henry... EPL would not be complete next season w/o u....</div>
