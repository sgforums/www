            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea and England midfielder Frank Lampard is almost certain to be included in the squad to face struggling Watford on Saturday.<br><br>Lampard had the fractured bone in his wrist examined by club doctors on Thursday and with modern, light-plaster protection at such an advanced stage, the midfielder should have no problems in getting the cast accepted by the match official.<br><br>Chelsea have been boosted by further good news on the injury front ahead of their trip to Vicarage Road.<br><br>Michael Essien, who hurt his knee at home to Tottenham in the FA Cup quarter-final at Stamford Bridge, is now running again but the Watford clash may come too early for the player to make his return.<br><br>England left-back Wayne Bridge, who underwent surgery on his knee two weeks ago, is also back running and will be available within the next week.<br><br>The defender said: "The knee is not bad. It is as good as it can be. It feels okay.<br><br>"A few people have been back in three weeks so hopefully I can match that or beat it."<br><br>But the biggest slice of good news for Jose Mourinho concerned England midfielder Joe Cole.<br><br>Cole has been out for most of the season with a host of injuries - the worst of which turned out to be a broken foot.<br><br>Cole underwent surgery to cure the problem and has since returned to training as he attempts to meet his early April target for a comeback.<br><br>Cole had a scan on his foot on Monday and specialists revealed the broken bone in his foot has now completely healed.<br><br>His last appearance was as a substitute at Manchester United on November 26 but he is now weeks away from a return to action.<br><br>Chelsea took the opportunity to rest Michael Ballack, Mikel John Obi, Geremi and top scorer Didier Drogba.<br><br>None of those players were involved in international duties after the weekend but Mourinho told them not to return to training until Thursday.<br><br><span style="color: red;">you guys think my fav. best Midfielder was being dropped instead of really injured during the last England game? did the manager try to save face for Lampard? if it is then it really showed how bo lan par the manager is..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </span></div>

Here was what I said in the other topic.<br><br><blockquote><br>To take things into perspective, it was Andorra afterall. A team England should beat easily no matter the team they put it out. Credit still to Gerrard for being hardworking and getting the two goals, but overall for the team, they did end the first half 0 - 0, and overall, it was still a below par performance by England.<br><br>I'm not saying Gerrard isn't good, in fact I pretty much agree with your points. I'm just saying the result of this last match is inconclusive in confirming this Gerrard or Lampard debate.<br><br>What would really make or break would be when the team faces strong opposition.</blockquote>Note the post might still be appropriate for the ohter thread.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree with 798. Crouch is in a rich vein of form now too. Should give him a try ahead of AJ and defoe in the next match. But is till think lamps shouldn play.</div>

Most of the time the ball are float into the box waitin for rooney n AJ to challange it. Is this their type of game???  Its juz like playin all the ground passes to crouch n expect him to perform.<br></div>
