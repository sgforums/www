No two ways about it. It is how we leverage on these FTs.<br><br>One extreme is the Singapore Slingers, and one is the bowling or Sailing team.<br>Just for example.<br><br>Now, the FTs are incorporated into the Singapore team based on certain criteria.

            <div class='col-md body'>i rather save the money we spend on foreign players in sports and distribute it among citizens. foreign coaches are okay, to bring in the necessary experience to pass it on to our players. we should be winning games with our own people, someone who has experience and live the good and bads of this country, like coming here at an age of 2 to 6 years, rather than any older.<br><br>i think sg got to put more effort in bringing up the standards in the sporting arena. sports have to begin at a very young age. the sports school seriously will do little help at this point of time. but then again i'm not sure about this, i think the sports school is occupied by a number of young foreign athletes. if this is true, there are so many local borned s'poreans wanting to get in the school but can't. its like the doors are wider for foreigners than local people.<br><br>in conclusion, i feel its still a team international,     for now.<br><br>don't flame me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't see the need to blame FTs for our so-called lack of talent.<br><br>Truth be told Singaporean soceity does not really set itself up for sporting excellence, and taking up sports as a full time calling is still not well reconized. It's like we want to medals, but yet think it's prehaps not so wise to do what it takes to get it.<br><br>Hopefully things will change in the future, as sports take a stronger foothold in Singaporean culture. Leaving the M-League was a huge leap backwards for Singaporean soccer, who knows where we would be if we didn't all degenerate into kumpung soccer all those years back. But things are once again back on track.<br><br>Personally I do not see the issue with FTs... given more or less a lot of us are decendents of FTs who came here to seek a better life. That's one part of Singapore that shouldn't change, that we offer an opportunity to other people to come here and join our unique way of life (with all it's ups and downs). I would be opposed however, to the glorification and hype of FTs, and certainly would not approve the promotion of FTs at the expense of locals (and sometimes that is an issue)... but going to the other extreme of wanting to see only true born Singaporeans dominate all fields before it's counted for Singapore is a mistake in the opposite direction, and prehaps also a slap in the face for those who have put their sweat and soul by casting their lot with us.</div>

However, lately he has been such a disgrace to us..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>players have their ups and downs. we cannot expect the players to be playing at their best form all the time..</div>

Singapore are strong at set-pieces. It's all part of Raddy's gameplan. Raddy always formulate different tactics for different matches, instead of sticking to the same players all the time. If the coach has faith in him, that means he's good enough.</div>
