            <div class='col-md body'>hi. im new here.. anyway i really wanted to noe why singaporeans dislike the foreign athletes so much..<br><br>cos i hate it when ppl talk about our national soccer team and how it consist of so many foreigners. pls, don't call them foreigners. they are Singaporeans, just like u and me. just because they are of a different race, a different skin colour, or that their names don't consist of Tan or Mohd doesn't mean they are not Singaporean enough. Let's face it. Singapore is a cosmopolitan city. why isit that we can be happy with the foreign construction workers contributing to our economy but not foreign singaporeans increasing the standards of singapore soccer. i looked thru the papers recently and i found several comments on how we can be proud of our soccer team when it consists of so many foreigners.<br><br>1 thing i noticed, everytime our soccer team get thru to the semis or finals of some competition, these ppl will come out to criticise that our soccer team consist of so many foreigners and therefore not Singaporean enough. Whenever the team flops, these ppl will again criticise the team for having so many foreigners and yet not make the cut. What is this debate about whether we can be proud of our soccer team or not? Would u seriously be proud of a team that wins nothing? If not for these foreigners, would you see a 55,000 capacity crowd in the national stadium? Would we even be in the finals of the ASEAN cup? It can be said that some of these foreigners are lured here by the prospects of a better future and more importantly cash incentives. But we must admit that these foreigners have in a positive way contributed to the soccer standards of Singapore.. it would also benefit our "pure-bred" players to be training with these foreigners. So why not lets take it that we are buying their talents to help improve the standards of soccer in Singapore and also to help us win something.<br><br>However, Singapore really cannot rely heavily on these FTs in the long run. Who knows when they might just take our money and disappear. afterall, Singapore is not their motherland. when there are better opportunities elsewhere, they might just leave us for them. So we really have to breed our own, home-grown talents. These foreigners would help by letting young talented Singaporeans play at a higher standard. This would also help in the development of sports in Singapore. The sports school is a big step forward into creating a better enviroment for talented young Singaporeans, but dun expect the effects to be seen immediately. So till then we'll just have to wait and continue supporting team singapore and not be so myopic and complain about how some of our athletes are not born here.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>as much as we would like our entire singapore team to be purely singaporeans..but those foreigh talent had made a name for themselves here n they deserve our respect.they ARE SINGAPOREANS NOW.Daniel bennet,mustafic for eg,they've done well n contributed for sgp's cause...<br>n if u look at our international teams,take for eg.FRANCE.when ppl think of france the perception u get is that they are handsome men and pretty women all with the white skin,but if u look at their national team,how many whites u get?almost the whole team is dark color,cause most of these players are frm adpoted countires by france,colony in africa...algeria,senegal,watever it is..patrick vieira was frm senegal,the great zidane was frm algeria..many others too....makelele,gallas,trezeguet,saha...all dark colored skin..maybe some of u can enlighten us with their birth land...<br>and everytime we see players with double nationalities choosing their adopted country to play for..bablabla on and on<br><br>so.peace out.ACCEPT IT.HONOUR THEM.<br>SUPPORT THEM!!!!BEAT THE THAIs!!PLAYING THEIR KAMPONG SOCCER!</div>

If the next step is to have these foreign talents to influence and teach the younger generation on how to improve and such, then yes, I can definitely accept it and would say it's a good step for now. However, if the next step is to continue to do it this way, by always taking in FTs to solve problems, then it's a big NO for me. There will come a day when eventually there will be 11 "established first, then converted Singaporean" imports starting our games. Some of you may be ok to accept this outcome, but definitely not for me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It all depends on the heartware.<br><br>Frankly I have no issues with FTs as long as they eventually settle down and become truly Singaporeans. I mean for now there's a lot of talk about them running away after the cash has been paid and all that but is this really true for ALL of them? What about those who truly believe in playing for Singapore and becoming Singaporeans in the end?<br><br>We should not fault these FTs for playing for us and their victories are every much ours as well... and we need to remember that a lot of us are decendents of FTs as well as our forefathers came here to seek a better life.<br><br>I don't think we would like it if the mainland Chinese treat us Singaporean Chinese (or India Indians to Singaporean Indians for that matter) as if we owe them something because we still "belong" to them. In culture... yes... but one must know about nation as well.<br><br>So by all means, criticize certain policies that one sees as unfair, but lets not tar all FTs by the same brush and make them jump through more hoops just to prove their "Singaporeaness", or downplay the sucesses they have achieved for us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actully, I dont consider them foreigners.<br><br>Tell me, how many of us have parents or grandparents who are 100% local? Maybe 1% of us.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by club18:</div><div class="quote_body">hi. im new here.. anyway i really wanted to noe why singaporeans dislike the foreign athletes so much..<br><br>cos i hatethru to the semis or finals of some competition, these ppl will come out to criticise that our soccer team consist of so many foreigners and therefore not Singaporean enough. Whenever the team flops, these ppl will again criticise the team for having so many foreigners and yet not make the cut. What is this debate about whether we can be proud of our soccer team or not? Would u seriously be proud of a team that wins nothing? If not for these foreigners, would you see a 55,000 capacity crowd in the national stadium? Would we even be in the finals of the ASEAN cup? It can be said that some of these foreigners are lured here by the prospects of a better future and more importantly cash incentives. But we must admit that these foreigners have in a positive way contributed to the soccer standards of Singapore.. it would also benefit our "pure-bred" players to be training with these foreigners. So why not lets take it that we are buying their talents to help improve the standards of soccer in Singapore and also to help us win something.<br><br>However, Singapore really cannot rely heavily on these FTs in the long run. Who knows when they might just take our money and disappear. afterall, Singapore is not their motherland. when there are better opportunities elsewhere, they might just leave us for them. So we really have to breed our own, home-grown talents. These foreigners would help by letting young talented Singaporeans play at a higher standard. This would also help in the development of sports in Singapore. The sports school is a big step forward into creating a better enviroment for talented young Singaporeans, but dun expect the effects to be seen immediately. So till then we'll just have to wait and continue supporting team singapore and not be so myopic and complain about how some of our athletes are not born here.<br></div></blockquote></div>
