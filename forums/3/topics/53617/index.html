            <div class='col-md body'>Different types of exercise suits different ppl. For me, cycling burns a lot fat from me liao. And generally speaking, aerobic exercises like running, cycling, walking are very effective for losing fat. Weight lifting sure burns fats, but i hear that such fat burning is more localized and less effective, as weight training helps to tone the muscles not so much in burning fat. For example, if u r going to fo nothing but push ups as your only exercise, you're probably going to have nice looking arms and shoulders, but you belly will only show modest progress. I'm a sportsman myself.<br><br>I'm not saying that weight training is no good, but prioritize your exercise routine by having more aerobic exercises like running, swimming etc. Couple with some decent weight training will build up your muscles. Another reason on my emphasis on aerobic exercises is that it's fat burning effectiveness is more general than localized as weight training does.<br><br>Lastly, you may wish to EXCLUDE fat burning products from your list. Not because they don't help, but they have bad side effects in the long run. I used Xenadrine when i was training during the army and swimming. Only to find the drug affected my mental health. This is so as these products usually contain stimulants that arouses your aggressiveness and makes you want to exercise more, therefore helps burn more fat.<br><br>Ultimately, you have to weigh the price you have to pay for the desired effects against the consequences.

Xenadrine is less popular than hydroxycut. my friend take and the side effect at the beginning is faster heartbeat niah.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hydroxcut and Xenadrine are very similar products. I remembered when i first tried Xenadrine, i've compared it to Hydroxcut also. Ingredients are essentially the same. The faster heartbeat is due to the stimulants. If i'm not mistaken, one capsule of this equates to a few cups of Expresso. If ppl can bear the consequences, i don't why one should avoid. I only advise against it because of the side effects. Should consult a neuropsychiatrist if anyone need further explaination on the effects.<br><br>As a personal comment, a natural method of light dieting, comprising a little of Atkin's method of reducing carbo-intake, increasing (slightly) in protein-intake while maintaining fat-intake.<br><br>Reducing carb, would help to burn fat because blood sugar levels would drop a little, meaning less energy running. In exercise, the fat stores would be used, thus helps to lose weight. With exercise, muscles are repeatedly worn and torn (inevitably), increasing protein intake can help replace and repair cells and tissues. Same goes for fat, but increasing intake would then be counterproductive since per gram of fat yields more energy than carbo. But not reducing its intake is to maintain a similar diet pattern as before. A big change causes the yo-yo effect. By making small changes to diet, it is more feasible, but also takes quite a long time to achieve significant weight loss. Fast results mean fast change; as fast as you lose weight, just as fast you gain them all back. Fats are also the building block for cell membranes, hormones. Reducing fat intake is also counterproductive.<br><br>Above all, supplements are not cheap; even when they clinically proven, nothing beats supplement in it's natural form. In case you all also don't know. Vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals (plant chemicals, and i don't mean pesticides), and others work together and are usually interdependant to become effective.<br><br>Commerical supplements usually isolate chemicals and combine with other "fat burning" chemicals and therefore comes with huge price tags. I don't think it is worth it, besides, it also lowers the morale of those who really wish to lose weight when they spend up to hundreds and hundreds, when there's always a cheaper alternative.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no offence to those who recommended the products, but I'm of the school of thought that advocates exercise over change in diet (cause i'm greedy  and ill-disciplined  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> )<br><br>Cardio combined wif ab exercises are the best solution IMO. Ab exercises like sit-ups, cruches, leg-raises, side twists, all work well in toning the centre when combined wif lotsa cardio. Dats why u see the muay thai exponents wif toned bods, since their workouts usually consist of hellish cardio with innumerous abs exercises<br><br>But one shld not expect immediate results. When I started working out, I got disappointed and nearly quit since i was putting in tons of effort, yet I felt that there wasn't anything to show for. However, i hung on and now i'm starting to feel good.<br><br>ps: My bod type is also the skinny around but a lil 'weak' arnd the abs</div>
