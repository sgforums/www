The Portuguese winker has vowed never to return to Manchester United.<br><br>And he wants boss Fergie to agree his sale as soon as possible so he can link up with Real without having to show his face in Manchester.<br><br>The United boss wants to drag Ronaldo into Old Trafford and give him the mother of all rollickings and tell him: YouÂ’re going nowhere!<br><br>Sources close to Ronaldo in Portugal revealed the player is willing to go on strike to force through his exit and Ferguson must understand it is impossible for him to go back now.<br><br>Ronaldo thinks it is unsafe to return to England because of vendettas against him for his role in getting United team-mate Wayne Rooney sent off at the World Cup.<br><br>The starÂ’s Cheshire home was targeted by vandals and he fears further revenge attacks.

When Owen got injured, Erricson chose to go wif one up front, which btw Rooney is not suited for, and dis added to fustrations, made him struggle and ended stamping on Cavarlho's nuts (on purpose or not), den Ronaldo simply juz went to da ref and did some remarks and dat summed up Rooney's behaviour: He snapped.<br><br>So who to blame? No one really. Its all cause and effect: You drink you pee. Dat simple.</div>
