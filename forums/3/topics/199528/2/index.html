            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think every one is angry with him just because of rooney. The one part was rooney was his team mate and friend, and yet he could do something like that it shows his character. People just don't like a cunning &amp; deceitful person.<br><br>Its the way that he plays that make people angry. His cheating ways are just shameful and disgusting... The way he go down against france... not just one incident, so many times he try the same dirty trick its as he is not aware that the whole world can see him cheat. To top it all up, some expect the game with Germany to be without any problems as there is nothing to play for anymore but this fellow tried it again...<br><br>It would be a shame if he continues to stay with Man u. Hope they can get rid of him asap.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh man... now it seems like Real also don't want him. It emerged yesterday that, though Real's new president RamÃ³n CalderÃ³n had been talking of approaches for Chelsea's Arjen Robben and Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo, his comments appear to have been little more than a smokescreen. Instead, CalderÃ³n's first transfer-market play in the role he assumed last Sunday was to act on his new manager Fabio Capello's demand for RibÃ©ry.<br><br>That led to a Â£26m offer to Marseille last week, according to sources at the French club, one that could explode Arsenal's chances of securing the signature of the 23-year-old. There is further competition within France, where the domestic champions Lyon registered a Â£20.75m bid a fortnight ago to set the market at a level far exceeding Arsenal's offer.<br><br>Hope Real give the 26M to Man u better. ha.. ha..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
