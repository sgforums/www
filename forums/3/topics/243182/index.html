            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO, JM is just trying out another of his famous mind game, just that this time its for the guys upstairs, its a perfect one stone 2 birds move getting the board realised his importance to the club and sounding out Real or any other club for that matter, but i just a gut feeling that he might just stay with Chelsea simply because only Roman would be able to provide him with endless amount of transfer funds.<br><br>one thing that all of us must agreed is the amount of respect that he commands from his players, i bet Lampard and Terry's contract delay is just a stake that these 2 players gamble on to show their support for the "Special One" kudos to Jose Mourinho, he is just one of those manager that knows how to play a perfect mind game so now its just a matter of whether Roman will be falling for his mind game. talk about Jose competing on 4 fronts (League, FA Cup, Preimer &amp; Champion League), i guess its 5 cause his battle with the board should also be considered as another of his competition</div>

And Irina may not be around to save the Blues.<br><br>It would be pretty interesting to see the rise and fall of Chelsea link to a woman. But well, it is the 21st Century, and they rule..<br><br></div>

Cos when you said spent millions on new players year in year out, you gave the impression like they spent the same amount of money... But actually, there is alot of difference. Compare to most Spanish clubs, they probably spent quite a sum but I think you forgot that if compared to chelsea, they actually didn't spent that much...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Real also had to spend within their means, they have to balance their books. Compare to what Jose got, it was still very much lesser. Real bought players in different years. LuÃ­s Figo came in 2000 and they went on to sign Zinedine Zidane (2001), Ronaldo (2002) and David Beckham (2003). They did win the La Liga Titles during those years. Only from 2003 onwards have they not won the title and that is also partly because of the re-emergence of Barcelona who were very strong during these last 3, 4 yrs who we eventually saw them became European Champions.<br><br>Real's policy also seem to be only buy one star player per season that is probably where they got the name the Galactico (or superstar) from and maybe afew average buys... Compare to what chelsea buy for Jose... Just for 2004 Drogba - $24m, Tiago Mendes $10m - JaroÂšÃ­k $7m - Ricardo Carvalho $19.85m - Paulo Ferreira $ 13.2m... For 2005: Essien - $23m, Asier del Horno $8m - SWP $21m, Lassana Diarra $3m and 2006: Shevchenko - $30.8m, Mikel John Obi $16m - Salomon Kalou $8-10m - Khalid Boulahrouz $8.5m - A Cole $20m...And i didn't even include players like Hernan Crespo, Veron, Duff, Scott Parker, Ballack and others i couldn't recall...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>As for him winning the Uefa Cup and Champions League in successive seasons with Porto, I must say that his timing was very lucky... we should remember that during his time there, probably Figo was the only good Portuguese player playing abroad... So he had the cream of the Portuguese talent at his disposal... Most of them went on to play in the national team and did very well in the EC and WC. But had it been present day, he probably won't be able to do it again as most of Portugal's best are playing in England and Spain now. Anyway, i still feel that his Champions League win was a rather let-down to football, Cos i still can recall very clearly of the way his Porto team dived and play-acted their way to the title...<br><br>I agree with you that he is a good coach but also a problematic one. His style seem to make most neutral fans dislike the club he is managing... He creates trouble out of nothing... So I would say Wenger is a much better coach/manager. Winning the CL title doesn't automatically makes you a good coach. Wenger came very close last year and only losing to what most people would agree were the Best team in Europe this last 2 years. But if you look at Wenger's team budget, and compare them to Jose's chelsea... then you would understand despite his lack of funds he still did better than Jose. And i don't think Jose could have done any better with Arsenal's kids...</div>

They didn't win anything. My point is simple. You can have all the good players in the team, but without a good coach, u cannot do anything. Also, pls remember that last and this season, Madrid had spend a lot too. Fabio Cannavaro, Emerson, Diarra, Robinho, Cincinho, Paulo Garcia, Carlos Diogo, Higuain, Gago are some of the players signed. And oh btw, 2003-2004 season was won by Valencia. Barcelona emerged only the next season onwards<br><br>I beg to differ ur opinion that Figo was probably the only good Portugese player playing aboard that year Porto won the Champions league. Luis Boa Morte was a good player for Fulham, and in fact it was after his move to Fulham in 2001 that he started winning Portugese caps. Pauleta was the star player for PSG and Portugal, Jorge Andrade was an outstanding defender in Spain for Deportivo. Figo attracted the most press because he played for Barca and madrid, and also because he had won personal awards before.<br><br>You said that Porto dived and play-acted their way to the title that year. U saying that is unfair, because u are denying the fact that skills, team-work, work-rate and a good coach were other factors that brought the success to the club. Its as good as saying Man U, if they win the FA Cup and EPL this year, won it because Ronaldo was diving his way to the title. Which is not true, considering that the team really played out of their skin to win it. Same goes for Porto.<br><br>Arsene Wenger, believe it or not has not been an angel either. He constantly denies the fact that his players are ill-disciplined(the number of red cards during his reign is appalling). And he is really not the great tactician we think he is. A measure of how great a manager is how many trophies he won. Arsene has won league titles and FA Cups, but where's the big ones like UEFA cup or the Champions League? This is the type of trophies that makes the difference between a good manager and a great manager.<br><br>Also, we can say that Arsenal was unlucky last year in the Champions League, losing to one of the best team in Europe. But what about this year? Losing to PSV is not the same as losing to Barca. Its obvious that in Europe, Arsene don't really get it.<br><br>And pls, the constant talk about Arsenal not having the type of transfer budget Chelsea has is of no validity, if u see how Man U, despite not having the strength of Chelsea in terms of players, and having to pay off the debts the new owners inflict on them, is doing so well too. Arsene constantly talks about how his youngsters cannot do the job, but when u consider that more than 10 years ago, after having 3 of his 1st team players sold off, SAF having to promote the Nevilles, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and David Beckham to the first team and subsquently winning the title is proof that all it takes, is actually a good tactician, and a flexible mind to change things when it is not going their way.</div>
