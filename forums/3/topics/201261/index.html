            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal legend Dennis Bergkamp is proud of his Gunners legacy as he prepares himself for his last appearance in the club shirt.<br><br><img src="http://images.skysports.com/images/playerpics05_06/Premiership/Arsenal/bergkamp_mobbed.jpg"><br><br>The 37-year-old concludes his Arsenal career on Saturday at his old side's new home, Emirates Stadium, in his testimonial tie with Ajax which has already drawn in 54,000 spectators.<br><br>The Dutchman has said that there will always be a place in his heart for Arsenal and has already secured a box in the new ground in which to watch his former side.<br><br>Bergkamp has played a key role in Arsenal's rise to European fame since Bruce Rioch persuaded him to complete his switch from Milan to London in 1995.<br><br>After 11 years of regularly appearing in the starting line-up, Bergkamp decided to call time on his Gunners career at the end of last season.<br><br>"In years to come, when I look back, I'll see a different club to the one I joined," he said.<br><br>"I contributed to a style of football, very fluent and attacking, and my stats are good so maybe I made a difference.<br><br>"When I was looking to leave Internazionale, Arsenal were the first team to come in for me. I looked at the club and saw a solid base that I could fit in to.<br><br>"I didn't know anything about 'boring Arsenal', and I didn't know the importance of playing against Spurs, but I soon found out.<br><br>"The year after, Patrick Vieira, Emmanuel Petit and Marc Overmars came in, and now we obviously had a world-class team whereas maybe 15 years ago, these players would not be playing for Arsenal.<br><br>"A club like this deserves such a stadium, and I'm sorry I won't be a part of it. But you know people appreciate what you have done when it's sold out for you."<br><br>Bergkamp scored 120 goals for Arsenal in 423 appearances, which makes him the club's 10th highest goalscorer in their history.<br><br>His CV contains plenty of silverware too, with three Premiership titles and three FA Cups.<br><br>He was also named PFA Player of the Year in 1998 and has become a fans' favourite since his first goal against Southampton in his seventh appearance.<br><br>Gunners fans will also remember Bergkamp for his many wonder-goals and his captaincy in the thrilling 5-3 victory over Middlesbrough in 2005.<br><br>"I was captain and I was so proud when we came back from 3-1 down," he added.<br><br>"It was one of the times in my career that I felt like the leader on the pitch and led by example.<br><br>"That was special and it kept our unbeaten run going as well."<br><br>Saturday's game is likely to be a very emotional affair, but Bergkamp is determined to enjoy himself.<br><br>"It's going to be special. I can enjoy the day and share it with the players.<br><br>"I'll miss the simple things, the dressing-room humour and the training. But I've had a great time.<br><br>"The wonderful thing about coaches in England is they tell you to 'go out and enjoy yourself', and I've enjoyed my career."<br><a href="http://home.skysports.com/list.asp?HLID=404841&amp;CPID=8&amp;title=Iceman+ready+for+Gunners+goodbye&amp;lid=&amp;channel=Football_Home&amp;f=rss&amp;clid=3" rel="nofollow">http://home.skysports.com/list.asp?HLID=404841&amp;CPID=8&amp;title=Iceman+ready+for+Gunners+goodbye&amp;lid=&amp;channel=Football_Home&amp;f=rss&amp;clid=3</a><br><br>---<br><br>Dennis, you've done the Gunners proud. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One of the great players of all time. His nonchalent approach to the game, cool slick passes and classy goals were the hallmark of a boring-turned-attacking arsenal of the 90s and beyond.<br><br>Having a mostly injury free career certainly helped the dutchman and his committment to the club was evident when he volunteered to travel by land for european away matches despite his fear of flying.<br><br>A great player and outstanding role model, many will forever remember his world-class goal against Argentina in the 98 world cup deciding a tight contest. His single trap and position with one move followed by a skillful finish with the outstep of his boot past Carlos Roa ranks as one of the coolest finishes on the world stage.<br><br>He will forever be enshrined in Arsenal's hall of fame and the hearts of diehard arsenal supporters.<br><br></div>
