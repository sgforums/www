You don;t improve a football team just by training at home unless your team is comprised of players who ply in oversea leagues (malaysia league not included). The biggest problem in s'pre football team is its mentality, technical skill, and experience. more money is needed to spend on the youth academy and pick out the young talents as soon as possible and have them send overseas for maximum exposure, however sadly in s'pore, education comes first and i doubt that s'pore will ever make it big in the international stage given the direction it is going since sports is secondary compared to education unlike the North Asia countries where you can be handsomely rewarded for exceling in sports at international level.<br><br>If you want to increase your country's profile and exposure, football is one of the best medium out there. with the largest spectator and most tv coverage on the globe, imagine if you have one single s'porean player plying in EPL...everytime he's subbed onto the field, the commentor states... "here comes..ABC.. the singapore international, a country in south east asia also known as the red dot.........blah..blah..blah..'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
