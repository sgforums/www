And honestly, no team in the world other than Microsoft can compete with Chelsea or Roman. So every other team will generally be weaker than Chelsea.<br><br>But hey, doesn't everyone loves the underdog? So give MUFC that support.<br>At least, it is making the title chase that bit more interesting.<br><br>MUFC is not the favourite, can never be after Roman came. No team is going to outlast, outbid, outbuy Chelsea. And that's a fact.<br><br>So for those glory hunter, being on the blue carriage is a wise choice.<br><br></div>

A underdog do not have the finances, the resources, the ABILITY to compete with the big boys. Man U do have all these, and team for team, they are one of the top 3 teams in England. It isn't that long ago that Man U was the dominating team, and make everyone hate them. I, for 1 have been pleased that it is now 3 seaons that Man U is not No1.<br><br>I would much rather see Chelsea lead 15 points, and the rest of the league chasing for No2, then to see Man U lead the table, and go on to win the league. But I gotta admit that Man U is playing out of their skin this season, and able to grind out results.</div>
