            <div class='col-md body'>Huh? What talking you? Chelsea no chance la. They are complaining whole day. What most ppl out there really want is not for Man Utd to win the EPL title but for Chelsea to NOT WIN IT. Even if they dont like Man Utd, they would rather Man Utd win it than Chelsea, who are behaving like a bunch of cry babies than winners. No wonder so many players want to leave chelsea.</div>

Cudicini or Hilario certainly not in the league of cech.<br><br>true that chelsea won liverpool at home, but they have to travel to liverpool at anfield, not to mention arsenal, man u and bolton.<br><br>for me, cech out long term is a very huge factor.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal suffering the effects of moving to a new home, the emirates stadium is a much bigger field than highbury.<br><br>I still think Arsenal is inconsistent and is not able to finish teams off when they have the chance.<br><br>As for liverpool, they are already 11 points behind Man U, even if they mount a late bid for the title, it will be a case of too little too late. any teams challenging for the title needs to start well and ends well.</div>
