            <div class='col-md body'>whatever the bet is, there is no doubt that Chelsea is still the team to beat in EPL, they're setting the standard like what Liverpool did in the 80s, Man Utd in the 90s and Arsenal in the early 20s, so its just a matter of how the fellow clubs in England respond to it</div>
