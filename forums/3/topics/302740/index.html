It seemed like a whole new Chelsea, a much rejuvenated team.</strong><br><br>From the time when Anelka came in, the whole team started to push tremendously. Obviously, Grant had made a very good decision in purchasing Anelka to curb Chelsea's strikers woes.<br><br>Most of the players playing the very first match for a big club like Chelsea were mostly jittery(take a look at Sheva), making bad passes and getting poor strikes. But that did not fall on Anelka.<br><br>A figure whom had experienced the top flight with big clubs like Arsenal and Real Madrid, Anelka was basically a player worth the money Chelsea cashed for him.<br><br>Against Tottenham, Anelka was unlucky not to get onto the score-sheet, nevertheless, he provided several opportunities for his teammates.<br><br>I think, Chelsea will really prosper in their striking with Anelka either as a lone striker, or to play a 4-4-2 formation with Drogba.<br><br>Rating: 8/10<br><br>What do you guys think of him and the game?</div>

But that did not fall on Anelka.<br><br>A figure whom had experienced the top flight with big clubs like Arsenal and Real Madrid, Anelka was basically a player worth the money Chelsea cashed for him.....<br><br>What do you guys think of him and the game? </div></blockquote>agreed that he is a hell of a striker.. he would have been a much better now if he would have stay with Arsenal.. thats just my opinion..<br><br>as for Sheva.. well i kinda disagreed with you.. pardon me for saying this but Chelsea can't be a bigger club then AC Milan, so to say that he is jittery playing for Chelsea is kinda impossible.. he just couldn't fit into the English game and Chelsea's tactic.. lot of Series A players get alot more time before being closed down by the rival team so its just him and nothing to do with being jittery playing for Chelsea..</div>
