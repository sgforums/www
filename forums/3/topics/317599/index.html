              <h1 class="clr">Gao Ning and Tao Li named Sportsman and Sportswoman of the Year</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : Table—tennis player Gao Ning and teenage swimming sensation
              Tao Li have been named this year’s Sportsman and Sportswoman
              respectively.</p>
              <p>The winners were revealed by the Singapore Sports Awards Selection Committee on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>25—year—old
              Gao Ning clinched the Sportsman title for his gold medal performance at
              last year’s SEA Games and Commonwealth Championship, as well as his
              10th placing in the World Ranking.</p>
              <p>His win is significant as it is the first time a male paddler has won the honour.</p>
              <p>For
              18—year—old Tao Li, it was her second consecutive Sportswoman title.
              This time, she won for her triple gold medal performance at the SEA
              Games and her 7th placing in the FINA World Championship.</p>
              <p>The
              Coach of the Year award went to football’s Radojko ("Raddy") Avramovic
              — his first title in the annual Sports Awards. The last football coach
              to win the award was Jita Singh in 1981.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Raddy’s
              charges in the National Football Team clinched Team of the Year —
              mainly for winning last year’s ASEAN Cup and their excellent run in the
              2010 World Cup qualifying campaign.</p>
              <p>The award comes at the right time as the team prepares for some crucial World Cup qualifying matches.</p>
              <p>Raddy
              said: "It is good timing, and I think at least when we have training
              (sessions), that is on back of their minds, that people recognise what
              they do and that will give them the push and strength to do more."</p>
              <p>The
              National Women’s Table—tennis Team — comprising Li Jiawei, Wang Yue Gu,
              Sun Bei Bei, Tan Paey Fern and Yu Meng Yu — won the Team of the Year
              award for Events.</p>
              <p>Shooter Jonathan Koh clinched the Sportsboy title, while bowler Jazreel Tan won the Sportsgirl award.</p>
              <p>It was an issue—free selection for the committee, but they are looking at making the awards more inclusive.</p>
              <p>Chris
              Chan, Secretary General, Singapore National Olympic Council, said: "In
              the last year, there was a situation whereby bowling was going to
              nominate three coaches... so we have to (seriously) address this,
              whether the situation will arise again, and if it does, how will the
              selectors address this."</p>
              <p>All the winners will be honoured in a
              ceremony to be held on June 24 at the Marina Mandarin Hotel. Besides
              their trophies, they will also win for themselves cash awards. — CNA/ms</p>
