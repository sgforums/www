If we can end games with 11 men on the field, then obviously it'd make things a bit easier for everyone," commented the Argentine.<br><br>"The fact we lost 2-0 at home and ended up in nine men is negative.

Clearly we didn't play too well today and now there's no room for error, we must win the next three matches."<br><br>They now face back-to-back ties with Spartak Moscow and must win both those encounters or potentially crash out of Europe altogether.<br><br>"We're also taking on Sporting Lisbon at San Siro and must try to get nine points before we go to Munich for the final match.
