            <div class='col-md body'>Tomas Rosicky is expected to announce he has sealed a move to Arsenal at a press conference on Tuesday.<br><br>The Borussia Dortmund midfielder underwent medicals with the North Londoners and Czech Republic sources claim he agreed a contract on Monday night.<br><br>After activating a clause in his contract to leave Dortmund for Â£6.8 million, he has had a number of clubs pursuing his signature but is due to reveal details of the move alongside agent Pavel Paska in Austria, where Czech Republic are holding their World Cup preparation camp.<br><br>"There have been about 70 clubs interested and the move to Arsenal would be a big kind of encouragement before the World Cup finals start," Czech coach Karel Bruckner revealed to CTK.<br><br>Atletico Madrid were in pole position to land the 25-year-old but their negotiations collapsed this week.<br><br>Arsenal also signed Jens Lehmann from Dortmund and Rosicky scored against Arsenal whilst with Sparta Prague, in the 2000 UEFA Champions League.<br><br>Rosicky is likely to be a replacement for Robert Pires, who is out of contract and interesting Villarreal, so Opta compared the two players' statistics.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tomas Rosicky's agent has confirmed Chelsea almost signed Arsenal's new boy.<br><br>The Czech international was a big target for the English champions back in 2004, and The Blues bid Â€18 million (Â£12 million) for his services - nearly twice as much as Arsenal are believed to have paid Borussia Dortmund.<br><br>Pavel Paska has confirmed that Chelsea would not meet Borussia's demands.<br><br>"Chelsea once offered Dortmund Â€18 million but Borussia demanded Â€22 million so the deal went wrong," Paska told Sport.<br><br>Rosicky, who sealed his move on Tuesday, was delighted to have finally ended the speculation surrounding his future.<br><br>"I am happy the transfer speculations are gone, from now on I can fully concentrate on the World Cup," said Rosicky.<br><br>"Arsenal is the best thing that could happen to me, I have always dreamt about such a club.<br><br>"Everybody can see their attractive style of playing football. In my opinion, EuropeÃ‚Â´s best two clubs met in the UEFA Champions League final this year.<br><br>"I have signed for a top club in a top competition because I want to improve my abilities. And what else would make me better than playing for Arsenal? I am not lazy, otherwise I might easily stay in Dortmund until the end of my career."<br><br>Rosicky, who normally wears number 10, insists he has not even thought about such an issue.<br><br>"We have not talked about it at all, I donÃ‚Â´t care. If they give me 79, I will gladly take it," he added.<br><br>The Little Mozart also confirmed the appeal of working with Arsene Wenger.<br><br>"We were in London on Sunday evening. We met with Arsene Wenger and vice-president David Dein. My agent Pavel Paska held talks over the contract with David Dein and I talked with Mr Wenger about football.<br><br>"He made a very good impression on me but I would not like to reveal any more. It is only between the two of us."</div>
