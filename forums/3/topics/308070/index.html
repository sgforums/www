              <p><br> If you want to be fair I'm equally blind to zocoss, giga, you or any other fan. I certainly have not treated zocoss any differently from how I treat you or Stella. So in that sense, I'm equally blind to them as I am to you.</p>
              <p>Besides, if you want to go comment on zocoss, by all means. I'm not doing this to defend or protect anyone. And what has my commenting on him got to do with zocoss or anyone else anyway.</p>
              <p>I thought you would have understood the reasons behind my posts by now already, but  maybe you're just protecting this guy simply because he's anti-Man U. The problem with this guy is not because he is anti Man-U or even because he's pro-Chelsea. I really don't bother about the trash-talking between the rest of you, but this guy takes it to a whole new level.</p>
              <p>It's one thing to like a football club or even to dislike another club, but to go extreme about it is another thing altogether. You can take it as an insult or any way you want, to me, Zocoss is no different from a lot of you other forumites, simply because all of you pale by comparison when compared to the clonemaster.
                  
                  Perhaps if the clonemaster bothered to apply more footballing knowledge in his criticisms or really knew what he was talking about then I might feel differently. Look at fullham4life for example, he's anti-Man U but he's different.</p>
              <p>I have been wanting to tell you this in private but maybe it's applicable to all football fans out there. Perhaps when being anti towards anything, be it soccer club or anything else, even PAP or whatever organisation. We should remember to not become as blind as the very people or the very things we are against. Otherwise like you have said before, there is no difference between you and the other party.</p>
              <p>On top of that, perhaps we should not be as blind either when supporting people. Maybe because I don't view all this as 'choosing sides' or 'picking allies'. For me, it was never about which club vs which club kind of issue. Maybe my perspective is hard for you to understand because none of you are like that, my opposing the clone master doesn't mean I'm pro Man U or anti-Chelsea, I just don't like HIM directly. To add, I am simply not a fan of the saying,'The Enemy of my Enemey is my friend'.</p>
              <p>If you want to talk about being blind, the clonemaster has been very blind regarding my posts. I think outside of opposing him, it's very easy to see whether or not I'm pro Man U or anti-Chelsea. If anything, I think anger has seriously blinded him. I suggest you don't let it happen to you as well. You yourself know that I am fully aware where you are coming from regarding this whole anti-Man U issue.</p>
              <p>Maybe if the clonemaster applied more genuine soccer knowledge when making his criticisms, I wouldn't find an issue with it. But it's so obvious that he shoots his mouth off and switches his brain off when he starts posting. He is unlike any of the fans out there. I try to ask him why he likes his favourite club and he can't even answer me, I'm sure you can tell me why you like Arsenal or Argentina right? Instead of replying me, this guy straight away goes on to talk about Man U, Man U and Man U instead.</p>
              <p>I have previously tried to bring him away on a discussion in a different direction, but he simply is not interested. For him, it's all about the hate and nothing but the hate. It doesn't matter even if he makes a fool of himself, he's too far gone to even realise it.</p>
              <p>I ask you to look back on my posts, not just those to the clonemaster, touch your heart and ask yourself, am I anti-Chelsea and anti their fans like this guy says or not? Look at topics I've started and you think with a clear mind instead of letting your hate guide you.</p>
              <p>I've explained myself to you more than once already, and from past conversations you know I understand your stand. Can't you even try to do the same for me, even if you don't understand fully? Or is hating Man U and being anti-Man U so important that anyone who doesn't agree with your being anti Man U is a pro Man U?</p>
              <p>I know not all soccer fans are like me, but I know my soccer none-the-less and it doesn't mean I have to be like him. Take for example that time the FA Cup match between Tottenham and Man U. He was the only one saying the ref wrongfully gave a penalty, but even non Man U fans knew it was a clear penalty. Felirox himself voiced out how silly and how blind this clonemaster was. Is Felirox anti-Chelsea? Is he a Man U fan?</p>
              <p>If you want to play opposition, you should also pick credible allies.</p>

              <p><br>And why are you editing even 798's posts and changing the meaning? You are misunderstanding even what he is saying. Ask him yourself whether he thinks I am a clone, and you will know how deluded you continue to be. He is telling me what the another forumite is doing, and you are either intentionally misreading it or you just simply be bothered.</p>
              <p>Just answer this, is there even any trace of possibility that any person, soccer fan or not will find your posts disagreable?</p>

              </blockquote></div>
              <p>I think you should know I have always understand where you are coming from. I am one of those that even tried to explain your point of things in the Football and EPL forum, don't you remember? You even PM'd me after that telling me don't bother with them. Are willing to go so far just to side with the clonemaster just because he is anti-Man U? Why go so far with siding the other black sheeps of football fans out there.</p>
              <p>They have their black sheeps, but to support and protect the clonemaster is really the wrong way to go about it. If you really want retort them, find more credible people like Stella or fullham4life instead, and not simply blindly welcome anyone who is against Man U. Otherwise like I said, you become as blind in your support for ABUs as the fans you say blindly support Man U.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I myself have commented on some of the topics they've raised, like one making fun of Frank Lampard. And the way to retort should not be by getting thrasy like them or getting even thrasier people like the clonemaster to do all this.
                  
                  Instead of using these cheapo and cowardly methods like how the clonemaster does it, you should take them head on instead. Engage them on soccer, reply with articles. If they come into your threads and provoke you then point it out and say it to their faces. But to do it like how inno/gangsta/superlong/ronaldog/clonemaster is really another thing altogether.</p>
              <p>If you really want people to believe you are no different from the other monkeys out there, then I think you really should not blindly support the clonemaster.
                  
                  Since you think Man U fans are blind supporters and don't know their soccer, then take them on and challenge their knowledge of soccer. Discuss with them, exchange views with them and know how they think. Don't just blindly attack back. The way you reply will be what sets you apart from them.</p>
              <p>And if you have an issue with them, why are you attacking me instead? Have I told you not to reply against them? Have I tried to protect them in anyway? Have I told you not to point out when they are being biased? Have I? Did I ever stop or go against you speaking out about them?</p>
              <p>798, touch your heart, ask your conscience and tell me if I have ever opposed your stand. Why is it you always misunderstand the things I post and say, it's very sad that I try to understand you but you don't even bother to even give that little back to me. Not just once or twice even.</p>
              <p>But rather, you simpy choose to support even when he has twisted your words simply because he is the enemy of your enemy.
                  
                  I don't hate you 798, but after all that you have said you dissappoint me. Because I don't wish to believe that you have become like the very people you are against.</p>

              <p><br> Others can make longer posts simply because there is more content or more substance to the things they post. Quite simply not every post other people make is to insult some other person's family, and not every other post is about Man U.
                  
                  I dare you to come up and say who are the 'other fans' who feel I'm a clone. Is it inno/ganster/superlongstrong, why is it all called 'other fans' when it's the same person?</p>
              <p>Ask 798 for yourself whether he thinks I'm a clone. I think it's very obvious to find out, just don't let yourself get clouded by anger. I invite you to prove I'm a clone, by any
              means necessary. And provide any post whereby I accused anyone of being
              a gloryhunter.</p>
              <p>Again let me ask you, why is Chelsea your favourite football club? What is you like about them? Which of their strengths is it that draws you to them as your favourite club. And which are you favourite or more well-liked players from Chelsea?</p>

              <p>Powerhouse Tykes striker Kayode Odejayi delivered the holders a sensational
              knockout blow, rising highest to head home Martin Devaney's superb cross in the
              65th minute for the only goal in a thrilling 'David versus Goliath'
              quarter-final at a sold-out Oakwell.
              Chelsea manager Avram Grant conceded it was his worst day since replacing Jose
              Mourinho 37 games and only four defeats ago.
              But the Israeli and his captain were gracious enough in defeat to pay tribute
              to Coca-Cola Championship side Barnsley and their fairytale cup run. Davey said
              of his opposite number: 'He just said 'well done'. He was very sociable. He's a
              nice fella.
              'John Terry came up to me at the end of the game and said 'go on and win it,
              you deserve it after today'.
              'So it's great to have people of that stature in the game saying that
              afterwards.'
              Davey, who never played above League One level as a player, admitted he and
              his players were in 'dreamland' after trumping their memorable win at
              Liverpool in the previous round.
              'I never thought the Anfield win could be eclipsed and today, in front of our
              own fans, against mighty Chelsea with all their millions, we've done it and I
              couldn't believe it.
              'I still can't believe it now and hopefully I'll wake up in the morning and
              it will still all be true.'
              Barnsley went toe to toe with Chelsea in a typically full-blooded cup tie and
              even played some of the better football in the first half.
              Chelsea a took command early in the second half and it appeared their extra
              class would tell, but just when Barnsley legs appeared to waver, Delaney swung
              over a top-class cross and Odejayi thumped home his decisive header.
              Davey added: 'You have to enjoy days like these. It was a big day for
              Barnsley and a big day for the players and they went out to enjoy the game.
              'Nobody was found wanting. Everyone put a shift in and they've come up trumps
              again.
              'To go to Anfield and win and then to go and beat Chelsea in the same season
              is a fantastic achievement and my players deserve a lot of praise.'
              Davey revealed his most expensive player was Hungarian striker Istvan
              Ferenczi, who cost a tiny fraction of the £110million it cost Chelsea owner
              Roman Abramovich to assemble the Londoners' side on show at Oakwell.
              But it was match-winner Odejayi, who scored his first goal since September,
              that Davey singled out for special praise.
              Davey said: 'My players, last-ditch tackles, Luke (Steele) again pulling off
              saves - they've been fantastic.
              'But a lot of the credit for me has got to go to 'Kay'. He has been fantastic
              all season. He got a bit of criticism earlier, but we know he's a good player
              and that he'd come good.
              'Over the last month he's put a lot of hard work in and he's had his reward
              today.'
              Chelsea manager Grant, who insisted both Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba were
              left out due to injury, looked drawn when asked to assess his side's upset.
              He also laid some of the blame on the Oakwell pitch, and said: 'It's a big
              disappointment. It's a quarter-final and we lost.
              'First of all I need to congratulate Barnsley. They played very well today
              and showed good spirit.
              'For us it's not a pitch we can play quality football on. It was not good in
              the first half and the second half we started very well.
              'We played quick, we created a lot of chances and then, like it happens
              sometimes in football, we conceded a goal and we couldn't score.
              'I don't think we thought this was an easy game. We knew they beat Liverpool
              away, so we knew what to expect.
              'I wanted both (Lampard and Drogba) to play, but they were injured, so they
              couldn't, but we played with a team that was good enough to win the game.'
              Grant added: 'I don't know if I'm shocked, but I'm very disappointed. You can
              say so yes, since I came to Chelsea, this is the most disappointing day.'</p>
