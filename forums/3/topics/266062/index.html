The mentality is inside every youths head. So they won't spend as much time training but will instead focus on their education or other stuff.<br><br>And also, 90% of the parents will tell their kids to take football as a leisure cca kinda thing rather then go professional. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It's their fault but refuse to admit and improve their job.</div></blockquote>Thanks for your words, always good to have a clearer perspective. Some of the things you have said a re quite true and is what a few of my friends have talked about.<br><br>It's true, Singaporeans only support our soccer team when it's winning. Straits Times even ran a joke on it many years ago during the Malaysia Cup period. In fact, from my memory, I only remember support for the Singapore team being highest when Singapore was doing well in Malaysia Cup. The two back to back   finals against Kedah and Pahang. They lost 0-2 to Kedah and won Pahang 4-0.<br><br>What you say it quite true, Singaporeans probably would have less interest if they continually lose. Or maybe that's just Singaporeans now. I went for a match at the National Stadium between Singapore and Korea a long time ago. Can't remember if it was a World Cup qualification or something. Singapore team lost but the stadium was full Singaporeans were cheering all round. It's not like that nowadays though.<br><br>Regarding the hosting issue, in all fairness, maybe it was an oversight regarding the tearing down of the National Stadium. If you can't confirm you have the stadium or facilities to host, it wouldn't be very wise to make a bid. At most a planning mistake but I don't think it was to avoid defeat or anything like that.<br><br>About Singapore winning in Asean, well, it's no easy feat to win any Cup Competition, and you do need a bit of luck sometimes to even get to the final. You are kind of belittling the competition with some of the things you say. I think credit still should go to the current Singapore team to take their chances, they are not undeserving winners in any sense. To come from 1-0 down to draw the match in a hostile Thai enviroment is by no means any easy feat. Add to that the small number of supporters who actually went for the match. Credit should be given where it's due.<br><br>I agree that putting foreigners may not be a long-term solution, but you got to examine the alternative. To use home grown talent. But that solution is pretty hard to take up as well, not only does Singapore have a small population, as another has mentioned, there is the mindset as well. It's instilled in the mindsets of all our youths that soccer does not work out for a living. So if the locals are not willing to do the job, you gotta import talent. Kind of how businesses work.<br><br>I wouldn't say all the fault lies with FAS, but probably a lot has to be done to change the mindset of the people here.</div>

Losing 0-1 to Japan in Saitama is far more challenging than whacking Brunei 8-0 or Pahang 4-0.<br><br>The Australia match is a different story, firstly it was a friendly, secondly, the 2nd half had a lot of Singaporean injuries. Don't forget we hit the crossbar twice, and the post once. We had a total of 7 shots on goal, same as the Aussies.<br><br></div>

In competitions, sometime the best team doesn't win. On many occasions, the favorites would end up defeated. People can say they're unlucky or didn't perform up to expectation or wasted their chances. Right?<br><br>And about your comment on <strong>hostile</strong> Thai environment, I don't agree with it. I believe this is what the Singapore media's bad habit of over exagerating the situation after that 1st leg's incident. That's something a lot of foreigners always feel about the Singapore's media or government (sorry, don't mean to put politics in but it's true). They tend to portray other countries' situation as 'dangerous', 'messy', 'hostile' or something negative that affect Singaporeans' feelings about other countries. ( Nothing is good about others except Singapore.)<br><br>According to the fact at that time, from my numerous contacts in Bangkok, the Thai people were living everyday as usual. The Thai fans weren't hostile. Bangkok environment was as usual. Nothing negative or dangerous. It's the media that scared Singapore supporters and the team and play down on Thailand. Thus many supporters from Singapore canceled their trips.  In fact I find Thai people very disciplined and friendly citizens. Otherwise millions of foreigners won't be visiting, living and working there every year.<br><br>In fact, when I was in the National Stadium watching the games that Singapore played in, the Singapore fans appeared to be more hostile to the away teams. They would always curse out all the local vulgar terms loudly on the away teams. Even when it's true a foul by Singapore players on the opponent players, the local fans in Singapore would just curse out those 'CB', 'referee Kayu', 'KNN', 'FCUK U' kind of words on the referees or the opponent players. How do we justify that then?<br><br>In Korea, I've watched international football games and I can assure you that I have never seen Korean supporters curse and swear out loud at opponent teams or referees like what some Singapore supporters do. Unless there is some injustice over the referee's decision or unsporting conduct/naughty behavior by players of another countries. Despite that, the supporters continue to cheer without the disturbing curse and swear which we often hear when we enter the Kallang National Stadium in Singapore. So I don't know what those 'curse and swear' supporters really want.<br><br>Overall, if you talk about hostile environment, in my opinion, Singapore's National Stadium is more hostile if I'm a foreigner supporting my country and sit in one of the designated corner of the National Stadium. I remember how everytime, the foreign supporters got harassed or cursed by the local Singapore supporters when they didn't do anything wrong. That's unsporting.<br>I don't see that in Korea. Supporters just sing out loud, cheer the Korea National Team throughout the match without harassing the foreign supporters in another corner holding foreign flags.<br><br>Maybe it's due to education or media's influence on the supporters, I'm not sure. But I think that if you refer the Thailand-Singapore game earlier this year as hostile environment, I don't agree  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Of course the majority of the fans support the home team but they're not dangerous. Many people in Bangkok are educated and they have their own set of values and buddhist teachings they received since young.  So give the Thai supporters some confidence and credits. We can't base our judgement on what the media says. And as you know, some reporters are disliked by readers....They're biased. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Especially those from newspapers like The New Paper.<br><br>I have been to Thailand on many occasions and have many friends there. I think they're OK. They don't take the 1st leg's controversial penalty to heart. It's a game after all. Many supporters were unhappy during that time but after a while, they would forget it and look forward to the Asian Cup which will start today.<br><br>And please, do not classify Thailand as a places like Indonesia or England where the fans can be very too passionate to the extent that crowd trouble sometimes occur.  Indonesia's domestic league games sometimes see players chasing after players or even referees, the supporters even become violent.<br><br>I'm not Thai but I feel injustice for the Thais if the media influence the people, telling them negatively about the usually friendly people.<br><br>Anyway, if you have a chance, welcome to Korea to watch an international match between Korea and another country, you'll see for yourself and know what I mean.<br><br>SumOne, have a Nice Day!!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
