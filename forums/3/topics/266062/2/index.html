            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Jaeyoon:</div><div class="quote_body">Thank you for your opinion. No, I'm not belittling the competition. They deserve some credit of course. You need a bit of luck. In competitions, sometime the best team doesn't win. On many occasions, the favorites would end up defeated. People can say they're unlucky or didn't perform up to expectation or wasted their chances. Right?</div></blockquote>Thank you for getting the point. Singapore's two wins was not undeserving.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>And about your comment on [b]hostile</strong> Thai environment, I don't agree with it. I believe this is what the Singapore media's bad habit of over exagerating the situation after that 1st leg's incident. That's something a lot of foreigners always feel about the Singapore's media or government (sorry, don't mean to put politics in but it's true). They tend to portray other countries' situation as 'dangerous', 'messy', 'hostile' or something negative that affect Singaporeans' feelings about other countries. ( Nothing is good about others except Singapore.)<br><br>According to the fact at that time, from my numerous contacts in Bangkok, the Thai people were living everyday as usual. The Thai fans weren't hostile. Bangkok environment was as usual. Nothing negative or dangerous. It's the media that scared Singapore supporters and the team and play down on Thailand. Thus many supporters from Singapore canceled their trips.  In fact I find Thai people very disciplined and friendly citizens. Otherwise millions of foreigners won't be visiting, living and working there every year.<br><br>In fact, when I was in the National Stadium watching the games that Singapore played in, the Singapore fans appeared to be more hostile to the away teams. They would always curse out all the local vulgar terms loudly on the away teams. Even when it's true a foul by Singapore players on the opponent players, the local fans in Singapore would just curse out those 'CB', 'referee Kayu', 'KNN', 'FCUK U' kind of words on the referees or the opponent players. How do we justify that then?<br><br>In Korea, I've watched international football games and I can assure you that I have never seen Korean supporters curse and swear out loud at opponent teams or referees like what some Singapore supporters do. Unless there is some injustice over the referee's decision or unsporting conduct/naughty behavior by players of another countries. Despite that, the supporters continue to cheer without the disturbing curse and swear which we often hear when we enter the Kallang National Stadium in Singapore. So I don't know what those 'curse and swear' supporters really want.<br><br>Overall, if you talk about hostile environment, in my opinion, Singapore's National Stadium is more hostile if I'm a foreigner supporting my country and sit in one of the designated corner of the National Stadium. I remember how everytime, the foreign supporters got harassed or cursed by the local Singapore supporters when they didn't do anything wrong. That's unsporting.<br>I don't see that in Korea. Supporters just sing out loud, cheer the Korea National Team throughout the match without harassing the foreign supporters in another corner holding foreign flags.<br><br>Maybe it's due to education or media's influence on the supporters, I'm not sure. But I think that if you refer the Thailand-Singapore game earlier this year as hostile environment, I don't agree  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Of course the majority of the fans support the home team but they're not dangerous. Many people in Bangkok are educated and they have their own set of values and buddhist teachings they received since young.  So give the Thai supporters some confidence and credits. We can't base our judgement on what the media says. And as you know, some reporters are disliked by readers....They're biased. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Especially those from newspapers like The New Paper.<br><br>I have been to Thailand on many occasions and have many friends there. I think they're OK. They don't take the 1st leg's controversial penalty to heart. It's a game after all. Many supporters were unhappy during that time but after a while, they would forget it and look forward to the Asian Cup which will start today. [/b][/quote]<br><br>I think my usage of the word 'hostile' was probably inappropriate. You've gone into pretty much depth over it, but by hostile, I didn't mean they were dangerous or ready to maul the Singapore players to death. I'm kind of just using the same word soccer reports tend to use, my bad I guess. No offence, but I don't mean it the way you think I do.<br><br>Yes Thais are a friendly bunch, I've experienced it first hand. Going back a bit, by hostile, what I meant was basically a charged crowd cheering in full force against their opponents. I've also mentioned how little support the Singapore team had there.<br><br>About the Singapore crowd swearing and all, I was at the match between Korea and Singapore, what do you think I saw?<br><br>But still, I'm sure you wouldn't label the Singapore crowd as hostile as that would be a pretty extreme comment in itself. Do they have a tendency to throw things onto the pitch? No doubt there is a ban on bringing bottles into stadiums, but they don't even throw coins.<br></div><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>And please, do not classify Thailand as a places like Indonesia or England where the fans can be very too passionate to the extent that crowd trouble sometimes occur.  Indonesia's domestic league games sometimes see players chasing after players or even referees, the supporters even become violent.</blockquote></div></blockquote>No I didn't, I hope I didn't give you that impression somehow.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>I'm not Thai but I feel injustice for the Thais if the media influence the people, telling them negatively about the usually friendly people.<br><br>Anyway, if you have a chance, welcome to Korea to watch an international match between Korea and another country, you'll see for yourself and know what I mean. </strong></div></blockquote>I do know what you mean, but just wanted to address a few of your points.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><div class="quote_body">[quote]SumOne, have a Nice Day!!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div>You too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>2010 is such a tall order for Singapore to be honest we cant even guarantee if England or Brazil is going to be there.What is guaranteed is that Soccer is moving at the right direction for FAS,the speed of progress would have to depend on how much money the sports ministry is willing to pump into Soccer developement.If I have my way I would remove the words 'Foreign Talents' in Sports.The idea is to win a competition for yourself and to a certain extend the country that you represent . Nothing to do  much with nationalism or patriotism but all in the name of Sports.The big disappointment is not seeing Singapore share some of the glories with the other South East Asian Soccer teams in the Asia Cup.Big dreams starts with smaller ones! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun bother to follow the SG soccer scene......the S-League or any international match involving SG. Not that i am being anti patriotic. It's just that SG cannot make the cut into the real international scene. I am not referring among Asean.....even here Sg soccer has more ups than down....so how to compete with the likes of Australia, China, Japan, Korea....Middle Eastern countries etc etc?<br><br>In my opinion Soccer is more about size and speed of the players than it is about solely on skill......you can have the best skills....but when it comes to body weight to shove your opponent aside during a tussle for the ball or goalmouth melee to press on ahead towards goal....Sg players is sadly lacking.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Look at all the likes of Australia, China, Japan etc.  Their players are not only tall, they are also big as compared to our players.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>If you guys analyse our results in qualifiers, we've been able to hold top Asian teams to a draw or a 1 goal loss. E.g 0-0 China, 2-0 Iraq, 1-2 Japan, 0-1 Japan (Yokohama in winter).<br><br>Could the team during the Malaysia Cup days do the same thing? Losing 0-1 to Japan in Saitama is far more challenging than whacking Brunei 8-0 or Pahang 4-0.<br><br>The Australia match is a different story, firstly it was a friendly, secondly, the 2nd half had a lot of Singaporean injuries. Don't forget we hit the crossbar twice, and the post once. We had a total of 7 shots on goal, same as the Aussies. </strong><br><br>it is not a fair comparison whther the current singapore soccer is better than during the malaysia cup days. how can we better off when we have the likes of abbas saad, michal vana taking bribes? same goes to malaysia.<br><br>second look at the foreign influx footballers playing for national team now.<br>i like to pay respect to China player Shi jiaya. in my opinion he is the 2 players together with benett deserve my respect.<br><br>it bullshit to say singaporean fans are not loyal and only support team when they are winning. fans pay money to see their teamn play. thus it is only human nature we want our national team to win. time and again the national team fails us.  to have a better football future in singapore. everybody have to play a part, and it has to start with the FAS and the players. show us your quality and the fans will be back.mah bow tan is better stuck in his HBD holes than making another mockery of own intelligence again . 2010 my feet!<br></div>

Can defend perhaps and keep the score low but not yet to that quality of defeating every top teams. Maybe once in a while, an upset or so only.<br><br>You know, upsets or giant-killing happens in soccer everywhere in the world.<br><br>Huddersfield from lower division can beat the likes of Arsenal or Manchester United. But who are still stronger? ofcourse Arsenal or Man Utd.<br><br>Singapore is still not good enough. Maybe only hold to draw or occasionally upsetting the bigger teams. These days, defense is better partly because of imported foreign players playing for Singapore.<br><br>Iraq might have lost to Singapore 2-0 once during a qualifer does mean that Singapore is better overall. On that day, Singapore strike form and Iraq was in not so good condition. Skill-wise and physical-wise, Iraq is still better.<br><br>Remember, the return leg, Singapore lost 4-2, finding it hard to repeat the same thing they did in Singapore.<br><br>To prove that Singapore is the top tier of Asian soccer, they have to able to beat any of the top Asian teams anytime, anywhere.<br><br>There is hope but need more effort, money and match experience.
