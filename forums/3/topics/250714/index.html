            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Interview<br>Ronaldinho: Â“Criticism motivates meÂ”<br><img src="http://www.fcbarcelonaweb.co.uk/images/news/070415025044.png"><br><br>Speaking to BarÃ§a TV after BarÃ§a's wonderful 4-0 win over Africa's finest, Al-Ahly, Ronaldinho has told BarÃ§a TV about the criticism which he has had, the truth about his illness last week and about how he is happy at BarÃ§a and is fully focussing on BarÃ§a and hopes to win a domestic double this season.<br><br>How is the personalised training plan?<br>"It has gone very well. I have worked hard. I have to make use of the time that I have to be strong and to be ready for the last few games."<br><br>Did you need a rest?<br>"I did not want to stop, but I had the flu and I lost weight, so it was necessary. Now I feel a lot better."<br><br>People have said that you had glandular fever. Do you defend yourself against that rumour?<br>"Defend myself? No. I simply tell the truth and that was a lie."<br><br>It has been a difficult year, with all the criticism you have received<br>"When the team is not doing well, this is the kind of thing that happens. The lead that we have in the league is deserved. Everyone talks and asks questions. It is something that motivates me and now I am going to try and help the team in the best way that I can."<br><br>Does it surprise you that you are criticised despite being the team's top goalscorer in the league with 17?<br>"People say what they want. To me, it all serves as a motivation to continue playing at my normal level and to end up winning two trophies this season."<br><br>Is your future with BarÃ§a?<br>"I am happy here; I want to finish the season strongly. Players live in the moment and I have to prove that I am good enough to carry on playing here."<br><br>So, you are happy here?<br>"Yes, when I start playing again. I am fine."<br><br>How are things in the dressing room?<br>"The same as always. When you do not win games people start to make things up that are just not true. The squad is the same as always, everyone is motivated. Sometimes we are angry because there are games that we should not have lost, where things did not go well. But we carry on."<br><br>Some rumours state that you do not get on with Samuel Eto'o that well.<br>"I get along with him very well. People do talk a lot and a lot of what is said is not true."<br><br>Let's talk about the good things, like Messi's goal<br>"I was watching it on television and it was one of the best goals I have ever seen and I will always remember it."<br><br>How do you see the team doing towards the end of the season?<br>"We have to keep our feet on the ground. We have to stay calm because we can win both trophies (the league and the Copa del Rey) and we have to fight for that."<br><br>Will you take a holiday or will you play in the Copa AmÃ©rica?<br>"I am only thinking about BarÃ§a. I have had some games now and there more to come and after that we shall see what happens."<br><br>If BarÃ§a do beat Getafe (in the Copa del Rey), will you be available for the final on June 23? Will you not join up with Brazil?<br>"Hopefully I will, yes. I am prepared for that. My thoughts are with BarÃ§a only and to play in all the games here."<br>Written By: FCB-Mo<br>Date: Wed. 25th April 07, 07:31 pm </span></div>
