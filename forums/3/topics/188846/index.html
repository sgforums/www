            <div class='col-md body'>WAYNE RooneyÂ’s World Cup dream was shattered last night after hospital scans revealed multiple fractures in his foot.<br><br>The news England fans had dreaded means the striker is unlikely to take ANY part in the tournament.<br><br>A Â“clusterÂ” of fractures in the superstarÂ’s mid-foot was exposed by a hi-tech CT scanner. A hospital source said grimly: Â“It looks bleak.<br><br>Â“It was originally thought he had suffered a broken metatarsal bone. The scan shows other fractures.<br><br>Â“It will be three to four weeks before his injuries even start to heal. ItÂ’s heartbreaking for both Wayne and all the fans.Â”<br><br>With the World Cup looming in six weeks, England coach Sven Goran Eriksson had hoped the 20-year-old would at least be fit in time for the later stages.<br><br>But the results of yesterdayÂ’s scans at ManchesterÂ’s Whalley Range Hospital make it likely Sven will not risk taking him to Germany at all.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson Â— RooneyÂ’s boss at Manchester United Â— was already at loggerheads with Sven over the injury.<br><br>Fergie accused the England coach of peddling a Â“wild dreamÂ”.<br><br>The source said: Â“Sir Alex believes itÂ’s unrealistic to build up England fansÂ’ hopes that Rooney will make the finals. The scan shows heÂ’s right.<br><br>Â“Wayne will be in plaster for weeks. He has been told thereÂ’s basically nothing more we can do for him except let nature take its course.<br><br>Â“He has to rest and come back for the odd scan to see how heÂ’s getting on but thatÂ’s it.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s very sad for the lad Â— and everyone who loves football."<br><br>Sun Doctor Carol Cooper said: Â“If Wayne has suffered breaks in his mid-foot the situation is far more serious than was feared. With that sort of injury you are looking at a lay-off of three months.<br><br>Â“An ordinary X-ray would not necessarily show fractures like this. ItÂ’s significant it seems to have been exposed on a CT scan.Â”<br><br>The Sun revealed how Rooney is so desperate to play in his first World Cup he has taken to sleeping in an oxygen tent to boost the healing process.<br><br>Earlier yesterday he was upbeat about his chances of taking part in the tournament Â— despite branding the injury Â“horribleÂ”. He said it had left him Â“devastatedÂ”.<br><br>But he declared: Â“IÂ’ll be coming in for treatment every day and trying to give myself the best possible chance.Â”<br><br>The striker said he was determined to remain optimistic despite having to be helped from a car as he arrived at hospital yesterday on crutches.<br><br>Rooney, wearing a special boot on his broken right foot, also showed off his injury at Manchester UnitedÂ’s training ground Â— resting his leg on a table as he relaxed in a chair.<br><br>Â“He has to rest and come back for the odd scan to see how heÂ’s getting on but thatÂ’s it.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s very sad for the lad Â— and everyone who loves football."<br><br>Sun Doctor Carol Cooper said: Â“If Wayne has suffered breaks in his mid-foot the situation is far more serious than was feared.

It was an impact injury and there was a lot of pressure on my foot.<br><br>Â“If you watch the video again you can see thatÂ’s how it happened.Â”<br><br>_________________________________________________________________<br><br>i feel for him  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>hope he recover soon</div>
