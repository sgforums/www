            <div class='col-md body'>All I can say is that Barcelona played very well and even though there are 2 own goals, I find the game very interesting. I think that the red card Del Horno got is abit harsh but the ref has made the choice so I believe it's the correct 1. I still find that Lionel Messi is getting better and better maybe 1 day he might become like ronaldinho.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Barcelona deserves to go through, not just based on the score, but the way they won the tie with some scintillating football. Too overly emphasized on determination and workrate makes a team boring to watch and too much flamboyant football may not get you the desired result, but combining determination and workrate together with flamboyant football is a perfect mix.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>
