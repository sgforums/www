            <div class='col-md body'>Question To All True Blue Chelsea Fans :<br><br>1.   Would you still support Chelsea if they were relegated. Whether by playing badly or some unforeseen circumstances like the Juventus saga?<br><br>2.   Would you still support Chelsea if they went bankrupt when if for some reason, RA kenna jailed by the russian govt for illegal activities?<br><br>3.   Would you still support Chelsea if all the most of the first team palyers left and JM goes on to manage the Portugese national team?<br><br>4.   Would you still have the guts to slime the ManU, Arsenal, Liverpool supporters when Chelsea is not doing well?<br><br>5.   Would you dare to say, "Given a choice, I would rather Chelsea lose the Barca match and let Victoria Buchanan live" ?**<br><br>Would you able to do all these?<br><br>**Victoria Buchanan was head of operations in the Chelsea Pitch Owners Assoc. which effectively made her a Chelsea backroom staff. She was killed in a road accident while riding her bicycle to work on the morning of the Barca match. The players knew her well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">yes to all except 5 because even if chelsea lost to barca she is already dead and she won't be pleased to know that chelsea lost to barca so chelsea should win it for the sake of her and she will be crying for chelsea and sobbing with tears<br><br>if the match is abandoned it is different case<br><br>and for 4 don't need to go and slam other pple club for nothing</span></div>
