Even if you were to use an excuse to disregard my posts, using the reason that people had posted in bar as an excuse is pretty lame.

Yours are cr@p, are it's public opinion. Just ask around, and I don't mean Man U fans. You're welcome to ask those people about my posting in BAR and posting in sports or EPL forums too.<br><br>If you want to talk about what people's posts reflect, then let's take a look at your soccer-related posts. So far, everyone else who has said anything have commented your soccer-related posts are cr@p, and reflect how ignorant you are when it comes to soccer and that you don't know what you're talking about.<br><br>I have nothing I'm ashamed off, but instead of bringing in unrelated issues (i.e: Soccer-related posts in case you're confused ), let's just talk about soccer-related posts.<br><br>Like I said, you have a reputation where knowledge of soccer of concerned. Go figure.<br></div>

Quite honestly, I don't see how posting in BAR means my soccer-related posts are cr@p, unlike you with the reputation. Then again, blind wrong assumptions are so typically you.<br><br>Besides, do you have any idea how long it has been since I posted in BAR? You're welcome to do a search on my nick but see things for totality instead of being so close-minded, like your posts on soccer.<br><br>And if you know how to, you're welcome to search for when was the last time I posted in BAR. I'm sure you'll find it was really long ago.<br><br>But really, I don't see how my unrelated posts in BAR that have no relation in soccer would have anything to do with my posts about soccer. It's such a stupid assumption of yours that I initially chose not to comment.<br><br>Even then, when you try to link my posts in BAR with you do it all wrong. Just really pathetic. It's..... lame, pathetic and weak.<br><br>Let me just ask again, what has posting in BAR got to do with soccer? Did you really have no answer to my comment on your lousy soccer posts that you resort to other ways to attack me? It's only showing even more how poor you are as a person, really.</div>
