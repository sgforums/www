Hence, you're once again getting confused. And you are also confused as to why those nicks are called clones, it is not because they are anti-man u or pro-chelsea. Something I've mentioned a few times. Yet you choose to intepret things your own 'special' way. Which once again like many occassions, leads you to the wrong conclusion.<br><br>Also, the viewpoint that those nicks are clones did not start with me, but rather a lot of people already know them as clones. Just like how everybody knows about you and your illogical soccer judgements (eg;Lampard is better defensively than Gerrard). So to call it my assumption is as wrong as the assumption you think I have. Ghim pheng, confused as always.<br><br>It's so ironic for you to accuse me of assuming when you yourself are the one who assumed wrongly. Really funny indeed. Now, I suggest you read my posts carefully instead of shooting your mouth off and making a fool of yourself.<br><br>Then again, you shoot your mouth off to when it comes to soccer too.
