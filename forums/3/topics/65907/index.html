            <div class='col-md body'>Although injuries causes him to play lesser games and didnt perform really well on the pitch but you cant doubt his ability in the past. He helped Lazio to win the Serie A title at 2000 and also his World Cup display at 1998 was marvellous. Chelsea isnt a very strong team but with Veron, their play changed totally. His creative passes can really make opp defenders blur. Man United must be missing this man in their midfield! All I wanna say is that, Veron is a complete player! He will be the man behind Chelsea success as years goes by...........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wrong.<br><br>Veron was never the complete player.He lacks to0 much defensively.Any team that plays him in central midfield will need to have a very hard working partner for him in the middle of the park.<br><br>He has always been over rated.Why did you think Sir ALex sold him to Chelsea?</div>

Thats where Man U did'nt have with him.<br><br>Great creativity, vision and passing counts for nothing if the player lacks fittness and commitment.<br><br>Back in Lazio Veron was outstanding was because of the other players he was playing with.<br>He did not need to worry much about the defensive duties and ball winning cos Itallian teams are reown for thier defensive, bulldog qualities.<br>With the defensive aspect covered well thats where Veron can do the most damage.<br><br>Though he still poccess the attributes of a quality player, juz look at the number of games he been left out due to lack of match fittness to see that football demands nothing but the highest work antic. highest<br><br></div>
