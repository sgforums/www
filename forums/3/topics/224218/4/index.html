            <div class='col-md body'>i dunno bout ballack, but shev seem so lost.. =X<br><br>Its a pity that he still has not found his form which was what chelsea bougt him over in the first place for. Its too late to say loan him out now becuz you just dun do that to someone whom you paid that much for. Mourinho should review his tactics and see wheres the missing link between shev and the rest of his crew.</div>
