But we are doing best and have shown that we can play without him.<br><br>"Against Chelsea he might not play so we need to do our best without him and I hope we do the job well.<br><br>"We won at Old Trafford and, more recently, against Tottenham when he wasn't there so we can win at Chelsea without him."</span><br><br>It's a real tough ask for Arsenal, especially without striker Thierry Henry. One of Arsenal's problems on the road has been playing against teams that are physical like Chelsea, who eventually will break them down.<br><br>Arsenal can't win the league even if they win as they have just got too much to do.

I am staying here."<br><br>The Ukraine international has struggled to adapt to life in the Premiership since his Â£30m move from AC Milan and he has been linked with a move back to his former club.<br><br>But Shevchenko is adamant that is not going to happen.<br><br>He added: "It is just talk, talk, talk. I never thought once of this situation about going back to Milan.<br><br>"I had difficult times also in Milan but I earned my respect there. What I am doing here is working hard to help the team to win.<br><br>"My role in the team is the same as it was in Milan - no different. But you need time to adapt to the style of play.<br><br>"I have no doubts that when I get into my right form, I will play and my objective is for Chelsea to win something important." </span></div>
