I bet most managers are wise and would use a 451 formation.<br><br>anyway, when mourinho mentioned that MUFC lost 2 pts when they failed to beat Chelsea at home is back to haunt him.

What's his logic??<br>Arsenal put the ball in the goal first.. without four to five 1st teamers, going to a ground where Chelsea has not lost for 51 matches, hey, what you expect?<br><br>Full credit to Arsenal, they did not park the bus in front of their goal, they went and still played their football. At times, it even left Cole on his backside.<br><br>If this young Arsenal side, beaten MUFC, Liverpool and now draw Chelsea, I really fear when they matures.<br><br></div>
