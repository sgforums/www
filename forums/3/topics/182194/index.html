            <div class='col-md body'>Look at the determination and mental strength of this guy and after all the years of trying, to win an event this big, wire-to-wire, local born, mostly self-supported, etc....<br><br>If you play golf, you will know how hard it is to win. Even to make the cut is already so tough. Some critics even say "big names" are missing, what you guys are talking about?  Dougherty , Jyoti and Thaworn are not big names?<br><br>When a swimmer won a Gold in Asian meet last week, I don't feel proud at all.<br>Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that is easy. That is not easy, but I just don't feel proud.<br><br>To those who were at the 18th green (or saw it live on TV) when Mardan par and won, you can see what this guy and his family went through to realise this dream.<br><br>Let's look at how we can fly our Singapore flag proudly and give fund to those who really need help to achieve their dreams.<br><br>Sportsman of the Year ? He should be the Sports Person of the Year at least.</div>
