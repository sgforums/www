              <h1 class="clr">Badminton-Lin Dan in All England final for fifth year running</h1>
              <p>BIRMINGHAM, England, March 8 - World champion Lin Dan of China reached
              the All England final for the fifth year in succession on Saturday with
              a comfortable 21-14 21-14 victory over compatriot Bao Chunlai.</p>
              <p>His opponent on Sunday will be another Chinese, fourth seed Chen Jin
              who beat second seed and former world number one Lee Chong Wei of
              Malaysia 21-18 21-18.</p>
              <p>Top seeded Lin, winner in 2004, 2006 and
              2007, produced a devastating spell from midway in the first game, when
              he trailed 14-12, to capture 10 points in succession and take control.</p>
              <p>Bao, seeded three, managed to pull back from 9-2 down in the second to a more respectable 12-6 down but Lin eased home.</p>
              <p>Chen, winner of last year's Swiss Open, will be making his first All England final appearance after ousting the in-form Lee.</p>
              <p>The Malaysian had started favourite after beating Olympic champion Taufik Hidayat in the quarter-finals on Friday.</p>
              <p>Lee
              made the early running but lost the advantage midway through the first
              game and struggled after that. He managed to save three match points
              from 20-15 down in the second game but finally succumbed to a powerful
              Chen smash.</p>
              <p>Lee, who now heads for next week's Swiss Open, told
              reporters: "I didn't play well at all today. I was very slow. I don't
              know why. I'm very disappointed."</p>
              <p>In the women's final, third
              seed Lu Lan will fly the flag for China after beating seventh seeded Xu
              Huaiwen of Germany 21-13 21-14.</p>
              <p>She will meet either Tine
              Rasmussen of Denmark, who beat world champion Zhu Lin earlier in the
              week, or South Korea's Hwang Hye-youn.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Badminton-Emms in sad All Englands exit</h1>
              <p>BIRMINGHAM, England, March 8 - A capacity crowd turned out at the
              National Indoor Arena on Saturday to cheer one of their favourite
              daughters in her last All England tournament there.</p>
              <p>But the dream of another honour for Olympic silver medallist Gail
              Emms and partner Nathan Robertson was sadly and quite swiftly dashed.</p>
              <p>The
              duo produced a sub-standard display and lost their semi-final 21-18
              21-15 to second seeds Nova Widianto and Liliyana Natsir of Indonesia.</p>
              <p>Emms, 30, is set to retire after the Beijing Olympics and was playing in her last All Englands.</p>
              <p>Robertson
              said: "The crowd support was fantastic but unfortunately we played well
              below our best and made a lot of simple errors when we weren't under
              pressure.</p>
              <p>"You just can't do that at this stage of any tournament
              against a pair like that. They were just too good and we are extremely
              disappointed with our level of play today."</p>
              <p>He added: "When you
              get to the semi-final of the All Englands you should be able to go out
              there fully focused and play up to your best standards but it was not
              meant to be today.</p>
              <p>"Gail's very upset with how she played and I
              know I served terribly today and gave away quite a few points and it's
              not good enough really."</p>
              <p>Robertson and Emms have become popular
              figureheads for badminton in England since their silver medal in
              Athens, topped up by the All England title in 2005 and world
              championship gold in 2006.</p>
              <p>But there has been little success
              since then and the pair need an upturn ahead of the Beijing Games,
              starting with next week's Swiss Open.</p>
              <p>"We have played very well there before so hopefully we can get back to playing very well quickly," said Robertson.</p>
              <p>In Sunday's final, Widianto and Natsir meet holders Zheng Bo and Gao Ling of China.</p>
