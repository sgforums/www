            <div class='col-md body'>tribalfootball.com - May 8, 2006<br><br>Newcastle United caretaker boss Glenn Roeder hopes media pressure won't force Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho to move abroad.<br>Roeder told the Sunday Sun: "I think that the fair bit of criticism he has had is because of a human emotion called jealousy. It's amazing.<br><br>"I would hate to see him leave because I have enjoyed watching him from a distance as a coach. I find him a very interesting person.<br><br>"But I have seen him quoted as saying he does not feel as if he or his team are given the respect they deserve; I can understand where he's coming from.<br><br>"I believe that has a lot to do with the British mentality of building someone up and knocking them back down again.<br><br>"We build people up to be champions and, when they are, we want the underdog to win. If it's David and Goliath, we'll always support David.<br><br>"I don't know whether Jose completely understands that British mentality."<br><br>Chelsea's failure to add Champions League glory to their double Premiership success - allied to the club's unrivalled spending power - has cast Mourinho's true ability into question.<br><br>But Roeder adds: "He has done a brilliant job. Chelsea have run away with the Premiership title twice - they've basically had it won twice by the New Year.<br><br>"He shows no fear whatsoever and because of that he's not frightened to say what's on his mind. Where some people hold back, Jose comes out and speaks his mind.<br><br>"It's pretty obvious he doesn't worry if people don't like what he says, so having him here for the past two years has made the Premiership much more interesting.<br><br>"He's done a great job winding up some very high-profile managers<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Roeder Is Right.............Thank You Roeder and congrats on being the new newcastle boss</span></div>
