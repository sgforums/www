            <div class='col-md body'>Lennon and Walcott get shock England call-ups<br><br>England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson admitted he only decided this morning to name 17-year-old Arsenal forward Theo Walcott in his provisional 23-man World Cup squad.<br><br>RossKinnaird/GettyImages<br>Aaron Lennon: Another surprise choice by Sven for England.<br><br>Eriksson has included Walcott, who has yet to make a Premiership appearance for Arsenal, in his squad alongside Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney and Aaron Lennon - but there are no places for Ledley King, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Jermaine Defoe or Darren Bent.<br><br>Walcott has not played first-team football since his Â£12million move from Southampton in January but is regarded as one of the hottest talents in the game and Eriksson has decided to include him in his squad.<br><br>Eriksson admitted he was taking a gamble and when asked when he made up his mind about Walcott he said: 'Finally this morning. I thought a lot about it during the last month.<br><br>'It is a gamble, of course it is a gamble I can't deny that but it is a nice one. He is a great talent. I have 23 players, why not take one gambling?'<br><br>Manchester United forward Rooney's broken metatarsal is expected to rule him out of the start of the tournament but Eriksson decided to gamble on his talisman's fitness as expected.<br><br>Owen's prolonged recovery from a similar injury has severely limited his match practice and he will head to the finals having played only 31 minutes for his club since December 31.<br><br>The tournament begins in Germany in 32 days with England's first match against Paraguay a day later on June 10.<br><br>Goalkeeper Scott Carson, Charlton right-back Luke Young, Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe, West Ham captain Nigel Reo-Coker and Crystal Palace forward Andrew Johnson have been named on Eriksson's standby list.<br><br>Eriksson will submit his final squad next Monday.<br><br>Lennon has enjoyed an excellent first season in the Premiership since joining Tottenham from Leeds in the summer with his explosive skills and developing maturity.<br><br>Wright-Phillips has been left out after a disappointing season which has seen his first-team opportunities limited since joining Chelsea from Manchester City last season.<br><br>Downing's inclusion rounds off a turbulent season for the left-winger which has been largely marred by injury, before his return to fitness which culminates on Wednesday when Middlesbrough face Sevilla in the UEFA Cup final.<br><br>King is struggling to recover from injury - also a fractured metatarsal - while Defoe has spent much of the season on the bench for Tottenham.<br><br>Eriksson admitted selecting Walcott is a bold move.<br><br>'It's a big gamble, I know it is. I am excited to see him, he's a big talent. And pace in football today is worth a lot. I spoke to Arsene Wenger (Arsenal manager) and he's excited as well, very much so.<br><br>'For me it's a good squad, an interesting squad. There are some new players, some young players and it is an attacking squad with a lot of pace which is necessary in a World Cup.'<br><br>Asked how he decided on his selection, in particular leaving out the likes of Bent and Defoe, Eriksson said: 'Probably not too logically, sometimes you do it on feelings as well and I am excited about Theo Walcott.<br><br>'It would be absolutely crazy if I didn't pick Rooney when there is still a possibility he can play in the World Cup.'<br><br>More to follow...<br><br>Â• Goalkeepers: Robinson (Tottenham), James (Manchester City), Green (Norwich)<br><br>Â• Defenders: G Neville (Manchester United), R Ferdinand (Manchester United), Terry (Chelsea), A Cole (Arsenal), Campbell (Arsenal), Carragher (Liverpool), Bridge (Chelsea)<br><br>Â• Midfielders: Beckham (Real Madrid), Carrick (Tottenham), Lampard (Chelsea), Gerrard (Liverpool), Hargreaves (Bayern Munich), Jenas (Totenham), Downing (Middlesbrough), J Cole (Chelsea), Lennon (Tottenham)<br><br>Â• Forwards: Rooney (Manchester United), Owen (Newcastle), Crouch (Liverpool), Walcott (Arsenal).<br><br>Â• Standby players: Scott Carson, Luke Young, Nigel Reo-Coker, Jermain Defoe, Andy Johnson.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eriksson: I haven't seen walcott play<br><br>Sven-Goran Eriksson admits he may have made the biggest gamble of his entire football career by taking teenager Theo Walcott to the World Cup.<br><br>Eriksson has never seen Arsenal's young striker play a game - except on videotape - and has barely spoken a word to him.<br><br>Walcott, 17, has not even made his debut for the Gunners and has never played a Premiership game.<br><br>But Eriksson is ready to make him England's youngest international footballer because is convinced he can handle the pressure and terrify defenders with his pace.<br><br>Eriksson said: 'Maybe it is my biggest, bravest, boldest gamble. It is a bit of a gamble.<br><br>'If you take a 17-year-old boy to the World Cup of course you cannot be sure.<br><br>'The feeling is that he is ready for it. I don't think he will be nervous or feel the pressure.<br><br>'We have spoken to a lot of people who have had him before. I think he can cope with it, handle it.'<br><br>Walcott will be the second youngest player in World Cup history if he gets on the pitch in Germany.<br><br>Norman Whiteside played for Northern Ireland in Spain 1982, aged 17 years and 41 days.<br><br>Walcott cannot beat Whiteside's record but he can beat Pele, who played in Sweden in 1958 at 17 years and 236 days.<br><br>Eriksson's chief scout Tord Grip went to watch Walcott play for Arsenal reserves in an unofficial match today.<br><br>He played 90 minutes for an Arsenal under-21 team against an Irish under-21 team. The Gunners won 2-1 but he did not score.<br><br>The England boss has only seen him at work in a couple of training sessions but, with Wayne Rooney facing a fight to be fit, decided it was worth a punt on Walcott's electric pace and raw talent.<br><br>Eriksson said: 'I have seen him on videos a lot but never in the flesh. Tord went to see him today playing for the reserves.<br><br>'I spoke to him a couple of weeks ago. I said hello after a training session.'<br><br>Eriksson had to rely on a glowing reference from Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who bought Walcott from Southampton in January in a deal which could rise to Â£12million.<br><br>Wenger insisted the youngster has the right temperament.<br><br>Eriksson said: 'I have not been able to go and see him playing in the Premiership so, of course, I spoke a lot to Arsene Wenger about it.<br><br>'In this case, what Arsene Wenger said was more important than with all the other players.'<br><br>Eriksson admitted he did not make a final decision on Walcott until just hours before he unveiled his 23-man squad in London today.<br><br>The Swede made shock selections with uncapped Tottenham winger Aaron Lennon, 19, and Middlesbrough's Stewart Downing, 21, both making the list.<br><br>The biggest surprise he saved until last and the 23rd name on the list confirmed the rumour that Walcott was in.<br><br>Eriksson said: 'I decided this morning. He has pace, a little bit like Lennon and Downing.<br><br>'He can beat people. Having people like that on the bench could be very good.'<br><br>The England boss admitted he never considered picking Walcott for the friendly against Uruguay in March.<br><br>But suddenly, after Rooney broke his foot, he decided he had to take an extra striker.<br><br>Walcott got the nod ahead of Jermain Defoe and Andrew Johnson, who are both on standby, and Darren Bent, who has missed out completely.<br><br>Eriksson confirmed he will give Walcott a taste of international football in one of the three warm-up games before the squad flies to their World Cup base in Germany.<br><br>His first appearance is likely to be in the B international against Belarus, at Reading, on May 25.<br><br>Walcott could also play in one of the friendlies against Hungary and Jamaica and that would make him the country's youngest international footballer.<br><br>Rooney, who currently holds that record, played against Australia in 2003 at the age of 17 years, 111 days.<br><br>Walcott will be 17 years, 75 days when England take on Hungary at Old Trafford on May 30.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its a brave selection - Walcott and Lennon, and by Eriksson's own admission, a gamble.<br><br>I cannot understand how an international coach like him can pick Walcott, a player whom he has never watched him play, a player who has yet to turn up in Arsenal's colours in the EPL and a player who is still uncapped. The FA pays Eriksson 4m quid annually and he better make sure that its a right decision. I still think Defoe is fitter and a more suitable candidate.</div>
