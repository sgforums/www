Due to law and breach of contract. In any part of Europe,this will happen. Contract stated,he will be manager for 3 years and after 18 months, he is forced to go. Compensation is needed. If he stays out thru this 3 years, including bonus and other incentives++,I believe will mount to 10 million pounds. So to FA,it consider a good deal at 2.9 million as compensation!</div>
