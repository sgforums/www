            <div class='col-md body'>I am sure Benitez is a great bloke, but I am sure all of us are very well aware of what type of attitude problems (or perceive to have due to their sides' dominance) Sir Alex, Mourinho and occationally Wenger have. Sir Alex and Wenger are not so arrogant now adays mainly due to the fact that their sides aint winnning any big trophies of note lately.<br><br>Alias... to acheive great things is easier than to acheive great things and yet remain humble.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hard to see chel$ki's football as good when they prefer to defend and dive.<br><br>ok, winning managers like Fergie and Wenger are disliked because of their success and they are not angels also. They also have streaks of arrogance in them.<br><br>However, moaningho is mainly disliked because of the negative controversies he brings to EPL all in just ONE AND A HALF Seasons. It's ok if there is a russian billionare pouring endless cash into the club (Ranieri was still in charge when Roman came) and tactical football may not be as spectecular as Arsenal or Man Utd's style but it still can be tolerated.<br><br>However, moaningho introduces arrogance and classless attitudes into a whole new level the moment he comes to the EPL. Stealing players from other clubs, insulting other players and mangers, imparting cheating,diving tactics to his players, not acknowledging opponents' superiority all in ONE AND A HALF Seasons are the main reasons why chel$ki and moaningho are so resented.<br><br>Just look at the papers when barca deservedly beat chel$ki. A significant part of those articles are talking about the classlessness of moaningho and criticizing him personally.</div>
