            <div class='col-md body'>Jose Mourinho: An Enemy of Football<br>Added by Gerry on 24 February<br>Firstly, best wishes to Momo Sissoko and Alan Smith on a speedy recovery from their horrendous injuries. On our midweek game, I was disappointed that we lost in our CL tie with Benfica but I was happy to see that Rafa went there with a positive frame of mind and put out a very attacking side. Although Gerrard was rested for the game, we still should have had enough quality on the pitch to have won the game but we didnÂ’t create nearly enough chances and fell to an undeserved defeat through a late Benfica goal. I donÂ’t think Benfica are a good side and if we fail to beat them at Anfield then weÂ’ll only have ourselves to blame.<br><br>However, the real subject of this blog is that contemptable little turd Jose Moaninho, itÂ’s a bit of an epic but this guy really gets on my tits and I want to get it all off my chest. Before I get to the Barcelona game lets have a quick look back at the Â“distinguishedÂ” career of the (not very) special one since heÂ’s come to England. When he first came to manage chelski , he was hailed by certain sections of the media as being Â“a breath of fresh air to the PremiershipÂ”. This was mainly due to the fact that we had endured many years of the petty bickerings of Ferguson and Wenger but Jose has gone on to prove to be far, far worse then them both.<br><br>I could literally write a book about this -beep- and maybe one day I will but for now letÂ’s just have a look at some of the lowlights of his chelski career so far. In the Carling Cup final with Liverpool last season this guy who asks the football world to show him more respect, covered himself in glory by shouting Â“-BEEP- offÂ” at Jamie Carragher from the touchline and when his team got a late equaliser through an OG from StevieG he proceeded to make gestures towards the Liverpool fans. Chelski went on to win the trophy in extra time and of course no action was taken against Moaninho.<br><br>In last seasonÂ’s CL quarter final tie against Barca, chelski were extremely lucky to get a victory. After the first leg Jose threw one of his typical childish tantrums, which he tends to do when things donÂ’t go his way. This time the primary target of his rant was respected referee Anders Frisk and the result of his comments was that Frisk and his family received numerous death threats which forced him to retire from the game. Mourinho was charged and found guilty by UEFA for his part in this despicable affair. One senior UEFA spokesman branded Moaninho, an enemy of football and I totally agree with his sentiments. Curiously the press didnÂ’t dwell too long on the source of the death threats to Frisk and his family but you can be sure that if a similar situation were to arise relating Liverpool then the merest hint of Liverpool fans being involved and it would be plastered all over the back pages.<br><br>In the semi final of the CL they had 180 minutes to score against Liverpool but couldnÂ’t do it. Liverpool scored the only goal of the tie at Anfield but Jose rather childishly continues to say that the ball didnÂ’t cross the line for this goal and it wasnÂ’t a victory. He conveniently forgets the fact that in the lead up to the goal Peter Cech totally flattened Baros in the box and the referee confirmed after the game that if the goal hadnÂ’t been scored, then he would have sent Cech off and awarded Liverpool a penalty. However, facts like these rarely hold any meaning in JoseÂ’s sordid little mind so he ignores them and continues to claim that the linesman who awarded the goal couldnÂ’t possibly have seen the ball crossing the line from his position so far away but as he was a lot closer to it then Jose was, how is it that Jose can be so sure that it didnÂ’t?<br><br>At the end of last season chelski had managed to buy themselves their first title in 50 years and are well on the way to buying another one this year. Saying they bought the title may seem harsh but I believe the facts suggest that this is the case and that it is money rather then Moaninho that is the primary reason for their Premiership success. When LiverpoolÂ’s accounts last year showed that they were in debt to the tune of Â£20 million, major alarm bells were ringing around Anfield and the very future of the club was called into question. A few years ago Leeds Utd had built up debts of between Â£80 and Â£100 million and went bankrupt. However, chelskiÂ’s accounts this year revealed that they had run up debts of a whooping Â£220 million over the last two seasons and yet thanks to their billionaire Russian owner they can brush these debts off.<br><br>This gives Moaninho a huge advantage over his rivals, not through his managerial skills but through his ChairmanÂ’s bank balance. Its clear that rather like the Stamford bridge pitch, we are not playing on a level playing field and JoseÂ’s successes now and in the future will forever be surrounded with question marks because he is not operating under the same constraints as other managers. Benitez, Ferguson and Wenger have certainly spent the money available to them but each of them have known that the wells they were tapping were not bottomless and they have had to keep to a budget and rely on their management skills to do the rest. Can you imagine if these three had limitless budgets and could afford to run up the kind of debts that are brushed away at chelski? Do you think in those circumstances that chelski would now be sitting so far ahead at the top of the table or that they would have even won the Premiership last season? I seriously doubt it.<br><br>Another shady element of JoseÂ’s character is the fact that he is not satisfied at having all the money in the world at his disposal to buy any available player, he also wants to use every dirty method at his disposal to get his hands on the unavailable ones. He has supported and actively participated in illegal approaches to players and staff in the past and IÂ’ve no doubt he will continue to do so in the future. Although he has denied this, it was proven that he was lying and he along with others were found guilty and fined by the FA for their involvement in the tapping up of Ashley Cole, and he wonders why he isnÂ’t given enough respect!<br><br>There have been a couple of incidents in his teamÂ’s encounters with Liverpool this season that are worth mentioning because they have a relevance to their recent Barcelona tie. In one of the CL games, Essien making no attempt to play the ball, assaulted (I wonÂ’t call it a tackle because it bore no resemblance to one) Didi Hamann with a career threatening lunge that the German international was fortunate to walk away from. The referee somehow managed to miss the incident but UEFA reviewed the video evidence and subsequently took action against the player. This decision enraged Jose but rather then having a word with his player who had also committed a similar offence in their game with Bolton a couple of weeks earlier, he bizarrely blamed SKY TV for it instead, saying their decision to Â“constantlyÂ” replay the incident had somehow influenced UEFA. It wasnÂ’t SKY that tried to break DidiÂ’s leg and if Essien had shown more control then they would have had nothing to show but this is typical of Moaninho, rather then deal with the sickening actions of his player he instead goes off on a farcical rant against SKY.<br><br>Of course we all remember the over the top theatrics of that dirty little -beep- Robben in our most recent encounter, when after the tiniest of shoves from Reina he did a triple somersault and two back flips before writhing on the ground in supposed agony in a successful attempt at getting Reina sent off. IÂ’m not suggesting this action influenced the result, Liverpool had bossed the possession but couldnÂ’t take their chances, while chelski took their chances well and were comfortably 2-0 ahead at the time but that being the case, why do it? Amazingly when Jose was asked about the incident he seemed to have lost his tongue and he also barred his players from talking to the press about it. In the end it took him 4 days to make any kind of comment about it and even then it was his usual evasive -beep-. He claimed that Rafa used the Robben incident to deflect from the fact that Liverpool had been well beaten by his side and when further pressed on RobbenÂ’s theatrics, he said that he didnÂ’t want to focus on that one incident and would rather talk about his good play throughout the game instead. Sometimes in football what goes around comes around and this certainly proved to be the case when barely more then 2 weeks later his side faced Barcelona.<br><br>I havenÂ’t even gone into all of the petty bickering and accusations he sees fit to throw at his fellow managers when heÂ’s talking to his press buddies. However, the various items I have mentioned above would each be bad enough on their own but his pre and post match actions in this weeks CL tie with Barca have shown he up to be the most petulant and childish, little two faced -beep- manager the game has ever seen.<br><br>Firstly there was the chelski pitch which currently resembles a quagmire and they not only refused to have it repaired but in a further disgraceful display of gamesmanship were continuing to pour water on to it, less then two hours ahead of the kick-off in a pathetic attempt to prevent Barca from playing their usual brand of free-flowing football. Then in a pre-match interview Jose made a disgraceful comment when he warned the referee to be wary of the Â“BarcelonaÂ” players diving!<br><br>The major flash point of the game itself, occurred when Del Horno was correctly dismissed by the official in the first half for a foul on Messi. Del Horno was fortunate to get away with perhaps an even worse challenge on Messi minutes before the sending off but in the incident itself he made no attempt to play the ball and Messi had to jump to avoid his challenge and was knocked flying. Although it is true to say that Messi did perhaps roll around a bit too much, his reaction pales in comparison to Del HornoÂ’s who went down like a sack of potatoes perhaps in an attempt to feign injury and escape the punishment that was coming his way from the referee. However, he did manage to make a miraculous recovery when he saw that he had been given a red card and there seemed to be plenty of life in his broken body to protest the decision but IÂ’ll come back to this a little later.<br><br>Being down to 10 men seemed to galvanize chelski and although under pressure they did manage to fight back and go in front in the second half thanks to a Barca OG. After this Barcelona showed great character and despite the pitch and the dirty tricks, they went on to put on a brilliant display to eventually win the game 2-1. If it wasnÂ’t for John Terry they could have scored 4 or 5, Terry cleared 2 attempts off the line and Barca were also denied by the crossbar and had a blatant penalty turned down. So a great match and a great victory, not just for Barcelona but for football. So surely after such a great game Jose would be a little bit gracious in defeat and rally his troops for the second leg? Not a bit of it, he instead elected to throw one of his childish tantrums and totally misrepresent the facts of the game.<br><br>Unlike when Robben tried to win an Academy Award by diving all over the place to get Reina sent off two weeks ago, this time Jose had plenty to say and accused Messi of all kinds of theatrics. Of course he failed to make any reference to the even more over the top theatrics of his own player in the same incident. What happened to focusing on the good play and using incidents like this to deflect that your team has been well beaten, Jose? He also rather childishly demanded that Sky Sports reshow the incident 200 times a day, like they did with the previously mentioned Essien incident in an attempt to persuade UEFA to replay the match. His drawing of comparisons between this incident and an incident where the recklessness of one of his players could have potentially ended the career of another player, speaks volumes about the sick mentality of this sad little man. He went on to pretty much say that before the sending off, the game had been an even contest and the referee spoilt the game by reducing them to 10 men. This is total -poof-, before the sending off Barcelona were already clearly on top and the possession stats show that they had 70% of the possession.<br><br>Will this guy never learn from his mistakes? I hear on todayÂ’s news that just like last time, the referee of the Barca game has been receiving death threats from chelski fans again and I have no doubt that this is due in no small part to JoseÂ’s after match rantings. So considering this and the events and comments surrounding the Barca game and all of the other items I have mentioned above, I have come to the conclusion that Jose Mourinho is not just an enemy of football but a total disgrace to the game.<br><br>credits to Gerry....<br></div>

First day watch soccer ar, ah di? Anyway, is there anything to do with Morinho? As far as I know, soccer is fair games. Man U won is fair game, Chelsea won is cheat, you talking about what?

Man U players are the ugliest. I remember once Alan Smith step on Robbie Savage on purpose when Rooney brough him down, so, I think when Alan broke his leg, Robbie has the loudest laugh. And the, What Crespo said, and what Horno does, Mourinho has to reponsible? If then Fukerson should be sentence 1000X times more than Mourinho.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MingFreeman:</div><div class="quote_body">Much more will come definitely......</div></blockquote>You sure or not, ar di?

During the dominance years of Man Utd, Man Utd was and still is the most popular club in the world, but at the same time fans from rival clubs unite to form the other part of the faction, the anti-Man Utd faction. Reasons besides being JEALOUSY, are what the anti-Man Utd fans perceive to be bad antics and of course arrogance from both the manager and the players alike. But I am sure now Mourinho will take over the uncoveted title of "Public Enermy No.1"<br><br>Alias this cycle of you hating me and I hating you goes on, maybe this is what makes football the number 1 game in the world, where emotions and passions dictate the mind of a passionate fan.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

So funny with his English language!<br>When Abramovich took over in 2003,Ranieri's days were said to be numbered and there was a "Keep Ranieri" campaign in the real world and online.<br><br>I still remember seeing him cry after Chelsea knocked Arsenal out of the CL. That was touching man.I am sure many fans worldwide felt a lump in their throat too upon seeing that moment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I observe a lot of posts regarding HafizulKMS .<br><br>I really feel the best way of keeping him shut up with his immature comments is by ignoring him. Don't give him the slightest attention at all. That is what he likes. He just love to see you guys ( man utd fans ) pissed off. So don't bother with a clown like him. I think I will call him the forum's BIG TIME CHARLIE .<br><br>Btw, I am a liverpool fan. ( I like mature debates among club rivals but not his "monkey" taunting . )<br><br>So if he is kbkb again ... let him be .... dont respond to him . Treat him like an outcast just like Chelsea FC themselves.<br><br>I respect them for their skills and the champions of England but not with their attitude. They are setting bad examples to the juniors , just like Mourinho himself. A clown written all over his face .<br><br>HafizulKMS :  Don't bother replying because I will not even notice your existant in the forum.<br><br>Cheers.<br><br>Enjoy the coming match later guys.</div>
