            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fears over Rooney injury</strong><br><br>England striker Wayne Rooney faces an anxious wait to discover the extent of a foot injury which led to him getting carried off on a stretcher during Manchester United's clash with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge - just 41 days before the World Cup.<br><br>The 20-year-old, who is expected to lead England's attack during the World Cup this summer, appeared to pick up a foot injury as he landed awkwardly following a tackle by Chelsea full-back Paulo Ferreira.<br><br>Rooney, whose side were losing 3-0 when he was carried off, injured the same foot during the European Championship quarter-final against Portugal in 2004 which severely affected England's chances of victory.<br><br>Rooney, who will not play in Monday's game at home to Middlesbrough, was later seen on crutches getting onto the United team bus at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was reluctant to speculate about the extent of Rooney's injury. 'We don't know,' he told Sky Sports. 'We'll have to wait until we get to Manchester. He's being looked after and we'll see.<br><br>'When a player is taken off we're always concerned but hopefully Wayne's is not a bad one. He will not be playing on Monday.'<br><br>Ferguson felt his side were punished for failing to take their chances against Chelsea, with goals from William Gallas, Joe Cole and Ricardo Carvalho accounting for the victory.<br><br>'It was harsh,' he added. 'It didn't reflect the run of the game.<br><br>'We had a lot of the play and made some good chances - Edwin van der Sar has not made a save and their keeper has made good saves.<br><br>'We had opportunities and missed them and if you miss them you expect to be beaten.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rooney's World Cup in jeopardy<br><br>Sven-Goran Eriksson must now decide whether to take the biggest gamble of his time as England manager after it was confirmed Wayne Rooney will be out for six weeks after breaking his foot at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Rooney was stretchered off during Manchester United's 3-0 defeat by Chelsea, having suffered the injury in a challenge for possession with Paulo Ferreira.<br><br>And, despite the reassurances of Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, who claimed after the game he had been told by United staff Rooney was `okay', the initial fears as Rooney was taken down the tunnel have now been confirmed.<br><br>'Wayne Rooney has fractured the base of the fourth metatarsal on the right foot and he will be out for six weeks,' said United in a short statement tonight.<br><br>Rooney travelled back to Manchester with his team-mates before heading straight to a private hospital in nearby Whalley Range, where the precise extent of his injury was diagnosed.<br><br>And, with England's opening World Cup game against Paraguay on June 10 exactly six weeks away, Eriksson's dilemma is now obvious.<br><br>When Rooney fractured the fifth metatarsal on the same foot in the Euro 2004 quarter-final defeat to Portugal, it was 10 weeks before he played again.<br><br>Such a lengthy absence would render it pointless taking the 20-year-old to Germany this summer given the obvious loss of fitness.<br><br>However, Rooney is such a key figure in an England side widely tipped to challenge for the trophy, Eriksson may deem it a risk worth taking him even though the former Everton star will definitely miss the final two matches of Manchester United's domestic programme and England's pre-tournament friendlies against Hungary and Jamaica.<br><br>Eriksson has previously indicated he would be prepared to take such a risk if one of his more important players was injured in the build-up to the tournament.<br><br>To this England side, they do not come more important than Rooney, although any decision to take the youngster to Germany would have to be made in consultation with United's medical staff - and Ferguson - to whom the former Everton man is equally important.<br><br>Even to consider letting Rooney join up with England, the United boss would require cast-iron guarantees the player's long-term fitness would not be put at risk.<br><br>Eriksson has already pledged to name a 26-man squad on May 8 before cutting three names from the list on the final FIFA deadline-day a week later.<br><br>Without receiving further clarification from United, it would be a major surprise if Rooney was not in the original party, before Eriksson then decides the precise make-up of his squad.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>rooney will go to WC and play if only England can progress. I believe more of boost at this time.
