You got no other scorer.<br>-&gt; Let's not start to "curse" other team's players just to gain an edge. It is immature and unprofessional. Let's drop this here.<br><br>For once, I am not arrogant, just to put you in place.<br>You are simply too one-dimensional.  Look at Superwhatever, he speaks as if he only knows how to curse and swear. Just a no-brainer.<br><br>Now, SAF to me, has been repeating "putting their feet on the ground".<br>He only responded to Jose's taunts that Chelsea will be on top in Christmas, and then in New Year. And MUFC will drop points after West Ham games, and SAF gamely replied that Chelsea will also too. He is reacting only.<br><br>Look at all postings, didn't Chelsea fans "roar" after the lead was cut to 2pts?<br>So games on, we roar when the lead was extended to 4pts. what's wrong?<br>arrogance?<br><br>Come on, if you want to pull punches, be prepared to take some.<br><br>Yes 4pts is not a lot by some, but mentally, it is a big worry for all.<br>Cause one thing, MUFC could lose focus.<br>secondly, Chelsea will try harder to win, while leaving to counter-attack.<br>lastly, the teams below Chelsea are all winning and the gap is closing.<br><br>anyway, if moderators deem this too offensive, just close the topic.<br><br></div>
