            <div class='col-md body'>He shall leave ManU, coz United no longer has the players feed him with crosses or that final pass for him to score. Ronaldo is more of a showman, crosses are usually too late. rooney dribbles n like the short 1 2 pass, dun think that is RVN style. Beckham gone, RVN stop scoring. So its his time now.</div>

U may say it is alot. but compare to how many goals he score when beckham still around u will see that the 19 goals is not good enough. What RVN need is a team that provide him with chances but i really dun see him getting the service from the midfield.

            <div class='col-md body'>The main problem in Man U now is of course the Central Midfield. They need a Attacking Midfielder And a Defensive midfielder. Scholes is getting too old and Keano is gone. Smith is not the Answer, Fletcher is nt the Answer.<br><br>Defensively, they are alright now. With 2 new signings of Patrice Evra and Nemanja Vidic, and also the return of Gabriel Heinze next season, their Defence looks quite sound.<br><br>At the MOMENT, Man U Do not need any more strikers. They already have the scariest attack(if not the top two scariest attack in EPL ). Louis Saha, Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ryan Giggs, Van Nistelrooy. But giggs is ageing and Van nistelrooy may be leaving. So they may need some reinforcements.<br><br>Im thinking of Morten Gamst Pedersen to replace Giggs..but im nt sure if he suits Man U's Style.. but he certainly has the ability to make an impact.<br><br>However for RVN, i really have no idea who can take his place. Saha? What is he's injured? who will play as the All out Center Forward?<br><br>However as, irreplaceable as RVN is, I have a crazy idea. I know this is mad.. and it might never happen but how about trading Van Nistelrooy to Liverpool in Return for Sissoko? Good deal right? But to bad it has a one in hundred chance of happening.<br><br>Other candidates for the Holding Midfield Role would be Diarra from Lyon, PapaBouba Diop from Fulham , Scott Parker from Newcastle and Michael Carrick from Tottenham.<br><br>For Attacking midfielder, they need someone who can pass, shoot and preferably, tackle. For this.. i really have no idea who can fit the role.<br>Move Rooney back to Offensive Midfield? and play 2 strikers up front?<br></div>
