            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Not my fault that Reina was sent off, says Robben</strong><br><br>Feb 8, 2006<br>The Straits Times<br><br>LONDON - CHELSEA, according to one British newspaper, will beat Manchester United to signing Freddy Adu, the American teenager widely regarded as the most exciting young player on the planet.<br><br>But most of yesterday's media copy was reserved for a more familiar Chelsea face - Arjen Robben.<br><br>Nearly every editorial in the English papers cried out against his 'simulation' in the Premiership match on Sunday, when Liverpool goalkeeper Jose Reina was sent off for stroking the Dutchman's face.<br><br>Robben, upon the contact, fell like a ton of bricks.<br><br>Liverpool must dread playing Chelsea. Over two seasons, Frank Lampard broke Xabi Alonso's ankle, Michael Essien assaulted Dietmar Hamann and an Eidur Gudjohnsen dive that got Alonso suspended for the European Cup semi-final second leg, are some of the incidents which the Reds claimed they have suffered at the hands of the Premiership champions.<br><br>But it was Robben's playacting which has infuriated Liverpool players. Worse, the player was less than sorry and put the blame solely on the Liverpool goalkeeper.<br><br>'Reina was the one who got carried away, not me. He made a crazy challenge on Eidur over by the touchline and I told him so when he ran past on his way back to the goal,' said Robben.<br><br>'I can't remember the exact words I used, but it was something along the lines of 'That was a stupid thing to do, wasn't it?' The next thing I know, he swings round and reacts with his hands.<br><br>'I don't see how I can be blamed for that. I wasn't the one who lost control. I don't think people from Liverpool should be talking about me, either. They should be having a look at themselves.'<br><br>His manager Jose Mourinho has told the squad not to discuss the Dutchman. But, according to The Independent, some of the Chelsea players felt that Robben's reaction to a gentle shove from Reina was shameful.<br><br>Robben was described as 'embarrassing' by the former Chelsea player Pat Nevin, and 'disgraceful' by the ex-Liverpool defender Alan Hansen.<br><br>Reina, who will be suspended for three games after the red card, said: 'Robben is a big actor and he did well enough to win an Oscar. I would never hurt another player in the way Robben suggested by collapsing.<br><br>'Robben is an excellent player but he was deceitful with the way he behaved.'<br><br>The 2-0 victory effectively wrapped up Chelsea's quest for a second Premiership title - they are now 15 points clear atop the table, four more than this time last season.<br><br>Winning the FA Cup could be as easy.<br><br>The Blues face Everton today in one of four fourth-round replays following last month's 1-1 tie at Goodison Park. The winner will host Colchester of League One for a place in the quarter-finals.<br><br>With last year's winners Arsenal already out, and Liverpool and Manchester United facing each other in the fifth round, Mourinho has a great chance to add soccer's oldest cup to his collection.<br><br>He is already planning for Chelsea's continued domination.<br><br>According to The Times, Chelsea's negotiations for Adu with Major League Soccer, which owns his registration, are at an advanced stage.<br><br>The 16-year-old forward is expected to move to London in the summer, by which time he hopes to have become the youngest player to feature in a World Cup tournament.<br><br>News that Chelsea could snare Adu will upset United, given that Chelsea will now have a entry point into the enormous commercial benefits in the US.<br><br>Sources at Stamford Bridge say that the initial outlay will be about £5 million (S$14.45 million) for Adu.<br><br>Last summer, Adu played against Chelsea for DC United in a friendly in Washington and said: 'Hopefully one day I can end up playing with those guys rather than against them. They're my favourite team.'<br><br>Should Adu get his wish, it would be another remarkable development in the life of a boy who moved to the US from Ghana at the age of eight after his mother won a Green Card lottery.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Man Utd 2 midfielders short - Van der Sar<br>tribalfootball.com - February 10, 2006<br><br>Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar has told manager Sir Alex Ferguson his squad is two midfielders short.<br><br>Fergie spent Â£12 million on Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra, even though his side were crying out for a new face in midfield.<br><br>And goalkeeper Van der Sar admitted the lack of a world-class midfielder could see United struggle in their pursuit of the Carling Cup, FA Cup and second spot in the Premiership.<br><br>"The manager bought two defensive players in January and that means we're very strong in that department," he said.<br><br>"And up front we're capable of causing damage to any team. So one or two midfield players, whether they are short or long term solutions, would make a real difference to us. We'd be much stronger."<br><br><span style="color: red;">Same As what I had Suggested 2 midfielders !</span></div>
