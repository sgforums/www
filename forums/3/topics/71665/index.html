            <div class='col-md body'>Just to share tips ,<br><br>"A fundamental part of playing tennis is keeping your eye on the ball. But if that's all you're watching, you're not utilizing a key visual tool: your peripheral vision. Try this experiment:<br><br>Hold your palm up in front of your face. Pull it away from your nose and focus on the lines in your palm. While your eyes are fixed on this small area, notice how you are able to identify all the things beyond your hand without looking at them directly.<br><br>Peripheral Awareness (PA) is the ability to keep focused centrally while being aware of essential information around you. PA is used every day and is essential in almost every sport. In some, like boxing and auto racing, PA can be lifesaving.<br><br>During a rally, players can use PA to heighten court awareness. While watching the ball, for example, your peripheral vision can help you see an opponent charging the net, standing too far behind the baseline, or leaving one side of the court vulnerable because he's protecting his backhand.<br><br>Next time you hit the court, use your peripheral skills and you'll gain an edge over your competition."<br><br>4 those interested go to http://www.tennis.com<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

While your strokes may be technically sound, if you're not in the right position to execute them, it won't matter. One way to improve your movement is to think like a soccer player.<br><br>In soccer, players always move aggressively toward the ball or attack the ball with their feet so the ball will not be stolen. In tennis, this means never letting the ball come to you. Attacking the ball with you feet and moving your body weight into the shot will put you in a better position to hit consistently.

            <div class='col-md body'>hi takis kakis,<br><br>Tips to share  : <strong>Keep your head up while serving</strong><br><br>- Everything about your serve feels fine. Your motion is just the way you want it, the toss is in the right place, but the ball still goes into the net. WhatÂ’s wrong? Ans: Your eyes may be part of the problem.<br><br>- Many players make the mistake of looking in the direction of their targets right before hitting the ball. ItÂ’s a common error and can cause a solid serve to fail.<br><br>- When you look away just before you strike the ball, you inevitably lower your head slightly, which, in turn  tilts your upper body forward a bit. This causes you to pull your hitting arm ahead just a tad.  It may not seem like much, but itÂ’s often the difference between a good serve and a fault into the net. Instead, watch the ball all the way to the point of impact. Not only will this increase your serveÂ’s chances of clearing the net, it will improve the odds of hitting the ball in the center of the racquet.<br><br>Practice make perfect.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>waiting....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tips for all beginners,<br><br><strong>Go for high lob</strong><br><br>Hitting a lob really high is a smart defensive move for a number of reasons:<br><br>- High lobs buy time: Defensive lobs are usually hit when you're out of position and trying to gain time to recover. Lofting the ball higher keeps it in the air longer and gives you more time to get back to the center of the court.<br><br>- High lobs are difficult to smash: Since the ball gains speed as it's dropping, high lobs travel faster than shallow lobs. Only players with excellent overheads will attempt to smash high lobs before they bounce. Most players will wait for the ball to bounce and hit a ground stroke rather than an overhead.<br><br>- High lobs go deeper: The higher the lob, the deeper the ball will land. And deep lobs can be trouble for lots of recreational players. You may be surprised when you find out how many of your opponents are ill-equipped to handle high-bouncing lobs that land deep in the court.<br><br>- High lobs will make a beginner more time to position him/herself for the return ball.<br><br>The above tip is one of  the simple trick for a real beginner to try out for a shot with the intermediate players on the court.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tip for all: Return Every Ball<br><br>- If u're like most people, yr time on the tennis court is limited and u don't like to waste it. And when u practice one of your goals is to hit as many balls as u can. U can immediately improve yr practice sessions and hit more shots y doing 1 simple thing: Return balls that go out.<br><br>- Many players like to give up a rally whenever someone hits a ball that goes beyond the lines. Don't do that. Try to return every shot that u can get to even if it's out. This will do several things for u. First, u'll immediately start to hit more balls. Second, u'll be forced to hit more of them that r outside yr comfort zone, which will challenge u to move faster and prepare earlier. Plus, u'll find that u have to learn to hit on the rise to return many shots that go beyond the baseline. Sure, the goal of everyone on the court is to keep the ball within the lines whenever possible, but just because someone hits a ball that goes a few feet outside of them there's no reason to interrupt a rally and start over.<br><br>- Practice make perfect... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>waiting.....<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Hi 2 all tennis lovers;<br><strong>Hit softly</strong><br><br>- With all the emphasis on power these days, it's easy for beginner to overlook the effectiveness of soft, off-pace shots. While pushing a gentle, easy ball over the net can be disastrous at the professional level, it's often a smart play for beginner and intermediate players. Hitting without much power can be unsettling to your opponent. Here's why:<br><br>- When a player delivers a crisply struck shot it's easy for an opponent to use that pace to get the ball back. But effectively returning a shot with little power requires a player to create pace, and that demands polished technique, something most intermediates lack.

While pushing a gentle, easy ball over the net can be disastrous at the professional level, it's often a smart play for beginner and intermediate players.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all beginners;<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Share tip for all,<br><br><strong>How to return a low volley</strong><br><br>- On volleys, weÂ’re taught to keep the racquet head above the wrist. But on the low volley, your first step should be to drop the racquet head to where you estimate the ball will be. With this immediate preparation, there should be time for a pause to stabilize the racquet before you start your volley swing.<br><br>- LetÂ’s say the ball is going to be at your ankles. You should prepare your racquet at that level with an open racquet face so you can get it in line with the flight of the ball. This way youÂ’ll be hitting the back of the ball (not the top of it) and moving your racquet from low to high on a diagonal line. Your follow-through should move upward as you lift the ball over the net on the same path and angle that it came in on. Instead of popping the ball up with too much underspin, now youÂ’re driving the ball over the tape and being aggressive with your low volleys.<br><br>waiting..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

Winning canÂ’t be controlled, but a winning attitude can and needs to be. Players achieve confidence in a variety of ways. Before matches, ones can tell himself/herself  " I can play like Pete Sampras with confidence. Find the approach that works best for you, then do it regularly.<br>Builds confidence with a Â“good practice before the match.Â” Nothing establishes self-assurance like solid preparation.<br><br><strong>Remaining in the Present</strong><br><br>A match is about right now. ItÂ’s not about looking forward or back. Players must stay absorbed in the present. Concentration is a weapon that usually goes undetected by the opponent. Thoughts and feelings, or external sights and sounds, distract players at all levels. Remaining focused is tough and becomes even harder when itÂ’s a conscious effort.<br><br>Allow focus to come naturally by enjoying the battle and remaining absorbed in the moment rather than worrying about the score. Dent focuses by thinking Â“watch the ballÂ” and Â“play your own game.Â”<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
