              <li><br></li>
              <li><strong>Bolton boss Gary Megson has blasted the "nonsense'' penalty decision that cost
                  his side the chance of a point or 3 at Manchester United this afternoon.</strong> <strong>Ronaldo scored the penalty, paving the way for a 2-0 win and an unhappy
                  Megson. </strong></li>
              <li id="quotes">
              <p><strong> "It was a nonsense decision,'' argued Megson. </strong></p>
              <p><strong> "When Rob Styles blew the whistle I thought he was going to book Ronaldo for
                  diving. He did not seem to be sure what he was going to give. </strong></p>
              <p><strong> "My thoughts on the tackle were the same as everyone else's in the stadium
                  apart from one man. When the referee sees it again, he will have the same
                  opinion too. It really sticks in the throat.'' </strong></p>
              <p><strong> It is not the first time Styles has attracted criticism for a debatable penalty
                  decision.</strong></p>
              <p><strong> "I don't want him to ring me up,'' added Megson. </strong></p>
              <p><strong> "I would have more respect for him if he just holds his hands up and says he
                  was wrong. "If he tried to justify that it will be incredible. </strong></p>
              <p><strong> "I don't know if we would have gone on to get something out of the game but we
                  certainly would not have gone 4-4-2 and we would not have made changes to try
                  and score.'' </strong></p>
              <p><strong> Even Ferguson accepted Styles had got it wrong, although as the official has
                  previously angered the United boss with his decision-making, he does not feel
                  much sympathy. </strong></p>
              <p><strong> "I was surprised because it looked as though their lad got a foot on the
                  ball,'' said Ferguson. </strong></p>
              <p><strong> "But Rob Styles turned us down four or five times last year so maybe it is
                  payback time. But he still owes us another four.'' </strong></p>
              <p><strong> Wayne Rooney's another dubious finish 11 minutes from time doubled United's lead, the
                  England striker's first goal of the season a perfect response to being left out
                  of Ferguson's starting line-up. </strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong> That is of little consequence to Megson though, having seen an hour's worth of
                  honest endeavour get no reward. </strong></p>
              <p><strong> "I want to see the right decisions made,'' said Megson, whose side had the
                  best chance up to that point when Fabrice Muamba fired wide from an excellent
                  position. </strong></p>
              <p><strong> "If TV replays take too long then we won't do them but from looking at other
                  sports, TV can do these things. </strong></p>
              <p><strong> "They talk about dropping the referee but what does that solve? It is just a
                  symbolic gesture. </strong></p>
              <p><strong> "Everybody knows what happened. Jlloyd Samuel won the ball. It is
                  astonishing.''</strong></p>

              <p>he said he changed the whole game of football right? claiming
              that he, as a winger, can score more than a striker.</p>
              <p>oh yea, he certainly left out the consistent diving and play
              acting involved ever since his introduction to bpl that also
              changed the game of football.</p>
              <p>i agree his performance ought to be recognised. but i don't
              feel right for a recipient of such award to be a constant
              cheap thriller.</p>

              <p>as Eddie Guerrero would say: 'Cheat to Win!'</p>
              <p>nah, just joking....</p>
              <p>honestly, at least for me, my support for Man U stems from the hard work done by the previous generations of players like Cantona, Sharpe, Schmeichel, Bruce and Pallister and many more, which ensured MU's dominance in the mid-90s. Just because of Ronaldo's diving, we wouldn't stop supporting Man U. Much like how ppl support Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, the support is FOREVER, haha!</p>
