              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Singapore Paintball Novice Series (SPNS) 2009 Leg 1 – “Bringing paintball closer to heart…”</span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">1 February 2009 – The location of SPNS 2009 Leg 1 was no stranger to any local paintball teams in Singapore, it was held in Red Dynasty Paintball Park located in the premises of the Bottle Tree Park (Yishun) and played over the driest month in Singapore’s history in the last 10 years. The comforting part about this dry month is that for the first time in the history of SPNS, the participants will not be playing under wet conditions and to the organizers and participants; this could just be a blessing in disguise. In this leg of the competition, we saw the participation of 9 paintball teams with an estimated turnout of about 120 participants and supporters. Since its intervention in March 2008, SPNS has since been recognized as the official paintball event by local paintballers. SPNS is organized by the Paintball Association (Singapore) and is supported by various stakeholders such as the Singapore Sports Council, Red Dynasty Paintball Park, Bottle Tree Park, etc. The PBAS has since registered up to 200 tournament players in its database and this list is ever growing. Participants who are keen to participate in the SPNS will have to undergo a 2 hour course known as the Basic Tournament Orientation (BTO) which comprises of a theory and a practical test. The objective of the BTO is to allow participants to understand the safety aspects of playing tournament paintball and the tournament rules and regulations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><img src="http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s97/redsevens/SPNS/SPNS09Leg1%201Feb09/SPNS09_Leg1_131.jpg" alt=""></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As participating teams strolled into the field to gear up for the event, you cannot help but to notice that there were a few who were already trying to catch a last glimpse of the field set up.<span>  </span>“Walking the field” is an important part of paintball as it gives the team a head start to better strategized game plan. A common scenario in the preparation of a tournament is to see teams equipping themselves with protective gears, equipment and eventually ending off with a light warm up to gets their adrenaline flowing. This keeps the player both physiologically and psychologically prepared.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Each participating team was to play a round of 8 games in a round robin format in the qualifying rounds with the top 4 teams advancing into the Semi Finals and beyond. Team Red West which was the eventual Champion of SPNS 2009 Leg 1 was formed only 3 weeks prior to the closing of the registration date. The team which comprises of 4 players is made up of 2 international students from the Singapore American School, a student from Republic Polytechnic and a full time national serviceman with the Singapore Police Force. Playing for their first time together, the boys who are no strangers to paintball (having played recreational paintball before) did well with an impressive run of wins of 7 games and 1 loss. Other participating teams of the SPNS 2009 Leg 1 include team Evil Avengers (who was featured in the TNP Newpaper recently), Red Fraction, Contract Killers, Wargh!Nuts, Dark Militia, Death Mavericks, Kamikaze and a Filipino team known as the PSG Warfreakz Bravo.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><img src="http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s97/redsevens/SPNS/SPNS09Leg1%201Feb09/SPNS09_Leg1_216.jpg" alt=""></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In this year’s competition, a new segment known as the “Top Gun Challenge (TGC)” has been added to spice up the tournament where each team will send a representative to compete in a one on one competition which tests the fundamental skills of snap shooting and marker handling. Gerald Lee from the Red West was crowned the YGC champion after eliminating 2 other opponents in this skilled test challenge. Ng Chee Yong who plays for Kamikaze was awarded the title of the Most Valuable Player (MVP) during the competition leg. A 2<sup>nd</sup> year student from Nanyang Polytechnic, Ng started playing paintball about 1 year ago and has since been hooked to the game which promotes self confidence and teamwork. “Anything can happen in paintball, winning the MVP is only part of the process…” exclaimed Ng when asked if he questioned if paintball is a game of chance and luck.</span></p>

              <div>Singapore Paintball Novice Series (SPNS) 2009 Leg 2 – Pasir Ris Park, Native Lawn<br></div>
              <br>
              <div>Bringing Paintball to the Hearts”<br><br>For the first time in Singapore, a competitive paintball tournament was held beyond a licensed paintball centre in Singapore. Established in 2008 and organized by the Paintball Association (Singapore), PBAS, SPNS 2009 Leg 2 sets its foot on a national park located in the eastern coast of the Singapore’s shores, Pasir Ris Park. Supported by the Singapore Sports Council and the National Parks Board, this leg of the competition saw 13 paintball teams vying for Singapore’s top paintball honour. With the slogan of “Bringing Paintball to the Hearts”, the objective of organizing the competition in a public park allows PBAS to showcase the sport of paintball to the heart of the community. This is also the first time that a 5-men competition format is adopted in the SPNS as compared to the previous legs of a 3 men and 4 men format.<br><br><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TmAua_0ZcXk/ShWMmRMhj8I/AAAAAAAAAbI/5-bOx_5OWnc/s1600-h/SPNS09_Leg2_261.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5338327522396442562" style="width: 320px; cursor: hand; height: 213px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TmAua_0ZcXk/ShWMmRMhj8I/AAAAAAAAAbI/5-bOx_5OWnc/s320/SPNS09_Leg2_261.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br><br></div>
              <div>Introduced to Singaporeans in 2008, competitive paintball otherwise known as speedball is increasingly gaining its popularity in Singapore. Efforts by PBAS to promote this sport have been significant with roadshows in tertiary institutions such as Singapore Polytechnic and Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Singapore Polytechnic has also recently become the first Singapore institution to introduce the sport of speedball to its students and armed with the intention of establishing a paintball club in the school.<br><br><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TmAua_0ZcXk/ShWMl9EpV1I/AAAAAAAAAa4/AckZ2glLaqM/s1600-h/SPNS09_Leg2_236.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5338327516994688850" style="width: 213px; cursor: hand; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TmAua_0ZcXk/ShWMl9EpV1I/AAAAAAAAAa4/AckZ2glLaqM/s320/SPNS09_Leg2_236.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br><br>Another historical event is the conduct of the Malaysia Marshal Level 1 marshalling certification course for 6 local paintball referees by Mr. Junaidi Khalil who is the Head Referee in Asia with marshalling experiences in the Asia Paintball Invitational Tournament 2008 in Kao Hsiung, Taiwan and the Asia World Cup since 2007. "The Certification Course helped to raise the competency of many of the new recruits to local refereeing" added Benedict Chen, a second year student from the National University of Singapore who took on the Head Referee role during the SPNS. Indeed, the certification course and cross learning between the Singapore and Malaysia marshals helped to unify the conduct of the sport with similar regulations across the borders.</div>

              <div><br>Team Red West who was the champion team in leg 1 of SPNS 2009 managed to defend their title by clinching another champion medal in this leg of the competition. With 3 of its players playing for the Red Sevens team, a Singapore Division 3 team participating in the Malaysia Paintball Official Circuit (MPOC) and Malaysia National Paintball League (MY-NPL), the Red West team displayed immense teamwork and proficiency to qualify for the 1st position during the 8 qualifying games and eventually winning the title. Five-O, participating for the first time in the SPNS took home the 2nd position after a series of impressive games against some of the top sides in the series such as Kamikaze and Dark Militia in Round 2 of the tournament. Last leg’s runners-up, Contract Killers, concluded the day with a 3rd position placing and Dark Militia claiming the 4th position. One of the most exciting segments of the tournament was the “Top Gun” Division where teams would send a representative to compete in a 1-on-1 paintball game where spectators of the event were involved in delivering sideline coaching. The “Top Gun” Division is a test of a player’s individual skills and of his ability to cope with the immense pressure of the match under the eyes of a crowd. This leg’s “Top Gun” Division was won by Sean Low, a student from Pei Cai Secondary School who has been playing paintball as a competitive sport for more than 2 years. His team the Death Mavericks was in 3rd position after the qualifying rounds.<br><br><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TmAua_0ZcXk/ShWMlpu6opI/AAAAAAAAAaw/dlVaUaPPSPo/s1600-h/SPNS09_Leg2_002.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5338327511803273874" style="width: 320px; cursor: hand; height: 213px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TmAua_0ZcXk/ShWMlpu6opI/AAAAAAAAAaw/dlVaUaPPSPo/s320/SPNS09_Leg2_002.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br><br>“We have seen vast improvement in the level of the game. Participants are getting more skilful and technically sound as compared to last year. To continue developing paintball, we’ll need the local authorities to reconsider the classification of paintball markers as a firearm but as a sporting equipment, similar to a foil in fencing, a bow in archery or a bat in softball” exclaimed Jane Koh, President of the Paintball Association (Singapore) who is also the Tournament Director since the dawn of the SPNS. While many consider this event as a big leap for Singapore paintball, there are still many aspects of the sport that needs to be addressed to develop this sport into a mainstream sport. Through awareness program and paintball clinics, this sport will soon do away with the common branding of being “jungle-game, painful or just plain shooting”.<br></div>
