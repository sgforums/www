Yeah, but people like Poolman still thinks that the abilities of Gerard, Lampard are still way superior compared to Kaka, Ronaldinho, Adriano and Ronaldo. Reason is that people like him are not exposed to other leagues and the players that played in them. A frog in the well mentality.<br><br>Just like if you just watch Fandi Admad only, (no disrepect to him) you will think he is the best footballer in the world.</div>
