            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">Real Madrid have reportedly agreed to offer ManYoo Â£54m for Cristiano Ronaldo this summer.<br><br>The Portuguese winger has been in dazzling form this season and is currently widely regarded as the best player in the world. However, his spellbinding performances, both in the Premiership and Champions League, have also made him the hottest property in world football and ManYoo face a fight to retain his services beyond the current campaign.<br><br>Having stalled on extending his Old Trafford contract, Ronaldo has been repeatedly linked with a move to the BernabÃ©u and it is understood that the Spanish giants have made him their number one target this summer.<br><br>According to The Guardian, 'Real Madrid have stepped up their attempt to sign by meeting his agent and agreeing a course of action that directors at the Santiago believe will end with the Portugal winger becoming their latest galÃ¡ctico.<br><br>'Franco Baldini, right-hand man to Madrid's sporting director, Predrag Mijatovic, and the man who negotiates all of the club's signings, met Jorge Mendes in London last Wednesday.<br><br>'Sources at Madrid claim that during the meeting, Baldini confirmed that Ronaldo is their No1 priority for next season and informed Mendes that they would be prepared to meet Manchester United's asking price for the winger - expected to be somewhere in the region of Euro 80m (Â£54m).'<br><br>Any such deal would represent a new world-record transfer fee, usurping the Â£46m spent by Madrid in 2002 on Zinedine Zidane. </span><br><br>it was reported that Real had agreed to offer ManU Â£54m for his services but is he worth that kind of money? would ManU really let him go? would Chelsea come after him if ManU is willing to let him go?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea may not have the luxury of huge fundings they enjoyed the past few years. On the contrary Liverpool may have the fundings to fight with Real Madrid. Lets not forget Barcelona too is keen in Ronaldo.<br><br>Besides, Ronaldo said he wanted to stay at MANU for a few more years (at least a few more) so unless he want to break on his own word, he is not going to another club for the next few years...<br><br>Of course if MANU wanted to sell him, that is another matter...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Didn't Becks come out and tell Ronaldo NOT to head to Real Madrid?<br><br>They just aren't the force they once were. They're pretty clueless at times with their football, and great footballers all together doesn't necessarily make a good squad.<br><br>Besides, while I'm not showing any favouritism here, being a United fan and all, i just feel that if Ronaldo goes to RM, his development as a player will slow considerably. Sure, he'll have some top players there that he can learn from, but how many managers has RM gone thru? I always believe that you need time to develop a team, no matter how talented your players are. You need someone who is quality to see a player thru his development. I'm not saying that Capello isn't quality though, all i'm saying is that he might not have the time to let it show and that can lead to a compromise in certain areas.<br><br>Still, in the business sense of it, it'll be great. Especially for a club that has horrendous money management, they'll need to sell as many shirts and fill as many seats as possible.</div>
