            <div class='col-md body'>two points I want to make,<br><br>first, we need to consider club form. Lampard won the league twice.<br>Gerrard none. Considering the pool of stars, Lampard is surrounded with, he loses on this.<br><br>then european cup and Fa, we all know how the heroic of Gerrard won the club the European and then the FA. So on that, Gerrard outshone Lampard.<br><br>second, the big stage.<br>Look at how both perform on the stage.<br><br>Gerrard shone, Lampard bomb.<br><br>As for those stats taker, take the important matches.. Like the WC. I think Lampard stats will enable him an auto drop.<br><br>And that happen in the last England game right??<br><br>Case closed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>gerrard won european biggest prize before and won the FA cup through his very own effort, more like a one man show. can lampard ever do that in those knockout stages? knockout stages is, once u're out means u're out. u only got 1 chance n u got to deliver if not u're out. whereas league, u might lose 3 pts today, but other teams might drop pts too.. final result will only be shown after a total number of 38 games is played.. its all about consistency. in term of effective, gerrard is definitely high up there. dont forget, lampard is team up with a bunch of superstar footballers status. liverpool can never match them. only manager benitez triumph over mourinho in term of tactical knowledge.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>its the way the team play that makes Lampard stand out more the Gerrard, no denying that Lampard is a great midfielder but the main reason for his outstanding form for the past 2 years is because the manager plays with 1 striker and have their midfielder attacking from every angle to support, this season Lampard was being made to do more midfield work hence resulting in his pretty normal stats against last few years, guess there is no way to say one is better then other, its like people comparing Pele against Maradona, Baggio against Romario, comparing Muller against Klinsmann all are the best in their own way regardless of how their stats reads, its just an opinion, a personal opinion.</div>
