He only played 38 games compare to LampardÂ’s 43 (League &amp; CL) + another 4 in FA cup total 47<br><br>So if you were to take away LampardÂ’s 2 in the FA cup and base on this, Kaka scored 19 goals in 38 matches, Lampared 18 goals in 43 matches. But more importantly, if you want to count all competitions including internationals, Kaka scored 24 Goals to LamparedÂ’s 20.<br><br>Juan Roman Riquelme also scored 24 in all competitions last season. But look at his shot on goal in La Liga &amp; CL total = 28 shots with 14 goals. LampardÂ’s total = 73 shots with 18 goals. If you were to see the ratio, every 2 shots Riquelme gets a goalÂ… with Lampard, he gets 1 goal in 4 shots.<br><br>Stats taken from ESPN soccernet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

I feel he had a disatrous WC from someone of his high standard..<br><br>And if talk about playing for England(abit off topic), we have to understand Stevie was restrain from becoming more attacking under SGE..<br><br>Look at how well he did on the right for the past 2 games..<br><br>Lampard n Gerrard are top class players..
