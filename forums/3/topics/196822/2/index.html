Yes he can play both left and right wing but his best position is still the front role. In addition, SWP wins hand down ? What did he win ? He didnt win first team. Thats for sure, his $21 million was Overpriced and among all 4 deals stated, it was the worst deal of all. Ronaldo and Hieb are better deals if you ask me. Cost less and much more effective .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u guys are crazy...<br><br>since when is bellamy a natural right winger...? he was and will always be naturally a striker... did u guys even remember that one of the reasons bellamy had a tiff with souey was bcoz he was being played out of position at right wing? now if benitez were to use bellamy as a winger than he's gonna create some dressing room tension over time...</div>

Mikael Silvestre didn't want to play in the left back spot prefering centre but accepted when he wanted to play in the first team instead of losing his place... same goes for Gallas at chelsea, L king at spurs central defence, move to holding midfield for england... its a matter of how big is a club. If the player is a star player and the club is small with no other star players, then he may get demanding. But if the club is big, they normally toe the line... There are so many such cases, Carragher, want centre but has to settle for right back spot, K richardson, wanted to play left winger but accept left back spot. Brown centre became right back. Look at chelsea, so many star players but they don't dare to ask for things cos they know they can be replace if they are too much... But of course, Gallas is a different case. He knows a bigger club wants him (AC Milan) so he can be demanding.<br><br>Yeah when i said win hands down, i meant in transfer fee... thats why i asked who is a better value for money.</div>
