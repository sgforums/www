            <div class='col-md body'>On a more serious, matured, and well thought manner of expressing one's views, here's my opinion on who United should 'get rid' in the summer.<br><br>1. Paul Scholes<br>Clearly past his prime. Maybe he should not have retired from international scene so early, it has clearly affected his level of performance since.<br><br>2. Darren Fletcher<br>Lack of pace, skills, and crossing ability when playing on the right. And certainly not the world class central midfielder that a club of United's status should be playing week in week out.<br><br>3. Wes Brown<br>Too error prone, whether playing on the right or central defence.<br><br>4. Most importantly, Sir Alex Ferguson<br>He should leave, because he has lost his motivational ability on the players.<br><br>In the summer, they should bring in<br><br>1. A world class manager. Possible short listed candidates<br>- Fabio Capello (reknowned for managing clubs from different countries; have yet to come to england to ply his trade; but the pace and robust style of the EPL may work against him and his more familiar tactics, as shown in Rafa benitez at Liverpool)<br>- Steve McClaren (i think he is a suitable candidate for the job in terms of familiarisation of the club system, and experience of managing an english club)<br>- Martin O'Niell (If he manage to rediscover his winning touch, would be able to breathe new life into the club with his own brand of football, and we shall see a different and more efficient United)<br><br>2. A world class centre half and left back<br>Silvestre and O'shea should certainly not be featuring in the United first team because of their inability to perform consistently. Their role in the club should be as cover to the first team. Ferdinand and Neville will fill the remaining defensive spots.<br><br>3. A world class left winger and a central midfielder in the mould of Gerard, Lampard and Ballack<br>Giggs is past his prime, Richardson at best should be cover for left wing. A truly classy left winger required.<br>Most important figure in the team is missing. The team needs a 'lampard', 'gerard' or 'ballack' to partner Keane in the middle. Some one who can compliment Keane's defensive play and also able to score and create goals freely from midfield. Someone with high influential ability is a bonus.<br>On the right side, the new boss needs to bring the best out of Ronaldo. He is still not making full use of his natural ability.<br><br>4. If they have sufficient funds, then they may want to keep a lookout for a goalie. If not, van der sar is fine.<br><br>So the first team should look like this<br><br>Van der Sar<br>Neville      Ferdinand        'blank'        'blank'<br>Ronaldo    Keane          'blank'         'blank'<br>Rooney<br>RVN<br><br>The rest of the players in the club will all be squad players waiting to cover the respective positions.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it has nothing to do with beckham.<br><br>their problem lies with the strikers firing blanks, no midfielders, lousy defence and error-prone keepers.<br><br>and a manager that cant instill any confidence.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the main problem lies with the midfield..n not scoring enough goals to finish teams off....few seaosn back.when the team's defence was worst than now-gneville,blanc,brown,silvestre....the team could sometimes out score opposition teams....but thats not the case now!.....Scoring is the worrying factor for manutd....the midfiled really suxs...resulting in insufficient supply of gd crosses and passes to the strikers to score...sighs</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cun really blame the defences la... The 2 centre back suffer too much pressure as ManU mid keep givin the ball away n nv protect the 2 centre back well. Mid cun attack n cun defence. Smith is out of position, fletcher too overated by Fergie. P.Scoles playin at best at the 'hole' position. I think they need only 2 players now... A new DMC n a world class MC. Sack Fergie is not a gd choice, dun think even if a new manager comes in he will do well with this kind of team.</div>
