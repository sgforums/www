            <div class='col-md body'>France midfielder Claude Makelele is to end his international career after the Euro 2008 qualifiers.<br><br>The Chelsea man announced after the World Cup that he no longer wished to play for Les Bleus, but France coach Raymond Domenech called him up for duty nonetheless.<br><br>Controversy ensued, with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho even claiming that Makelele was being treated like 'a slave' and that he should not be forced to play against his will.<br><br>However, club and country have now settled on an agreement to allow Makelele to play in the remaining qualifiers but not the competition's final stages in Austria and Switzerland.<br><br>"It is a controversy I want to end today," the 33-year-old told L'Equipe.<br><br>"I have found an agreement with my club and my national coach.<br><br>"When I came back to London after the last match against Italy, I had a talk with my coach JosÃ© Mourinho, before talking again to Domenech.<br><br>"He made me understand that I had to reverse my decision to stop playing.<br><br>"For Chelsea, the priority was to avoid Fifa sanctions and controversy, but Mourinho didn't understand why Domenech called me again after I said I wanted to stop.<br><br>"There had never been any secret agreement with Mourinho for me to stop playing with Les Bleus. It was just my decision.<br><br>"But now there won't be any more controversy because I am back in the French team for the next match.<br><br>"My aim is to do my best for the French team and to get qualification, but I won't go on.<br><br>"It is clear in my mind, I won't play Euro 2008. I believe Domenech will be right with me, as it will be the correct time to hand over.<br><br>"I believe Domenech and Mourinho had a talk recently, so I am happy that everything has been settled for everyone and above all for me."<br><br>Although Makelele is committed to France's qualifying campaign, he would like to see Domenech plan for the future by selecting younger players ahead of him in certain games.<br><br>"I believe that if we achieve a good result in Scotland, it would be nice for the coach to try a young player like JÃ©rÃ©my Toulalan on the Wednesday against Faeroe Islands," he explained.</div>
