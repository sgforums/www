            <div class='col-md body'>Emotions are often written all on the playerÂ’s faces. Other than just enjoying the matches, we can observe manÂ’s swing of emotions throughout the magical 90 minutes. Emotions are just as entertaining as good football; we can see dismay, despair and frustration in every footballerÂ’s face. It is very interesting watching every decision made by the referee hotly contested as players flung their arms up in protest. Despite all the fiery competition, matches are often full of humour if we look at it in another way. Goalkeeper wasting time, protests from players and bickering had added flavour into the competition, making it much more entertaining.<br><br>Making a mistake, squandering a chance will trigger off great dismay as footballers were pressured all the time not only by the opponent, but also by his fellow playmates. We had seen in every single match, there is full of dismay and despair. A player would be utterly disappointed when he missed chances repeatedly, just as in the previous matches of England, Germany and Sweden. They were veterans and should have no problem in finding the net. However, luck seemed not to be on their way, especially Germany, unable to score for 90 over minutes until stoppage time when Neuville struck. Even as I was just watching the match on television, I could feel the huge frustration in the stadium, every single German, every one of them. However, the stadium erupted when the final minute of stoppage time came, then we had seen the big swing of emotions in this dramatic moment. England playing against Trinidad and Tobago last night, it was another interesting match. Trinidad and Tobago had once again, played heroically and kept the England at bay for 82 minutes. EnglandÂ’s Frank Lampard wasted chances as he repeatedly struck the ball over the crossbar; he had shown us clearly what true dismay was by just sticking his tongue out. No matter what, EnglandÂ’s was victorious in the end as Crouch scored with a header. England was not that frustrated as compared to Germany, but it was still a great torture for these two strong teams as they faced the impenetrable defence of their opponents.<br><br>SwedenÂ’s victory came even later than EnglandÂ’s. Freddie Ljungberg headed home the goal in the 89th minute, sending Paraguay straight home after much frustration faced by the Swedes as they too, created so many good chances to score but could not do so until the last minute. They tried all kinds of ways to score and their efforts finally paid off after a goalless 179 minute in their two matches. This goal came just in time to make SwedenÂ’s World Cup hopes alive again. The scenario for the England, Germany and SwedenÂ’s matches were so similar, full of dismay, despair and frustration. However, it was still sweet victory for them as their efforts for over 80 minutes were not wasted.<br><br>Other than the players and the fans, coaches are also very interesting. Every coach watched their matches in great anticipation for their side and even showed much stronger emotions than the players sometimes. A good example was Hiddink, as he erupted after being denied by the officials to watch the reply of JapanÂ’s controversial goal. Even EnglandÂ’s coach Sven-Goran Eriksson, a man who seldom shows emotions, cannot hide his joy as his side claimed a late victory from Trinidad and Tobago. Fans, players and coaches are the flavours of every match, contributing to the great deal of entertainment. Thanks to all those wonderful fans, players and coaches, who had made this World Cup much more colourful than any other football event.<br></div>
