A team consist of Henry , Zidane , Makele , Wiltord , Trezequet , Thuram and Sagnol , team that plying their trade in the European Elite league .....

If France beat Togo by 2 goals or more , a draw for Korea against the Swiss will still see them crash out on goal difference. If France win 2-1 , then Korea must get a score draw against the Swiss to go through on goals scored..The best is if France only win 1-0, Korea will go through as long as they do not lose to Swiss. If Togo can beat or draw France , then the Swiss and Korea will go through regardless what happen...I support Korea but I think they are going home sadly....</div>
