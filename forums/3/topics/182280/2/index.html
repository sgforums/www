Well, if a coach like AW can do that, then EPL will no longer be EPL. I wish the FA will step in and only allow a certain numbers of foreign players in the team playing at only one time. Then the FA will not only save EPL, but England Football Team. Imagine SWP, he was doing so well, a star. but now??</div></blockquote>every league's FA in Europe wanted to have more local players in their own league big teams but with the current Euro law of free employment within Euro's representative countries, there is little they can do to limit the amount of Euro players in the league, the only thing that can do is minimize the non Euro players like Asian, South American...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by iceFatboy:</div><div class="quote_body">As for Torres, if he has a spine, I wish he stay at the club he supported, AM. And not be money driven. Try as they might, Chelsea may be rich in buying players, but never rich in tradition. </div></blockquote>you're making the world sound so simple.. nowadays its not a matter of spine, its just all about money.. he may not wants to leave but if someone is to come along and pay the kinda money that your club is willing to forsake the player for, then he will have to go.. sad to point it out but its just the what it is today..<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by iceFatboy:</div><div class="quote_body">if really G14 establish their own champion league, then Chelsea won't get any big money or players, by then will RA still be interested?? I wonder.<br><br>Just my two cents worth.</div></blockquote>dun think Roman is just purely in for the money, i mean with kinda money that he had, i would think that its more like a fantasy to him.. just like how we love playing the CM game...<br></div>

Remote yes, but can it happen?? Just like the way won the 1999 UCL Cup. U nv win unless the match end. So i dun see the need of boasting around before they actually win it....
