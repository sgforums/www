He said it clearly in his defence of his team selection against real. The scouting system does not effectively allow teams to scout outside their area and with so many clubs challenging for top talent, it might be hard unless they are trained in their own academy and have passed through the youth system.<br><br>Buying a local talent is just alike buy abroad where u can get better and cheaper youngsters.  I believe we wont see man u,chelsea or even liverpool blooming next season because of afew new blooded youngsters... Its got be foreign signings. But i really hope chel can get a good striker... Torres is up for grabs i guess...hopefully we'll see him soon..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Yeah i partly agree with you...I would hate it if players like lampard and henry were to leave the epl cause i only get to watch the epl...<br><br>But i guess we just cant fault arsenal...Its not as if wenger is going on a foriegn policy and boycotting local products.. He said it clearly in his defence of his team selection against real. The scouting system does not effectively allow teams to scout outside their area and with so many clubs challenging for top talent, it might be hard unless they are trained in their own academy and have passed through the youth system.<br><br>Buying a local talent is just alike buy abroad where u can get better and cheaper youngsters. I believe we wont see man u,chelsea or even liverpool blooming next season because of afew new blooded youngsters... Its got be foreign signings. But i really hope chel can get a good striker... Torres is up for grabs i guess...hopefully we'll see him soon.."<br><br>NO, we can fault Arsenal. Well, if a coach like AW can do that, then EPL will no longer be EPL. I wish the FA will step in and only allow a certain numbers of foreign players in the team playing at only one time. Then the FA will not only save EPL, but England Football Team. Imagine SWP, he was doing so well, a star. but now??<br><br>As for Torres, if he has a spine, I wish he stay at the club he supported, AM. And not be money driven. Try as they might, Chelsea may be rich in buying players, but never rich in tradition.<br><br>if really G14 establish their own champion league, then Chelsea won't get any big money or players, by then will RA still be interested?? I wonder.<br><br>Just my two cents worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>of course Chelsea will win it...........it is never in doubt since the beginning of this season.<br><br>Credit to them for their incredible consistency.<br><br>However, once the other 3 big clubs sort out their problems, Chelsea will be in for a tougher ride.<br><br>If Man Utd can get a couple of good central midfielders, Liverpool buy a striker who can score goals and if Arsenal keep henry and add more steel into their side, the big 3 can challenge chelsea better <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
