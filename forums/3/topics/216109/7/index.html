            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, a club can be viewed with green eyes only if it has certain amount of history.<br><br>does  anyone flame Everton or Spurs, or Charlton fans??<br><br>For Chelsea, the only + point is that it won the League twice...<br>Hand to heart, I know that now, it is their era. But just as I respect what Pool has done in the 80s, I just want MUFC to be respected in the 90s for what they have accomplished.<br><br>There are true fans and there are glory hunters. Well a fact is that there are more Chelsea fans all of a sudden. Its natural. Everyone associated with success. Not a lot would associate with relegated team like Leeds for that matter unless those really die-hard. (no disrespect to Leeds).<br><br>What I can't stand is those with tunnel-vision who refuses to acknowledge others' success. In order to gain respect, you have to give it, and also to earn it.<br><br>For me, I grow up in an era where MUFC were in the pits. They were struggling, and all focus was on Pool, Everton. No one knew then what Arsenal, MUFC, or Chelsea. So I grew up similiar to now, putting the most popular team as the enemy. So I hated Liverpool.<br><br>For those who said MUFC fans are arrogant, take a look at Liverpool fans, they fare no better. When they were lifting their 5 Eurpoean Cup, well, i also see fans going around with 5 on their jerseys. Sama sama.<br><br>Liverpool fans will always tell me, MUFC players play like gangsters, flying into crowds to injure. No style, class. Well, go ahead play with style,class, other than that occassional luck, you won't win another EPL title, or another cup.<br>And about MUFC style of playing, at least it is on the field, not outside.<br>The only CLUB in the world where fans die is LIVERPOOL.. No one can deny that fact. I am talking about LIVES here... Enough said.<br><br>For Gunners, yes, you are playing the most beautiful soccer now, but no end results. And in the real world, style is just a farce, you still need 3 points.<br>Moving into Emirates stadium, (I just can't believe Arsenal has even sell their stadium name), has not suited them, but give them another season, I believe Chelsea can't be the best team in London anymore.<br><br>Lastly, if you want to dump your verbal vormit on me, fine,  Let's have a go.<br>I won't go for your throat if you don't already kicked my B*LLS.<br>And please keep the focus on soccer, if you resorted to names-calling or "monkey",  I would give you one last note, and ignore.<br><br></div>
