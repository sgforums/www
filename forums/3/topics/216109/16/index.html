            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking of TNP, now Tohari Paijan's column is always a good read. Ojective, most in depth, most precise match analysis. Letter of the days are sometimes fun to read, but I won't count on for real soccer info or analysis. Not saying all those who get letters of the day are idiots (maybe at least one of them is), but like I said, it's not a credential telling others to die die listen to you when it comes to soccer. Especially when one's soccer knowledge has been found to be wanting on so many occassions vs one single letter.</div>
