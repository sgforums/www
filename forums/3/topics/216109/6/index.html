I only pointed out he was a friend because he added one of our friends on friendster or vice versa.<br><br>I am confused by what you pointed out "just type his nick on ur search menu u can find all the flaming topics n spams he made specially for others".<br><br>Personally, I would love that you checked the time of which those posts were made before you write anything. If any at all, I can say with certainty that I made posts during my breaks or rests.<br><br>But anyway, I feel and KNOW that my life will end up much more fulfilling than yours. Why? I don't take pleasure out of slandering and cursing people over the internet. And stop acting ok? Because you're looking dumber than you are right now<br><br>Besides, I think the personal agenda between us has little to with Ghimpheng. Why? If you had noticed, I hadn't posted for the past 2 weeks in this forum about Chelsea until I saw something which I felt a need to reply. Hence, The flaming begins.
