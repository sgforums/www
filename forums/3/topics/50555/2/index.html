            <div class='col-md body'>hmm... long strides not necessarily good. Try sprinting with short steps instead of long... you will actually run faster.<br><br>Also focus on a point far ahead - I agree this is important. I think it helps prolong the stamina.<br><br>One thing I find is that if you 'shadow' a person from the start for one thing you will find it easier to keep up at first. But once you meet an obstacle (like yellow soil that sucks your shoes) you will mentally collapse and you will just 'die' there.<br><br>I speak from experience at MacRitchie... used to run everyday.

            <div class='col-md body'>Remember to start drinking water the nite before your run. Otherwise, you will experience your mouth/throat drying when you are running. Do proper warm up. When running, you need to open up your steps. Coordinate your breathing  with your foot step when running. Then you won't feel so "siong". When running on stadium tracks, most people will tends to lose count when running 3rd to 4th rounds (then they will starts to slow down), so be careful.<br>If you are running 1 big track, then don't think too much, JUST RUN!!.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here are some tips from a seasoned runner,<br><br>1) Warm ups are very important..<br>2) drink a litre 30 mins before you start.<br>3)when you start, jog slow at a pace, coordinate yr breathing with ya steps.<br>4) when u breathe in, make sure you can hear your breathing.<br>5) get a waistband to wipe perspire if u perspire buckets.<br>6) get a small towel, wet it but not like a wet towel, justly moist.<br>7) sling the towel across ya shoulders for the first 1 to 2km, then when u get tired, put the towel over ya head and run. (n.b., towel must be off light materials). (the towel acts as an layer to allow faster evaporation of excessive heat and moisture.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> run fast at some intervals, as in 100 steps, 10 steps fast etc...<br>9) do not look far or on the ground, both are pschologically inducing, instead have your mind do some thinking, ex: happy times with gf, what u did which made you happy (remember: happy stuffs). If not, try counting, 1 to 100, then adding a noun in on the next 100 (ex: 1 car, 2 cars), follow by the melting pot (items u favour, ex: 1 lexus, 2 tits, 3 ladies etc...). ya mind will be shut out of fatigue soon enough.<br>10) if possible, have company, running causes anxieties which with say, frens, introduces emotional sharing (i.e., same plight, he can, i also can)<br>11) distance yrself however, at least 5m away from ppl u are jogging with<br>12) when you're tired, slow down, look up into the skies, this induces parallel rigid spinal homeostastis, bringing a balance to you body, brain induces dopahmines which will help regain vitality.<br>13) when nearing, u might wanna dash, my suggestion is to take 20 and 10.<br>paced 20 steps, fast 10 steps , then paced 10, fast 20 so forth, repeating<br><br>These are just a few examples how to manage ya 2.4km.<br><br>I have been running 5km 5 times a week, even after work.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know, the mental aspect of the 2.4km can really shave off the time. But a PTI warrant officer once warned us (when I was a regular) that using mind-over-matter tricks are dangerous. Your heart cannot do it, but your mind is forcing your system to function beyond its capacity. He has personally experienced an NSman who collapsed and died after IPPT because he was challenged by a fellow NSman (I think he was insulted or something).<br><br>It also happened to me before. I had just recovered from fever the previous day but still went for IPPT anyway (it's the last chance I had for my medal as the year is closing). I really felt weak, but I knew I could do it (I've got a medal the previous year), so I pushed myself. I vomitted, collapsed and was sent to the medical centre immediately after the run. Still no medal, though I finished  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> .<br><br>Use mind-over-matter only when your heart and body can take it. Never use it to substitute an untrained and unfit body. Your family and loved ones would prefer you to be alive than get that medal (it's only a matter of pride!)<br><br></div>
