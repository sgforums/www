            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal is looking good in the long run with it's own excellent group of talented youngsters. The nurturing of these young guns will fillup the generations of first elevens in years to come.<br><br>Besides skills, experience counts alot to win the long race. Arsenal's young guns hasn't reached that level yet... so another season ba. However, I do personally enjoy Gunner's attacking play and the lads really deserve something for the positive football.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
