            <div class='col-md body'>SUN readers have voted overwhelmingly to install Jose Mourinho as England manager.<br><br>In a You The Jury poll, 95 per cent insisted the Special One should take over from flop Steve McClaren.<br><br>Just five per cent of voters believe the ex-Chelsea boss is wrong for the post.<br><br>The Sun was bombarded by emails and phone calls demanding Jose be given the job.<br><br>And our My Sun web chat site was buzzing all day.<br><br>Cleggys Heroes, from London said: Â“No more letdowns! We need a new manager and Mourinho is the only logical choice.Â”<br><br>Taffylaure said: Â“He would be ruthless, brutal and very controversial Â— but thatÂ’s what needs to happen.Â”<br><br>Cutejade from London added: Â“Jose canÂ’t be worse than the numpties weÂ’ve had over the last decade.Â”<br><br><span style="color: blue;">He is a firm favourite with female fans. Jaclyn from South Africa said: Â“He is gorgeous. If England donÂ’t sign him he can boss me anytime.Â”</span><br><br>But TheOnlyCiderman, from Cornwall, said: Â“Steve McClaren should go but keep our manager English.Â”<br><br><span style="color: green;">don't think that Jose will want to coach any national teams for now as the workload is too less for him just going around to watch matches and picking the players which is expert in<br><br>With so many class players @ his disposal he can easily win matches especially those world cup qualifying matches<br><br>I feel AC Milan might have secretly offer him the job already with their poor league form lying @ mid table and Champions League defeat against Celtic  </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mourinho rules out England job<br><br>Former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has ruled himself out for the England job.<br>He told the News of the World: "I couldn't see myself coaching any national team other than Portugal. If I were coach of another team and had to face Portugal, it would be wrong.<br><br>"I think there are those who adore me in England. I adore English football. But I won't go back there for now. I'd like to come back later.<br><br><span style="color: green;">"I'd like to continue in club management, perhaps in Italy where I can test myself against their tacticians.</span> The national team would be for later. The Portuguese national team is an ambition but not for the Jose Mourinho of today.<br><br>"Being the coach of a national team is not the same as being coach of a club. It's a job for someone who doesn't like working much."<br><br>And Mourinho insists that bringing in coaches from overseas to lead international sides is wrong.<br><br>He added: "I'm completely against having foreigners with national teams, not because I doubt the professionalism with which they do it, but I think that a national team should bring together the best players and the best coach from each country.<br><br>"The national team is an obsession for me but it will be at the end of my career. Let there be no doubt about that."<br><br><span style="color: green;">AC Milan now lies in 11th position in Serie A after playing 8 matches and only getting 10 points and the recent  0 - 1 shock defeat to Empoli indicate that Jose Mourinho are likely to take over at the AC Milan hot seat</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jose Mourinho intends to prise Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard away from Chelsea once he lands a new club job.<br><br>The Mail on Sunday says his two Stamford Bridge favourites have been made aware that their former manager will come calling wherever he ends up.<br><br>Drogba, who broke down in tears when Mourinho left, last week described Chelsea as a 'broken club' without him, while Lampard's ongoing contract talks with the club are unlikely to progress until he knows Mourinho's next move.<br><br>The England midfielder's current deal has 18 months to run.<br><br>A source close to the Chelsea camp said last night: "Those two players are like Jose's blood brothers. They know he will never forget about them."<br><br>Mourinho signed a confidentiality clause when he left Chelsea by mutual consent a month ago but felt bitterly let down by owner Roman Abramovich and his cohorts.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">And he knows his special relationship with Drogba and Lampard will cause the club a lot of anxiety.<br><br>The Portuguese manager has made it clear he would ideally like to return to the day-to-day running of club management, although he is prepared to be patient until the right vacancy comes along. </span><br></div>
