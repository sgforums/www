            <div class='col-md body'>2 matches gone by in the epl, so many referees made a howler of a decision, esp the ben thachter crude elbowing of mendes, and after that, he wasnt even bother to check out on mendes if he was ok, he was arguing wth glen johnson afterwards. the ref gave him a yellow? was the referee millions of miles away from the incident or did someone blocked his view?<br><br>what abt wes brown blatant handball, maybe it was crowded, the ref cant see, ok i can accept it. what abt the non existent penalty given to everton for powell supposedly handball, the ball hit his chest only, and yet everton was given a penalty kick?<br><br>gunner_rv (Arsenal): "...The quality of refereeing in EPL is flabbergasting. Disgusting. Poor decisions led to points, but not only that. I saw the challenge and that was shocking. Damn an elbow to the head at full speed. That was insane. The poor quality of referees leads to the poor management from english FA. We don't want another season of consecutive poor decisions. Only two matches gone we have seen deliberate handb..."<br><br><blockquote></blockquote></div>

UCL refs also kayu one.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Romanov blasts AEK &amp; Russian ref</strong><br><br>Hearts owner Vladimir Romanov took a swipe at Russian referee Yuri Baskakov, saying that AEK Athens could not cope at a high level without him.<br><br>Romanov, himself Russian-born, was talking after Hearts were reduced to nine men as they lost 3-0 in Athens.<br><br>"AEK, on this performance, might not be able to compete at a high level in the group stages - certainly without a referee from Moscow," he told the BBC.<br><br>"We will be back in the Champions League if we can compete like that."<br><br>Hearts were without several first-team regulars and had Julien Brellier and Neil McCann red carded as they lost 5-1 on aggregate.<br><br>"Football is supposed to be what is happening on the field of play, not turned into a show thanks to the referee," said Lithuanian-based businessman Romanov.<br><br>"I would stop my football investment if Hearts were ever to play in the fashion that AEK did here against us.<br><br>"If we can fight and compete in these circumstances, imagine what we can do when fully fit.<br><br>"The team was very sick after the Rangers game, with injuries and illness, and had to put Jamie Mole up front on his own.<br><br>"But, playing with nine players, we gave AEK a very hard game."<br><br>Romanov's comments appear to contradict those predicting a bleak future for head coach Valdas Ivanauskas should Hearts fail to qualify for the money-spinning group stages.<br><br>Ivanauskas was furious with the sending off of Brellier, who was booked for wearing an earing then shown a second yellow card for allegedly leading dangerously with an elbow.<br><br>"We had chances in this game and played with heart, but I don't like to see these things from the referee," he said.<br><br>"Yes, Brellier was booked because he was wearing an earring.<br><br>"But the referee checked every player before and said they were OK to play with tape, so why he booked him I do not know.<br><br>"And the second yellow card for Brellier was not a foul. It would not be even possible to give this foul in a game of basketball, which is a minimal contact sport."<br><br>Ivanauskas also claimed that McCann should not have seen red for his tackle on Ivic.<br><br>"The game was over after 28 minutes anyway, but this was a normal football game and McCann's tackle was simply a normal foul," added Ivanauskas, who nevertheless admitted that AEK were the better side over the two games.<br><br>Hearts captain Steven Pressley believes refereeing decisions cost his side dearly as they failed to qualify for the money-spinning group stages.<br><br>Bruno Aguiar was also sent off in the first leg at Murrayfield.<br><br>"I don't like to go on about referees, but I feel we have been harshly dealt," said Pressley.<br><br>"We should certainly be proud of our performance."<br><br></blockquote></div>
