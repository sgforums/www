            <div class='col-md body'>u have a good striker is no use, the overall team must be there or thereabout to support mah.<br><br>a good striker without the support of strong midfielders or having a leaky defense will equal to naught.  this is why the strongest team wins and not the strongest players.<br><br>Brazil is brimming with mega stars but they still bowed out becos they are not that efficient as a team...same as Ivory coast, Drogba is a good player, but he alone cannot propel the team to glory if the rest is mediocre.  We see Giggs as a good player but the overall Wales team is not good...the list goes on.</div>
