We know that as a ASEAN powerhouse, we are just a top 20 ASIA country currently in world soccer.

We are just not there.<br><br>When 2010 was conceived, we said we want to enter the World Cup, not win it. That in itself is a sign that we know better than to talk out of our arse, that we are realistic.

            <div class='col-md body'>FACT- Singapore cannot win SEA games which is u23 competition, with only real Singaporeans...<br><br>This is as our national team stalwarts are FTs, shi jiayi, precious, bennett and now duric... granted, we do have good local players also, my point though is that from the sea games competitions, you can obviously see that in terms of natural ability, the thai players are better (foreign talents aside)<br><br>FACT- We cheer about getting to the third stage, but there is another stage after this, and we only defeated Tajikistan and Palestine to come here. I do think its a good feat for Singapore to get to the third stage... and I have always been following Singapore even through its low points... but I just feel that we should take things one at a time rather than jump ahead and count chickens before they hatch...<br><br>Look at Thailand. They have had a better team and better local talent in the past and even now they are good. Back then when the gulf between sg and thailand was large thailand even got to the Final stage of WC qualifying a few times. But got utterly owned by china, iran, and so on... So I think we should just focus on getting past this stage first (which I feel there is a slight chance), the next one will be uber tough.<br><br>Speaking of which though, if Sg really got into the WC finals, I think there will be mass exodus to buy tickets there.. our first chance and might be last... and some ppl mite wish for us to play brazil and so on to see good football.. though by then ill be in NS...</div>

And over the past two years, they've beaten Asian champions Iraq, drawn with regional powerhouses China, and toppled Thailand to win back-to-back ASEAN Championships.<br><br>It's a massive improvement on their ill-fated qualifying campaign for the previous World Cup. They were knocked out in the first round after finishing bottom of their group with five defeats in six matches, including a 7-0 thrashing by Oman. Even India finished ahead of them.<br><br>Their Serbian coach Raddy Avramovic has transformed an under-achieving side that leaked goals and was overawed by big-name opponents into a combative unit that defends strongly and can eke out good away results, despite difficult conditions.<br><br>Singapore progressed to the third round after beating Tajikistan over two legs in November: a 2-0 victory at home followed by an impressive 1-1 draw on the road, despite many of the squad being afflicted by a stomach bug.<br><br>It means that Singapore fans no longer have to keep talking about the 'good old days', with the current crop exceeding the achievements of the beloved 1977 and 1994 teams.<br><br>In their inaugural World Cup campaign ahead of Argentina '78, Singapore finished a gutsy second in their group after wins against Thailand and Malaysia. But they were dumped out before the final qualifying round after losing a play-off with Hong Kong.<br><br>After missing out on the USA World Cup, the 1994 team sent Singapore into national ecstasy by winning the Malaysia Cup and league double, overcoming the best club sides from across the causeway.<br><br>But the Lions' latest success hasn't come without controversy, namely the Foreign Talent Scheme which targets overseas players. No fewer than seven of the current 22-man squad were born outside Singapore, in countries like Nigeria, England and Serbia.<br><br>The newest star recruit is 37-year-old Aleksandar Duric who scored both the goals in the first-leg win against Tajikistan, the oldest international debutant less than two months after becoming a Singaporean. Duric was born in Bosnia, represented Bosnia and Herzegovina in canoeing at the 1992 Olympics and played in Australia's old National Soccer League (NSL) as an Australian citizen.<br><br>He's become the biggest star of Singapore's S-League: last season's top scorer with 37 league goals, voted player of the year and a key member of champions, Singapore Armed Forces FC (SAFFC).<br><br>The inclusion of Duric - and so many other imports - has irritated Singapore's most capped player, Malek Awab, who made 123 appearances in the red and white.

He's the finest midfielder now, but, because of the foreign-born players, he has to sit on the bench,' Awab told the Straits Times.<br><br>Singapore, with a population of 4.5million (roughly the same as Croatia), is as passionate about football as any European or Asian nation. The back pages of the newspapers are dominated by coverage of Serie A, the Primera Liga and the Bundesliga, in addition to its beloved EPL.<br><br>But holding back the development of the elite player base is the fact that its ethnic Chinese majority - around three-quarters of the population - tends to be football watchers instead of serious football players. These educated and business-minded people usually choose less risky career paths instead of the uncertain life of a professional footballer.<br><br>It's left to Singapore Malays and Singapore Indians to wear the national strip on the football field - along with naturalised Singaporeans like Shi Jiayi, Daniel Bennett and Agu Casmir.<br><br>Even so, much of this vibrant island nation identifies with, and closely follows, the achievements of the Lions. As soon as they start winning matches, everyone, it seems, is jumping on the bandwagon.<br><br>In football, like anything else for such a tiny speck on the map, Singapore uses planning and ingenuity to make up for a lack of natural resources and usually ends up doing better than most of its much bigger neighbours.</div>
