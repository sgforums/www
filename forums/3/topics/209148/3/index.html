            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Updated: Sep. 26, 2006<br>FIFA rocked by new corruption claims over TV bribing<br><br>The pressure is mounting on FIFA after the organisation became embroiled in a scandal involving a senior figure for the third time this year.<br><br>In the latest controversy, Dr Nicolas Leoz, South American federation president and a FIFA executive committee member, has been alleged to have received Â£90,000 in sweeteners.<br><br>The 78-year-old has been named as having received two payments relating to television rights in a report by Swiss magistrates investigating the collapse of FIFA's former marketing partner ISMM/ISL, according to The Guardian newspaper.<br><br>Two weeks ago, FIFA announced Lord Sebastian Coe is to chair their new independent ethics commission, but the magistrates will have to complete their legal investigation before there is any chance of the Leoz case being referred to the new body.<br><br>The latest allegations follow World Cup ticket scandals involving two of Leoz's fellow members of FIFA's executive committee this year.<br><br>Botswana's Ismael Bhamjee was sent home from the World Cup in disgrace for selling tickets at a profit to fans, and FIFA vice-president Jack Warner is under investigation from the organisation's disciplinary committee after auditors reported he too was involved in selling tickets at a profit. Leoz and Warner both completely deny any wrongdoing.<br><br>Furthermore, former FIFA president Joao Havelange has also been accused by BBC's Panorama of taking bribes from ISMM/ISL.<br><br>A FIFA insider admitted the new controversy was the last thing the organisation needed.<br><br>He said: 'This is a very difficult time for FIFA. What we all want to do is get the ISMM/ISL investigation dealt with and then we can make a fresh start.'<br><br>This is unlikely to be the end of the controversy because the identity of the person who repaid Â£1.1million to ISL's bank account two years ago - well after the company had gone into liquidation - may soon emerge.<br><br>The investigating magistrates say no Swiss nationals are involved, which puts FIFA president Sepp Blatter in the clear, but it is understood yet another FIFA executive committee member could be implicated.<br><br>The South American federation CONMEBOL said in a statement: 'Nicolas Leoz in 50 years has never had any problem of any kind. He is very surprised by your questions. CONMEBOL has never been in contact with the enterprises mentioned in these questions.'  </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Updated: Sep. 27, 2006<br>Majority of agents corrupt, says England manager's aide<br><br>LONDON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - England manager Steve McClaren's agent Colin Gordon has said the majority of agents are corrupt and those working in England are the worst.<br><br>'Are agents corrupt? Not all - but the majority,' the 43-year-old former Birmingham City player was quoted as saying in Thursday's Wolverhampton Express and Star newspaper.<br><br>'It's accepted abroad. We pretend we are holier than thou but I've spoken to people over there and the English game is considered the dirty man of Europe'.<br><br>'We are the worst - and it shouldn't be accepted. I can't argue with the public seeing us as the scum of the earth,' he added in an interview with the paper published on its website.<br><br>The BBC television programme Panorama made accusations last week of corruption and rule-breaking by managers and agents. All the accused have denied any wrongdoing, with several raising the prospect of legal action against the BBC.<br><br>However, the programme has prompted the FA to launch a series of inquiries. Under FIFA's current rules, such inquiries and any disciplinary action are entirely down to the FA.<br><br>World soccer's governing body is monitoring the situation, though, and said the affair was not good for the game.<br><br>Gordon, whose company Key Sports Management also represents Arsenal and England forward Theo Walcott and Watford manager Adrian Boothroyd, says tens of millions of pounds has gone missing from the game.<br><br>'Sometimes, the chain of people involved is not just one person but three or four,' he told the Express and Star. 'You will never get the truth out of them.<br><br>'And we're not talking about the Â£50,000 bungs the Panorama programme was alleging. We're not talking old brown paper envelopes stuffed with a few notes. We are talking about millions upon millions. But it's gone now,' he said.<br><br>'It's a very, very sophisticated business. It's very cleverly disguised. That programme (Panorama) couldn't prove anything and I'm pretty sure Lord Stevens enquiry will struggle big time to come up with any proof,' Gordon added.<br><br>Former London police chief John Stevens has been leading a long-running Premier League inquiry into allegations of illegal payments - 'bungs' - and will deliver the findings on Monday.<br><br>'It's time for a poacher to turn gamekeeper,' added Gordon. 'Someone who knows how to regulate it because they know how and what goes on. Some of the people getting involved haven't got a clue. We all know it's there, it's industry gossip.' </span></div>

Although the Holland star is cooperating, United's fixture schedule has so far prevented him from flying to Turin for the interview.<br><br>There is no suggestion that Van der Sar is involved in Italian match-fixing inquiries or that he benefited illegally from his ?7.5 million deal.<br><br>However, investigators are making wide-ranging inquiries into Juventus's transfer dealings to see if illegal payments were made to club staff.<br><br>Van der Sar's agent, Rob Jansen, said last night that he was not aware that the goalkeeper was required in Turin. Jansen told the Mail on Sunday: "The Italian prosecutors have interviewed everyone involved in a transfer with Juventus. That's natural - it's part of their investigation. Edwin has already spoken to them by telephone."<br><br>Lawyers for Fulham owner Mohamed al Fayed have held several meetings with Palazzi and, at the prosecutor's request, have passed a dossier of evidence to him.<br><br>These investigations coincide with two major judicial inquiries in France into corruption in football, both of which also feature the transfers of current United stars.<br><br>The Paris-based probe into Paris Saint-Germain transfers from 1998 to 2005 has looked at the ?6.9m deal which took Gabriel Heinze to Old Trafford in 2004, while Marseille authorities are focusing on deals involving unlicensed agent Richard Bettoni, who helped take Louis Saha to Fulham in 2000 and then move him on to Old Trafford four years later.<br><br>There is no suggestion in either case that the players, or United, have done anything wrong but the French investigations have shed light on a network of agents and middlemen which stretches across the Channel and the world. </span><br><br>Man Utd Van Der Sar , Heinze And Saha are the 3 players involved in the problematic transfers........</div>
