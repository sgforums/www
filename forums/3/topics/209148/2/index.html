            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Updated: Sep. 20, 2006<br>Agent calls on FA to tighten up on cowboys<br><br>Football agent Jon Smith has called for new regulations from the Football Association to avoid the allegations of transfer bungs to managers.<br><br>Three agents accused Bolton boss Sam Allardyce of being willing to accept illegal payments over transfers, while his son Craig was accused of accepting money for his part in two deals, even though the sums were never registered with the FA.<br><br>Smith, who set up the First Artist company, believes the FA can make the working relationship between clubs and players' representatives smoother with changes.<br><br>Smith said: 'The big issue from the programme is a lack of regulation. The FA's regulations do not work and are not enforced properly, and no-one gives a damn about them. In fact, we don't think they are legal.<br><br>'Until they get real and get proper departments to deal with this then there will always be allegations.'<br><br>He added: 'The FA made a complaint to us about us about a recent transfer being against FIFA regulations - a very small matter in the paperwork - but why bother when there are other fundamental things wrong with the regulations'<br><br>Allardyce was accused on BBC's Panorama show, although Smith felt the investigation did not live up to expectations.<br><br>'I think they got near to the edge of the cliff but didn't fall off,' Smith said. 'There was allegation and innuendo but there wasn't actually any meat on the bone.<br><br>He added: 'Had it just been a programme things might be different, but it was hyped up beyond belief.<br><br>'At the end of the day there was around Â£300million worth of Premiership transfer deals last year, the big boys accounting for around 70 per cent of that. The ones in the programme were very low down on the food chain and, if there has been something wrong, let's put the handcuffs on them.'<br><br>Barry Silkman, also an agent, was critical of the expose, adding on BBC Radio Five Live: 'All that happened was two people talking together like idiots.<br><br>'I've never had a manager offer so much as a cup of coffee.<br><br>'The bottom line is that nobody apart from the individual knows. I only know my own experience and I've never come across a manager whose asked for anything.'<br><br>Of Teni Yerima, one of the agents who accused Allardyce, Silkman added: 'I did a deal with Teni Yerima. At the end of it I said to the guy who put him in the deal 'do not put him in a deal again because he's the biggest liar I've ever met'.'<br><br>Sky Andrew, who represents Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant among others, believes it is a minority of agents who break the rules.<br><br>He told BBC Radio Five Live: 'Football's going through `deal, deal, deal' culture where some agents think it is all about deals.<br><br>'Surely it is about a player joining a club and honouring his contract, if he wants to stay he stays and if he wants to go he goes.<br><br>'I think it is the minority, most people abide by the rules. The amount of rules is unbelievable, every year there are new ones and it's getting more stringent.<br><br>'We must not forget that there are many very honest managers, people like Alan Curbishley and Arsene Wenger.<br><br>'I've had the privilege of dealing with those two and they are guys of high integrity, good moral fibre and because there is a programme (claiming) managers are a certain way, we can't think all managers are like that.' </span><br></div>

I have instructed my lawyers to take the appropriate action.'<br><br>Allardyce said: 'I am very angry at the lies told about me. The individuals who appeared in the programme making accusations against me have already confirmed in writing to my lawyers that they lied to the BBC.<br><br>'They lied in the hope of being able to make millions offered by the BBC undercover reporter to buy their sports agency businesses.<br><br>'Those individuals never thought their lies would be exposed in the way that they have been and have apologised to me. As a result of their greed, my good name has been tarnished by deceit and innuendo.'<br><br>Allardyce, who watched the programme late last night after Bolton's 3-1 win at Walsall in the Carling Cup, added: 'In addition, as a father, of course, it is painful to watch your son talk tall and exaggerate his influence for financial gain.<br><br>'If there is any real evidence - and there won't be, as I am utterly innocent of any wrongdoing - I would expect the BBC to give that evidence both to the FA and the (Premier League's) Quest inquiry.'<br><br>All the agents who fell victim to the undercover sting have attempted to discredit the comments they made.<br><br>But possibly the most problematic inclusion as far as Allardyce is concerned, came from his son Craig, who claimed on camera his impeccable Bolton contacts could help push transfers through.<br><br>The programme makers also alleged Allardyce jnr had received Â£30,000 in relation to two separate Bolton transfers, payments which were never declared to the Football Association.<br><br>The Bolton manager's son then went on to say his father knew about his involvement in all transfers, suggesting Allardyce snr was fully aware of what would constitute a flagrant breach of FA rules.<br><br>Although there is no direct evidence of Allardyce accepting bungs, the damage to his reputation - and that of his club - is incalculable.<br><br>Less than six months after he was interviewed about the possibility of succeeding Sven-Goran Eriksson as England manager, the 51-year-old now faces a major battle to clear his name.<br><br>And the problems for Bolton are not just confined to their manager either.<br><br>Chairman Phil Gartside, also an FA board member, was also filmed admitting he would be willing to sell star midfielder Jay-Jay Okocha despite public statements to the contrary and in the knowledge the Nigerian had been the subject of an illegal approach. </span></div>

No I'd take him. I would take him. I would take him without a doubt. I like him.'<br><br>The Portsmouth boss is renowned for his record in the transfer market, and a number of shrewd signings during the summer have helped Pompey top the Premiership after five matches.<br><br>Redknapp vehemently denies he has any case to answer after Panorama's broadcast.<br><br>'I haven't seen it (the programme) but I'm looking forward to going home and having a nice cup of tea and a slice of toast and watching it because I've done absolutely nothing wrong,' said Redknapp.<br><br>'There's nothing on there that I would have to consult my lawyer about. As far as I'm concerned there's not a single thing to worry about and I've said that from day one.<br><br>'If you haven't done anything wrong then you haven't got anything to worry about have you? Simple as that.'<br><br>Redknapp does not want to let the Panorama claims overshadow the work he is doing this season with the south-coast club.<br><br>Last night saw Pompey win 2-1 at Mansfield in the Carling Cup, thanks to goals from loan signing Manuel Fernandes and Matthew Taylor.<br><br>'It's not been a difficult weekend for me but the hassle has been difficult because it's distracted from the fantastic team performances that we've turned in,' Redknapp added.<br><br>'I really want to start focusing now on how well my team is doing. What a start to the season we've had, top of the Premier League - Pompey. Harry, you are different class.' </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea's transfer conduct was mired in fresh controversy last night when Frank Arnesen was shown on the BBC's Panorama programme making an illegal approach for a Middlesbrough schoolboy player.<br><br>Arnesen, the club's director of youth development, was secretly filmed offering to give the youngster Â£150,000 over three years to try to induce him to Stamford Bridge.<br><br>The revelation comes just over a month after Chelsea were accused by their former chairman Ken Bates of illegally poaching two players from his academy at Leeds United and tapping up a third, who stayed at Elland Road.<br><br>Chelsea denied any wrongdoing in that case and were waiting to see last night's broadcast before deciding whether to make any comment on this latest episode. It is likely to lead to an investigation by the Premier League, which gave Chelsea a suspended three-point penalty last year for an illegal approach to Cole.<br><br>The accusations are, at the very least, unfortunate for Arnesen, who joined Chelsea from Tottenham last September. His move across the capital was messy, with Spurs claiming Chelsea made an illegal approach for the Dane, suspending Arnesen from his post as sporting director and threatening to report Chelsea to the Premier League.<br><br>Arnesen was photographed aboard a yacht belonging to Chelsea's owner Roman Abramovich, and Chelsea paid substantial compensation to Tottenham to bring him to the club.<br><br>The programme states that Middlesbrough have confirmed they did not give permission for this approach and that Harrison, the player's agent, admitted Boro did not know he was offering Porritt to rival clubs.<br><br>The principal focus will, though, fall on Chelsea because of various other tapping-up accusations levelled at them over recent seasons. They were found guilty of an illegal approach for Ashley Cole after it was revealed they met the left-back without Arsenal's permission at a London hotel. Chelsea were fined by the Premier League and given a suspended three-point penalty. Last month they signed Cole in a deadline-night deal that took the defender William Gallas in the opposite direction.<br><br>Bates suggested activating that points penalty because of the financial strength of the owner, financial punishments alone will make no difference to them at all."<br><br>Chelsea's conduct vis-a-vis the Leeds players is being investigated out jointly by the Football Association and Premier League. It will be determined whether disciplinary action is required and, if so, which body will look after that. This case involving Arnesen may follow a similar pattern, though with two Premiership clubs being involved, the Premier League may deal with the case alone if, as seems likely, it chooses to investigate.<br><br>Arnesen has kept a relatively low profile during his year at Chelsea. The 49-year-old former Denmark international is understood to have played a role this summer in bringing Salomon Kalou and John Obi Mikel to Stamford Bridge, where they form part of the first-team squad.</div>

"If it happened at our club we would take disciplinary action within the club to correct it.<br><br>"All of our dealings with Chelsea have been very good.
