            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">tribalfooball.com - November 10, 2006<br><br>Arsenal midfielder Gilberto Silva has revealed Arsene Wenger was so furious after Sunday's row at West Ham that even the players were scared of him!<br>Gilberto is the first Gunners' star to shed light on exactly what happened in the dressing room after the touchline clash that stunned football last Sunday.<br><br>The Brazilian World Cup star revealed he and his team-mates gave the normally mild-mannered Wenger a wide berth after the 1-0 defeat which left them 10 points behind Premiership leaders Manchester United with their title challenge in tatters.<br><br>Speaking to the Brazilian media, Gilberto said: "There were no problems between Mr Wenger and the players because the problem didn't involved the players. But the situation left us scared. We know the manager and we know that he is very polite and calm. Something very bad had happened to make him react like he did.<br><br>"After the game, Mr Wenger didn't talk to anyone. As it wasn't a problem involving the players, he decided not to discuss it with us."<br><br>On the behaviour of West Ham manager Alan Pardew, Gilberto was scathing: "I have seen it on TV many times and when West Ham scored, Pardew came to our bench to celebrate, but in a offensive way.<br><br>"That made Wenger react like he did, and that is why he had to talk to Pardew about that celebration.<br><br>"He was p****d off about the way Pardew celebrated and, as I said, that was the reason he reacted that way. As I saw it on TV, Pardew said some words that he, as a manager, should have thought about before saying.<br><br>"He should have showed a little more respect. Of course, he could celebrate the goal, but not in the offensive way he did.<br><br>"That is what made Wenger react." </span><br><br>so scary  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
