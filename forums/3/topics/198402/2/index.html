            <div class='col-md body'>The Ex Lazio and Ex Ex England manager... SGE takes the beef.<br><br>Although England done reasonably well when he's in charge.. I oni found them to be very lucky and overrated to say the least. When Beckham was on form, there were too many A times he dragged them out of certain elimination or defeat with his freekicks.<br><br>That aside, England does has many World Class players in the team sheet but with a clueless and sometimes ball-less (hw could he when he has so many flings) tactical plan... many players I felt, underperformed.<br><br>Someone else was scoring loads in EPL but was overlook and to add salt to his wound... SGE remained faithful and belived in the 2 still-not-fully-recover players.<br><br>Is he trying too hard to pleae the fans to accomodate both Lam and Ger in the centre. I think so. Cos the pairing won't spark off in the centre...more like getting each other's way and in the process killed the drive in the midfield.<br><br>Contract's up and he has nothing to lose...

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes i dont understand the referee.<br><br>Just say that rooney deserves two yellow cards will do.<br><br>First, he kicked Carvalho in the groin. Whether its unintentional or intentional, it deserves a yellow. There are so many incidents where player caught another player with a high boot or something and they still get a yellow card anyway. Even obstruction of play can cause you to get a yellow card.<br><br>Second, he pushes Cristiano Ronaldo. That is unsporting behaviour and cannot be tolerated. Second yellow.<br><br>Who says you cant give two yellow cards in a single instant? The red card was justified.<br><br>You can blame rooney for england exit because england was the much better side and have a very high chance of winning if it goes to 120mins.<br><br>Blame Lampard and gerrard? Not really. Its not their fault. Instead its because ricardo said he can guess where they are shooting by looking at their eyes.<br><br>Jamie Carragher needs to be blamed though. He totally showed a lack of calmness in the shootout, both his first and second shot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We don't know what he said to the referee, think he must have scolded the "Fxxx Yxx". The whole team need to be blame, the captain carried more responsibility. As for penalty, it's their skill to do it in this big stage or issit Kelong who knows, only the players themself know.<br><br>Sometime it appear to be kelong, they players can put personal interests before country glory. I really don't see any fighting spirit they have, not even team work, but alot of finger pointing after the red card. They are like putting up a show and try to blame each others, and latter create story and coverup the mess. Now I see the headline on the papers I won't want to continue, the C.ronaldo thing is just to push the blame away. But I won't forget how bad this ingland squad is.</div>
