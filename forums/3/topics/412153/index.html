              <p>Lord Alan Sugar has delivered a biting analysis of the financial 
                                  state of global giants Manchester United and Liverpool.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Lord 
                                  Sugar, who headed the Labour Government's taskforce on business affairs,
                                   forecast a doomsday scenario for both elite clubs and the former Spurs 
                                  chairman also had his say on the controversial issue of foreign owners.</p>
              <p>''If
                                   you are asking me if foreign owners are good for football then I would 
                                  have to split them into two categories,'' Lord Sugar told <em>ESPNsoccernet</em>.
                                   "There is Roman Abramovich and that bloke from the Middle East [Sheikh 
                                  Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan at Manchester City]. To a certain extent 
                                  [Fulham's] Mohammed Al-Fayed and, although I was not a foreign owner, I 
                                  would include myself in this category of owners who use their own money 
                                  to buy football clubs.</p>
              <p>"How can you say anything about these 
                                  foreign owners? Roman Abramovich is passionate about Chelsea and 
                                  football and he is putting up the money to buy the best players in the 
                                  world, and now Manchester City are doing the same.  Yes, it might be 
                                  unfair to everyone else, but that's life, and it hasn't done much harm 
                                  to their football clubs, now has it?</p>
              <p>"But there is another type of
                                   foreign owner: The Glazers and those guys at Liverpool, Hicks and 
                                  Gillett. Now, I am sorry to have to say this, but they are done. They 
                                  are gone. They have big problems ahead.</p>
              <p>"When you buy big clubs 
                                  like Manchester United and Liverpool without using your own money and 
                                  lumber the club with enormous interest repayments on the debt, then you 
                                  are asking for problems, and both clubs have got them."</p>
              <p>Manchester
                                   City posted the second highest one year loss on Friday (at £121 
                                  million), with Abramovich's Chelsea the top of the list in 2004-05 (at 
                                  £141 million), but as Lord Sugar maintains it is meaningless in terms of
                                   the clubs' business plan, as they are supported by their owners own 
                                  cash.</p>
              <p>"Reckless lending caused the demise of the banking industry 
                                  throughout the world, and banks were irresponsible in lending to these 
                                  guys to enable them to buy such big football clubs,'' he said. "They 
                                  have used the club as an asset against the loans and that has resulted 
                                  in big interest repayments on the debt.</p>
              <p>"Here's the bad news: One 
                                  day the Glazers, the Gilletts and Hicks's will find its payback time 
                                  and, when that day comes, if they haven't got the money, they default, 
                                  and it's a nightmare scenario for the clubs.</p>
              <p>"A bank somewhere is 
                                  going to own the football club and hope desperately that some investor 
                                  will take over the debt.  But why would they?  I wouldn't.  Absolutely 
                                  not.  Football is not good business.  An electrical company, a food 
                                  chain, yes, why not, but football, you've got to be joking.''</p>
              <p>With
                                   his own experiences of owning Tottenham behind him, Lord Sugar has 
                                  nothing but fear for United and Liverpool's current situation.</p>
              <p>"Manchester
                                   United is funding £50 million a year in interest repayments with a debt
                                   of £700 million plus,'' he said. ''If it didn't then that £50 million a
                                   year would be spent on players and the club. Same at Liverpool, £40 
                                  million a year on interest repayments.  That leaves me really, really 
                                  worried for those clubs.</p>
              <p>"What a great institution Liverpool is, 
                                  what a great football club, but my forecast is that the owners will 
                                  inevitably default on their loans, it puts the bank in an embarrassing 
                                  position, and the bank will write off a large chunk of the debt to make 
                                  it viable for an investor to step in and take it over.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool 
                                  don't need to build a stadium straight away, that's not the priority, 
                                  the priority is to find the right business model to enable it to buy 
                                  players and stay where they are, and challenge for the top four places. 
                                   To do that they need to wipe their debts clear of the bank.''</p>
              <p>Lord
                                   Sugar cites the example of Leeds United, who dropped to League One 
                                  because of their financial problems as a warning from the past, but 
                                  thinks that history could repeat itself.</p>
              <p>"It would be an 
                                  unbelievable travesty if Liverpool would slip away like Leeds and end up
                                   in the second division,'' he said. ''That will happen if they are not 
                                  careful. Manchester United have more time, the Glazers have given 
                                  themselves more breathing space as their loans are not up until 2016.''</p>

              <div style="width: 275px;">
              <p class="photoDesc">Manchester United fans have protested strongly against
                                   the Glazer regime</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>However, he does not believe that 
                                  the Red Knights' bid to save United from the Glazers is the answer to 
                                  their problems.</p>
              <p>"This Red Knights fiasco, well that is rubbish,'' 
                                  he said. ''Supporters might have passion and love their club but it 
                                  would be out of the frying pan into the fire, with other debts to the 
                                  banks, as I doubt whether it will be their own money.</p>
              <p>"It's all 
                                  very well saying the Glazers are horrible people with no passion and 
                                  they borrowed far too much money, but the Red Knights are not the 
                                  answer.</p>
              <p>"I can see the Glazers selling up and they must be waiting
                                   until the world economy improves or some mad Russian or Chinese comes 
                                  along and gives them £2 billion for the club.  I cannot believe they 
                                  turned down £1.5 billion, as they would love to get themselves out of 
                                  their debt, I am sure.</p>
              <p>"They realise now that whatever prompted 
                                  them to buy Manchester United they got it wrong, They need to find 
                                  someone with many billions to spare who just wants to own Manchester 
                                  United."</p>
