            <div class='col-md body'>Let's admit it, they weren't great. There are positives, but only a handful. And seriously, on a personal note, McLaren was never good enough for the England job.<br><br>As for England now, I believe they can play 4-3-3 should they choose to. However, their choice of personel has to be different if they want to play that formation. They can try Hargreaves or someone else as holding midfielder, Carrick just in front of him and Gerrard either level with Carrick, or preffably just ahead of him. Lampard should be dropped because I don't really see him doing anything fantastic for England, except maybe bring fans into the game by allowing them to throw the ball back onto the field.<br><br>Further upfield, the attack should be spearheaded by either Andrew Johnson, Jermain Defoe or Owen. Playing on the right of the main striker will be none other than Rooney. Dyer or Lennnon can also come in in place of Rooney. On the left, the slot can go to Downing. Or Joe Cole if he's fit.<br><br>Defence wise, they seem ok.<br><br>Else, play 4-4-2 with Carrick and Gerrard in the middle, Downing wide left and Dyer or Lennon wide right. They can do well not to start with Crouch. He's better in holding up play or for a more direct route should one be needed.<br><br>What do you think?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i kinda like 4-3-3, but they really need rooney.. and the long ball tactics to crouch doesn't seem to work well on international stage, there was so many fouls called against him ytd just by jumping.<br><br>but i wonder, when owen is back, how to fit him in?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i tend to disagree wif stellario. england need to play long ball approach to peter crouch, 4-5-1 will be the ideal formation at the moment with the absense of joe cole.<br><br>lampard need to be drop to bench. rooney is not really dat great due to his quick tempo and he might cause the game. since dat spurs keeper is off-form, they should deploy david james for the time being.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>agree with the no lampard theory..<br><br>as for crouch, he could be used as a super sub, when the opposing defenders are tired, can use him as new focus of attack. before that, owen/rooney/johnson/bentley can show their stuff first..<br><br>midfield, if they really have left midfield, why don't they just push the defense up ? cashley cole and gary nev"er-foul-you"ille can be the wing backs, with carrick and hargreaves covering defense of king, woodgate and ferdinand.<br><br>then the single attacking midfielder can be either gerrard/dyer/cole</div>

Maybe because I'm in favour of fowards like van Nist. Master finishers who just die die wanna get the ball past the line.<br><br>But for Crouch, yeah, his job is super sub. Really.

It was certainly Gerrard.. Lampard only shine in Chelsea after the good players come in, not before.<br><br>I did supported Lampard when i found that entering WC, he was the top scorer in England team and every touch of his seems to lead to "Goal".<br><br>But after a while, you can predict his game, he is good with passing from side to side, and he shoot mostly in the final third of game. right?<br><br>You can debate Gerrard does that too, maybe not as good.<br><br>But look at who lampard got and then Gerrard. Lampard will mostly pass to Robben, Drogba who can do it on their own, as compared to Crouch and Garcia who needs just a bit more help.<br><br>And we know what happened at the WC stage where your quality needs to be backed up by results.<br><br>Lampard has a horrific WC, while Gerrard did much better.<br><br>but here's the key difference, Gerrard did it twice, one in FA cup finals and one in European Cup finals. the key, he <strong>can do it in the big times</strong>.<br>Lampard may be able to do it but firstly, he has to lead his team to the level and then display his quality.<br><br>Maybe, a sting in Barca can make him even better cause spain la liga does stress more on technical skills.<br><br>But I know my views are not entirely right, so let's hear yours..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually 4-3-3 is quite widely used by managers nowadays.. and the big clubs in england seems to be using it quite often, so the england players which mostly come from the big clubs should be able to shine.. since england has no out and out pure world class left footer winger, the 4-3-3 which is a narrower formation might be a better idea. and besides the strength of england central midfield, hargreaves/lampard/gerrard are very dominant in the middle.. they should practice this more..<br><br>with rooney dropping into the whole behind the lonestriker, he is at his best. add to that the creativity of joe cole, or the flair of lennon and it should on paper at least looks quite optimistic for england.. but they just dun seem to function as a team.</div>
