He blamed bad luck. He blamed penalties.<br><br>He blamed Liverpool for defending too much. He blamed Rafa Benitez for concentrating on the Champions League.<br><br>He blamed Chelsea for not scoring enough goals in the first leg and made it sound as if that was Liverpool's fault, too.<br>Advertisement<br>Click here to find out more!<br><br>He mentioned several times, as casually as he could, that he had won the European Cup.<br><br>But he said most generously that that did not stop him feeling the pain of his shattered players, most of whom had not won it.<br><br>And when he was asked if he wished Liverpool luck for the final, he said, no.<br><br>He had too much respect for whoever their opponent would be to do something like that, he said.<br><br>Gracious in defeat Mourinho was not. Not even close. Not that we expected him to be. Not even he could claim this time that Liverpool had not scored as Daniel Agger's clipped shot bulged the back of the net.<br><br>But he did everything he could to convey the idea that Chelsea had been cheated of their divine right to appear in the final.<br>Advertisement<br>Click here to find out more!<br><br>His attitude did a disservice to his players who had run like demons and fought like tigers.<br><br>John Terry was magnificent at the heart of defence, Didier Drogba ran until he dropped, Frank Lampard showed the nerve and style of a class act.<br><br>But just like he did two years ago, Mourinho tried to start the process of cheating history.<br><br>He tried to deny the winners their due. But if he thought his stance would take attention away from a season that is lurching towards failure, he was wrong.<br><br>By anyone else's standards, Chelsea have had another stellar year, vying for four trophies until late into April. But the team that cost hundreds of millions is staring blankly at the apocalyptic scenario of clinging only to the Carling Cup for solace.<br><br>Since peace was declared between Mourinho and the Chelsea board, the club's season has fallen apart.<br><br>Outlasted by Manchester United in the Premiership, they have been knocked out of the Champions League by Mourinho's most-hated domestic rival.<br><br>And though Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has pledged Mourinho will not be sacked, we do not know whether Roman Abramovich feels the same.<br><br>It seemed strange Abramovich was not at Anfield. His absence suggests his passion for the club is not quite what it was. Or certainly, that his enthusiasm for his manager is not what it was. He will not be happy with his return from this season.<br><br>And nor will he be thrilled at Chelsea's lack of panache. Once again, they were solid and relentless but never did they threaten to take the game to Liverpool.<br><br>Mourinho insisted they showed ambition, that they were the team trying to win, but that perception was shared by few of those within Anfield.<br><br>But if Liverpool could point to inspired performances from half of their side, Chelsea could highlight only Terry and Lampard in the same vein.<br><br>Having backed Mourinho so clearly, it would be a major surprise if they jettisoned him over the summer. But even if Chelsea win the FA Cup, it will only lend a superficial sheen to a season of under-achievement.<br><br>Mourinho has to be judged only by the highest standards after the money he has been allowed to spend. His gamble on changing his team against Bolton last Saturday to save players for last night's game backfired spectacularly. And there will be no shortage of those queuing up to say that the Special One has lost his sheen.<br><br>Not that he was tempted to start trying to win friends and influence people last night. When he was asked what Benitez had got that he had not, what had helped Benitez get to two finals in the last three years when he had not reached any, Mourinho sneered: "We have two Premiership titles in the last three years and they have none."<br><br>We have welcomed the colour, spirit and character Mourinho has brought to the Premiership since he arrived from Porto.<br><br>But on nights like last night, it is awfully difficult to say anything other than he appeared childish, churlish, bitter and sad.<br><br>If he is looking for people to blame for last night's defeat, he should look at giants like Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher first. And then at himself.</div>
