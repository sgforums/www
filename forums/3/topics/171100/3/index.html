Newcastle flirted with relegation last season, and this season, depends too much on Michael Owen. Without Owen, his team loses most of the time. His faith on Bramble and Boumsong is a mistake. They constantly makes mistakes, and only Shay Given is keeping them above the relegation zone. Without Shay Given, Newcastle will probably be competing with Sunderland for last spot in the EPL.</div>

At clubs like Galatasary and Benfica, he didn't win them the league. Southampton sucked until him too, and Rangers was the exception, but only because Rangers was already strong before he came in.<br><br>Souness may not be a bad manager, considering he managed to keep blackburn in the EPL, but keep in mind he is not the right manager to lead a big club like Newcastle. Newcastle flirted with relegation last season, and this season, depends too much on Michael Owen. Without Owen, his team loses most of the time. His faith on Bramble and Boumsong is a mistake. They constantly makes mistakes, and only Shay Given is keeping them above the relegation zone. Without Shay Given, Newcastle will probably be competing with Sunderland for last spot in the EPL.</div></blockquote>Kudos to Nanren !!<br>Fantastic post .. totally agree with you !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>but i have to add on a point..<br>Not only Souness's managerial skills are in doubt, but his players and media handling leaves a lot more to be desired..<br><br>Previously there were Bellamy and Robert.. that might be excuses for Souness.. but what abt the issue that happened between Dyer and Bowyer ( <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) ? His clashes with ex players had already been highly documented b4.. Making enemies with your own players hardly helps any team morale..<br><br>Trying to stage a war with the media is not going to do any good for both the manager and the club... Not going to post match interviews merely highlights the lack of class from Souness...<br><br>Now.. it is only a matter of when , not if , Souness is going to get the axe from Freddy Sheperd..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My apologises, Yes he's rangers, i remember he pull string to buy Barry Ferguson from Rangers.<br><br>Maybe you guys are right.<br><br>Maybe it depends what types of players he manage, maybe he's too autocratic and enforced his players to perform what he want, which may stiff creativity and fustration.<br><br>Maybe Newcastle is too big club for him to handle too many quality players.</div>
