            <div class='col-md body'>when Roman marched in with his oil-stained  money, it propelled a normal team into the top 4 of EPL. With his many signings, he aims to creates a super team, sweeping everything before them...<br><br>Supporters (I don't use fans cause they swayed easily) from other more established clubs were not too happy at this. -&gt; why?<br><br>1) firstly, from normal to super, for chelsea, this was not achieved via "normal" terms. the fact is that Roman's millions did the trick.<br><br>2) manager &amp; players from Chelsea talked big. Winning the treble..<br>oooh, we can be champions by Christmas... These did not go well with anyone...<br><br>3)Doing all the unnecessary in order to get a win...trying to play Barca with a ruin field...<br><br>4) tapping Cole, and now John Obi.<br><br>5) Gallas - scoring own goal.. false statement...<br><br>The thing is other clubs may do one of the above or similar but with Chelsea, it is magnified 1000times cause they are one of the top clubs now.<br><br>To me, initially chelsea is doing good, cause with their money, they attracted good players into EPL and making it exciting..<br><br>but now, they are destroying the transfer market, publishing false statements, they are not behaving like true champions.<br><br>I believe most fans will recall the liverpool dominance in the 80s, MUFC magnificent run in the 90s, Gunners' in the 00. but Chelsea simply doesn't remind me of anything that significant that makes them stand out.<br><br>Perhaps a true blue fan can enlighten us on why they support modern chelsea..<br><br></div>

He won and he kept his promise and paid Â£38.7 million to bring a then 27 yrs old European Footballer of the Year Figo to Real from most bitter rival FC Barcelona.<br><br>The same year Real won the Spanish Championship title after not winning it for 3 years. Figo then became the 2001 FIFA World Player of the Year.<br><br>In 2001 they bought Zidane, who was elected FIFA World Player of the Year a record-equalling three times (1998, 2000, 2003) and was also named European Footballer of the Year in 1998. He was also a winner of the 98 World Cup and the Euro 2000 and the UEFA Champions League, and domestic championships in Italy.<br><br>Real with him, went on to win the 2002 UEFA Champions League.<br><br>In 2002 they bought Ronaldo. He has won three FIFA World Player of the Year awards (1996, 1997, 2002). Ronaldo and former Real Madrid teammate Zinedine Zidane are the only two men to have won the award three times.<br><br>The same year, they won the La Liga title for 2002/03, which Ronaldo had previously failed to win whilst at FC Barcelona.<br><br>So no one can say the Florentino PÃ©rez years was not successful. At least the first half was better than before he took over as president. Before him, Real didn't win the La liga for 3 years.<br></div>

So Who played boring football now ? And I think when people say "Chelsea play Boring Football" is totally nonsense and no concerte evidence and people get the idea that chelsea football is just pure boring and therefore one influence other and thus come to the conclusion chelsea football is boring which is 99.9% wrong<br><br>Chelsea Scored the most and only man utd equal it and conceded the least last season.........so who play boring football ? To me it is Liverpool among the big "4"s play boring football</span></div>
