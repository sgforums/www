Go manage in a league with Mick McCarthy.<br>And what I tell you, you better use it. This league is for rock stars, not lovers of Willie Nelson music.<br>Silly man, youÂ’re a hack. You just follow Roman so you can just get your 2 cents back.<br>And when this season wraps up, youÂ’re going to look as stupid as Alex F when I got him smashed up.<br>IÂ’m going to master this season, like I did when I went unbeaten.<br>I donÂ’t know why they let you in on the EPL, you need to take your ass across to Portugal to rot back in Hell.<br><br>Jose M:<br><br>This guys thinks his teamsÂ’ very nice, but heÂ’s a nothing if he canÂ’t take the championship twice<br>His whole team looks suspicious Â– only Paddy V and 10 bitches.<br>I look like a hoe, right? ThatÂ’s ok. My team is as right as yours is gay.<br>A collection of whinnies. So funny. You throw away a 10-point lead like I can throw away money.<br>And you compare me to Mick McCarthy? When you canÂ’t even beat big Sam and his geriatric army?<br>Talk about the Roman A, you just look on in envy, got nothing to say.<br>And talk about smashed up, like you did to Alex F huh?<br>Tell you what A. Talk to us one day, when you and your team walk away with the European Cup.<br>You are a disgrace. I can take this league like a rabbit in a turtle race.<br>Come seasonÂ’s end youÂ’ll see me with a great smile. You listen to your rock music when I pull away from you by 8 mile.<br><br>ADAPTED FROM 8 MILE SCREENPLAY...PART 2<br>Second Battle: Alex F v Jose M, season 2005 - 2006<br><br>Alex F: [AF boots off Keano and shows everybody how tough he is]<br><br>I spit on you and your money! Sue me!<br>This League may be a horror flick but the Scotsman doesnÂ’t die in this movie!<br>Battle with me? You got to be kidding! That really makes me believe you have no interest in living!<br>You think anybody will listen to the shit you say? My spats with Arsene are more interesting any day!<br>We get involved with pizza and spaghetti, you just sound like dribble from a baby!<br>Ever since Porto I wanted a piece of you, so I can make you eat me and commit suicide to.<br>Even without Keano as my leader, I'll still have enough to murder your side and eat your liver!<br>I used to like your silly show, but when you gotta go, you gotta go!<br>I Hate to do this and I'll like our little shit to last, so I'll take pictures of my rear-end so you won't forget my ass!<br>Sure, you had one season - that's ok. But now I'll end your ass with fuck you but have a nice day!<br><br>Jose M:<br><br>Boy, I think you were a little hard on Keano your leader.<br>So nice to see you fucked by Villarreal, Lille and Benfica.<br>This guy keeps screamin'! He's paranoid.<br>Quick! Someone get his ass another steroid!<br>He and Wenger sayin' BLAH-BA-DE-BLOOM-BLAH-BLOOM-BLAH-BA-DE-BLOOM-BLAH!<br>I ain't hear a word you said.<br>BLAH-BA-DE-BLOOM-BLAH - you sound like you and the misers missing it in bed!<br>Didn't you listen to Arsene the last time, Meat-head?<br>You're sayin' the same shit that he said!<br>Matter of fact, look at your fixture.<br>So many losses and draws - thatÂ’s gotta to kill ya!<br>Common man! Make your team suspenceful!<br>Get some meat in your midfield instead of fielding 5 pencils!<br>And donÂ’t come to me unless you a get a better replacement for Keano than Alan Smith and his washed-up utensil.<br>And eat my liver?<br>I got 'nuff cash to make Wayne, Rio and Ruud shit you and say "see ya!"<br>And I'll even throw in a tip for you to go get Alan Shearer!<br>You can't hack it. And season's end, Glazer is going to put you in a sack-it.<br>Want pasta? Go siesta. I'll get your ass and Wenger's done well before Easter.<br><br>ADAPTED FROM 8 MILE SCREENPLAY...PART 3<br>Third Battle: Rafee B v Jose M<br><br>Look Look<br><br>While Jose just likes to talk tough<br>This psycho is nothing but all gassed up.<br>His ego inflated by a Russian Czar<br>But who's afraid of the Red Mafia?<br><br>1 billion, 2 billion, 3 billion 4<br>Howzbout that, Jose, want some more?<br>"I want 10 titles, 10 cups!" your master said.<br>DonÂ’t deliver and I'll have your head, cut you, bleed you before you're dead.<br><br>Hey Jose? Got something to say? Against me?<br>I am a Spanish bum. I did struggle at LFC.<br>I did sign Crouch. He did shoot blanks. My Harman did get fucked by your Essien tank.<br>I did get jumped 4-1 by all of your mother-fuckers.<br>But I did beat you when it really matters.<br>And you can whine all you want about THAT goal being dubious.<br>But my team did win the Champions League, all the way screamin' "FUCK THEM CHELSEA BITCHES!"<br><br>This is the Kop. Home of heart and soul. Surprised?<br>You should be. In this place passion means more than wallet size.<br>DonÂ’t understand me? Ask Steven G.<br><br>Don't you ever try to judge me.<br>You don't know what the fuck I have to carry.<br>Shankly, Fagan and Bob Paisley<br>Who have you got? Gullit and Vialli?<br>You're at Chelsea only for the money!<br>For a buck and a half you'll be out, next training Roman A's lesbian army!<br>You're so fucked up full of Roman's shit, if that lemon came in a cup you'd probably drink it.<br></div>
