            <div class='col-md body'>so far Arsenal is good at home but their away form can sometimes leave ppl scratching their head.  And their passing, which is their trademark, are slowly surfacing but if you recall their matches in CL against Moscow, they pass, they create, they threathen but they just cannot score.  Ditto for their match against West Ham where they suddenly conceded and lost.  Ditto for Everton match where they have to come back from one goal down.<br><br>seemingly they are like stuttering and maybe if they could re-discover their form, they can be like the championship winning form / team that won the title unbeaten bah.   Granted, they are the only team so far to beat Man U and at OT, so, they need to be consistent and maintain the same form.<br><br>I think they are trying very hard to shift away from relying on TH thats why RVP is getting involved and from last week's match against Liverpool, none of the scorers are strikers, which is a good sign.<br><br>But I think their slow start will cause them damage, they are already 10 points off Man U and 7 off Chelsea.

After the CL match against CSK, they were being too "stiff" and "aggressive" against West Ham. You can see they are not relax. If the team is tense, it is very hard to score.<br><br>Their supporters were screaming "SHOOT" etc, which is bad for them. If you recall how they won the league, many goals came from flowing football without stress and look so simple.<br><br>I hope the win against Liverpool will calm the team down. Let's see how they go from here. To be beaten by West Ham in that manner and then bounce back to beat a team like Liverpool.....think about it.</div>
