            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal do have a better prospect then any other teams in Europe. If they can cope with the present problem, they are gonna win it sonner or later. Not like Spur or Newcastle or even Liverpool, they have a committed manager to groom and train them well. Wenger is a person who plan well for the future, with that and the team have faith in him ,the team can beat anyone as they show in UCL last season.</div>

Robben is a great player but was being brought into Chelsea to play as a team player (but of course Chelsea doesn't operate like Arsenal, they dun build a team with any particular player) whereas Henry to Arsenal is like their soul..hence dun you think Henry to Arsenal is probably alot more important then Robben is to Chelsea??? Robben is just like a leave beside the flower, important but will never be the life of the plant...</div>
