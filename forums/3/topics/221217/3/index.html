            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Man Utd boss Ferguson disappointed to let lead slip<br><br>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson insists they were "the better team" after their 1-1 draw with title rivals Chelsea at Old Trafford.<br>The draw allowed United to maintain their three point advantage at the top, although there was a palpable sense of disappointment the hosts had not managed to retain the lead Louis Saha gave them with his expert first-half finish.<br><br>"The test for us now is to step forward from this because winning championships is about beating other teams. If we want to win the title, consistency is the name of the game."<br><br>Ferguson agreed with the assessment of opposite number Jose Mourinho that the result was a better one for Chelsea than it was for the hosts, particularly as, in the Scot's eyes, United were in control for long periods.<br><br>"It is disappointing to draw because we were in a winning position and allowed them to get an equaliser," he said.<br><br>"They had a lot of possession but didn't create a chance. We did well on the counter-attack and had two magnificent opportunities to get a second.<br><br>"But the longer the game goes on everyone starts to get a bit nervous. Even so, they weren't causing us any bother until the goal and I thought Edwin van der Sar had it covered until Louis headed it in. In games like these, you need a little break at times - and we didn't get it."<br><br>Van der Sar might well have kept out Ricardo Carvalho's bullet header had it not been for Saha's intervention but it would be harsh to blame the Frenchman given the way he had banished the misery of his last-gasp penalty miss at Celtic last week.<br><br>"Louis has been like a caged animal in training," revealed Ferguson.<br><br>"He was bursting to play and had been taking penalty after penalty, which shows his eagerness to make up for what happened at Celtic Park.<br><br>"I never had a worry about him. He is a mature player and his pace, strength and movement are vital to the way we play." </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Rare ref praise from Chelsea boss Mourinho<br>tribalfooball.com - November 26, 2006<br><br>Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho was satisfied with the point his team earned in their 1-1 draw at Manchester United.<br><br>Mourinho was delighted with his side's comeback after the interval - which he believes could have given his side the mental edge following Louis Saha's opening goal.<br><br>"To go to the end of the season with a difference of six points maximum is the reality of the Premiership and the reality between two big teams," Mourinho predicted.<br><br>"For me the surprise is what we did last season, with 10 or 12 points difference. For me, this is not a surprise - but I think we are ready and we can go all the way.<br><br>"The good thing for me was the mental point of view. We came here and go home with the same distance. No way would a six-point gap kill the Premiership with five months to go, but six and three is a difference."<br><br>Mourinho revealed he spoke to Ferguson at the final whistle, and the pair agreed a draw was a fair result from a tight game of great intensity.<br><br>He added: "I think the result is deserved, because in the first half they were the best team and they scored - and in the second half Chelsea were best team.<br><br>"When the game had finished I exchanged quick words with Sir Alex and we agreed the result was very, very fair.<br><br>"What was wrong in the first half was maybe the mental aspect of the game, and we were waiting for things to happen. We did not show a lot of ambition, but it looks like a new game in the second half."<br><br>Mourinho also had rare words of praise for referee Howard Webb, who controlled the most high-profile game of the season with efficiency and ensured there were no major incidents.<br><br>Mourinho added: "My feeling is he had a good game - which for a young referee is good.<br><br>"A very bad game could push him down and a very good game could push him up, so it is very good for him." </span></div>
