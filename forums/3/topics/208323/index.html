            <div class='col-md body'>ROBERT HUTH admits he felt Â“almost suicidalÂ” at the thought of returning to Chelsea.<br><br>The German defenderÂ’s Â£6million transfer to Middlesbrough almost collapsed as the Blues focused their efforts on signing Ashley Cole from Arsenal.<br><br>The big centre-back Â— was in the depths of despair while they waited for confirmation. But the move went through with seconds to spare and he is determined to prove to Jose Mourinho he was wrong to ditch him.<br><br>Huth said: Â“We could not complete the signing because of one document. Â“We had to wait a few hours and once it got to late in the night I was feeling almost suicidal.<br><br>Â“I was at the club waiting for the fax to come through and everyone was a bit anxious but IÂ’m delighted to be here.Â” Eventually it was time for me to move on. Â“It doesnÂ’t take a genius to work out I had to go and it was better for the club as well.<br><br>Â“Have I a point to prove? Yes. IÂ’ve never had a good run of games so IÂ’ll be looking forward to showing what I can do.<br><br>Huth, 22, kept his word and signed for Boro despite a late bid by North East rivals Newcastle to hijack the deal.<br><br>The German insists he never had any doubts after Boro kept in touch following his failed medical in July. He is confident he can forge a defensive partnership with Jonathan Woodgate, on loan from Real Madrid.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m an honest person and we had a deal agreed and we all stuck to our word. On both parts it was honesty.Â”<br><br>Delighted boss Gareth Southgate said: Â“WeÂ’ve signed two international centre-backs and theyÂ’re both hungry to prove a point.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">you know there is lots of news on football some can be rumours,false,true or watever and it is the person who post this that have serious biasness against chelsea not the "true football news"<br><br>As Followed from tribalfootball.com</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Middlesbrough signing Huth: No problems with Mourinho<br>tribalfooball.com - September 01, 2006<br><br>New Middlesbrough signing Robert Huth insists he has only good words to say about former club Chelsea and manager Jose Mourinho.<br><br>Despite finding a starting place hard to come by at Chelsea, Huth, who signed a five-year deal, refused to criticise Stamford Bridge boss Mourinho.<br><br>"The manager was brilliant for me and I learned a lot from him and I've only got good words for Chelsea," Huth said.<br><br>"The manager did have different plans for me but you give it time. I thought I deserved to play but it didn't happen and it was time to move on.<br><br>"I was frustrated with the situation and it doesn't take a genius to work out that I needed a move and that it would be good for the club also.<br><br>"I never had a run of 10-15 games so I will be looking forward to playing regularly if selected."<br><br>It appeared at one stage that the transfer was destined to stall at the 11th hour.<br><br>A planned unveiling fell through on Thursday afternoon and despite Middlesbrough chief executive Keith Lamb remaining confident the saga would be resolved by the early evening, confirmation had not been issued by either party by the close of the window at midnight.<br><br>However, both parties confirmed the transfer today and with the help of the Premier League Huth is eligible to play for his new club as soon as he has regained full fitness following a foot operation in the summer.<br><br>"It's been frustrating," said the 22-year-old Berliner. "I picked up an injury in the World Cup so the transfer was put back for five weeks.<br><br>"But now I'm delighted that everything has gone through.<br><br>"Yesterday was a very tense day and when we got to 10 o'clock and it hadn't been sorted you do think 'Is it going to happen?'<br><br>"So I'm delighted that everything went through at the end. It's important to get games under my belt and that wasn't the case at Chelsea with all the new signings.<br><br>"I was impressed with the way Middlesbrough have looked after me, the way they've shown great interest in me."<br><br>Lamb explained the reason behind the delay.<br><br>He said: "We were unfortunate yesterday because all our documentation was completed some time ago, as was the agreement with Chelsea.<br><br>"The deal was never in any doubt, the deal was always secure. We just needed one signature on one piece of documentation.<br><br>"But Chelsea were wrapped up yesterday with dealings over Ashley Cole and William Gallas. That took some time but when that was sorted the final piece of the jigsaw could go in place.<br><br>"There was a tremendous willingness to ensure the transfer happened and we're very grateful to the Premier League for their help in ensuring it was completed.<br><br>"We can now concentrate on football and step off that transfer merry-go-round." </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal new boy William Gallas has warned Ashley Cole that working with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is far from an easy ride.<br><br>The France international swapped West London for the north side of the capital when he finally ended the most protracted transfer of the summer in moving to the Emirates Stadium, with Ashley Cole heading to Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Gallas' relationship soured with Mourinho to such an extent that he was threatened with the possibility of spending the rest of the campaign in the club's second string, before an eventual accord was struck with Arsenal.<br><br>With a deal done and both players having had their respective wishes granted, Gallas has wasted no time in issuing a frank and forthright appraisal of his former taskmaster.<br><br>"I wanted to leave Chelsea and Arsenal was the perfect club for me," Gallas told The People.<br><br>"They wanted me, they are a team going for all the honours, and I am very happy in London and I have a lot of friends here.<br><br>"I am happy that I have joined Arsenal. I'm sure I will be treated better by their coaching staff than I have been by Mourinho in the last year.<br><br>"I wish Cole luck and I hope he has the patience to put up with his manager."<br><br>While conceding that Mourinho is a more than accomplished trainer, Gallas has blasted his man-management skills - pointing to his spats with several players in the past.<br><br>"Mourinho is a good trainer but he is fickle with his players," he added.<br><br>"What has happened to me has happened in the past to Ricardo Carvalho, Mateja Kezman, Paulo Ferreira, Asier Del Horno and Hernan Crespo.<br><br>"He uses us for his convenience. In the past few years I have had offers from Italy and Spain but I stayed loyal to Chelsea.<br><br>"But this has counted for nothing with Mourinho and that is sad. Mourinho has pressured me constantly as if he wanted to get the press and the fans against me.<br><br>"I don't understand it. In the dressing room my team-mates have been supportive but Mourinho is the boss and so nobody has spoken out for me.<br></div>

There are people who died to free themselves of slavery. To use this term is insulting.Â”<br><br>Domenech insists on still picking Makelele and added: Â“I did not give Makelele an option. I imposed his return.Â”<br><br>Les Bleus defender Lilian Thuram has also slammed Mourinho.<br><br>Thuram said: Â“If Mourinho can use a word like this, it means he doesnÂ’t know what he is talking about. He doesnÂ’t know what slavery is.<br><br>Â“He didnÂ’t say it because he is stupid but because he doesnÂ’t know the meaning of this word.<br><br>Â“This has nothing to do with soccer.
