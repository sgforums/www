Rio Ferdinard : Complete flop and has failed to justify his 30 mil pound price tag<br><br>b. Wayne Rooney: Cost a bomb and has made headlines for all the wrong reasons.<br><br>Between them they cost the club over 50 million pounds...money that could have easily been invested in an army of quality players.<br><br>Last time he spent on Jaap Stam, Dwight Yorke and Jesper Blomquist, he won the treble. Now he's just spending for the sake of it.<br><br>And deciding against retiring was perhaps the worst decision in his life. They should have insisted he step down and get Martin O'Neal in.<br><br>It's really time for a change. An FA cup and a league title are poor returns since then for a club of this statue. </div></blockquote>Time to rebut some of the points made by our fellow forumites..<br>a) Rio Ferdinand - Yes.. he is definitely over-rated and overpriced at 30million.. but i dun think he is the only one faulted for the games United lost... Silvestre is such a liability.. i would love to see how John Terry struggled playing beside him...<br><br>b) Wayne Rooney - Oh come on ! Made the headlines for the wrong reason ? Where have you been last season ?? How many times has he rescued United ? I dun think making ur Champions League Debut and getting a hat-trick is a bad headline ? Euro 2004 anyone ? This season has not even passed the halfway mark.. and everyone is berating him and United... Anyone recalled that he scored one and made one (albeit racing down 60 yards to provide a pass for RVN) at St. james park this season ??<br><br>Title race is over in Sept ?!?!? Ppl talked abt how boring the league is now.. becos of one-horse race.. and here they are going on no team is going to beat them... Come on.. Believe in ur own Freaking team ! If the supporters dun believe in their own teams , what makes u think that the players would ?<br><br>c) Fergie to stand down - I dun really like the 4-3-3 or 4-5-1 formation but if it is the way Chelski is knocking the lights out of other teams.. why can't we use the same formation too ?<br>Martin O'Neill to be a replacement for Fergie ? Yes.. he had done admirably well at Celtic.. but what has he won ? A few scottish leagues and cups.. where no other teams will win except them n Rangers..<br>Have not progressed to the last 16 of the champions league b4... His previous job , manager at Leicester wasn't that eye-catching too.. Although he had a weak team ... but then again.. Sam Allarydce didn't inherit a good team.. but he still chop n change till the team he had today..<br><br>Overall.. i definitely think that with Fergie's record and pedigree.. i would certainly think that he would deserve at least one more chance ?!<br><br>United We Stand  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br></div>
