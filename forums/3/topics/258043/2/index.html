            <div class='col-md body'>Oh man, if i am to just take the last 5 yrs... you will lose big time man... The one thing that you seem to forget also is the players united bought will most likely still have after sales value... The Rooney, the Ronaldo... Can sell for $80m today... But the Shev, the Ballack and the SWP... i am not too sure lah... seem to me like all lose money one... Big money somemore... And you mentioned Veron, you know who man u sold Veron to? Guess lah... and you know how much... At least when he was with man u, he played 51 matches for them and scored 14 goals, they also won the title... But when they sold him to the other club, he only played less than 8 matches and only score a single goal before they loan him out...<br><br>Know your football?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, GP, you got a good point.<br>MUFC was Chelsea-like in the past. They just over-power people, throw huge sums of money to get their targets...<br><br>But now, Chelsea is the one doing that.<br><br>As for 2007, spending so much, well, we got one title, went to FA Cup Finals, UCL Semi-finals, and with Chelsea paying us for Mikel, selling RVN, it gave us a bumper... And then on top of that, 50M was given. So we spend on Evra, Vidic, &amp; Carrick. As for the recent buys, Anderson and Nani, well,  they are investments, to replace Giggs and Scholes.<br><br>I did Zcoss did the numbers for you already.<br><br>Gunners won't need cause they are all young. Liverpool may want but they are replacing. Chelsea, may need cause their two recent buys are flops. Spurs are buying too.<br><br>I am trying to talk sense, but if you start flaming, then no point continuing..<br><br></div>

But seems you don't know your history too well.<br><br>MUFC did buy a lot of flops, but that's due to scouts' report. And it is a bit like gamble.<br><br>But for me, Forlan was never a flop, just ask Dudek, I bet he may piss in his pants, or that infamous goal when Veron pass to Forlan to stick it in Chelsea's net.

As long as you earned it from the game, they are free to spend what. United have been profitable over the last few years and really, they still need a striker... that is a fact unless they decide to go with an injury prone Saha again for next season... i belief they may buy another. But i also belief they will also sell one or two players within this next 3 months to make up the difference...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
