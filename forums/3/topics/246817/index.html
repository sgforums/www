We have played very poorly and not won.<br><br>"When you don't score goals, as a game goes on or as a season goes on, there is always an inevitability that someone will score at your end because of the quality we face every week.<br><br>"But if you do score a few goals early you can get some momentum going. Nobody has turned us over massively so I do think it could have been a lot different.<br><br>"I would say it is not fair to put it all on Marlon's shoulders, nor is it fair to say the other players haven't applied themselves.<br><br>"They have done and are doing as much as they can." </span></div>

Basically his words were he appoints the Manager and gives them every chance to be successful and it's down to them to prove they can be. That was the discussion and I'm happy with that.<br><br>"I've been to Craven Cottage a few times this season to see Fulham play. Fulham is a very welcoming Club with a traditional stadium played in a very modern Premiership. From what I've seen off the field the Club is at the cutting edge of what modern Premiership football is about. Now, on the field, we've got to accumulate the points to make sure we're here next season.<br><br>"It's about coming in and changing things. The Manager's job is to point the players in the direction you think they can be successful. Ultimately, whether they're successful or not depends if the players take that on board and do as you ask. I'd like to think in the two previous jobs I've done they've taken that on board and they've seen the benefits. There are no great secrets to football, from top to bottom. It's about making sure the basics are right and the players know what they are doing and doing it to the enth degree.<br><br>"Different managers have different ways of doing things. We all have our individual traits and I'd like to think if the ones I like to work on can be brought here then they'll be successful.
