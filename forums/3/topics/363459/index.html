              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Singapore group in talks to buy Newcastle United<br> </strong></span> <br> ChronicleLive, 9 Jun 2009, by Lee Ryde<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>NEWCASTLE United owner Mike Ashley is in talks with the Singapore-based company The Profitable Group over a possible sale.</strong></span><br> <br> The Chronicle can reveal that the far east strategic global investment
              group are currently preparing a package to bid for £100million-rated
              Newcastle with Toon tycoon Ashley officially putting the club up for
              sale yesterday.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The Profitable Group are understood to have a
              strong Geordie connection and have ex-Liverpool and England midfield
              battler Steve McMahon on board as Group Commercial Director.</strong></span><br> <br> And it is understood that the group have an ambitious plan to involve the fans at St James’s Park more than ever.<br> <br> Indeed, the company’s initial blueprint, which was disclosed to the
              Chronicle today from the far east, claims a successful bid would see
              them:<br> <br> :: Plan to turn United into a trust which will give Toon fans a major
              say in club politics and draw similarities with the Barcelona model in
              La Liga<br> <br> :: To appoint Alan Shearer as boss and back the Geordie legend with
              transfer funds to help the Magpies fight their way out of the
              Championship<br> <br> :: Ensure that a footballing figure will be appointed at boardroom
              level to ensure the series of high profile errors of Mike Ashley era
              aren’t repeated<br> <br> :: To increase the capacity of St James’s Park to 60,000<br> <br> A Profitable Group source told the Chronicle today from Singapore said:
              "Yes we are interested in buying Newcastle United - and we’re putting
              together a plan.<br> <br> "We have spoken with Mike Ashley and Derek Llambias and we are hoping that we can reveal a lot more in the next few days.<br> <br> "We have people within the company who have strong Geordie roots that stretch more than 40 years.<br> <br> "And there are people here who have a love for the club - we think that is vital for Newcastle at the moment.<br> <br> "The plan we have in mind is to get the club on a sound financial footing first and foremost.<br> <br> "Then we aim to turn the club into a trust.<br> <br> "It will be very similar to the Barcelona model where fans have a major say on what happens at the club.<br> <br> "Without any question we see Alan Shearer as the man to manage the team.<br> <br> "Yes, we have Steve McMahon on board but he is not looking into management.<br> <br> "He is though a football man and understands the game inside out.<br> <br> "There is also scope to look at increasing the capacity to 60,000 which is being explored.<br> <br> "We will look to give Alan money to spend and funds to build his squad
              - but we have to say now that we are not interested in highly paid
              players at this moment in time - we won’t be a Chelsea."<br> <br> The source, who spoke to us before boarding a flight to a business
              meeting, made it clear Shearer, who has been backed overwhelmingly by
              the Tyneside public, was their number one choice.<br> <br> "What this club needs now is somebody who understands the area, understands the people and how this club works.<br> <br> "Steve McMahon can offer expertise in the background. But Alan is the man we want."<br> <br> However, the next move is all dependent on the co-operation of Ashley,
              Llambias and Seymour Pierce investment banker Keith Harris who has been
              entrusted to sell the club.<br> <br> The source added: "We are not in the business of misleading people.<br> <br> "We have put a plan together and it’s one we think that the fans will be behind.<br> <br> "Newcastle is a fabulous club and we are hoping that we can reveal more in the next few days."<br> <br> ------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>More at <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.
