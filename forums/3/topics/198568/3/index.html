            <div class='col-md body'>it is true that he made himself look silly by taking the penalty before the referee blew the whistle.  it is a rule practised worldwide.  he should have known better.  that is what the whole comment is all out.<br><br>nothing to do with liverpool or his performance!!!<br><br></div>

Bad luck really ravaged them too..Rooney was clearly not 100% fit and cannot play his best...Owen came back and was out again..Crouch didn exactly excel either and Theo walcott didn start a single game with Arsenal or England in de Wc...Eriksson should have brought more strikers such as defoe and bent instead..y brin peeps like Jenas and Walcott if u didn even play them....</div>
