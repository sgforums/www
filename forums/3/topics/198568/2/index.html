Nobody mentioned Liverpool here what...<br><br>The comment didn't came from anyone here i think, in between i never see. It came from SvenÂ’s assistant Tord Grip &amp; Carminati EnglandÂ’s fitness coach all professional in their own field. All they said was Carragher is a joke cos he is a professional football player and as a professional football player you know you have to wait for the referee to blow his whistle before taking a penalty.<br><br>It has nothing to do with being brave by taking a penalty. And nothing to do with missing too. Lampard &amp; Gerrard missed too, but they were not called a joke.<br><br>The point they were trying to say i think is he, as a professional player didn't follow or know the rule as a result, having to retake causing himself to become nervous unnecesssarily and ended up changing his mind, hesitated in his run-up and fired a shot which Ricardo saved easily. That is the comment why he is a joke all about. They mentioned Â“It is the same rule in England, in Italy or anywhere else in Europe. ItÂ’s the same in America or Africa Â— in fact everywhere.Â” to make their point.<br><br>So lighten up bro, one player didn't make a team. And no one is thinking any different about Liverpool. It was JAMIE CARRAGHER that they are saying and base on what we have seen, they have their point we can't denial. But Liverpool is still liverpool and not Carragher.<br><br></div>

Nobody mentioned Liverpool here what...<br><br>The comment didn't came from anyone here i think, in between i never see. It came from SvenÂ’s assistant Tord Grip &amp; Carminati EnglandÂ’s fitness coach all professional in their own field. All they said was Carragher is a joke cos he is a professional football player and as a professional football player you know you have to wait for the referee to blow his whistle before taking a penalty.<br><br>It has nothing to do with being brave by taking a penalty. And nothing to do with missing too. Lampard &amp; Gerrard missed too, but they were not called a joke.<br><br>The point they were trying to say i think is he, as a professional player didn't follow or know the rule as a result, having to retake costing himself to become nervous unnecesssarily and ended up changing his mind, hesitated in his run-up and fired a shot which Ricardo saved easily. That is the comment why he is a joke all about. They mentioned Â“It is the same rule in England, in Italy or anywhere else in Europe. ItÂ’s the same in America or Africa Â— in fact everywhere.Â” to make their point.<br><br>So lighten up bro, one player didn't make a team. And no one is thinking any different about Liverpool. It was JAMIE CARRAGHER that they are saying and base on what we have seen, they have their point we can't denial. But Liverpool is still liverpool and not Carragher.<br><br></div></blockquote>dont bother explaining things to him.<br><br>it is plain and simple.  to him nobody can criticise liverpool and any of its players.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not a liverpool supporter but i really don't see why they made him the scapegoat after England poor showing at the World Cup.<br><br>The only reason why Eriksson sub him on is to take penalties.<br>He shud have waited for the whistle.<br>But it's unfair to brand him a joke.<br><br>Lampard is even worse. Throughout the whole tournament, he kept shooting when there're better options around and even if he's presented with a golden opportunity to score, he misses.
