As usual, you miss the very simple point, seems you haven't improved as much as I initially gave you credit for.<br><br>Nobody's getting you wrong, you are getting everybody else wrong and as usual blaming everyone else for it. Like I've said before, be responsible for the things you say instead of blaming everything one and everything else.<br><br>Rather than see the simple point infront of you, you like trying to twist your logic that you're right and everyone is wrong. Intsead, you end up looking silly, like now.<br><br>Perhaps to you, relationships are about lies and all, in which case, it means you have very shallow and superficial relationships. But it's more likely, you either miss or refuse to see the points that others try to tell you.<br><br>It's not about lying, it never was. Why do you keep coming up with your own weird conclusion about things? It was never about two timing in a relationship but you brought it up anyway. If anything was irrelevant, these two points were the irrelevant points.<br><br>Just like how people used to tell you the problem isn't with your supporting Chelsea in itself but the attitude in itself, yet you keep accusing everyone else of either being anti-Blue or conspiring with the anti-Blues against you.<br><br>A lot of times, the truth is much simpler and more straightforward than how you make it out to be.<br><br>Seriously GP, look inwards for once and stop pointing the finger at everyone else.
