I doubt they would close shop early instead of making more money. As for the shoutings I have never been awaken by any of those, hardly heard any noise late at night. For the last point people can still get together for drinking without watching anything and theres no difference if people gather to watch WC matches or movies so wat do u mean by constructive?</div>

Man Udt losing RVN, Heinze and Ronaldo wouldn't be a problem at all cos their best run last season came when RVN was drop and without Heinze for the whole season. Basically, Arsenal have lost or will lose more players than Man utd. Man Udt have the funds to get another 2, 3 players without a problem. They have already got 12M pounds for that John fellow to chelsea and imagine if they sell these 3 players, for a total of 40M, They will have more than 50M to buy players and this amount don't include their own money, this are money generated from player sale only.<br><br>I would rather be in Man Udt situation than Arsenals'</div>

Man Udt losing RVN, Heinze and Ronaldo wouldn't be a problem at all cos their best run last season came when RVN was drop and without Heinze for the whole season. Basically, Arsenal have lost or will lose more players than Man utd. Man Udt have the funds to get another 2, 3 players without a problem. They have already got 12M pounds for that John fellow to chelsea and imagine if they sell these 3 players, for a total of 40M, They will have more than 50M to buy players and this amount don't include their own money, this are money generated from player sale only.<br><br>I would rather be in Man Udt situation than Arsenals' </div></blockquote>Why the Fark is Heinze going out? He is my fave defender in Man U... Correct Man U may have more money but don't know why players like don't want to come.. Hopefully Gattuso comes to Man U..</div>

I think a lot of people are looking what will happen in Italy first... If got good players cheap sale why don't want?<br><br>If Chelsea had waited a little longer for Shev, maybe they could have got him at one third of the 30M they paid for him. On Gattuso, unless AC goes down otherwise he won't leave. But if they go down, he will cost less then carrick and a better player somemore in the holding role.<br><br>In Heinze's case, Real M may want him. But not a big lost if he goes, last season he didn't even play at all from mid sep. anyway, they have Silvestre and Evra in that position already... My favourite defender is The Cool Rio.</div>
