Ferguson himself mentioned that he would not make the same mistake as the one against Exeter City.. and now here we go again..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Burton did played out of their sleeves.. and Ferguson's selections gave them addition confidence and desire to beat United.. Maybe Ferguson wasn't being disrespectful (just maybe <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ).. but if u r a burton player, you would definitely be fired up..<br><br>As for contesting with Chelski for the title.. all i can said that with Smith or Fletcher as the defensive midfielder.. we are going to struggle.. DOn't get me wrong.. Smith is an excellent fighter.. puts in 120% (p.s. i love him to bits <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ) but his positioning and reckless tackles are often called into question.. as for fletcher, nuff said  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>By the way.. yes i do know who Bailey is.. but i didn't start supporting United from so long ago..<br>i started when United beat Chelsea in the FA Cup final.. 4-0.. 1993 or 1994.. forgot le  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br>Brian McClair , Lee Sharpe.. those days..<br>so this little drought of trophies doesn't really bother me that much.. been thru worse  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
