Fighting for every ball.. and they played a much better passing game than liverpool..<br><br>All was going rosy for Luton until Sinama-Pongolle came in.. Liverpool opting Sinama upfront and pushing Cisse wide right..  Sinama's 1st goal rattle Luton and from then on, Liverpool pushed on their ascendency and got a fine victory.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>P.S. what a great goal from Alonso.. with his unfavoured left foot !<br>and take a look at Stevie G's reaction.. haha.. he was absolutely fuming when Alonso opted to shoot instead of passing to him..

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi HafizulKMS,<br>allow me to speak some sense for MUFC.<br><br>you are 100% against MUFC, why?<br><br>1) they were dominant in the 90s?<br><br>2) they won the european cup by luck?<br><br>3) they don't play beautiful football?<br><br>4) the players were too tough?<br><br>5) the fans were too abusive?<br><br>if for any of the reasons you are against them, let me speak my case.<br><br>1) Liverpool was also dominant in the 80s, but why nothing were heard of them? Cause if you were living at the age, where you go complain? Net? Sms? Forum?<br><br>2) Coming back to 3-0 and winning by penalties over Milan to me is sheer luck too. If Pool were to meet Milan against, my whole house will be on Milan.<br><br>3) looking at chelsea now, are they playing beautiful football? at their best, MUFC can sweep any team off the planet. With Giggs, Beckham at the wing, Keane, Scholes in the middle, Yorke and Cole in Front, and Stam at the back, and our great Dane keeper. We were class.<br><br>4) Looking at Gerrard, Sissoko, Hamman, the tackles they put in. Well, when hamman were tackled badly by Essien, well, one player spoke up against Hamman as he got it too. Yes, Cantona did a kung-fu, but was he banned?<br><br>5) my masterpiece.<br>The only club to ever put English Football on the map for all the wrong reasons - Liverpool. Liverpool - The only club whose song is a joke when they sang "you will never walk alone" cause you certainly die alone. Liverpool FC, the only football club whose fans died becos of LFC, whose fans killed becos of LFC. Don't believe me, ask any Juventus Fans.<br><br>The only fans who jeered when silence was for the passing of George Best - Liverpool FC.<br><br>I chose Liverpool cause it is always protrayed as angels.<br><br>For me, I do respect what Liverpool has achieved in the past, and for winning the last european cup.<br><br>My point,  No matter what team,  will have mud on their names but if you are really a true, geninue football fan, you will come to respect what each team has achieved.<br><br></div>

Compare to Jose, who can really develop his players to the best. So Man U is lucky too in the pass, but now why they crying like fuk when their luck is over?<br><br>3) Man U players are good, so do other players, then Alan Smith is cheaper than Drogba, does that mean Alan Smith only have one leg, where Drogba has 4 legs? If not then what the fuk they are complaining at?<br><br>I tell you what, whenever Man U fuk up, you can see millions of excuses from the manager, players, as well as fans. Cannot play on sand eh?

            <div class='col-md body'>HafizulKMS,<br>Firstly, after reading all your posts, I expected some intelligence that's why I did not want to explain more. But seeing what little you have, allow me to explain.<br><br>1) the pitch was covered with sand.<br>You trying to say Burton players have 3 legs, which can run better on sand?<br><br>If you ever watch EPL games, and see some of the fields, be it anfield, old trafford or gunners, they are well-maintained. Now, suddenly, throw them in a field half-flooded, filled with sand, and performance will dip. Now, if your team is familiar with this condition, it will give you an advantage. Now, MUFC did not lose, yes, they have a lousy draw. It is better than Fulham or Spurs.<br>Now, another thing, what team do you support? Burton?<br><br>2) MUFC players are not good in beach football.<br>Buton have 22 players againts 11 Man U players?<br><br>I did not suggest that there were any numerous advantage, but conditions advantage.<br><br>3) MUFC players can't compete in terms of Burton's spirit.<br>This one everybody know. Man U jokers no spirit, everybody know.<br><br>Oh really? Burton on the day was over the moon, cause one thing, they hit the jackpot in terms of gate earning, and they get to Old trafford, a dream to them.  But in no way, did I mention that MUFC has no spirit.<br><br>4) WC2006 is around the corner.<br>So? They should perform lousier so that Erikson won't choose them to play in the national team? they perfer not to be selected so that can enjoy holiday at home? Wakakakak~~ Lamest excuse!<br><br>Nope, they won't want to get injured. From what I read, your mind is filled with just negative thoughts. Imagine England with an injured list of Rooney out, Terry, Gerrard and Paul Robinson, you think they will go with confidence.<br><br>anymore you need?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi,<br>firstly, if you wish to use such language, I shan't engage you cause you are unworthly of conversation or debate, cause I won't go so low.<br><br>I tell you what:<br><br>1) Man U spent like fuk which not any better or worst than Chelsea in the pass (their dominating age). Chelsea pay more now is because of inflation. So why they complaining about how much Chelsea spent? do they complain how much themselves spent in the pass? then tell me, why Man U fukers crying like a loser?<br><br>I am unsure who you are mentioning?<br>But let me ask you this question. From the days Chelsea were struggling before Russian came, who else is in the team and not brought? Who in the chelsea team came thru the youth side and not bought? Mere Inflation? for that, I am now sure you can't do maths.<br><br>2) Man U won is just because of luck too, Fukerson has luck where Beckhem and gangs are doing good, but now, he is running out of luck, because all of his youngsters play boobies better than playing soccer. Compare to Jose, who can really develop his players to the best. So Man U is lucky too in the pass, but now why they crying like fuk when their luck is over?<br><br>Yes, I already admit MUFC won the cup due to Luck. But for them to be dominant in the 90s, it is not luck.  Jose can develop players? name 2-3 where he develop from youth? ZERO!! Are they crying? Please back it up with some creditable information than slam with your personal feelings.<br><br>3) Man U players are good, so do other players, then Alan Smith is cheaper than Drogba, does that mean Alan Smith only have one leg, where Drogba has 4 legs? If not then what the fuk they are complaining at?<br><br>MUFC complains about Alan Smith? AS is caught in no man's land becos he needs to cover for Keano. Now, you want to compare strikers? pound for pound, compare Drogba with RVN or Henry? Does he even come close? Look @ the scoring charts, Even cisse from pool is better than Drogba when he was in French. Now, I believe I got that right.<br><br>I tell you what, whenever Man U fuk up, you can see millions of excuses from the manager, players, as well as fans. Cannot play on sand eh? Wakakakaka~~ that's lame.<br><br>Trust me, give it 2 years when Chelsea collapse, I will see zillions of excuses from "chelsea" fans when they jump on the bangwagon when Moaniro joined.<br><br>What was the score when Chelsea last played United? they won??<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello iceFatboy..<br>being a fellow United fan...<br>i am sorry to disagree with some of your points..<br><br>For the FA Cup match with Burton..<br>i dun think the sand pitch was as much as an arguement..<br><br>Man Utd paid mega bucks for so-called Mega Players.. you are expected to coast to victory, let alone win it..<br>Yes.. Burton players have the added advantage of playing b4 in sandy pitches.. but United players are professional players ! Coming against non-league (nt even semi-pro) opposition.. there is really not arguement..<br><br>It's simply a case of not good enough on that day.. Not good enough to win a match that they are expected to thrash the opposition..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Just my 2 cents worth.. no offense..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yo HafizulKMS,<br>I did not mentioned any other teams. Yes, all teams deserved to be respected.<br><br>Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham, and etc are deserves to be respected. Except Man U, they won't they arrogant, they lose, they fuk up, they want others to shut up?<br><br>Oh really?  They know that for a fact? Where you got your news? Sun? Mirror? BBC? you actually believe those medias who spice up stories to earn their keep and to entrap fools like you? You are pitiful. For someone who is struck in a different time zone, you know nothing. I would imagine you to get facts not myths before you shout you mouth off cause from my angle, I see a pitiful man in a small well, banging on four walls.<br><br>I am happy for them for having another screw up performance against Blackburn.<br><br>Screw up performance? 1-1? In blackburn? When they lost the last time?<br>Hey, if we win, we will be in the finals. Yes, a worthless cup you may say comparing to Gunners, Chelsea or Liverpool. But hey, win the european cup then we talk, else you are but living a dream.<br><br>Oh yeah, tell me, over this transfer period, who spent most? who spent less? Chelsea spent more than Man U? if no, meaning Man U spent more, that mean they can win the EPL title loh? Wakakakakak~~ Jokes ah!<br><br>Oh, suddenly, you pick one transfer period to see when MUFC spend the most. Can I pick the period when Chelsea brought like half their team?<br><br>If you even bother to read the news, MUFC is buying to rebuilt. Yes, SAF has admitted they are in no way as consistent as Chelsea. Thus, he wants to built and challenge them next season.  But I believe your mud in your eyes are so thick, you can't see anything other than blue.<br><br>Hey, my suggestion, go wash your face, to clear the mud, brush your mouth so you speak nicer. Then we talk.</div>
