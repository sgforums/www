            <div class='col-md body'>I believe all non-Chelski fans can see clearly that Money did a play an integral part in Chelski success..<br><br>but then again.. Chelski fans prefer to turn a blind eye to that and claim that team spirit won the title for them.. absolute bollocks..<br><br>You trying to tell me that Drogba , Crespo , Makelele , Joe Cole , Frank Lampard and almost whole of the squad.. came for nothing ?<br>Of course not ... cast ur eyes back to 3 or 4 seasons ago.. under Ken Bates.. without money.. did chelski win anything ? i can onli remember a FA cup or 2 ..<br><br>Of course , other teams spend $$ too.. Man Utd spent the biggest lot (pre-Abramovich era).. we didn't say that united won the champions league and EPL becos of their team spirit and rubbish.. $$ did play a big big part..<br><br>Speaking abt Real Madrid.. i personally dun think Chelski has any rights to question their achievements.. Real is the MOST successful club in European history..<br><br>Jose Mourinho is a good manager.. but without Roman Abramovich bankrolling those transfers.. do u really think that they will be what they r today ?

If Chelsea were as before can they splurge on players like Essien and SWP? I highly doubt so.If Chelsea had not been waving their cash at these 2 players' clubs, i believe that Essien wud go to man u and SWP will end up in Arsenal.But they didn.Becoz Chelsea offered a pirce that other clubs cannot match.sure other clubs lyk man u also spent.Liverpool spent.But did they approach the 300 million mark in a mere 2 seasons?</div>
