A draw during below form is far more acceptable.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Jeno:</div><div class="quote_body">...I, for one, didn't see or read any Man Utd fans blowing their horns and said that United is going for the title.. </div></blockquote>Because Man U know that the dream of winning the title  for them was over, at least for this season. But there are still majority who thought about the pass, about the history, will your dream come true?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Jeno:</div><div class="quote_body">...it's funny and contradicting.. because just not that long ago.. Man Utd lost.. and someone did made some laughing.. that person is a monkey ? ...<br></div></blockquote>It's big difference between thrash by mid table team compare and to draw with them. It's such a shame thrash by Boro, and lately Man City. So, want to thrash Chelsea? Well, I have long long never see that already, waiting for that.</div>

Ask any Liverpool fan if it meant anything about this loss.<br><br>I bet Charlton would have raise the roof if they have beaten Chelsea, but they did well considering they stop the blues from winning all at home and at a fraction of Chelsea's costs.<br><br>And yes, it meant a lot to MUFC as they lost the derby to a better team in City, and needed this win to raise morale.  Maybe, it is nothing much to other teams or team who already have the title confirmed.<br><br>Just two things left to mention.<br><br>Yes, I think all EPL fans and even MUFC fans agreed, Chelsea is going to be Champion of the EPL for this season.<br><br>And if there is no memories or history then who are you? Can you fathom this deep truth?<br><br>And lastly, to call someone else monkey has really degraded you to animal level.
