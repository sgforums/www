            <div class='col-md body'>haha.. it's weird that how kissing his own club's badge and celebrating the victory can "incite" the fans that much..<br><br>Only last week did Fowler taunt the United fans after he scored the third goal.. notice how none of the United fans over-reacted to that ?<br><br>Carragher himself thrown a coin back to the fans.. pot calling kettle black..<br><br>Liverpool fans shouted abuse at Neville for 90minutes.. and when Gary celebrated his victory and flaunt it to the Scousers.. The Pool fans suddenly turned Angels.. and reported to the police how Neville incitied them..<br><br>If you can't take the abuse.. then don't dish it out..<br>It's as simple as that..<br><br>Of course, not only Liverpool fans shout abuse.. it's literally all over the world..<br>The point is to take everything with a pinch of salt..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Wakakakakak~~~<br><br></div></blockquote>i didn't see any Man United fans making alot of noise now.. we are just being tactful with our replies.. Is there any comments that claimed that we thrashed liverpool? any comments that we walked over Liverpool?<br>Nope i dun see any.. (maybe my eyes r playing tricks with me..)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>To answer your point on Chelski fans not making any noise when they beat liverpool..<br>maybe.. maybe no noise was being made.. becos all the time u , a chelski fan, has been making all the noise.. be it whoever that wins..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>and one more thing.. it's something that's called Tradition.. it exists in a match between Manchester United and Liverpool...<br>The Nostalgic.. The Atmosphere.. The Setting..<br>it's hard to explain... but to those who have followed United and Pool longer than since Abramovich poked his nose into Chelsea FC... they will understand (i think)..<br><br>The pride factor.. it's lovely and sometimes downright nauseating..<br>it's these kind of matches that allow you to share a friendly banter with your Pool-supporting colleague..<br><br>Of course.. Chelski definitely will win the title.. their fans will rejoice..<br>but it seems that this Chelski fan (on top) demands all non-Chelski fans to rejoice in that too... isn't that abit far-fetched ?<br><br>It seems that in this forum.. only Chelski is allowed to celebrate in their victories..<br>while Man Utd can onli grieve in their defeats..<br>Any United celebrations will be clamped down and swore at by Chelski supporters.. even thou it is a low key celebration (just like this one)..</div>
