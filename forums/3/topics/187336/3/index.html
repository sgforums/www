Ferdinand though IF on his day, might be better.  But he's too prone to lapses in concentration.<br><br>But for me, i just like those defenders that get stuck in. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Like.. Terry, Carragher and Vidic and other lesser names ones.<br><br>Also, if you watch ESPN. They have alot of show that talk about EPL.<br>People like Paul Maesfield and Steve McMahon actually thinks Terry and Carragher could be the best pairing for England. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So please.. again..<br><br>I'm a MAN UTD FAN~! Through and through.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  &lt;-- see the red devil?<br><br>But i do accept the fact that you feel Ferdinand is a better defender too. Cos everyone has their own opinion as to what a TOP defender requires. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

And when you said Everyone knows terry is better than rio... Come on... Just see how Sven-Goran Eriksson (England Manager) rate them. Rio 1st choice with terry and cambell to partner him. In fact, Cambell came back last night and did well for the Gunners so maybe cambell may be ahead of terry too.<br><br>No disrespect to terry who i belief is also good but Gallas is the rock in the chelsea defence.</div>
