Fergie came in the late 80s and mu were underperforming and were definitely not one of the richest club in the world.<br><br>He bought cheap and good players. (Schmichael, Keane,Solksjaer etc) He also trained and brought players from the youth team (Beckham, Neville,Giggs etc). And these players were the core of the team which were so successful.<br><br>Man Utd won trophies and entered the CL regularly. There was stadium expansion etc and all these helped mu to EARN</strong> lots of money which they used to buy more exe players (Rooney, Van Nistelrooy,Veron etc).<br><br>This is in complete contrast to the way chelsea became the richest football club in the world. In the 02/03 season, they were facing administration and were having huge debts. (ghimpeng, do u noe this fact??).<br><br>Then one fine day, 1 russian by the name of roman abramovic decided to make chelsea his new financial playtoy. An endless pot of money was poured into the club and chelsea became the richest club OVERNIGHT<strong><br>The quick cash was used to hire a good coach and buy good players. Success was quickly obtained.<br><br>This is why other pple will say chelsea BOUGHT their titles. Yes,its a fact. Teams like liverpool,arsenal,manutd EARNED them. And which is why chelsea's fans retort of saying manutd spends lots of money too is a lame and shortsighted "defence".<br></strong></div>

What he said is about protecting his players , they played their heart out for Mourinho , do you think Mourinho will say the better team won ?

(Schmichael, Keane,Solksjaer etc) He also trained and brought players from the youth team (Beckham, Neville,Giggs etc). And these players were the core of the team which were so successful.<br><br>Man Utd won trophies and entered the CL regularly. There was stadium expansion etc and all these helped mu to EARN</strong> lots of money which they used to buy more exe players (Rooney, Van Nistelrooy,Veron etc).<br><br>This is in complete contrast to the way chelsea became the richest football club in the world. In the 02/03 season, they were facing administration and were having huge debts. (ghimpeng, do u noe this fact??).<br><br>Then one fine day, 1 russian by the name of roman abramovic decided to make chelsea his new financial playtoy. An endless pot of money was poured into the club and chelsea became the richest club OVERNIGHT<strong><br>The quick cash was used to hire a good coach and buy good players. Success was quickly obtained.<br><br>This is why other pple will say chelsea BOUGHT their titles. Yes,its a fact. Teams like liverpool,arsenal,manutd EARNED them. And which is why chelsea's fans retort of saying manutd spends lots of money too is a lame and shortsighted "defence".<br></strong>[/b]</blockquote>agreed.. Liverpool won 18 championship.. man u won the most epl title.. ars is always ard when come to tiltle challenge.. they built everything through years n years of hard work..  (any1 rem blackburn? they oso sort of 'bought' their only epl title.. look where r they now..)<br><br>chelsea was champ once in their history b4 they 'strike rich' (everybody should noe y).. but credit to them, they managed to gel in such a short time and win the epl..<br><br>and to a certain extend i agree with him that liverpool r still not as good as them..(FYI i'm a liverpool fan) but pls lose with grace (attn:mourinho).. u must be such a sore loser to make comments like that esp when u got ur tatics wrong in the 1st place.. shame on u..<br><br>anyway the match is over! well done liverpool! i oso wanna congrats chelsea for they will cfm win the epl again..(sorry man u fans but i tink they will win it in front of ur faces this weekend)..<br><br>so lets all hope for a better season this coming july cos Liverpool, man n and ars will be there again to challenge the title!<br><br>but b4 that, world cup is coming!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
