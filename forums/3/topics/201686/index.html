            <div class='col-md body'>Look at big clubs like Manu and Arsenal<br><br>Manu got really big through use of their own produced players, During the time.. SAF had nothing to lose because he knew that whether he stayed or relegate Manu. He would be sacked<br><br>So he gambled on Beckham, Scholes and etc and they turned out to be superstars and thus he was in control<br><br>Now, As those big names are old and being replaced. It would be very dangerous to field a very young and unproven squad because there is a chance of not qualifying for the CL.<br><br>Furthurmore, With the money Chelsea is spending, Manu fans and other fans feel the need to win the EPL thus a season with a unproven squad may see them finish somewhere below Chelsea and a huge gap thus making fans unhappy.<br><br>I feel it's not that SAF don't give the youngsters chance to shine, It's Chelsea who are forcing the unproven players out of contention thus clubs have to spend big to match Chelsea.<br><br>Then, I feel that a limit on the number of foreigners (EUs alike) to be limited so that more English stars can shine like Beckham, Scholes, Gerrard, Owen and etc..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Man Utd got into their predicament because of two things:<br><br>1. they failed to dispose of Alex Ferguson (or at least, marginalise him to boardroom staff)<br><br>2. The shareholders allowed Glazer to buy out the club.<br><br>Chelski basically was a win-win situation: they were in debt and a Russian sugar daddy came calling...match-made in heaven.</div>
