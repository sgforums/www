            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea's 2-2 draw with Bolton at Stamford Bridge allowed Manchester United to increase their lead at the top of the Barclays Premiership to five points.<br><br>On an afternoon of twists and turns for United and Chelsea, Jose Mourinho's side now look destined to finish runners-up.<br><br>United fought back from two goals down to win 4-2 at Everton, but Chelsea allowed Kevin Davies to score a second-half equaliser to virtually kill off their bid for a third successive Premier League title.<br><br>Bolton went ahead in the 19th minute and although Chelsea hit back to lead by half-time, Davies stunned the home crowd with the all-important leveller in the 54th minute.<br><br>Mourinho had made six changes as he prepared for the Champions League semi-final return leg against Liverpool at Anfield on Tuesday night.<br><br>But after a bright opening, the biggest cheer was reserved for news of Everton's opening goal against United at Goodison Park.<br><br>However, the cheers were soon reduced to deathly hush as Bolton took a shock lead. Andranik Teymourian's free-kick caused panic in the Chelsea defence and when Chelsea failed to clear their lines, the ball fell to Lubomir Michalik to fire past Petr Cech.<br><br>But Chelsea's remarkable fighting spirit hauled them level just two minutes later when Salomon Kalou met a cross from Wayne Bridge and glanced the ball beyond the stranded Jussi Jaaskelainen.<br><br>Chelsea were rocked in the 29th minute, though, by the loss of defender Ricardo Carvalho. Carvalho, who shook off a hamstring injury in time to play against Liverpool in the Champions League last Wednesday, appeared to suffer a recurrence of the problem.<br><br>He was replaced by England midfielder Frank Lampard, with Michael Essien switching to the centre of defence alongside England captain John Terry.<br><br>Carvalho must now be a major doubt for the semi-final return against Liverpool, although Essien is capable of playing in his role.<br><br>Chelsea should have gone in front on the half-hour, but a stunning volley from Andriy Shevchenko was tipped over by Jaaskelainen and then Essien fired wide from Lampard's corner when the Bolton keeper completely missed the flagkick.<br><br>The home side were now in totally control and it was only a matter of time before the second goal arrived.<br><br>It came via the foot of goalkeeper Jaaskelainen in the 33rd minute. Kalou rose highest to meet Lampard's corner at the far post and when his header came down off the bar, it went into the net off Jaaskelainen.<br><br>Chelsea were incessant with their attacks, but Bolton still had enough guile in the final third to keep the home side alert.<br><br>A minute before the interval Bolton won a corner on the right, but Cech used his experience to meet the ball and punch clear.<br><br>Chelsea made a further change at the interval, with Didier Drogba replacing Andriy Shevchenko in attack.<br><br>In the 48th minute Kevin Davies was booked for a late challenge on Mikel John Obi and moments later Shaun Wright-Phillips sent a 20-yard shot flashing just wide of the Bolton goal.<br><br>But in the 54th minute Bolton were level through Davies, who headed home Tal's free-kick on the edge of the six-yard box with Cech stranded.<br><br>The shock goal was soon forgotten by the home fans, though, as they cheered loudly once more as news of Everton's second goal against Manchester United filtered through to them.<br><br>In the 57th minute Drogba almost restored Chelsea's lead, but his free-kick went inches over the crossbar.<br><br>The game had now reached a critical stage as far as Chelsea were concerned as they had to ensure they made the most of United's woes at Goodison.<br><br>Mourinho, always a man to be relied upon when it comes to making the most of his substitutions, sent on Joe Cole in place of Lassana Diarra on the hour.<br><br>It was designed to put more pressure on Bolton's withering defence and moments later he was involved in the build-up which led to a Drogba shot flashing across the face of the goal.<br><br>In the 64th minute Cole sent a 20-yard drive just wide of the right-hand upright as Chelsea exerted more pressure on the Bolton defence.<br><br>Chelsea poured forward in search of a winner, but Bolton's rearguard refused to buckle.<br><br>The home were left stunned by news of United's fightback and Chelsea's efforts to score the winner grew more frantic.<br><br>Drogba, Kalou and Cole all went close to scoring but, for once, Chelsea's remarkable fighting spirit deserted them and the title now looks certain to be heading to Old Trafford.</div>
