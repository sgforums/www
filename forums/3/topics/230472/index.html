There are professional and leagues in North America Europe Australia and there is even a league in Asia (PALS).<br><br>I play a tournament version of Paintball called Speedball which is played on a football field with air filled bunkers. Teams of 5 or 7 go head to head in 5 min games - alot of PB pellers and alot of agression, seed and firepower goes into a game of Speedball.<br><br>There are other types of games like woodsball/scenario which is played in the jungle and is more military styled. Many types of games of scenarios can be played- attack/defend a base/castle/capture your enemys flag etc.<br><br>Most guys get hooked by the thrill of combining shooting running and tactics in paintball and the team building with colleagues/friends. Paintball is popularly used as a method of team building by companies because you need team work and trust to win a game.<br><br>Currently there are no places to play speedball in Singapore and there is no proper competition/league. I only play in KL because of cost and facilities. It costs up to 5 times more to play in Singapore than in KL. To give you an example it costs as low as RM75 for 500 PB pellets plus marker (gun), mask and protection kit rental. I havent found anywhere to play PB in JB but there is rumours that there will be one place opening soon.<br><br>Anyone/any age/any gender can play paintball. There are ladies teams in Malaysia competing in the PALS Asian league with other ladies teams. The largest number of paintball players in the world are kids below the age of 18.<br><br>If you'd like to try playing paintball in KL please contact me via email - I'm looking for people to play with or to form a team for the MPOL league.<br><br>If you have any questions please feel free to post it in here to email me<br><br>Have a nice day.<br><br>ARTC<br><span class="large"></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah- like I said its expensive to play in Singapore especially when you play Speed ball. I carry about 3 pods (each pod has 140 PB pellets) in each game and can finish at least 1-2 pods in one game so thats about 300 pellets per game. The pros can carry up to 5-6-7 pods for a game!<br><br>1000 for 5 people means you get 200 pellets per person which is very limiting. I guess its ok for scenario or woodsball as you'd shoot "conservatively".</div>
