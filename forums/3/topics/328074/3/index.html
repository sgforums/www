              <p>i don't know whether china is strong or not, but it still got so many space to develope, actually now only beijing ,shanghai shenzhen are develope, other people from other city, are still lazy, but i think they are not stressed, they treat their offspring and parent good, if you could do that, i will say nothing, but in singapore, once i saw a mother slap his daughter with no mercy, actually for seven years i spend in singapore i saw  a lot odd thing, so i question myself, is it because the pressure is to high, make people mad, yes singaporean is hardworking, i admire that, besides that i don't know what's too say, nice people are so rare, all become working machine.</p>
              <p>One of my professor in singapore said, stress is a bless actually, it's bullshit. It's because singapore's elite policy, government think every people is elite, so continuous them ask them to do better, some people cannot endure that, got psychological problem, for them, i don't see any hope they can recovered, maybe i don't have a good time in singapore, so some of my word r a little bit distorted, but i question myself, more money,less happier, or more happier, less money, i think i will choose happier is my top concern, but you guys always think money is the top concern, forget u want to earn more money is trying to make ur life better.</p>
              <p>Singapore government only can look into GDP, seems that as long as GDP grow, everything is solved, actually in china it's not the case, historian, lawyer, philosopher, economics ppl, artist, come together to make a decision, so not everyone in china is hunting for money,  most of them rather live a happy life.</p>

              <p>I am being very smart by NEVER admiring China... Come on... Your so called history is history... China may be was once a great civilization, but now it's not anymore... And please have the balls to make history and make it YOUR own than try to get some recognition from what your ancestors did... And so far what I've seen from modern China is more pathetic than ever... As I've mentioned, you would eat your own kin to save profit, traffic your own women into slavery and prostituition... All I could say that your ancestors would be spitting on You and your so called nation right now...</p>

              <p>The reason that you could say I am stupid is because you have nothing more to say... So who's the really stupid one here? By nothing to say and calling others stupid... That's another CHINA's bad character...</p>
