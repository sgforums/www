              <p>I'm new here and just signed up coz i've been interested in singapore.. So u can guess now i'm not a singaporean. Yes, I'm another "chinaman".</p>
              <p>It really makes me sad that Li Jia Wei's marriage shows she is a typical modern china woman looking for a man not for love but for materials. Once the materialistic conditions are met, who the f**k cares how long they've known each other? This happens as something taken for granted especially to those women over 25. They call this philosophy "realism". It's very common in china nowadays that when a girl approaches near 26, she rushes to marry whatever man as long as he has a certain amount of money. If she still dreams about love, she'll be afraid that she's getting too old to wait for it. Then who can resist someone like Li Jia Wei's husband-to-be that is considered as a billionaire?</p>
              <p>I've had contacted quite a lot of china girls and disappointedly conclude that many of them can not love. They only want to be loved but don't want to give anything. True, they give their bodies, but an adult male can find that stuff in prostitutes as well. Believe me. In china sometimes it's much more economically profitable to find a whore than to have a wife, since whoever you choose you have to pay, and a whore is much less demanding than a spoiled heartless "princess". Surely, there are counterexamples.</p>
              <p>But of course, we should not point all our fingers to china women only. Scientists found that all the women around the world are born to love materials, even in the most developed countries. Now that you singaporeans are blaming china women, but in nature your girls are materialistic too. The difference is that singapore is a richer country than china so it's much easier for you to satisfy that easy desire so you start targeting more expensive things and don't have to look so hungry. What can chinamen do? Life in china is the least easy in the world, so sometimes people have to try all the methods. Tragedy.</p>
              <p>And what can I do? I don't like china either but it is my homecountry.</p>
              <p>I guess things can be much simpler if we ignore nationality. If you're strong enough, you don't really have to rely on the group behind you. You're just you as an individual.</p>

              <p>interesting, i tell you the way chinese living in china, is not changed, the enviorment changed, but not the people, chinese, still like the ancestor, 4 limbs, yes they are educated about science philosophy, a lot of them from west, but the filial family value is not changed, in china if you don't respect elder, and make self discipline, you will be viewed as odd, yes, modern chinese generation have been spoiled, because they are only child, singaporean compare to them, is more mature, but the X or Y generation can not represent chinese, even the  scholar from china in singapore  cannot fully represent chinese, there is a saying in chinese,äººä¼¦æ—¥ç”¨è€Œä¸�çŸ¥ï¼Œthe morality you practice everyday, but you may not fully know it, at least many number of chinese people at my age, is history fun, philosophy fun, name anything, there will be some expert in the area, even me i cannot represent china,</p>
              <p>besides ordinary chinese people embrace relationship, marriage, brotherhood, a lot, for chinese scholar, there is a rich heritage inherited from our ancestor, i can tell you there are hundreds of thousand of scripture, about chinese culture passed down, the india culture maybe written down in srikrit, mainly used among brahman in the social caste, but the language dissapear now, because culture break down, and invasion,</p>
              <p> chinese, now still can read the original scripture in ancient time, china's policty is not pracmatic, as chinese culture, middle way think, balance, the president Hu, revert to harmony again, this harmony policy have not been emphasize by his precedent, after 1949 till prior to president Hu period, china is completely westernized, even communism is west theory, but china will never just adhere to one policy unchanged, i believe, china will never abandon chines legacy, that's what make chinese like today, GDP is not china's first concern the first concern is the stability, and peacefull rise, just like chinese people, not all chasing-money animal, majority of chinese people are nice.</p>

              <p>The guy who is going to wear Susilo's old shoes is Mr Li Hou Lin, mid 30's, quite good looking and filthy rich. Never mind if he is a divorcee. Playing this guy's balls will be easier to get rich, than chasing after the damn tt ball.</p>
              <p>Best wishes to both of them. Hope it last.</p>
