Of course you retard, no scientific studies were done... The experiment itself is dangerous, no scientific committee would allow this study to be done... Maybe except China... Why don't you go and seek china health committee to do this study, I am sure they don't mind as long as you flourish them with money...</p>

              <p>Well, at least they know basic english... You ask them around for directions in Chinese, do you think they would know what crap you are talking about?</p>
              <p>Oh yea, living in the past... Who cares where we come from? You are just one of those ppl who wants to get recognition from what your ancestors did... You did nothing and yet you claim as if you did something big... Go and have some balls and be a man....</p>
              <p>I have my own unique culture and cultures change... Look at China itself imperialism changed to communism then to capitalism... Things change and yet you say as if it is still the same as 3000 years ago...</p>
              <p>Oh really? How come so many singapore, US, malaysian, indonesian and many more overseas Chinese despise the China Chinese ? And you would still say that they are proud...</p>
              <p>Of course I can't ignore China... They products are dangerous, just beware when I want to buy stuff, and see it is made in China, i make sure that I don't touch them... You don't know where this Cheena stuff came from and so many are dangerous, even the food... And with such lack of morals you want to claim that oversease chinese are proud of China?</p>

              <p>I'm new here and just signed up coz i've been interested in singapore.. So u can guess now i'm not a singaporean. Yes, I'm another "chinaman".</p>
              <p>It really makes me sad that Li Jia Wei's marriage shows she is a typical modern china woman looking for a man not for love but for materials. Once the materialistic conditions are met, who the f**k cares how long they've known each other? This happens as something taken for granted especially to those women over 25. They call this philosophy "realism". It's very common in china nowadays that when a girl approaches near 26, she rushes to marry whatever man as long as he has a certain amount of money. If she still dreams about love, she'll be afraid that she's getting too old to wait for it. Then who can resist someone like Li Jia Wei's husband-to-be that is considered as a billionaire?</p>
              <p>I've had contacted quite a lot of china girls and disappointedly conclude that many of them can not love. They only want to be loved but don't want to give anything. True, they give their bodies, but an adult male can find that stuff in prostitutes as well. Believe me. In china sometimes it's much more economically profitable to find a whore than to have a wife, since whoever you choose you have to pay, and a whore is much less demanding than a spoiled heartless "princess". Surely, there are counterexamples.</p>
              <p>But of course, we should not point all our fingers to china women only. Scientists found that all the women around the world are born to love materials, even in the most developed countries. Now that you singaporeans are blaming china women, but in nature your girls are materialistic too. The difference is that singapore is a richer country than china so it's much easier for you to satisfy that easy desire so you start targeting more expensive things and don't have to look so hungry. What can chinamen do? Life in china is the least easy in the world, so sometimes people have to try all the methods. Tragedy.</p>
              <p>And what can I do? I don't like china either but it is my homecountry.</p>
              <p>I guess things can be much simpler if we ignore nationality. If you're strong enough, you don't really have to rely on the group behind you. You're just you as an individual.</p>
