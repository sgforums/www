I donÂ’t think I would still be in a job.Â”<br><br>But Benitez, who led Liverpool to Euro glory in 2005 and the FA Cup 12 months ago, pointed to the cash Roman Abramovich splashed to help Chelsea win back- to-back Premierships and two Carling Cups.<br><br>The Anfield boss said: Â“It depends on the money you spend and so you can decide the value of each point Chelsea have more than Liverpool.<br><br>Â“Chelsea have good players but if you spend big money you get a good team which should always be competing to be in the finals.Â”<br><br>Mourinho also claimed Liverpool have had an easy ride to tonightÂ’s semi-final while his side is still fighting for four trophies.<br><br>But Benitez insisted: Â“I donÂ’t like to the play the game that Mourinho does.<br><br>Â“He says we have more fresh legs but we want to be in the final the same as Chelsea.<br><br>Â“Mourinho is a great coach. But the key to this tie is not him or me.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s about Steven Gerrard or Frank Lampard so I will not play these games.Â”<br><br>Mourinho will be without injured Michael Ballack but Joe Cole is set to replace the German in midfield.<br><br>Liverpool dumped Chelsea in the semis before their final victory over AC Milan two years ago.<br><br>Blues have been desperate for revenge ever since Â— but Benitez insists he can sense the same feeling in his squad as he did before that 2005 triumph.<br><br>The Spaniard warned: Â“We are better than two years ago.<br><br>Â“Maybe they are as well but we have more experience now and I think we can do it.<br><br>Â“Two years ago I could sense the players were ready to win it, even though people didnÂ’t believe it was possible. And I have the same feeling again.Â”<br><br>Liverpool, who also knocked out Chelsea in the FA Cup semis last season, have not scored in five games at Stamford Bridge with Benitez in charge.<br><br>But Benitez insisted: Â“We lost 1-0 there in September Â— but, yes, it was still a good game for us.Â”<br><br><strong>These two guys seriously don't like each other, man..</strong></div>

Now we have to win but we've got the advantage of playing at home.<br><br>'We will have to play like United did against us. We will have to show we've got great personality and enormous energy because we face a real battle.'<br><br>Milan defender Massimo Oddo rued his side's failure to convert a couple of chances early in the second half.<br><br>'We were stupid. We played a great first half and their second goal was fine but then we missed several opportunities to make it 3-1,' he said.<br><br>Milan may be without two important players in the return leg.<br><br>A recurrence of an old knee injury forced captain Paolo Maldini to sit out the second half at United while midfielder Gennaro Gattuso limped off in the 53rd minute with a sore foot.<br><br>'The knee swelled up and the pain became unbearable. It will be difficult to recover for the return leg,' said Maldini.<br><br>'It will be a difficult match for Milan. We didn't deserve to lose at Old Trafford but the English side put in a fantastic performance. They fought right to the limit and showed great self-belief. We will have to follow their example.' </span></div>
