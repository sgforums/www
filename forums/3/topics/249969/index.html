Serginho wouldn't be right and neither would Marek Jankulowski be ideal, while Kakha Kaladze lacks speed. I spoke about this with Ferguson and we are of the same opinion.<br><br>"If (Paolo) Maldini has recovered his speed, he is the best solution."<br><br>As for the final, should Liverpool beat Chelsea, Benitez would prefer to play Milan.<br><br>He said: "Against Milan there will be more emotion. If we're in the final against Milan again, fine - it's perfect."<br><br>As for the Liverpool-Chelsea semi-final, there is a genuine personal dislike between Benitez and Mourinho, and the Liverpool boss admitted it is unlikely he will share a drink with his Chelsea counterpart as he did with Ferguson during the FA Youth Cup final between Liverpool and Manchester United at Anfield on Monday.<br><br>Benitez said: "You cannot have a good relationship. When we see each other at matches, you are trying to win and he is trying to win. It is not easy." </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">too bad Benitez your tips for valencia to stop chelsea  did not really help afterall maybe u can show valencia how to stop chelsea or get destoryed by chelsea just like valencia sorrow ending</span></div>

We have done that both against Barcelona and PSV Eindhoven in the previous knockout rounds.<br><br>"But we do not under-estimate Chelsea. They are a very, very good side and have proved that by winning the title in the last two seasons.<br><br>"We are a better team than two years ago, maybe they are too, but for us we have more experience and we think we can do it again."</span></div>
