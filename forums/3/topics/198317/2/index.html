I remembered Fowler was commended for waving penalty appeals in a match against Arsenal.  The ref still gave a penalty despite protestations from both Seaman and Fowler. Fowler subsequently missed that penalty and McAteer scored the rebound.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whatever it is, the candidate he back Juan Miguel Villar Mir did not win the Real election even after using his name... Instead another guy Ramon Calderon looks likely to be named Real Madrid's new president and he has vowed to sign Chelsea winger Arjen Robben and Milan's Brazilian playmaker Kaka - a declaration which has angered the Italian giants... he has also promised to appoint Juventus boss Fabio Capello as the club's new coach.<br><br>Anyway, Real Madrid has become a dumping centre for players? First Beck when Ferguson didn't want him anymore now Small Ron? Small B'cos Madrid already got a Big Ron there...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Where as in chelsea's case, they had witness that A cole had met up with Peter Kenyon &amp; Mourinho to discuss a transfer to chelsea.<br><br>If you compare both cases its a lot of difference, in the Real M case it is seen as the candidates are talking fantasy football and these candidates righ now are only normal members like any fan... they are not even on the board of directors so in a way they don't even represent RM so no case to charge them, they can be seen as ordinary fan saying who they want until they are elected. By then maybe they will keep quiet or they can be charge by Fifa. And Chelsea... well, they had the intent... Kenyon &amp; Mourinho are official representatives of Chelsea.</div>
