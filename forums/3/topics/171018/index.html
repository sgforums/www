            <div class='col-md body'>I feel sad for him.<br><br>When the club not doing very good, he left the club, and joins a super club: Real Madrid. But most of the time when he was with Real, he spent his time on the bench. Even can score quite a few goals, but he is just under utilized.<br><br>While he has a bad season with Real, his formal club won the Champions League after so many years. His old friends and colleagues (e.g. Steven Gerard, Carra and etc) are enjoying their success with the club, he can only squeeze his balls in front of the TV at home.<br><br>Then he want to leave Real, but the club asking for 17m... when Liverpool sold him, he only worth 6m (Nunez is crap, he worth 0 cent, thatÂ’s the price Liverpool sold him: Free), how to you expect Liverpool to pay 17m?<br><br>Then he joins Newcastle, I don't think he is happy, or willingly join them, as there is no choice for him at that short period of time.<br><br>He is still very good, but I think his current manager do not make good use out of him... pity him.<br><br>Liverpool fans may hope that Newcastle relegated this season, then Liverpool buy him back with 6m, or maybe 4m? 3m? 2m? 1m?<br><br>I pity him, leaving Liverpool is a bad decision, perhaps thatÂ’s the biggest mistake of his life.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HafizulKMS:</div><div class="quote_body">Rafa made mistake too. 6.3m for Morientes (old + inefficient), and 7m for Croch. Wasted so much money.<br><br>Rafa brought lots of quality midfielders, like Sissoko, Alonso, Zenden, Garcia, and etc. But for strikers and defenders, he almost brought all craps. Now Liverpool is flooded with talented midfielders, Steven Gerald, Stephen Warnock, Hamann, and etc.<br><br>Oh yeah, Cisse is not cheap too, 14m.<br></div></blockquote>Morientes was signed for a reason, because of the lack of firepower up front last season, with Cisse out injured, and besides, Morientes was the top scorer in Champion League soccer with Monaco the season before last. Rafa knows that Morientes can be depended upon, and also, to help spearhead his European campaign for this season. I don't think Rafa have expected his team to win the Champs League in his first season, and he signing Morientes was to help bring experience to the squad.<br><br>And Peter Crouch a joke? He is not a striker in the Owen or Shearer or Henry mode. He does much more than that. He contributes to the team play. Often, his knock-downs help provide the goals, and his height often help in getting to crosses. He is now also starting to score goals. Rafa continues to field him because Crouch is a team player.<br><br>And Cisse is actually quite a good player too, at Auxerre as well as at Liverpool. Despite his limited field time, i believed he has scored quite regularly too. Liverpool's strike-force is not a joke, but rather, a bit too lightweight. Besides these 3 strikers, who else do they have? Florent Sinama-Pogelle is not the finished article yet. Le-Tellec is not doing that well too at Sunderland on loan. Liverpool needs another striker, like Dirk Kuryt.</div>
