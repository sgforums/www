Granted the team now is different, but they seem beatable. Just my opinion.<br><br>Bahrain. We lost 2-1 to them at National Stadium in 2001, but I would really fancy facing them again.<br><br>Australia. They are the strongest team and will take points off everybody else (but hopefully not us) and leave the 2nd qualifying place wide open.<br>But here, any team from Pot A will do, but hopefully not Japan, because Japanese fans will outnumber Singapore fans in Jalan Besar (argh... but the plus point is having many cute Japanese girls to watch).</div>

Let's face it, we have improved since Radojko Avramovic took over in 2003. We may still lose to the traditional powerhouse, but there's more hunger and passion by these men when they played. I think we don't mind our boys losing, as long as they did it playing 100%. Reaching this stage, something we have never done before, is already a miracle.<br><br>If u want to support only winning teams, there's always the table-tennis team u know.</div>
