              <p>Wigan chairman Dave Whelan has claimed some referees "seem to be afraid of applying the law to Manchester United" after <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/21046/Wayne-Rooney">Wayne Rooney</a> escaped a ban for his elbow on <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/137100/James-McCarthy">James McCarthy</a>.</p>
              <div class="mod-inline image image-right">
              <div style="margin-left: 10px; width: 275px;"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2011/0228/waynerooney20110226_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Wayne Rooney" width="275" height="155"></div>
              </div>
              <p>Referee Mark Clattenburg awarded a free-kick to Wigan following the incident, which Wigan boss <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=105">Roberto Martinez</a> felt "quite clearly" warranted a red card.</p>
              <p>Although
               Clattenburg would have had to have admitted he did not see the 
              incident, many had expected that Rooney would be punished 
              retrospectively, and the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> reports that United 
              "were so resigned to Wayne Rooney being charged ... they had explored 
              possible loopholes to spare the 25 year-old from a ban".</p>
              <p>Whelan, whose side were <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=293107&amp;cc=5739">beaten 4-0 at the DW Stadium</a>, said he felt Rooney's escape was unjustifiable.</p>
              <p>"I cannot understand how the FA can say there will be no further action," he told the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>.
               "Manchester United is a great club and Fergie is just simply the best 
              manager, but it is the referees who seem to be afraid of applying the 
              law to United and I don't know why.</p>
              <p>"Man United get treated a 
              little bit differently to the rest of the football clubs. I wish they 
              would treat Wigan like that. I wish we could get away with certain 
              things that Man United get away with.</p>
              <p>"Mark Clattenburg is 
              usually a very good referee. I could not believe that he [Rooney] was 
              not sent off. Had it been one of our players, he would have walked.</p>
              <p>"Rooney
               was only ten yards from the referee and it was a deliberate elbow. It 
              was the swipe of an elbow right across the head and a clear sending-off 
              offence."</p>
              <p>He added in <em>The Sun</em>: "Something is wrong when a 
              top international like Rooney is seen doing something like this, as 
              clear as day, and is allowed to get away without being punished.</p>
              <p>"If
               it was any other club or player, you can bet your life he would have 
              been sent off, but officials seem intimidated by the words 'Rooney' and 
              'United'. Manchester United are allowed to get away with things the rest
               of us get pulled up for, and you can't have one set of rules for one 
              club and another for the rest.</p>
              <p>"I don't care what the FA say 
              about the matter being dealt with at the time by us getting a free-kick.
               They, and everyone else in football, know justice isn't being served 
              here.</p>
              <p>"The FA will be delighted they can hide behind their rules 
              and let Rooney off, as they are frightened of taking sanctions against 
              him and his club."</p>
              <p>In the wake of the news that Rooney had 
              escaped a ban on Monday, Professional Game Match Officials general 
              manager Mike Riley defended Clattenburg.</p>
              <p>"Mark took the correct 
              course of action with this incident," he said. "Match officials are 
              trained to prioritise following the ball, as that's where the greater 
              majority of incidents are going to take place. However, we also do a lot
               of work around the area of peripheral vision to be aware of anything 
              that might potentially happen off the ball.</p>
              <p>"In this incident Mark
               was following play but caught sight of two players coming together and 
              he awarded a free-kick because he believed one player had impeded the 
              other.</p>
              <p>"We should be clear that Mark did nothing wrong in officiating this incident as he acted on what he saw on the pitch.''</p>
