            <div class='col-md body'>I find that my run typically there are three stages:<br><br>stage 1: initally will be a bit lethagic and seems difficult to run at a measured pace. Also might have some minor aches here and there on knees. ankles shins...etc etc... beathing also not too regular<br><br>stage 2 : after 30 mins or so... body is warmed up. sweat start coming out fast. pace is more controlled. somehow pain is gone. Also tendency to run faster and felt that I can run forever. beathing is very very smooth and natural without any effort. must always tell myself not to run too fast.<br><br>Stage 3 : typically for me after about 3 hrs of running. use to be about 2 hrs of running before the SBR.<br>Will feel suddenly very very tired... not the isolated leg muscule aching tired where I run too fast or when I run uphill but "overall body" felt tired. I will try to take walking break. but somehow no matter how much I "rested" with the walking breaks, I cannot continue running... just cannot. that is my definition of "hitting the wall".<br><br>I took powergel when I felt that I have another hour to go. This is to try to simulate the 30km powergel intake on the actual day. so far I don't really find it very useful for me. there is an initial 'boost" but after 20-30mins the effect will wear out.  But I guess if I can reach the 30km mark another 20-30 mins boost will be welcome and take me closer to the finishing line.<br><br></div>
