Just plain pasta without any sauce. I find that it although it is can make me feel a bit full when I started running it will keep me from going hungry after a long time... I am a slow runner so for Full M will probably take about 5 hours. That means that at 11am I will probably still be running. So really need to eat something.<br><br>I have been eating this before my runs and also before other races so not a problem. I wouldn't recommend people to try for the first time during the Stand chart marathon as pasta can really be very filling!<br><br></div>

For me, after the first 20km, i plan to walk 1 minute to the drink stations too.<br>Marathon all about economy of movements and i will conserve as much energy as i cud and try to finsh strong at the 30km mark. The last 10km will be HARD. When i get tired, I intend to look into the crowds eyes and maybe especially the cheerleaders to stay motivated and get as much energy as i cud from them.<br><br>I'm not briging my own water, just some energy bar and power gels. I will drink at every drink stations.<br><br>Dam, i got weakened and went to the gym last nite and ran 10km on the threadmill. Hardly broke a sweat but maybe a mistake but am now resting my legs for the big day. I will collect my race pack on Saturday.<br><br>I'm scared of starting too fast so i'll start in Pen4 with the sub 5hr crowds like Mr.no_speeding. anyway, in case this is my last post before the race, Good luck guys!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Last year although i am running the mini-marathon, I started right in front. I cut in through the metal barriers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> . I find that it is much more easy to run as "everyone" is running and there is no-one is walking and I mean walking and not even a slow jog.<br><br>I will either stand in Pen 3 or 4 depending on the situation. The last thing I want to do is to be stuck behind some aunties that is going for a morning stroll...... I have a feeling most people will stand right in front even those who are very slow!!! ... so Pen 4 might be a bad idea. I don't know how this will Pen thing will work as we don't submit any qualifying times and there is no way they can verify our expected finished time.<br><br>And also since timing is not too important, I think I have to take it easy until the crowd thin out.... and not get too frustrated.<br><br>Oh yeah... one thing that I am telling myself is that I will keep running even though I am the only runner who is still running....... it is usually more easy to run when there are a lot of people running together, I suspect that in the later part of the full M, there will be very few runners left and we will all be dispersed, so I might become disheartened.........<br><br>I am also a bit ill. my nose is sensitive and blocked and I keep sneezing.... so need to rest more before the race.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>run spencer ... run.<br><br>My slight fever/cold getting better i think, have been taking vit.C tablets and plenty of water since last week. Hopefully, i will be fully fit sunday, so no excuses.<br><br>Pen3 or Pen4? Hmm, I definitely don't want to start wayyyy at the back too as i think i've put in some good training and long runnigg sessions and i know i can run at least for the first  20km ok. My main problem probaly my lack of mental toughness. This being my 1st maratohn, and i never cover this distance before, etc.<br><br>Ok, I'll start the the back of Pen3.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I will definitely run.....<br><br>I am bring a bottle of water to the start point. Drink before the run and then discard.<br><br>When I run, not bringing anything..... I have a small wrist pouch then can fit one powergel. so I am thinking of bringing that along also. but most probably will not bring along but will just consume the powergel at the 30km mark.<br><br>I couldn't find my digital watch for the past 2 weeks. didn't have time to buy a new one. so I am running watchless.... could be a good thing as during the SBR 1/2M, I was too distracted by my timing and speed.<br><br>If you see one guy running and asking for the time... that is ME! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
