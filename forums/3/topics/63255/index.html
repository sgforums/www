            <div class='col-md body'>As for midfield. (442) the most stable formation at the present games will most likely include:<br><br>(left winger)     (defensive MId )      (Attacking Mid)        (Winger)<br>Giggs                 Keane                    Scholes                 Ronaldo<br><br>A solid department for the anchor role in Keane (Who else need to knit the team and cover the back 4, Though simple in passing however a definite ball winner and seldom lose poccession)<br><br>Giggs-solid in attacking and back tracking oozes in flair and experience<br><br>Scholes in the attacking depatment cos no body does it better in Man U (not to mention arould the world though there are the likes of Zidene and Xabi). hard to track his run in therefore able to score vital goals, A closer mould to him will be that of Frank Lampard minus the good distribution (No offense to Chelsea)<br><br>Ronaldo -wizardly foot work and pace. However too inmature and physical to back track attackers. Need to brush up on positioning. However a tremendous talent to be reckon with needs time to mature.<br><br>Man U should buy a good <span style="color: red;">attk mid </span>and <span style="color: red;">left winger </span>to shoulder Giggs and Scholes. Keane has ample department in Djemba(Very good in time to come) and Kleberson. As for <span style="color: red;">right winger </span>Man U can do with Bellion and Ronaldo or throw in a couple of make do players coz I tink that spending in the right Winger department will further incur the cost of buying additional players with Ronaldo and Bellion round.<br><br><span style="color: #444444;">Therefore to conclude all man U really needs<br>[color=red]Saviola</span> for his pace and trickery to open up defence and to partner with RVN [/color]<br><br>An all <span style="color: red;">round Mid </span>in the form of Real Sociedad <span style="color: red;">Xavi</span> or one such as <span style="color: #444444;">[color=red]Pavel Neved</span>[/color]<br><br>A good <span style="color: red;">forward left back </span>such as <span style="color: red;">[color=red]Wanye Bridge </span>or Probably Paul Konchelsky (He adept tat left back as well)<br><br><span style="color: red;">Right back</span> goes to Stephen Carr for his intusive running and good crosses</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U dun expect a season without losses do u, unless u team is really tt gd. And losing to chelsea is nothing shameful, cuz its consistency tt counts. Maybe u shd see the faces of true "blue" fans when they lost to Bolton. Anyway like i said, its consistency tt counts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>United still need David Beckham and Juan Veron in their midfield. Nobody can replace them. Ryan Giggs is getting older, maybe United should try signing Valencia's Vicente as years goes by. As for Keane, United stillhave someone like Kleberson &amp; Phil Neville as future cover. Scholes can still play for a long time. As for<br>strikers, I think United should try their best to sign either Saha from Fulham or Kezman from PSV to partner Van Nistelrooy or Forlan or Solskjaer. For defenders, they should sign another centre-back as cover for Rio.Southgate can never do that job well. Maybe Chelsea John Terry can. Or try signing previous target PSV Kevin Hofland. Goalkeeper Tim Howard is a no problem at Man U.<br><br>Keeper - Tim Howard<br>Right - Gary Neville<br>Centre - John Terry/Kevin Hofland<br>Centre - Wes Brown(Regaining fitness)<br>Left - Mikael Silvestre<br>RightMid - David Beckham<br>CentreMid - Roy Keane or Kleberson/Phil Neville<br>CentreMid - Paul Scholes/Juan Veron<br>LeftWing - Ryan Giggs/Vicente<br>Forward - Ruud Van Nistelrooy/Diego Forlan<br>Forward - Louis Saha/Kezman<br><br>Ole Solskjaer can play either left right flank or striker.<br><br>This imaginary Man U team can sure conquer Europe!
