              <p><strong>Game started wif a lot of fanfare abt whether Terry will shake hands wif Wayne. Well we found out the ans to that...</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Meanwhile the game went on wif Man City players fouling hard on Chelsea players but received no cards. In fact the only yellow card for City came when Zabaleta was caught two-foot tackle <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for the second time!</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>But Chelsea received the wrath of the Refs for even the slightest touch on any City players. Beletti &amp; later Ballack got Red cards after picking up a couple of "touch" fouls.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea fell wif 9 men playing despite picking a consolation goal through Lampard &amp; The Blues lost a first  home game this season!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>It was noted that Manchester United Chairman David Gill was in the Grandstand gesturing to some "unknown" ppl. </strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #33cccc;">SO MAN CITY DID NOT WIN THE MATCH. ManU did!!!</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So it's ManU-re ppl behind this defeat!!! I always knew they needed to cheat, just to catch up wif The Blues. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>That is also why i stopped being a ManU fan.  ALWAYS CHEATING!!!</strong></span></em></span></p>

              <p>Yup, farking KELONG!</p>
              <p>Anyway, MU head(chairman?) was really spotted at half-time quite close to Capello.</p>

                                          sure he wasn't there to see the Terry/Bridge

              <p>Was ManU head really in Chelsea stands? Didn't notice.</p>
              <p>But now that you mention it, Mike Dean or whoever the official was probably needs specs!!!!</p>
              <p>Probably in the starting of the second half when drogba fell tothe 
              ground by a "FAIR CHALLENGE" by Lescott , he might have thought they were
               brothers having an "embrace".   So is the challenges on Kalou, Anelka, Lamps etc....</p>
              <p>Also probably belleti had just brought 
              barry down by probably getting on him .And proably like at the CITY OF 
              MANCHESTER STADIUM the TRUE Blues were beaten .<br> I hope that the officials do get some money for their work so that in 
              near future they can buy specs or even lenses to see what is going on in
               the footballing field..........................</p>

              <p>i dont understand why belleti was given straight red. it was a soft challenge. penalty and yellow card is good enough i thought.</p>
              <p>i think chelsea should have played more aggressive at start. plus their strikers were all off form today. and hilario is greatly disappointing. maybe now ancelotti knows how fergueson felt when only had foster as MU GK.</p>
              <p>if it was cech, first two goals cld have been easily avoided, although the first was chiefly mikel's fault, which led to the 2nd since chelsea were chasing the win.</p>

              <p>According to match statistics, Chelsea committed so much more fouls than Man City. Ref can't be that kelong rite?</p>

              <p>Anyway, basically, it seems that the game is decided between the keepers: Hilario vs Shay Given.</p>

              <p>Just after the Aston villa vs Man utd league cup final match,
              <br> <br> Villa's keeper Brad Friedel's comment:
              <br> Friedel said: "We started the game really well but we have seen the 
              penalty incident now and it really should have been a sending-off.
              <br> "You feel really hard done by after you have viewed it afterwards 
              because you would have liked to be playing against 10 men.
              <br> "We feel a bit hard done by that we didn't play with a man advantage 
              after that, especially on a pitch as heavy as that and cutting up like 
              that.
              <br> "With 10 men, they would have really tired towards the end but it wasn't
               to be."
              <br> <br> Villa defender Carlos Cuellar echoed Friedel's sentiments and said: "For
               me it is a penalty and a sending-off. I think everyone says the same.
              <br> <strong><span style="color: red;">"You saw the sending-off of (Juliano) Belletti
               of Chelsea for something similar on Saturday. I think this was even 
              more clear.
              <br> "But different referees make different decisions and you never know what
               would have happened had we had the extra man." </span></strong> <br> <br> <em><strong>If there is fair play then we will be don't know how many points will be taken away 
              from man utd.
              <br> Obviously there is a different standard of treatment between chelsea and
               man utd.
              <br> A difference of 1 point might made either chelsea or man utd the 
              champion this season.
              <br> Base on the treatment we got from the happy trigger ref!</strong></em></p>
