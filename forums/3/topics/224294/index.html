            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Juventus veteran Nedved threatens to quit<br>tribalfooball.com - December 07, 2006<br><br>Juventus veteran Pavel Nedved has threatened to quit the game after he was slapped with a five-match ban for his dismissal against Genoa.<br>Nedved was handed the shock suspension after being adjudged to have intentionally stepped on the foot of the referee after his red card.<br><br>"Zinedine Zidane was suspended for three matches for a head-butt, what did I do to get five?," agent Mino Raiola said he was informed by Nedved.<br><br>"If this is the way they intend to manage things, I might as well retire from football," added the player, who was asked by Juve to avoid releasing any statements on the issue as the Bianconeri are appealing.<br><br>"Pavel told me that he cannot agree with the decision and that [referee] Farina is a liar, he never offended him and he did not stamp on him voluntarily," explained Raiola to La Gazzetta dello Sport.<br><br>"Many clubs have complained about this referee, including Chelsea, Barcelona, Inter and Milan.<br><br>"Pavel is convinced that the team is paying for what happened during the summer, but that was not the players' fault," added the representative.<br><br>"If this is how things will continue, they should have killed the club or given them a 40-point deduction.<br><br>"Pavel also wants Juve to know that he does not agree with their attitude. The club must react and demand respect.<br><br>"If this does not change he is ready to consider quitting. Punishments must be proportional to blame, in this case there is no proportion.<br><br>"I am thinking of appealing to the European Court of Human Rights. A five-match ban means that Nedved will not be able to play for a month and a half and you cannot deny a citizen the right to work for such a long time.<br><br>"They might as well rescind his contract"</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Ref stands by Nedved report<br>tribalfooball.com - December 07, 2006<br><br>Ref Stefano Farina stands by claims Juventus midfielder Pavel Nedved trod on his foot after he was sent-off against Genoa.<br><br>Nedved was slapped with a five-match ban based the Farina's report and the ref said yesterday: "I will not take it back because I confirm everything I said.<br><br>"I repeat what I wrote in my report. I only pointed out faithfully what happened on the field of play."<br><br>The midfielder was originally dismissed for stamping Francesco Bega's ankle.<br><br>"Nedved's challenge was a dangerous one and intentional," Bega told Odeon TV. "I don't understand why he won't admit it. He would've helped himself and everyone else if he had come forward. Everyone can make mistakes, but the important thing is to own up to them and learn." </span></div>
