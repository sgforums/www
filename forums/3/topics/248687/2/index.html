Btw i dun have any preference to serie a like wat u mention ...my money's jus on ac milan to win champions league...its that simple...</div></blockquote>demand and supply factor plus alots of marketing will see which league gets more coverage in the media, media also needs to make money hence they'll only sell news that are sales worthy, as for Sleague they had already did quite a fair bit for them, all local newspaper like Straits Times, Today and New Paper does carries at least 1/2 - 1 page of Sleague news everyday, don't try comparing coverage of EPL to Sleague, read my 1st sentences if you want to compare and add in the nos. of teams betweeen the 2 leagues and decide for yourself which will have more things to write about.<br><br>p.s. just in case you'll question if i know where i was being brought up from, i do give me share of support to them in going to some of games played in my town</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>italian league is boring<br>very tactical &amp; slow pace, more about team tatics rather then individual. their main idea is to hold the ball(possession) den slowly try to create chance. even when they cross, u can see 2 of their guys waiting to head the ball. they dont give away possession easily.<br>ever since serie A is proven to be kelong league, den i dont bother to see anymore not to mention bet<br><br>spanish league is more technical, indvidual flair/skills. they got lots of space to do flashy stuff like sissors over ball without defender fussing over them. the referee beep at the slightest foul whereas english referee will wave play on. their mentality is to play beautiful soccer and lose 3-1 rather then to defend,  play like crap n win 1-0.<br><br>english league is no tactic &amp; technics. playing like bull, chiong n chiong. fast passes, quick runs hoping to catch defenders off guard. only have a few seconds with the ball b4 defenders chop u down. b4 the influx of foreign managers, english teams play like wimbledon and old arsenal, defence get the ball then high ball to striker(skip the midfield)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me personally,  i used to share the same sentiments as the thread starter. Why is the popularity of Serie A and La Liga lagging so much behind the EPL? I remembered some of my friends during school days didn't even know who is 'Francesco Totti' or 'Luis Figo' during the earlier days of their club careers.<br>I think some of the forumers have brought up some very good points why this is happening. 1stly, english league games were broadcasted before the SCV era, whereas others were not (correct me if im wrong). 2nd, pace of the english game is faster and hence more exciting. 3rd, the standard of commentary and sound level of stadium crowd for EPL games is undeniably far superior than games of the other leagues. Here are some of my feedback for each league, after watching soccer since 1990.<br><br>1. English league<br>Some people said that the english game is all about 'cheonging' and 'pumping long balls' with little techniques, but i beg to differ. The standard of english football has risen significantly over the past 5 years or so, as reflected in the vast improvement of the results of english clubs in european football, a far cry from the early 90s when teams like man united have to struggle to get past teams like Galatasarray or Steau bucharest in early rounds of the european cup.  Nowadays, the big english teams know how to adapt to the European game.  They play more tactically in european matches compared to the domestic games. They are also more technically sound, but unfortunately this applies only to the top 4 teams (the rest of the league are lagging too far behind, with only perhaps Tottenham and newcastle having the best resources to close the gap with the top 4), which is why nowadays i only watch games that involves the top 4 teams. Would definitely choose to skip a Everton v Charlton game unless i have nothing better to do.<br><br>2. Italian serie A<br>I have to admit this, watching serie A matches really puts me to sleep. This happened like, around 5-6 years ago, ever since which i hardly watched an italian game. I used to support some italian teams in the past, but seems like the attraction of italian football to me has vanished, even before the this season which several teams were docked points and relegated due to corruption. Gone were the good old days of the 'seven sisters' dominating the rest of the league in the country.<br>Parma? - waiting to be relegated to serie B<br>Juve? - In serie B (although i await their majestic return to serie A dominance next season)<br>Milan? - Pretty much consistent, but lost the dominance it used to have in the mid 90s<br>Fiorentina? - Got kicked into the cellar league of italian football, changed the club name, then spent millions of get the name back, now back at serie A, but a top 8 team at best<br>Inter - Used to carry the tag as one of the most underachieving giants in european football, but has proven critics wrong this season (i still cant believe that they are leading the 2nd placed team by 20points); A dramatic transformation of fortune; Can Mancini maintain the domestic dominance next season? Or will things start to fall apart again once their nemesis Juve gets back?<br>Roma - Has maintained the status of a 'top 7 team' in italian football over the years<br>Lazio - Close to bankruptcy few years ago; Has since bounced back after selling most of their valuable assets, and i do not know most of their players now. Look forward to see them in champions league action next season<br><br>3. Spanish La Liga<br>The most entertaining league in europe. Too bad the commentary sucks big time. They should have just pay an englishman to do the job.<br>Anyway, that aside, Barcelona should retain the league title this year, despite having a less than convincing season. Real is still a sinking ship after Makelele and Vincente Del Bosque left the club, and has won nothing for the past 3 years. Valencia has regained some of their dominance, but still unable to achieve the level of consistency during the Rafa benitez era. As for Sevilla, i think they would spring a few surprises in next season's champions league.<br><br>4. Rest of europe<br>Hardly bothered to keep track of the matches and results. Is Lyon still leaps and bounds ahead of the rest in the french league?<br><br>5.  Local football<br>Lost its flavour since the malaysia cup days ended in '94. 'nuff said.<br></div>
