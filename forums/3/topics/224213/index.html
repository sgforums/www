            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">tribalfooball.com - December 07, 2006<br><br>Manchester City chairman John Wardle would stand aside should negotiations over a Â£75million takeover reach a positive conclusion.<br><br>Wardle revealed talks with an unnamed party, which could lead to a significant investment in the Eastlands outfit, are at "an early stage".<br><br>After spending the best part of two years scouring the globe for additional funds, it is welcome news for chief executive Alistair Mackintosh, who has come under fire by some sections of the City support for failing to secure a much-needed cash injection.<br><br>And, although Wardle's association with the Blues has lasted a lifetime, the 62-year-old would be happy to relinquish control if it meant a brighter future for the club.<br><br>"Hopefully, something comes of these talks because I would be prepared to pass the baton on if it allowed the club to get back into the honours," he said. "The board are aware that we need further investment to maintain our challenge in an increasingly competitive and high-finance Premier League.<br><br>"With the new TV deal commencing next season, we are all conscious of the importance of the current campaign. We would welcome the arrival of anyone who could take the club forward with open arms."<br><br>Wardle announced the news to City's annual general meeting on Thursday morning.<br><br>Although talks with numerous parties have taken place over the last few months, none offered the potential for the kind of significant investment seen recently at Aston Villa and West Ham, clubs of similar size to City.<br><br>"A lot of opportunities have been brought to the table, every one of which has been treated on a confidential basis," revealed Mackintosh.<br><br>"But today we felt, as we were sitting in front of our shareholders, it was important to give them an accurate and up-to-date picture of the situation." </span></div>

It will happen when it happens.'<br><br>Belgravia have been in talks with the club's major shareholders for months, in an effort to pave the way for a complete takeover.<br><br>Former chairman Sir John Hall and his son Douglas control hold more than 40% of shares, with current supremo Freddy Shepherd owning a further 28%-plus.<br><br>Shepherd recently challenged Belgravia to put their money on the table, but has shown little sign of being ready to relinquish control.<br><br>The potential buyers suggested last week they would like to push through a deal before the January transfer window closes.<br><br>But even if an offer came in the next 24 hours, the legal process which would be triggered would make that target difficult.<br><br>Newcastle have largely avoided commenting on the matter to date - Stock Exchange rules dictate they must announce any significant development through the official channels.<br><br>However, Shepherd has grown increasingly weary following reports predicting huge investment in the playing squad should Belgravia be successful.<br><br>The club is currently valued at around Â£90million, but Newcastle also have significant debts after investing heavily in both the redevelopment of St James' Park and the squad in recent years.<br><br>Newcastle reported a Â£12million loss in their most recent figures, although a proportion of that was due to activities in the transfer market and reduced revenue last season because of missing out on European football. </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">DIC plan Liverpool cash whirlwind after takeover<br>tribalfooball.com - December 10, 2006<br><br>Dubai International Capital will push through plans for a new stadium as soon as their Â£170 million takeover of Liverpool is complete.<br>DIC is an arm of Dubai Holdings owned by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, whose personal wealth is Â£7 billion and family fortune Â£14 billion. Only four men on earth are richer; only 11, like he, could buy and sell Roman Abramovich.<br><br>It would cost the sheikh Â£170m to acquire Liverpool, in which Moores, whose family have been owners for 50 years, has a 51.7% holding. Debts of Â£80m and the club's commitment to a new stadium could lift the price as high as Â£500m. DIC can pay cash.<br><br>"We'll build the stadium pronto and invest in players, though there'll be no blank cheques," a source at DIC told the Sunday Times. "We're serious investors looking for returns. Liverpool won't turn into Chelsea, but it will become closer to Manchester United."<br><br>A leading football analyst was less cautious: "This will catapult Liverpool into the Abramovich league."<br><br>A senior figure inside Anfield also said: "This is not a shotgun wedding.<br><br>"They've looked hard at us, but we've also looked hard at them. DIC understand the values and traditions of the club, that's what they're buying into. Remember, the most important value in Liverpool's heritage has always been winning. The old Shankly adage, first is first and second is nowhere, fits perfectly with the philosophy of the sheikhs.<br><br>"An Abramovich would be wrong for us. It wouldn't be our style or fit with our fans. Liverpool are about winning - but getting there through hard work.<br><br>"We know for DIC this is not about having a trophy asset which wins a couple of titles." </span></div>
