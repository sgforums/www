Can you survive without $$$? Obviously if you were running a club, it would very much meet a fate like Leeds. You remember Leeds? Spend, spend, spend... like no tomorrow and what happened to them? They became bankrupt, couldn't pay their player salary, sold all their good players had to make do with junior players, then went down to division 1.<br><br>Was rooney a big name before he went to Man u? he was only a potential nobody came in for him only Man u and Newcastle. Not Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal or even spurs... and with newcastle, any english players available they were keen but they didn't even offer 2/3 of what man U were willing to play for him.... Ronaldo, he wasn't even a player anyone know or heard off outside of portugal maybe the fat ronaldo we have... And the Rio case... Well, it sums up my point regarding Leeds only.<br><br>And the John guy, To make 8 or 10m for something so simple is good money... They didn't even have to spend a cent to develop him yet get such good return. Where can you find this kind of business...  i also want. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
