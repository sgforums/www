Sadly since poly no more PE my stamina been dropping. Before the kayaking we need to do PT, average alternating 30 push ups, sit ups, jumping jacks. The record done is 120 jumps. By then sometimes I already feel very drained. Yup poor stamina. I must train more.<br><br>The deckline very slippery. I grip and pull, I can hardly move up, instead my hands slip.</div>

Not so much of boulder climbing. Ever since I got into adventure activities that I found, adventure training not only your physical but your metal strength as well.<br><br>After so 2 sessions I still can't do the sea exit properly, must think of something.
