            <div class='col-md body'>speaking from personal experience, generally speaking, the malays i've played with are better than the chinese. and i've played with many. many many. they have more balance and better ball sense. better technical skills too. they know when to move, when to stay and how to support you. there are a few good chinese players i know of, but few are good team players. the malays understand that soccer is a team game. they pass the ball better. i used to play with toh choon ming. honestly he wasn't that great. and now he's in the national team! you have to look at many things when u select a player. you may be very skilled but if you are not a team player you won't be selected. if your style of play doesn't fit the coach's game plan, you won't be selected either. if u have a screwed up attitude you won't be picked. so there are many things to consider.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thou' I'm a Chinese, I tink the Malays deserve my vote. Even young Malay kids have better ball sense n better control than Chinese kids.<br>1 of the reason is due family influences. Chinese parents seldom encourage their sons 2 take up soccer(partly fear of injuries), most of them wanted them 2 pick up instruments, swimming or indoor games such as bowling. So, by the time the kid started playing football, the Malay kid has alredi been well-trained in this sport. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

They will be given PR status and trains at a very young age. And they are going to be the future representatives of our National team for the qualification of World Cup.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok here are my views:<br><br>First of all I wont go on arguing on Malay better or Chinese better cause I find it a damn kok thing to argue abt.<br><br>Moreover heres what I think that would make the best Singapore team.<br><br>Starting with the Chinese: They make the best central defenders, defensive mids and goalies. No offence but technique(footwork) wise the Indians and Malays r much better. Also Chinese have the better built and they r more gutsy. They seem to be able to jump higher(basketball?) too.<br><br>With the Malays: They make the best wing backs, playmakers and forwards. Malays have this "natural" sense of the ball and they read the game better than the other races. Malays arnt usually big size so thats y they r better of playing in these positions. Malays have better pace then the other races as well but stamina wise its not too impressive.<br><br>With the Indians: They make the perfect wingers. Indians r usually fast, have lots of stamina and most importantly they like to dribble and they r gd at it. So y waste the talent here?<br><br>Not forgetting the Eurasians: Not many Eurasians have broke into the soccer scene here but from my view they make the best centre forwards and central defenders. With the ang moh blood they r usually also bigger in size which makes them hard to shake off.<br><br>These r just my views and I'm not trying to offend anyone. They may be some chinese who r gd at dribbling and stuffs or malays that r big size but this is just my general view. After playing football for like 10 yrs but was forced to quit(a damn bad toe injury), thats what I observed in our local football scene. And the reason why the standard of the S-League is not as great as other Asian leagues is because our players dont have the fire power and motivation. Remember the gd old Malaysia Cup days, Singapore was like very much feared by the other teams and we usually have a gd chance of beating the Thai national team in SEA Games then. But look at us now, ever since we broke off from Malaysia cup, the standard of football have been decreasing as there is no motivation and will to succeed in it. As for the 2010 thingy, all I can say is let us win the SEA games gold first. Then win the Asian Cup. Then we can think of the World Cup. Singapore FA needs someone who can lead us to these success. And the man who I think is suitable for the job must be someone local but with overseas experience, maybe Fandi Ahmad or Sundramoorthy. Foreigners usually only wants money and thats it.<br><br>Peace,<br>SpookyKid<br><br>Love is the Dance of Eternity<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sunnyday and plunkY..my view of Goal 2010 is the same as both of you. The SSC is not likely to achieved it within such short span of time. But the groundwork got be carry out..in order for them to do the rest. A stepping stone. The idea was 'mooted out' by our PM Goh during his National Day speech.<br><br>As for who is the better player..it all voice down to whether are you committed and passionate to football. Fandi Ahmad is one player we look up to..not only for  his football skill, but also his attitude on and off the field. A role model for the youngsters to follow. For Sundramoothy..he is good too....no question about it. How come he is not in the National team? Your guess is as good as mine.<br><br>As for which race to play in which position..it is all absurd! During our parents time..we have chinese attacking forwards like the Quah's brothers . The defenders and midfielders were Samad Alitpichay, Mohammed Nor and others.. the goalkeeper was a eurasian by the name of Eric Paine. Football is a team game. The coach (experience) is the only person from outside the field who is able to put the various people into their appropriate roles...or his 'head' is going to be on the chopping block.<br><br>Good day!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes I wonder what's the difference between the S-League and the M-League.<br><br>Well, next time if there's a match between China and Malaysia,watch it and then we'll know if the Chinese or the Malays or better! Hee!</div>
