              <p>i have seen howe liang a few times at the kallang stadium gym when i was there previously, years back. at about 6pm-ish, he will clean out the sweats left by the users and put the weights back in place for the next day.</p>
              <p>everytime i see that, i said to myself, " here is an olympic silver medalist, our only pride and joy; reduced to a bloody gym cleaner. and the freakin' ssc thot they are doing howe liang a favour too by givin' him a job." what is wrong with our system here!!!</p>
              <p>it is not too late to recognize and do something more for him. i am not sure in the back if the government has done something about it. this is a real shame that our sports administrator's oversight has done to what is a living `national treasure' of ours.</p>

              <p>My Fellow Singaporeans! Please, Please stop bickering among ourselves! The PRCs won't care too hoots about what we say............'cause most of them can't even speak or let alone read a word of English!</p>
              <p>Granted, our forefathers came here from many lands, settled here and we are the so called bi-products!</p>
              <p>These PRCs (packaged with ping pong) were BOUGHT and brought here but it does not matter really because it proves ONE point...... our enviroment, whether education, training, methods, etc CANNOT and I repeat CANNOT produce  a medal winning Olympian.</p>
              <p>As for our PRIDE &amp; JOY, Mr TAN HOWE LIANG,he was not bought with any packaging, he just came, saw what he loved at Gay World and started to fulfil his dream on his own. Sad to say what a nightmare it has become! We don't acknowledge his feat monetary, or give him decent retirement benefits, but would rather HAPPILY pay to these so called Singaporean PRCs.</p>

              <p>Mercenaries come and go. I think the general sentiment is that pple dun wan to see these sports players come, earn our tax money and go. What are we then? In hokkien, citizens would be known as "cai tao".</p>
              <p>Yes, you can draw parellels between these sports players and our ancestors. All have arrived for the sake of money. However, today we a re different generation of Singaporeans and we call this place our home. We speak Singlish now and we eat food from all races. Can we say the same of our ancestors and these PRC pple?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some comparisons are better put in perspective.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And as for Tan Howe Liang, even though China born, has called Sg home for tens of years. If Li Jiawei after becoming a Sg citizen for so long (in sg for 13 years), can only speak halting English, what does that tell you of her intention to stay in Sg for the long term? And the reason why she has stayed so long is becos S'pore is her only realistic hope of getting huge money...fast. Not even top Olympic players in China get the kind of dough that Sg offers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Li Jiawei and the likes are still young....can still offer competitive glory and of course, win lots more money. That's why they are still here. Throw this incentive away and see if they still stay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When I heard Sg entered the table tennis finals, I was happy...delighted. However, the joy was only shortlived...say 10 secs? Reality has hit home that we didn't win this on our own. How I envy the Penangite Lee Chong Wei and all his fellow Malaysians.</p>

              <p>well maybe I am hyper sensitive but  i have a question since the table tennis player put themselve in 2nd spot and there is an opportunity to take the Gold.</p>
              <p>From all the reading that i read from news media i got a feeling that SG is contented to get sliver and not GO FOR GOLD? even the coach has said it accomplish what it came ?</p>
              <p>Did u see michael phelps ever said "Enough"  where is the competitiveness?  i know the player really work very hard. But mentally....doesn;t really put sport out there.</p>

              <p>Ultimately I don't think it's fair to question their loyalty, the only way we can be happy I feel is if they tell us themselves of their intentions and even then that may not be enough for some.</p>

              <p>While I have issues with the general FT policy in its whole, to zoom into individuals and say this or that about them to be honest, isn't really bring fair to them or the individuals who do come under this scheme, but have the intention to be honest to the spirit of being Singaporean.</p>
              <p>In these kind of things, only time will tell? But truth be told if I was Li Jaiwei and see all that was being written in here about me, even if I intentions to be true to Singapore this would be extremely discouraging.</p>

              <p><br>What's so indecent about wanting our country to send out our own talents to compete instead off wooing outsiders?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Truth is,if Li Jiawei or any of her compatriots were to be reading all this,she should have been mentally prepared considering that she wants to represent Singapore on an international scale.Does she expect to be sheltered from all this?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How about we try being the decent human beings for once and try kindness even to our own home grown talents even to those whom we know would not be able to make it anywhere in the top three, and let their loss for us, be a win for us in terms of Singaporean pride?</p>

              <p>this one i give you a bit of credit. i think singapore has a slim chance. help by the fact that the margin of difference between the top10 players are small, and the fact that this is a team game.</p>
              <p>but your earlier assessment about tao li's chance of gold is way off the mark.</p>

              <p><br>i agree with 798 that with your kind of attitude, you will never excel in sports. money aside, one common trait of sportsperson is that they detest to lose. if losing is ok, then they are kampung sportsman.</p>
              <p>also, why stop at $750k when you have a shot of a lifetime for $1.5m?</p>

              <p>David Beckham was brought to America to promote the sport. In the past century, rest of the world has gone football crazy, save America.</p>

              <p>Yao Ming was brought over to the US to gain access to the populous Chinese market.</p>
