              <p>Beijing Olympic is just around the corner and everyone's attention is going to fix on the Games.</p>
              <p>A portion of Singapore Olympic team just set of this morning, setting off on the journey for Singapore first Olympic medal in 48years.</p>
              <p>Now let us discuss something. What make a Singaporean? What make a Singaporean althetes?</p>
              <p>Many of the athletes are foreign-born, especially from China. Just take a peep at the Ping Pong team, Badminton team, swimming sensation Tao Li and so on. Many of them grew up and trained in their native countries before being courted over to represent Singapore instead.</p>
              <p>My question is: Will you truly support them when they don the Singapore attire and compete for the 'glory of Singapore'? Are they born in Singapore? Are they trained in Singapore? Do they grow up in Singapore? Do you truly consider them as Singapore althetes?</p>
              <p>One of my Malaysian friend did comment before: Even if Malaysian Ping Pong team lost, at least he wont be too disappointed. He know Malaysian players are truly Malaysians. Born in Malaysia, grew up in Malaysia and trained in Malaysia. Just like other normal Malaysians. Unlike Singapore foreign legion of players.</p>
              <p>So what is your view on above mentioned issue? Do you consider them as true Singapore althetes?</p>

              <p>We are spending an considerable amount of money of these sport FTs. I prefer we trained our local althetes instead of going for these fast-tracked 'glories'.</p>

              <p>The thing is with these FT, they have to perform and win.There are no 2 ways about it. I really don't give a damn if they say they tried their best or whatever or even wayang and break down in front of the TV or whatever. The fact that we gave them citizenship and paid them $ = they must perform and win. If not, they should have their citizenship revoked.</p>
              <p>Look at Ronald Susilo? What the hell has he won? He can go balik kampung lah. I'd rather take my chances on Kendrick Lee.</p>
              <p>Good is not good enough, they must be the best. If not, I'd rather see a Singaporean do his/her best at any sporting event even if he/she fails to win anything or even come close than some FT come agonisingly close.</p>

              <p>Yah especially in soccer. I really don't understand why they wanna give citizenship to old fogeys like Duric and Wilkinson. How much longer can these LKKs play? How much more use are they of to the national team? Soon, I believe they'll be like Goncalves, who has sinced F-ed off and Gabrovac, F-ing off soon.</p>
              <p>Then there's that bum Precious Emuerajeye (or something like that, dunno how to spell). Other than being physically big in size, he's slow and clumsy and looks like he'll potentially lose the ball every time he runs with it. Personally, I think Baihakki is technically 10 times the player this clumsy fool can ever hope to be if he can cut out his schoolboy errors that he commits there and then.</p>
              <p>Shi Jiayi? Not much for me to complain but seriously nothing great about him either. Surely with some time, effort, and money put into our academy, we can groom someone of his calibre right? Might as well spend this money on a player who is Singaporean.</p>
              <p>And, don't even get me started on Itimi Dickson and Agu Casmir...<br>Only Mustafic and Bennett seem to add value to the Singaporean team. But honestly, between putting Bennett or Alam Shah back in the team when he returns, I'd choose Alam Shah. Coz after all, it is goals that win matches...</p>

              <p>I also agree with you.. I think trying too hard to be the best is not the way. I think local athletes or potential ones also half heart to pursue this dream. Ultimately singaporeans will not commit their life on sports because there was no environment to nuture them.</p>
              <p>I believe most pple also will feel proud for our teams if they all are our own singaporeans.</p>
