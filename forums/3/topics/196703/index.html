Couples go to hotels for simple reasons but in this case, she was invited to the flat along with a few other people for a chat i guess.<br><br>The thing is she was drugged so she don't know who is the culprit or culprits but she knows she was rape when she woke up and since she was invited to the place by Merson. She reported him lah.</div>
