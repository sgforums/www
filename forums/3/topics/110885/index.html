AND SEE FROM THE MATCH WITH MYANMAR IS ONLY THEY (START) TO SCORE AFTER THE OPPONENT STARTING TO GET RED CARDS.<br>SO DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE PROUD? BETTER DON'T TAKE TOO PRIDE FOR IT. EVEN Ma Lu for missing the penalty. And compare to the STRATEGY of the way they play also always depending on "Agu Casmir".

            <div class='col-md body'>So you have any comments on Singapore badminton team? Table tennis? all have china born players? And everyone hoping them to win in the semi final or quarter final but they didn't manage to get into the final. How about France winning World Cup with Algerian born Zidane and some Senegalese born players? And Holland? Other countries table tennis team? European country asking china or indon player to represent them. What have u to say? SIngapore player win by luck? COs 8 man Myanmar? How about the final? SIngapore lead Indon 2-0 when Indon still have 11 man. Singapore players lembek? Cos Myanmar get 3 red card? Hello! those are serious foul they committed! And one of them is silly enuff! Kick mud at referee. Stupid red card well deserved for a stupid player. You all are not in the position to comment if you don't know much about rules and regulation in soccer. So just shut up! And dun be a sore loser! Singapore is in the final! Like it or not. And I'm proud of their achievement!<br><br>PS.

Imagine that we had less than 100 fans there, while Indonesia had a capacity crowd cheering for them (at least in the beginning <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">). Whether or not the players were born in Singapore does not matter as long as they are willing to play for the country.
