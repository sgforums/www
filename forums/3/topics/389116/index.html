              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>Singapore’s pro-foreigner government is again giving out free scholarships sponsored by Singapore taxpayers to foreigners.</p>
              <p>The new scholarship, called the Singapore Youth Olympic Scholarship will be awarded to outstanding young athletes from around the world to study in Singapore.</p>
              <p>According to a report in the Straits Times, the recipients will get a fully-subsidized academic and sports education at the Singapore Sports School for between four and six years.</p>
              <p>The government-funded scholarships, which will be given out once every four years during the summer YOG, is open to all 205 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) worldwide.</p>
              <p>One athlete will be selected from each of the five continents, and the last spot will be reserved for a Singaporean.</p>
              <p>The scholarships for foreigners will cost about $25,000 a year which means that more than $100,000 will be allocated to attract five foreign athletes to Singapore instead of being invested in locals.</p>
              <p>They will cover food, accommodation, education, sports training as well as return air tickets from the recipient’s home country.</p>
              <p>It is not revealed if the foreign scholars will be bonded in Singapore for a period of time upon graduation from the Singapore Sports School.</p>
              <p>While the Singapore government has offered a slew of scholarships for foreign students to study in Singapore’s varsities, this is believed to be the first such scholarship for sports.</p>
              <p>The ruling party is especially generous to foreign students studying in Singapore on government-funded scholarships – many of them are given a free tertiary education here on top of being guaranteed a job upon graduation as some are bonded with the Singapore government for varying periods of between three to six years.</p>
              <p>The scholarship was welcomed by Dr Southanom Inthavong, deputy secretary-general of Laos’ National Olympic Council.</p>
              <p>“We have plans to send our sportsmen overseas, but we are short of funding. A scholarship like this will help, especially for the future,” he was quoted saying in the Straits Times.</p>
              <p>Singapore is indeed a boon for developing countries in the region for which country in the world will spend more money on foreigners than its own citizens.</p>

              <p>Aiya, uncle</p>
              <p>I am just giving free lecture to help peoples think better and accept the truth. You can't be so dillusion to really believe that the world is fair. Are you???</p>
              <p>When i was studying laws as a attach subject, an old former judge, who was our lecturer told us...<strong>the lady</strong> statue on the supreme court <strong><em>holding the balance weight</em></strong> had never been equal, it slighted one sided, that shows that men created <strong><em>laws</em></strong> are not equal as the world is not deem to be fair.</p>
