They can only judge through the performance in CL. I am very impressed with Roy Makaay too. Totally agree that his technique is incredible. He is a near complete striker in my opinion. Very impressed. So sad that he left Depor. To me, he was more impt to them than Tristan. Why he doesn't get a start in the Dutch team is surprising I feel.<br>Go Roy Makaay!</div>

But I have taken a look at the stats and in both matches they have outnumbered their opponents in terms of shot count. To outnumber Barcelona in that department is not easy at all.
