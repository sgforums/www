            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, I don't believe any footballers in the EPL are really high-achievers in terms of academic. And you sure Liverpool don't want him now with all their strikers mis-firing. I believe Chelsea will beg for his signature if he is available.<br><br>Secondly, you don't even know how players are managed before making comments. Their money are all tied up and even though they earn lots, they don't have access to it. So Rooney has to confess to his agents for help. If not, we would not even hear about it. And to think the rest won, and he did not, it is like saying all smoke but one got cancer. Damn lame.<br><br>Tell them to Gunners after he scored and make the assist. I don't believe he is dumb. But I bet most will agree you are.<br><br>Don't label people or call people names. It really put you in a bad light.<br>No doubt, I believe you enjoy being that, but there is a limit right? Stop insulting yourself, cause now whenever you start a thread, people just pin a clown face to your nick. I felt pity and sorry for you.<br><br></div>

Also, how can u say that 1/2 month of 1 month of his salary can solve his debt?? it make u sound rather stupid actually because 1) you don't know his pay 2) you don't know how much he owes..</div>
