            <div class='col-md body'>Sad to say... although Real is still a team of galaticos (Zidane, Beckham, Carlos, Raul, Ronaldo, Robinho, Ramos, the list goes on.. ) their level of performance has consistently failed to match their team quality on paper. Losing to a rival 3-0 at home and consistently dropping points against lesser teams away from home surely means that they will be playing second fiddle, at best, to arch rival Barcelona till the end of the season.<br><br>Some rebuilding is clearly needed (although the situation at Bernabeu is not as bad as at Old trafford... ) Luxembourgo should be brave enough to axe some old and underperforming 'galaticos'... i think i dont have to name names, its clear for all to see..<br><br>when its time to go, its time to go..</div>

He has to stop playing to the crowd, but play to the game in order to excel further. To me, he is like Ronaldinho some years back. I'm not saying that Ronaldinho is no good. Just that some years back, he was playing like Robinho now. Fanciful but not too effective. But he is totally different now. Very effective, especially in big games.<br><br>If ask me, during that game, i was most impressed with Messi. We are know what to expect from Ronaldinho in big games. But that was the first real big match Messi and he didnt disappoint. It was Robinho who somehow disappointed me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's another strange la liga season if u ask me.. No single team is truely consistent. Even Barca is not too. Not to mention Real Madrid. If teams like Valencia, Villareal, deportivo are more consistent, by now Real Madrid could be near Mid-table already. But u can likewise say about real being more consistent though. This could yet be another close La Liga season.</div>
