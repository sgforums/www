He said: "We're very confident because our level of game has lifted and recent results have given confidence to us.<br><br>"It will be necessary to be careful, however, as though Arsenal are not at their best at the moment, they have players who can make a difference.<br><br>"It is necessary to try to win and to maintain a clean sheet.

I will decide on my future after the World Cup,' he said angrily yesterday.<br><br>Ronaldo joined Real for 35 million euros (S$66.5 million) from Inter Milan following a brilliant performance at the 2002 World Cup. He is under contract at Real until 2008.<br><br>Despite being the club's top scorer every season since he joined, Real's notoriously fickle fans have never quite taken to him.<br><br>He was whistled by a section of Real supporters when he was replaced by new signing Antonio Cassano after he failed to score during the 3-0 league win over Alaves at the weekend.<br><br>This season, he has struggled with a succession of injuries and has faced regular criticism from the press over his fitness and weight.<br><br>He has not appeared for Real in their present Champions League campaign, missing their first two group games because of a ban and the rest through injury.<br><br>Still, he is set to make his first start against an out-of-sorts Arsenal today.<br><br>He is expected to be partnered up front by compatriot Robinho, who has hit a rich vein of form, notching his 11th goal of the season in all competitions against Alaves.<br><br>Real coach Juan Ramon Lopez Caro can also call on Spain international Raul Gonzalez, who is returning after a three-month lay-off due to a serious knee injury.<br><br>If Raul plays, he will become the first player to appear in 100 Champions League games. He is the competition's all-time leading scorer with 51 goals.<br><br>He was rested against Alaves and had illustrious company on the bench with Zinedine Zidane, Cassano and Brazilian full-backs Cicinho and Roberto Carlos given a break too.<br><br>Raul is keen to return to the heat of the competition.<br><br>'Bring on Arsenal. I think we can eliminate them,' said the Real captain.<br><br>'I want to help the team any way I can, help them win both La Liga and the Champions League,' he said on Sunday.<br><br>The Arsenal match will be significant for English duo David Beckham and Jonathan Woodgate as it is their first game against English Premier League opposition since they moved to Spain.<br><br>Beckham is convinced his teammates will inflict the same painful lesson he suffered at the hands of Real when he was in a Manchester United jersey.<br><br>He told The Independent: 'If every player performs to his potential, then we can be devastating.<br><br>'If we do that against Arsenal then, hopefully, we'll win and give a great performance.<br><br>'Our form has been very good for a few months now. When this team play well, the Bernabeu is an incredible place for us to play in and not a very nice place for opposing teams to visit.'<br><br>Lopez Caro has all his first team squad at his disposal. The big dilemma for him is who will play in front of the back-four, assuming he adopts his usual 4-1-4-1 formation, with Thomas Gravesen the most likely candidate but Ivan Helguera and Carlos Diogo are also possibilities.<br><br>Defence remains Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger's biggest worry, with England internationals Sol Campbell and Ashley Cole likely to be missing, but the Frenchman is sure whoever he selects will be up to the task.<br><br>Said the manager: 'I believe in the mental strength and inner character of my young players. They've shown that before. A big part of the game will be not to be overawed by the night.'<br><br>Bookmakers do not give Arsenal any chance of a victory after a recent string of poor results.<br><br>The game will be under the spotlight for more than just what happens on the pitch.<br><br>Arsenal will be the first English team to visit the Santiago Bernabeu stadium since the national team played Spain in November 2004, when England's black players were racially abused by fans.<br><br>AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, REUTERS<br><br></div>
