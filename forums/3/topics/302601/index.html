            <div class='col-md body'>Bottom line.... cheating does not pay.<br><br>All it does is to hurt the honest ones who choose to do it the hard and legal way - through lots of training, practice, and hard work. And it pisses upon their efforts, making a mockery of good old hard work.<br><br>Be it cheating at a school test or in the Olympic games.... if you're a cheat, you are hurting a lot of good people. Period. And you deserve to suffer for that.<br><br>6 months IMHO is pretty light.... but then again, I read that the prosecutors called for no more than that, considering that Jones needs to care for her kids and that she's virtually financially bankrupt. All that endorsement money, prize money, and sponsorship has gone down the drain. She even had to sell off her mother's home.<br><br>I just hope that with this sentence, a strong message gets sent out to cheats of any form, any time, and any place: YOU SUCK.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i really wonder.. ultimately, it will catch up with them..<br><br>from some leaked information, even people who are heroes like Carl Lewis was juiced up.. it was the complicity of the Olympic Council (who were at that time made up of corrupt and criminal) who let him get away with it.. in fact Ben Johnson was supposed to get away with it too but a screw-up caused him to be "found"<br><br>in the light of all this, it makes one wonder what actually is true sportsmanship, and turns one into a complete cynic where sports like the Olympics and Le Tour is concerned...<br><br>that.. and in the end, the cheater pays dearly.. Lewis is crippled... Flo-Jo is dead..<br><br>is it really worth it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Does it matter? Sports is tainted forever. So long as one so-called champion is convicted, that event is thrown into disrepute.<br><br>And we haven't included those conspiracy theories where the labs deliberately infect player's cultures to ensure they show up as positive for drugs test.<br><br>With so much doubt thrown into the picture, there's no telling which side is honest.<br><br>Do you think Lance Armstrong is clean? Or are the french labs trying to ruin him?<br><br>Do you think Liu Xiang is free of drugs?<br><br>Are the Australians as 'clean' as they claim?<br><br>I would like to believe so, but it's harder and harder these days.</div>
