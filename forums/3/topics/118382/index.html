            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Mailman Malone announces retirement </span></strong><br><br><img src="http://a123.g.akamai.net/f/123/12465/1d/media.canada.com/cp/nba/20050211/v021122a.jpg"><br><br>Karl Malone, the second highest scorer in NBA history and twice league Most Valuable Player, ended his career on Feb 13 where it all began with the Utah Jazz.<br><br>Voted one of the 50 greatest players of all-time, the 41-year-old forward officially announced his retirement to bring the curtain down on his Hall of Fame career with 36,928 points, second behind only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (38,387).<br><br>Known to fans around the world as the "Mailman", Malone spent 18 of his 19 seasons in a Jazz uniform, teaming up with guard John Stockton to form one of basketball's most lethal partnerships.<br><br>"The reason we're here is for me to announce my retirement and make it official," said Malone in a news conference at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City.<br><br>"I grew here as a 'Jazzman'. If I'm fortunate enough to go into the Hall of Fame, I will go in as a 'Jazzman', with the old uniform and not the new one."<br><br>In an attempt to claim the NBA title that eluded him throughout his career, Malone signed on with the Los Angeles Lakers last season, joining forces with Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal and Gary Payton in a 'dream team' line-up.<br><br>But his championship dream ended in a nightmare when the Lakers lost to the Detroit Pistons in five games in the NBA Finals.<br><br>Following reconstructive knee surgery in the off-season, Malone considered signing with another team before eventually deciding to end his career.<br><br>"The all-time scoring title is not a big concern for me," he said. "The thing that will stick with me for the rest of my life is not winning a championship, I'm not going to lie to you.<br><br>"That was my ultimate goal, but that was a team goal, not an individual goal."<br><br>Malone said he had discussions with the San Antonio Spurs about joining the Western Conference leaders this season in one last-ditch attempt to land the title.<br><br>"I did visit San Antonio on the way back home but when I got on the plane I knew that it was done, it was time," he said. "Because I look at basketball as 100 percent mentally and 100 percent physically.<br><br>"If I can't bring you 200 percent, for me, I can't bring you anything."<br><br>Malone leaves with his name sprinkled through the record books.<br><br>He is one of two players (the other being Jerry West) to average at least 25 points in 11 consecutive seasons, the only player in league history to be named to the All-Star team 11 times and he led the league in free throws made a record eight times.<br><br>Malone ranks second all-time in minutes played and field goals made, and fourth in games played.</div>
