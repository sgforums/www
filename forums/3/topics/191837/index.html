I hope chelsea buys carlos, shevchenko &amp; even RVN and sell Drogba &amp; Gallas. Imagine carlos... old &amp; slow already, shevchenko pass his best days &amp; RVN a very lazy &amp; selfish player and also losing his best form as he reach 30 alrdy. All these 3 players may be able to sell lots of shirts in the short term but they are no longer at the top of their game and they also have big egos. Losing Drogba &amp; Gallas will be extremely huge. Drogba is a good player, he is not selfish, put team before self &amp; strong in the air. Gallas: their best defender. as good as terry in the centre but also very good at left &amp; right back where terry can never play effectively at all. Not many player can play in all positions of defence and still be as good.<br><br>So i hope this deal go throught... They will spend extremely huge money to get these 3 old Jokers not to mention their salary &amp; get nothing much from them but only trouble in the dressing room as they all are Big name players so won't like sitting on the bench.</div>

Even if he do well this year he would probably be over by next cos strikers normally go downhill once they reach 30yrs old. And with Gallas being a defender can play till much older &amp; Drogba, much younger the shev will probably be in their current form for a much longer time at least. Anyway, since they are on a roll, might as well get carlos &amp; rvn too. hehhe...</div>
