            <div class='col-md body'>Penalties proved to be Balestier KhalsaÂ’s undoing in the RHB Singapore Cup after they lost their 3rd-placing match to Woodlands Wellington in a Sunday evening shootout.<br><br>The Tigers, who were knocked out of the semifinals by Chonburi Province FC of Thailand on spot kicks, had taken the lead in the first half through Akihiro Nakamura.<br><br>But Woodlands, who had defender Azmi Mahamud sent off in the 62nd minute, then brought the score level after Masrezwan Masturi had earned a controversial penalty, which was converted by league top-scorer Laakkad Abdelhadi.<br><br>The game thus went down to a penalty shootout, where a twice-taken spot kick by Hasrin Jailani was the highlight as last yearÂ’s losing finalists won 5-3 to claim third place.<br><br>Woodlands started the match with four key players missing through injury and suspension, including the midfield duo of Goh Tat Chuan and Essa Basile.<br><br>Jorg Steinebrunner dealt with the staffing crisis by moving Laakkad into midfield to partner Sazali Salleh, while Jeykanth Jeyapal started in place of the injured Itimi Dickson.<br><br>Jeykanth started the match promisingly, as did the rest of Woodlands, as Laakkad adapted admirably and gave plenty of steel and industry to the teamÂ’s engine room.<br><br>Balestier were playing at least equally as well, though, keeping things tight all around and persistently putting their opponents under plenty of pressure.<br><br>Kengne Ludovick was a major driving force in attack for the Tigers, as he fought hard to add to his 24-goal haul in all competitions.<br><br>Just as outstanding at the back was Mohamed Mardani, who was tough as nails against his old club as he cut out attack after potentially threatening attack.<br><br>The two players combined in the 22nd minute when Mardani met LudovickÂ’s corner with a powerful header, but Yazid Yasin proved equal to the task with an excellent save.<br><br>It was not the first time Yazid had to save his teammates in the match, and it was far from the last, although even his level best was not enough to prevent Woodlands from going behind in the 37th minute.<br><br>A silly free kick for a handball offence just outside the box presented Balestier with a tantalizing chance to take the lead, and LudovickÂ’s powerful drive drew a good save from the compactly-built custodian.<br><br>But then in came Nakamura, who had initially stood near the free kick site, and the Tigers captain slammed the rebound home to rapturous cheers from the red half of the Woodlands Stadium crowd.<br><br>Going a goal down was bad enough for the Rams, and it could easily have been worse as they had to cope with some combative and industrious play by Balestier.<br><br>Azmi, detailed to mark Ludovick, clearly struggled with his assignment, and while the tussles between the players went both ways, the Rams centreback often reacted the harder Â– and consequently paid the price.<br><br>The 30-year-old centreback was shown the yellow card ten minutes into the second half after hauling the Cameroonian down in the centre of the park, and when the two clashed again seven minutes later, Woodlands fans feared the worst.<br><br>Their fears were confirmed as referee Abas Daud brandished the yellow card, followed by the red, leaving the Rams backline looking dangerously thin with half an hour to go.<br><br>Balestier looked poised to exploit the situation, especially as they had just brought on Osagie Ederaro, who made a surprise appearance on the bench after recovering from a knee injury.<br><br>The Nigerian was not yet fully match-fit as he lacked his usual pace, but still managed to cause a couple of dangerous moments, most notably a blocked shot in the 67th minute.<br><br>But the face of the game changed completely in the 69th minute, when Masrezwan went down in slow motion just inside the box under a soft challenge by Mardani.<br><br>Abas took the bait by giving the spot kick despite the Balestier playersÂ’ loud protests, and it was up to Laakkad to save the match for Woodlands as he faced Fajar Sarib.<br><br>Fajar saved the MoroccanÂ’s first effort, only to be told he had moved off his line too early, and could do little to prevent the retaken shot from going in the second time.<br><br>That proved the turning point as the Tigers lost their psychological edge, and while they still had opportunities through Ludovick, Mardani and Norikazu Murakami, they could not find the second goal that would have averted the penalty shootout.<br><br>Having fallen to Chonburi under similar circumstances, the Tigers were clearly apprehensive about facing their most dreaded ghosts.<br><br>They thought they had exorcized them when Hasrin Jailani sent WoodlandsÂ’ third spot kick wide, but Fajar, roaring in triumph, was stunned when he was told he had again left his line early, leading to the penalty being retaken Â– again.<br><br>Hasrin made no mistake with his second effort, and the odds were further stacked against Balestier when Abdul Rahman Hassan then saw his shot caught by Yazid.<br><br>The Rams went on to convert their two remaining penalties for an unassailable 5-3 lead, thereby ending the season on a high as they left Abdul Karim RazzakÂ’s Tigers crushed.<br><br>Triumphant Steinebrunner hails both teams<br><br>Woodlands Wellington coach Jorg Steinebrunner praised his team after they had given Â“one of the best performancesÂ” he has seen since assuming the position in June.<br><br>The Rams faced immense pressure from Balestier Khalsa, going a goal down and losing Azmi Mahamud to a red card, but clawed their way back when Laakkad Abdelhadi converted a penalty in the 71st minute.<br><br>Laakkad was one of the teamÂ’s leading performers on the occasion, playing excellently in midfield as Steinebrunner had to cope with a manpower shortage.<br><br>But the German insisted the collective effort from the team was what kept them in the game against Balestier, before winning the RHB Singapore Cup 3rd-placing match in a penalty shootout.<br><br>Â“It was not an easy game at all, but IÂ’m very proud of the team,Â” he said after the match.<br><br>Â“Looking at the situation, we had two players suspended, and (Goh) Tat Chuan and Itimi (Dickson) were out injured. So we actually played with only seven from the first eleven, but the team still fought hard.<br><br>Â“Putting Laakkad in midfield may have turned a few heads, but the way he played, he looked very comfortable. HeÂ’s my man of the match, but tonightÂ’s star was the entire team.<br><br>Â“They showed determination, hunger, fighting spirit, everything. I think itÂ’s one of the best performances from the team in the way they had given everything.Â”<br><br>Steinebrunner, who was once with Balestier in his playing career, also lauded his former club for their role in a very tight match that saw them rarely giving an inch to Woodlands.<br><br>Remarking that a penalty shootout was a cruel and unfortunate way to go down, he offered his commiserations to the Tigers after they had given a Â‘brilliantÂ’ performance.<br><br>Â“Balestier contributed to a very good evening, and they too had given everything they had to offer,Â” said Steinebrunner.<br><br>Â“That gave all the fans a very good game, a game that had everything in it from the first to the last minute. To do that, you need both teams, and you have to credit Balestier for it.<br><br>Â“I can understand that the Balestier people are upset that this has to go down to penalties, and losing in the penalty shootout is especially heartbreaking. IÂ’d rather lose inside 90 minutes than in a penalty shootout.<br><br>Â“In that sense, I can imagine what it is for them, but they can keep their head up and feel proud of their performance. They were brilliant and gave us all a good game tonight.Â”<br><br>Balestier coach Abdul Karim Razzak managed to contain his disappointment after watching his team lose their lead to LaakkadÂ’s penalty, which was earned by Masrezwan Masturi under controversial circumstances.<br><br>Masrezwan went down in the box under minimal contact from Mohamed Mardani, and LaakkadÂ’s spot kick had to be retaken after goalkeeper Fajar Sarib was adjudged to have left his line too early in making the save.<br><br>Balestier rued their luck once again in the penalty shootout, when Hasrin Jailani was allowed to retake his kick under similar circumstances as well.<br><br>But Karim felt proud of his teamÂ’s performance on the night, and consoled several tearful players as they left the field.<br><br>Â“I think MasrezwanÂ’s penalty was a bit soft, but the referee was nearer to it than I was, so I have to give it to him for his decision,Â” he said afterwards.<br><br>Â“The penalty changed the whole match, especially after the save was disallowed. The players were a bit down after that, and they understandably lost their composure.<br><br>Â“But then we had enough chances to win the game comfortably before that, and football is cruel to us when we donÂ’t put away our chances. One penalty in the box, and everything suddenly changes.<br><br>Â“Still, we controlled the game very well for the most part, and we had them where we wanted them to be. In the end, to lose a cup tie to two retaken penalties is not something to be ashamed of.Â”<br><br></div>
