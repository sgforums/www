Both soccer stars serve as goodwill ambassadors to the UN Development Program.<br><br>Both Ronaldo and Zidane have been involved with the game for each of its first four years and both feel that it's important to use their prominence to draw attention to the worthy cause.<br><br>"It has been really encouraging to see the response from the public and the media to previous games," Ronaldo said. "We really want to continue mobilizing the world of football in raising awareness and overcoming poverty."<br><br>This will be Zidane's first game in Europe since last summer's World Cup and the infamous head- butting incident. He has since retired from competitive soccer.<br><br>"I have retired from professional football, but I am determined to continue playing in my capacity as UNDP Goodwill Ambassador for such a good cause, and to contribute to this gathering with my friend Ronaldo," Zidane said.<br><br>Moneys raised from previous matches have all gone to support various worldwide programs that are focused on eliminating poverty.<br><br>"Through the Match Against Poverty, millions of fans witness their heroes in soccer become heroes in the fight against extreme poverty," said Ad Melkert, an Associate Administrator of the United Nations Development Program. "This message is so important because only in partnership with governments, the private sector, civil society, and individuals like Ronaldo and Zidane will we be able to truly overcome poverty and achieve the Millenium Development Goals."<br><br>Since 2002, two All-Star football teams captained by Ronaldo and his Real Madrid teammate ZinÃ©dine Zidane have faced each other three times in a match organised by UNDP to raise money and awareness about poverty. The funds support projects selected by UNDP in programme countries.<br><br>As UNDP Goodwill Ambassadors, Ronaldo and Zidane were the ones to propose the Match Against Poverty. The 2007 Match took place on 19 March in Marseille, France and raised an estimated US$450,000 for UNDP anti-poverty work world-wide.<br><br>In past years, the Match Against Poverty took place in the following cities:<br><br>2005: Dusseldorf, Germany<br>2004: Madrid<br>2003: Basel<br><br><img src="http://english.people.com.cn/200703/20/images/xin_42203042010511093044927.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://english.people.com.cn/200703/20/images/xin_42203042010512501730428.jpg"></span><br></div>
