If we had lost at Spurs last Sunday, it would have been three points so it's going to be nip-and-tuck until the end of the season.<br><br>"That said, we're confident in the way we're playing football at the moment and we've got the bit between our teeth to keep trying to get results.<br><br>"Performances such as the one at Tottenham breed confidence, though - especially after the defeat a couple of weeks ago against Arsenal.<br><br>"A lot of people maybe expected us to fall by the wayside and drop some more points straightaway.<br><br>"But we showed great character in getting results since then."<br><br>United boss Fergie has billed Ferdinand's defensive partnership with Serbian ace Nemanja Vidic as a major factor in the club's title surge this term.<br><br>The pair have helped stiffen a United defence that has shipped just 18 goals in 28 games so far this season.<br><br>Vidic's aerial ability has also seen him weigh in with four goals.<br><br>Ferdinand added: "We've never really had a settled backline since I've been here. I've played with numerous different people.<br><br>"Maybe I had a settled one with Mikael Silvestre but even that was interrupted a little bit through injury, so I think now is the most settled it's been and we're getting our reward for that.<br><br>"We have a good understanding of each other's games and we're always learning.<br><br>"Consistency is the key. People such as Alvin Martin, Iain Dowie and Slaven Bilic had that consistency when I was at West Ham and that consistency comes with age a lot of the time." </span></div>
