            <div class='col-md body'>Henry named player of the year<br><br>Arsenal striker Thierry Henry was tonight named PFA Player of the Year by his fellow professionals.<br><br>Thierry Henry: Player of the Year (JohnWalton/Empics)<br><br>The 25-year-old French international was rewarded by the Professional Footballers Association for his scintillating form this season and his 34 goals for his club, who trail Manchester United by five points going into the final two weeks of the campaign.<br><br>Newcastle midfielder Jermaine Jenas was named PFA Young Player of the Year, only 15 months after hisÂ£5million move from First Division Nottingham Forest.<br><br>Henry said: 'This means a lot to me because the other players have voted for me. They all know better than anyone else because they play against me and they must have noticed something, so I'm happy they have noticed something.<br><br>'It's never easy when you come from another country to get people to like you but, at the end of the day, the most important thing is football, no matter which country you are from. We are all trying to play the same and to do well on the pitch, so nationality doesn't really matter.'<br><br>The 2002 PFA Player of the Year, Ruud van Nistelrooy, scored his 40th goal of the season for Manchester United in the 2-0 win at Tottenham today, and was on the shortlist of nominees for the award along with Southampton striker James Beattie, United team-mate Paul Scholes, Newcastle striker Alan Shearer and Chelsea forward Gianfranco Zola.<br><br>Henry admitted: 'There were some great names on the shortlist and some equally good ones who didn't make it, but that's because there are so many great players in the English League and that is why I am so happy to win this.<br><br>'It means a lot when the players vote for you.'<br><br>The 20-year-old Jenas has become a mainstay in the Newcastle midfield as Sir Bobby Robson's men bid to qualify for the Champions League for the second consecutive season.<br><br>He fought off competition from Everton's teenage prodigy Wayne Rooney to land the prestigious prize.<br><br>'This means a lot to me, it is a massive achievement,' said Jenas. 'I felt I'd had a good season but to win this shows me what the other players think of me and it's a great achievement.<br><br>'I was slightly surprised but I knew I'd be in the running because I believe in my own ability and I was hoping I would be up there and it is so nice to win it.'<br><br>Jenas, who made his England debut against Australia in February, follows in the footsteps of Newcastle team-mate Craig Bellamy, who won the award last season.<br><br>The Welsh international was also on the shortlist for this year's award, along with Rooney, West Ham striker Jermain Defoe, Manchester United defender John O'Shea and Charlton midfielder Scott Parker.<br><br>'I'm hoping to follow in the footsteps of previous winners because I've joined a list of great names and that's an honour in itself, and it will be even better if I can go on and aspire to the types of career of previous winners.<br><br>'It has all come thick and fast but I've loved every minute of it. Making my England debut was special, especially getting man of the match, and it has been great playing in the Champions League, which has helped me develop my game - and that is why I am here today.'<br><br>PREMIERSHIP<br><br>BRAD FRIEDEL - Blackburn He had a magnificent World Cup for the USA last summer, where he was widely recognised as the one of the outstanding goalkeepers of the competition and has continued his fine form into this season's Premiership. An exceptional shot-stopper with excellent reflexes, he arrived at Ewood Park from Liverpool on a free transfer in November 2000.<br><br>STEPHEN CARR - Tottenham Missed the whole of last season through injury and only returned to first-team action in January. A full-back who loves to get forward, the Republic of Ireland international remains a big favourite with the White Hart Lane faithful.<br><br>ASHLEY COLE - Arsenal He joined Arsenal as a trainee in 1998, and after been capped by his country at youth and under-21 levels, he has now established himself as England's first-choice left-back at senior level. Effective in the tackle and capable of making surging runs forward.<br><br>SOL CAMPBELL - Arsenal After making the controversial move from Tottenham to north London rivals Arsenal in 2001, he has established himself as one of the best central defenders in Europe. A cornerstone of the Gunners' double-winning side last season, he is also a key figure in England's national team.<br><br>WILLIAM GALLAS - Chelsea He arrived at Stamford Bridge from Marseille in July 2001 for Â£6.2million. A player who possesses exceptional pace, he is comfortable anywhere in the back four, and his form this season has been a major reason for Chelsea's successful campaign.<br><br>PATRICK VIEIRA - Arsenal Joined the Gunners in 1996 for a fee of Â£3.5million from AC Milan. A skilful and determined player, he has taken on the responsibility of club captain following the retirement of Tony Adams last season. A regular in the French national team, he remains the driving force in the Arsenal engine room.<br><br>PAUL SCHOLES - Manchester United Joined Manchester United as a trainee in July 1991, before quickly establishing himself as a first-team regular at Old Trafford. A player with wonderful skill and vision, he continues to score vital goals for both club and country. He has also received a nomination for Player's Player of the Year.<br><br>ROBERT PIRES - Arsenal This skilful wide midfield player joined Arsenal from Marseille in July 2000 for a fee of Â£6million. Last year, the France international's campaign was cut short by a serious knee injury, but his return to fitness earlier this season was a major boost to the Gunners' quest for glory.<br><br>KIERON DYER - Newcastle He arrived at St James' Park from Ipswich in July 1999 for a fee of Â£6million. A player with terrific energy and an impressive turn of pace, the England international can play in a number of different positions across midfield.<br><br>ALAN SHEARER - Newcastle The former England captain has had another outstanding campaign in what has been an impressive season for the Magpies. Throughout his illustrious career he has scored more Premiership goals than any other player and has also been nominated for the Players' Player of the Year, an award he previously won in 1995 and 1997.<br><br>THIERRY HENRY - Arsenal A Â£10million signing from Juventus in 1999, the France international has established himself as one of the most feared strikers in Europe. A player with great close control and an electric change of pace, he is celebrating his second-successive nomination in the Premiership team of the season.<br><br></div>
