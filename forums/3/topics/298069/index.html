            <div class='col-md body'>Hey everyone. I'm really interested in motor racing since I was a child. Have been trying to find ways where I can start racing myself. Although I tried searching for years for way how to start this long-time hobby, or maybe career, it's to no avail.<br><br>Main reason of this is because of the amount of money needed just to try at this kind of sports. I'm greatly sadden and dissapointed with my try to somehow "get myself in" this sport. I came from a very poor family and currently not living on our own, but renting a room. And the fees and amount of money need to just start this sport is too high for me or my family, even go-karting is way above my expectation or anything I could afford. I even started thinking of forgetting this dream of mine, but I just can't, coz I love it.<br><br>I came here to ask if there's any other way I could just maybe learn or start this thing, or maybe anyone could be my mentor for this sports. It is very unfair to poor people who are interested in this type of sports, or in that matter, any kind of sports.<br><br>Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The motorsports academies are all overseas, my friend. Given your situation, I'm afraid that's the best advice anyone can give you.<br><br>On what basis do you believe you have what it takes? Have you raced a go-kart a few times before? Racing is not something you can suka-suka join, train hard and then expect to become good at - you need to be a proper talent in order to win and progress. Even then, in spite of the impending Formula 1 race here, few companies give a shit about sponsoring local racing talent.<br><br>I know I probably burst your bubble, but I'm just giving you a reality check. Motorsports engineering is one of your alternatives, and you need to save up to study that abroad. But if you're still convinced that you should be in the c<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ockpit, find some way to get answers from Hafiz Koh or Dennis Lian.<blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ahmad0410:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm afraid saving up money is not an option here considering my age.
