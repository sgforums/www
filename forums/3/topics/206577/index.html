            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United and Chelsea target Carlos Tevez is refusing to play for his club Corinthians as he continues to be linked with a move to Europe.<br><br>The Argentine international featured at the weekend against Botafogo, but he then told the Brazilian media that he had played his last game for the club.<br><br>He is now back in Buenos Aires and does not look as if he is in a hurry to return to Brazil as he was pictured at a rock festival and a move to Europe seems to be the prime motivation behind his actions.<br><br>Tevez's unofficial departure has not gone down well with the club, but coach Emerson Leao is not overly concerned about the player's absence.<br><br>"Our relationship has never got started," said Leao.<br><br>"But it is still too early to say anything. I don't want this getting in the way of my job, I am here to coach the team.<br><br>"I need to improve Corinthians and the more good players I have, the better.<br><br>"I'm not going to make allowances for those that don't deserve it. I arrived only a short time ago and have a two-year contract.<br><br>"Tevez has missed other training sessions so this is nothing new. From what I have seen, the team played 45 games last year and he played only 24.<br><br>"Does anyone understand what Tevez says when he speaks, because I don't.<br><br>"He is a citizen who has to answer for his own actions and he has no reason for his absence.<br><br>"Corinthians received no official notice and we need to work with concrete, reliable facts."<br><br>Corinthians confirmed that Tevez was AWOL.<br><br>"Tevez has not appeared," said Corinthians spokesperson Luciano Signorini:<br><br>"He has not called to give any reason why he has missed training. We don't know what is going on with him."<br><br>New of Tevez's unrest is sure to alert Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho - both of whom have shown an interest.</div>
