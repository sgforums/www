            <div class='col-md body'>West Ham striker Carlos Tevez has wasted little time in offering a frank and less than complementary assessment of departed manager Alan Pardew.<br><br>The Argentine international arrived at Upton Park prior to the close of the transfer window, as did compatriot Javier Mascherano, but neither player has lived up to lofty reputations in the capital.<br><br>Tevez has spent more time on the bench than the pitch, whilst Mascherano has fallen out of the picture completely, and the former has now had his say on Pardew, who was sacked last week.<br><br>Firmly of the opinion that he has been misused thus far on his English sojourn, Tevez has delivered a damning verdict on the manner in which he was employed by his former taskmaster.<br><br>"I was surprised to see how long Pardew held on to the job in the end," he told the News of the World.<br><br>"In Argentina or Brazil he would have been out long ago. It was clear the team did not react as he wanted - it wasn't going right.<br><br>"I was never given the chances I thought I would be given and I was told to play out of position against my will.<br><br>"I had to sacrifice myself for the team which I don't think helped. I was playing in ways I did not understand well and I lost a lot from my own game.<br><br>"It didn't fit where he put me, but I wanted to help."<br><br>On a more optimistic note, Tevez has vowed to do his utmost to impress new incumbent Alan Curbishley, confident that he will be given chance to shine under the former Charlton chief.<br><br>"The fans have been fantastic towards me and I thank them. Now I want to repay them," he added.<br><br>"I want to win with this team and a lot of people have told me great things about the new coach, so I want to start scoring for him and start helping West Ham win matches."<br><br></div>
