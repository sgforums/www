              <p>Last Saturday article:</p>
              <p><a href="http://tnp.sg/sports/story/0,4136,163252-1209333540,00.html">Young gun's big chance</a> </p>
              <p>Reader vs Tipster</p>
              <p>IT is a day which Ng Ghim Pheng has been waiting for.</p>
              <p>He had been wanting to take part in The New Paper Tipster Challenge since last year but since he was a year short of the minimum requirement of 18 years old, he had to bide his time.</p>
              <p>A fortnight ago, a month after he turned 18, he wrote in to us.</p>
              <p>How could we turn him down?</p>
              <p>Anyway, Ghim Pheng is a student by day, and a Chelsea fan by night.</p>
              <p>So passionate is he about his club, that he once composed, recorded and sent to us a video footage of himself doing a rap number, singing Jose Mourinho's praises.</p>
              <p>As he follows world football closely, it is no wonder his friends often asks him for his predictions.</p>
              <p>He said: 'Most of them think I am quite knowledgeable in football as I watch football almost everyday, certainly whenever there is a match involving English Premier League, Spanish La Liga and Italian Serie A teams.'</p>
              <p>But Gary Lim will not be shaken.</p>
              <p>After beating his challenger last week, he has tasted blood and is eager to claim another victim.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">THE READER - <em>NG GHIM PHENG</em></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">CHELSEA v MAN U</span></strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">During the Champions League semi-finals, Chelsea played in England while Man U had to travel to Spain. The travelling for European games usually affects a club's domestic performance.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The schedule of both teams' recent matches suggests that Chelsea should be fresher and more prepared than United for what is potentially the title decider.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">And let's not forget that Stamford Bridge has always been a fortress.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>BIRMINGHAM v LIVERPOOL</strong> </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">LIVERPOOL have an eight-point advantage over fifth-placed Everton, which means they are almost assured of a Champions League qualification slot next season.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">With the second leg against Chelsea coming up at Stamford Bridge four days later, I expect Rafael Benitez to rest his key players against Birmingham to keep them fresh against Chelsea.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Birmingham are quite sound at home and desperate to avoid defeat.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>WEST HAM v NEWCASTLE</strong> </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">NEWCASTLE have been playing well recently, with the Michael Owen-Mark Viduka-Obafemi Martins combination looking impressive. So, too, the defence.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I'm backing Newcastle despite their poor away form because I believe the Keegan Effect is finally in place.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">West Ham have lost three out of their last four matches, and two of them came against strugglers Sunderland and Bolton.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Backing Newcastle is a logical choice.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>TOTTENHAM v BOLTON</strong> </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">BOLTON'S back-to-back wins have shocked many but they won't continue such form against Spurs, who have too many attacking talents and higher energy level.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Bolton's players are fighting to stay in the Premiership while Spurs' players are fighting for their future at the club.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I thought Spurs were unlucky to get only a draw against Wigan last week. I believe Juande Ramos will correct the problems soon.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">THE TIPSTER - <em>GARY LIM</em></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>CHELSEA v MAN U</strong> </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">I AM tempted to go for a Manchester United win here. That would be a perfect way to clinch the title, wouldn't it?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Then, I looked at Chelsea's home record and began to have second thoughts. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">On recent form alone, United would win this hands down. But football is never that straightforward. A draw seems a safe-enough bet. But I won't be surprised to even see United pick up a victory.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>BIRMINGHAM v LIVERPOOL</strong> </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">LAST season, Liverpool disregarded the consequences of fielding weakened teams against relegation candidates towards the end of the season, when they had already secured Champions League qualification.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">They ended up losing two and drawing one in their last three matches.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rafael Benitez will rest his key players against Birmingham, especially with an important second leg against Chelsea coming up.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">And Birmingham will not find an easier game against the Reds. </span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>WEST HAM v NEWCASTLE</strong> </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">THE revival of Newcastle has seen them unbeaten in their last six matches, winning four of them to boot. West Ham, plagued by injuries throughout the season, will find it hard to raise their game tonight.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Alan Curbishley spoke of a tough game ahead of their clash with Derby last week, which gave us an indication of how dire the situation is at the club.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">I mean, if they are not even confident of beating Derby, then what chance do they have of beating Newcastle?</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>TOTTENHAM v BOLTON</strong> </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">SPURS have been an enigma this season, winning when least expected and losing when it seemed impossible to.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">There will be no shortage of punters looking at a Bolton upset, especially since the Trotters have won two consecutive games.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">And Spurs themselves have not won in four matches. But that's just a sign for me to back Spurs.</span></strong></p>

I also felt that Chelsea had to win it, and they eventually did.<br><br>Being a Chelsea fan, it was the perfect icing on the cake that Chelsea also helped me win the contest. <br><br>I'm looking forward to the Monthly Tipster Challenge.<br></span><br><strong>THE TIPSTER - GARY LIM (8 pts)</strong> <br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">I WISH I can think of a better excuse than some computer virus messing around with my predictions.<br><br>But really, I don't have any.<br><br>The problem is not with losing. It's the tally that irks me.<br><br>From breaking the record with a 67-pointer a week earlier, to registering the second-lowest score in the contest history - I feel like a deep-fried ice-cream.<br><br>Anyway, I blame Sir Alex Ferguson.<br><br>I blame him for choosing to rest Paul Scholes, Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez and Patrice Evra in such an important match in the Premiership calendar.<br><br>But surely, he knows better than all of us, doesn't he? I hope so.<br><br>Ah, but I also give credit to Ghim Pheng. He was so devoted to his Chelsea that he predicted a win for them.<br><br>And at least, I had him chewing on his toenails right until the late, late penalty.<br><br>Before that, I thought I had it. But I was dead wrong.</span></p>
