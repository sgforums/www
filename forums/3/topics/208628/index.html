            <div class='col-md body'>WILLIAM GALLAS made a series of bizarre threats to Chelsea in an astonishing five-month feud with manager Jose Mourinho.<br><br>Furious club chiefs yesterday decided to reveal the catalogue of misbehaviour in an official statement on their own website.<br><br>In it, the Premiership champions claim the French international defender:<br><br><span style="color: red;">Hawked himself around, searching for the highest bidder.<br>Threatened to boycott their FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool if he was not offered a bigger contract.<br>Went on strike for the new seasonÂ’s opening game against Manchester City.<br>Warned he would score an own goal or get himself sent off if the club tried to discipline him for his outrageous actions. </span><br><br>Gallas was finally jettisoned by Chelsea when they used him as a makeweight in the deal that brought Ashley Cole to Stamford Bridge from Arsenal minutes before the transfer window closed at midnight last Thursday.<br><br>Boss Mourinho challenged Gallas, 29, the morning after transfer deadline-day to come clean on why he had been sold.<br><br>The defender, currently away on international duty with France, remained silent Â— so Chelsea decided to act themselves.<br><br>Their statement said: Â“Chelsea FC believes it is important for our supporters to be made aware of the full facts regarding William Gallas and the lack of respect he showed to the fans, manager and club.<br><br>Â“Despite leaving, he continues to attack Jose Mourinho and this cannot be left unchallenged.<br><br>Â“Chelsea made William Gallas a very substantial and attractive new contract offer to stay. This was rejected.<br><br>Â“The issue was purely one of money, despite his public comments he wanted a new challenge, to play abroad . . .<br><br>Â“These were just a smokescreen to cover the fact he was hawking himself to the highest bidder.<br><br>Â“Having failed to secure his demands, his position became increasingly intransigent and unacceptable.<br><br>Â“He initially refused to play against Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final last season in an effort to force an increased contract offer.<br><br>Â“He refused to join up with the team in Los Angeles during pre-season, despite agreeing the dates for his return as the other World Cup players did.<br><br>Â“When Jose Mourinho generously offered him a way back into the Â‘familyÂ’ after the American tour, this was thrown back in the managerÂ’s face.<br><br>Â“The manager told him that, even if he did not agree a new contract but returned to the Â‘familyÂ’ and abided by the rules, he would still select the best players available and would not punish him playing-wise.<br><br>Â“However, despite meetings to try and resolve the problems, Gallas made it clear to Jose Mourinho he would never play for Chelsea again.<br><br>Â“Before the first game of the season against Manchester City, when only four defenders were available and John Terry was doubtful with an injury, he refused to play.<br><br>Â“He went on to threaten that if he was forced to play, or if he was disciplined and financially punished for his breach of the rules, he could score an own goal, get himself sent off or make deliberate mistakes.<br><br>Â“Clearly this was a totally unacceptable situation. So a collectively agreed solution in Chelsea's interests had to be found, hence his departure.<br><br>Â“Chelsea has a wage structure in place that is valued not only on the contribution of the player to the manager and the team, but also on a playerÂ’s respect for the club and contribution to the promotion and image of the club off the field.<br><br>Â“Every player is expected to play their part in this. William Gallas rarely recognised these responsibilities.<br><br>Â“He also failed to recognise the role Jose Mourinho and Chelsea played in helping him become a double Premiership champion for a player whose only League title had been in the French Second Division.Â”<br><br>Gallas was unavailable for comment last night.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea seems really angry... But then they are just trying to cover their own flaws...<br><br>In the first place, had they treated Gallas better, he wouldn't have left them. They were paying Lamperd, Terry, New boys Shev and Ballack all 100,000 or more per week salary and treated Gallas like dirt on a 35,000 a week when he was their most important &amp; best defender.<br><br>You don't treat your best defender that way, even the 2 portuguese defenders gets more than him. How can you blame him for being not happy.<br><br>To say he...<br><br><span style="color: red;">Hawked himself around, searching for the highest bidder.<br>Threatened to boycott their FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool if he was not offered a bigger contract.<br>Went on strike for the new seasonÂ’s opening game against Manchester City.<br>Warned he would score an own goal or get himself sent off if the club tried to discipline him for his outrageous actions</span><br><br>is rather silly when they were the ones that didn't valued him in the first place. To say he wanted more money, they forgot that they offered him 80,000 a week when he made known he wanted to leave to persuade him to stay but still wasn't interested.<br><br>It reminds us of Makelele during his time at Real.<br><br>I guess the one that benefitted from all this is Arsenal &amp; Wenger...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He was already so unhappy over there.. They do not want him to leave then he die die want to leave. So he had to twist the arm of Chelski or else he will have to spend another unhappy season playing out of his favourite position and have to go through squad-rotation. Anyway he wanted to leave for a few seasons already, i think he see no improvement so he is desperate so he made those threatening comments.<br><br>Dun understand why chelski want to keep an unhappy player when they can buy.. so rich..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Overall, it would have been funny had Gallas played for Chelsea and he went on to score an own goal... Never happen before in an EPL match, a player scoring an intentional own goal. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>This reminds me of a match between Indonesia and Burma in an Asian cup semi-final match some time back... They both wanted to avoid Thailand so they decided to lose but nobody wanted to score... so when one team attacked, the defenders would move away so that the other team can score but the striker shoot out on purpose.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>In the end, can't remember what exactly happened, i think the indonesian scored an own goal and they were celebrating cos they lost... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Do any of you here remember that match?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Gallas hits back over Chelsea's 'own goal' claims</strong><br><br>French defender William Gallas has accused Chelsea of 'hiding behind false accusations' after being stunned by his former club's claim that he threatened to score an own goal.<br><br>Gallas, who joined Arsenal on deadline day in a cash-plus-player deal that saw England left-back Ashley Cole move in the opposite direction, denied making the threat and said the Barclays Premiership champions 'lacked class'.<br>The French defender, currently preparing for his country's Euro 2008 qualifier against Italy, revealed he would explain his reasons for quitting Stamford Bridge at an 'appropriate' time.<br>Gallas was forced to respond after Chelsea, in an unprecedented move, issued a statement which alleged Gallas refused to play against Liverpool in last season's FA Cup semi-final and against Manchester City at the beginning of the current campaign.<br>The club insisted that he threatened to score an own goal, get himself sent-off or make deliberate mistakes if Mourinho picked him for the home clash against City.<br><strong>But Gallas declared: 'I am surprised and shocked by these remarks.<br>'I never said that I would score an own goal. I was very firm in my will to leave, that is clear, and I will explain at the appropriate time why.</strong><br>'If people want to hide behind these eccentric charges to explain my departure instead of assuming their responsibilities in front of their supporters, then they can do.<br>'All this is very, very petty on behalf of Chelsea. But at the same time, coming on behalf of its new leaders, that does not surprise me. Even if Chelsea has much money, its new leaders lack class.'<br>Meanwhile, Chelsea have accused the French Football Federation of prolonging a row over Claude Makelele's international selection by deliberately inflaming a situation that is set to be resolved.<br>The Premiership champions came under renewed criticism from France coach Raymond Domenech and defender Lilian Thuram after Mourinho had accused Domenech of treating Makelele like a `slave' for not allowing him to quit international football.<br>Chelsea claim Domenech did not understand Mourinho's use of the word as a metaphor to highlight Makelele's situation.<br>A Chelsea statement read: 'Ill-considered comments regarding Claude Makelele's international career continue to come from the French camp, in particular Lilian Thuram, and the French national team coach, Raymond Domenech.<br>'Thuram and Domenech fail to understand Josi Mourinho's comments regarding `slavery' which were purely a metaphor to illustrate the Makelele problem, a figure of speech rather than a literal comparison with slavery as a social and political issue.<br>'As a result of their failings, deliberately inflammatory comments will only cloud a problem which is on its way to being resolved.'<br>Makelele had informed the FFF federation he wanted to retire from international duty after their World Cup final defeat by Italy.<br>This decision was reinforced by a letter to the FFF which was faxed to their HQ on August 22 - two days prior to his latest call-up.<br>However, Domenech threatened to have Makelele suspended for up to four domestic games by world governing body FIFA if he failed to join up with his international team-mates.<br>Chelsea now hope that Makelele will be allowed to retire after their Euro 2008 qualifier against Italy which the midfielder may miss after suffering an injury in the 3-0 win over Georgia on Saturday.<br><br>From Soccernet.</div>

Thinking Gallas could betray his team-mates is scandalous.<br><br>'I am disappointed that people could think or suppose that. William proved in the past and today that he is a true defender, it is scandalous thinking that of him.<br><br>'I am happy because I do nothing in this case, it is a problem between Arsenal and Chelsea but I can say we burst out laughing with William.<br><br>'It was funny to see that from Chelsea. William is not disturbed by that. He trained as a great champion.'<br><br>Gallas is unlikely to face any action from the Football Association after allegedly threatening to score in his own net.<br><br>The allegations, if substantiated, could have put the French defender in line for a Football Association charge of bringing the game into disrepute but the FA played down suggestions they would become involved in an issue that would be difficult to prove either way.<br><br>Gallas is alleged to have made his threat in a meeting with Mourinho and in front of other witnesses and while Chelsea have made this public, the champions are not planning to supply the FA with any statements from individuals.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Arsenal star to fight Chelsea's own goal claims<br>By John Cross </strong><br><br>WILLIAM GALLAS is ready to sue Chelsea after reacting furiously to the club's unprecedented attack on him.<br><br>Arsenal defender Gallas was last night said to be "angry" at Chelsea's claim that he threatened to score an own goal if they refused to sell him.<br><br>The enraged French defender is now consulting his lawyers after categorically denying Chelsea's allegations.<br><br>He said: "I am surprised and shocked by Chelsea's comments. I never said that I would score an own goal if I had to play for Chelsea."<br><br>And a source close to Gallas said: "He is considering his options but this is the worst sort of libel. I think he will talk to Arsene Wenger but he is also his own man and will not accept what Chelsea have alleged."<br><br>Last night Gallas received backing from players' union chief executive Gordon Taylor, who said: "You would have thought that Chelsea would have been more appreciative of the fact that William Gallas helped them win two league titles.<br><br>"But what I find even more strange is why on earth they have issued this statement. What purpose does it serve the game? William would have every right to take action but maybe it's better for him just to move on, which is what Chelsea should be doing."<br><br>The Football Association are also monitoring the situation and Arsenal privately want them to step in should the row get any worse. However, the FA are also likely to write to Chelsea to ask them not to take the matter further.<br><br>Chelsea and England skipper John Terry yesterday admitted that he has been aware of the Gallas fall-out for the past 12 months, and confessed that he's had his own stand-up rows with boss Jose Mourinho.<br><br>Terry said: "It has been ongoing for a year or so. There have been times when I've had to stick up for myself when he's had a go at me. I've had to do it for myself and for other players. "<br><br></div>
