              DreamFighters.com once again was able to get a hold of Alistair Overeem as he arrived back home in Holland, and we were able to ask him some very interesting questions, as were able to bring up some of the â€œDreamFighters.com Fan Questionsâ€� that we offered from our site.
              
              Again, we would like to take a moment to thank Bas Boon, Alistair Overeem, and Golden Glory for answering our callâ€™s so fast, as this will be our 5th interview with Alistair.
              
              DreamFighters.com: First off, great fight against Remy. You went toe to toe with the best K-1 striker in the world. - How did the fight go for you? Did you follow your game plan? Was Remy as hard as you thought?
              
                  Alistair Overeem: Well we knew he was going to stand there in his double defence if I would keep the pressure. I think our game plan worked, the pressure was good and I could land some good knees and uppercuts and leg kicks.
              
              DreamFighters.com: If you had to fight him again, what would you do different?
              
                  Alistair Overeem: I would throw some more punching combinations, I was to focussed on my game plan, but I actually knocked him down in round two with a right left right combo. 
              
              DreamFighters.com: Now looking forward, what is next for Alistair Overeem?
              
                  Alistair Overeem: I will going to focuss on MMA again and maybe defend my strikeforce belt soon in the United States.
              
              DreamFighters.com: Will you be fighting more in DREAM, or will you be fighting in the USA next?
              
                  Alistair Overeem: Dream and the USA
              
              DreamFighters.com: Have you decided on a promotion to fight with in the USA? (UFC, Affliction) ? Anymore meetings with Dana White and Golden Glory?
              
                  Alistair Overeem: My manager is bussy with negotiations, things go very well at this moment.
              
              DreamFighters.com: Mirko Crocop said he wants to fight you now in a K-1 match up. Would you accept that fight, and what are your thoughts on it?
              
                  Alistair Overeem: He should fight me under dream rules and finish what we started instead of wanting me to fight in his cellar and now again under different rules.
              
              DreamFighters.com: So you are saying you are open to fighting him again?
              
                  Alistair Overeem: Yes, anytime!
              
              DreamFighters.com: (Fan Question) You and Remy seemed to have fun at the K-1 Presser. Do you always try to plan and play head games with the person you are fighting?
              
                  Alistair Overeem: Not really, but it has been sucha hot item that I thought it was funny to do something with this. Fuji Tv even broadcast the oscar thing, so I think they like it.
              
              DreamFighters.com: (Fan Question) What was it liking growing up and living in Holland? Did you get into many fights as a kid growing up?
              
                  Alistair Overeem: Yes I was a restless child, lots of energy, my brother took me to a gym when I was 16.
              
              DreamFighters.com: (Fan Question) Many people and critics say you have been taking performance enhancing drugs. What do you have to say about that and to those people?
              
                  Alistair Overeem: I have been tested everytime everywere I fight, I have gained weight because I always have been a heavyweight. I was about 103 kg when loosing 10kg to fight at 93 kg/205 lbs. After my last fight in the states I gained about 4 kg per year. But its still easy for me to loose 10kg or gain quickly. 
              
              DreamFighters.com: (Fan Question) Alistair, we all want to see you fight Fedor. Do you think this will happen in 2009 or 2010?
              
                  Alistair Overeem: I would love to fight him on NYe 2009 in Japan or affliction, its fine by me.
              
              DreamFighters.com: Alistair, thank you once again for speaking to us. Is there anyone you would like to thank?
              
                  Alistair Overeem: I would like to thank all my fans and my trainingspartners at Golden Glory, my trainers and managers. peace!
