United's reserve won the QUADRUPLE last season and is currently 2nd in the reserve league.<br><br><a href="http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA%2D9A47%2D47BC%2DB069%2D3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=175222" rel="nofollow">Click here to verify.</a><br><br>Anyway, Only 4-5 players from Chelsea are not first team but the rest are more or less from the first team. Do you think players would join the club to think that u're bought just to play in the reserve?<br><br>The English league is different from Spanish La Liga so be it. How would you like to see a Chelsea A team vs Chelsea B team and there're lots of injury problems? Also, players will not get the chance to play for the first team if they're selected for the 2nd string cos technically speaking, these are 2 different teams. Coaches would like to have their own set of players instead of having to "pass them around".<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the reason why mourinho has spoken is because we all know his reserves are made up of internationals and do not come cheap. with such tight competition in the main first 11, its definitely a while before the reserves are given a chance to play on the field in the permiere league. we all know that a long absence in a football player will not do him much good or for his club and maybe mourinho might be starting to feel and understand that his reserve international team is rotting away slowly if not given a chance to really play competitively on the field.<br><br>As for the transfer of schev, i guess we are slowly getting the picture that it was more of a Roman who wanted schev than mourinho..</div>
