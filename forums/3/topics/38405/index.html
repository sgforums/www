What you usually see as "gymnastics" is Artistic Gymnastics and/or Rhythmic Gymnastics. These are competitive sports. There are a few more sports with the term "gymnastics" in them. That is because these sports developed from the system of exercises called gymnastics as described above.<br><br>Q) Do I need to learn gymnastics?<br>A) Yes, it will help you in whatever sports you are involved in.
