            <div class='col-md body'>theres a shortage of football fields in singapore for our youths to play football on.even there is,its located far far away etc marina bay.other than that,good fields are either govt property(which means you cant set foot on the field) or those of clubs or need to pay for it (etc the cage which is really expensive) those are for rich kids.but the fact is that most singapore teens or kids cant afford to pay that much just to play football.so it results in hdb void deck football or even playing at multi-purpose hall which is illegal which most of you dont know.my friend got caught playing soccer at a multi-purpose hall and got a warning by some hdb officals or something.furthermore i dont see any talent scouts around looking for talents are hdb streetsoccer courts.these courts are poorly maintained and is always very dirty and in unplayable conditions.so whats the use of hiring foreign coachers to coach these 'talented' players in the national team when theres much more talented players unearthed.i remember once some  one said singapore can get in to the world cup by 2010?haha dream on man.you think winning a tiger cup means you're champions of asia huh?if nothing is to be done,singapore can Never get into the world cup or even winning the AFC title.i myself is a football player.but because of lacking of football courts and fields i gave up football.worst still my hdb area doesnt have a football court or field which means i have to travel far to play football and resulting in arriving home very late at around 7pm.theres one more reason to i gave up football thats because of my school.the football cca did not let me in cause they are full.but when i watched one of their training,i swear most of them are really lousy.i am way better than them and i cant play.screw local football,viva epl</div>
