            <div class='col-md body'>I think TS is right in saying we blew the chance of hosting the Asian Cup. Now that we are champs of ASEAN, we should start pit ourselves against Asian's best, and see how far are we from being the top 5 nations in Asia.<br><br>If I were 2 base it on the way we play Australia last sat, i would say its encouraging. For the first 45 mins, we created chances. I would say the turning point came when Harry Kewell was subbed on when we were 1-0 down. Seems as if the Singapore team suddenly became awe-struck by the Liverpool player. Kewell created a lot of chances after he came on, and that's why we lost 3-0 in the end.<br><br>1 thing that make me worry though, is how we go down a little too easy. Was it me or were the Singapore players being carried off more times on the stretcher than I care 2 remember? It could have been due 2 the fact we are playing our 3rd game in less than 1 week, or due to the fatigue that is setting in. Either way, we still have 2 improve on our phsyique a little more.</div>

Picture Khairul Amri against Mark Viduka. I wasn't surprised many of them got bumped off so easily.<br><br>Have any of you ever played soccer with big, hulking guys? All things in skill and fitness being fair, the little guy will always be at a disadvantage. It's so easy to just get bumped off the ball when someone much bigger is running alongside you chasing for it too.<br><br>Height is one thing ; slimness of build is another. Roberto Carlos and Diego Maradonna were some short-arse players but had robust and stout builds to offset that.<br><br>I would say that slim guys like Amri have to spend a little more time in the gym bulking up to complement his fairly decent football flair.</div>
