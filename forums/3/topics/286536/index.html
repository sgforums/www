            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO, robinson should definitely be blamed. In such a crucial match where you cant afford to lose, you should palm the ball out for a corner. Robinson have palmed the ball directly in front of him, giving free goals to opponents, that it is so laughable. I think any schoolboys with a bit of predatory instinct can score such a goal when the ball is right of the goal. I bet that if i was in that position, i would have at least 50% chance of scoring, let alone a professional football. BTW, paul robinson should also have saved the penalty since he dived the right way but as you can see, paul robinson can never save a penalty as diving one direction is just a formality to him.<br><br>Gerrard should also be blamed i guess since he missed some very good chances.<br><br>McClaren should be blamed too since he shouldnt put lescott and he believe in paul robinson.</div>
