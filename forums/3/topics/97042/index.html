            <div class='col-md body'>Hi folks.... Football in S'pore has become overwhelmingly popular during the last 2 to 3 years thanks to the EPL. However, the standards have not improved at all. I believe if Singapore is to make it BIG in football, many barriers need to be obliterated.<br><br>First is the accessibility of football fields. In order to get access to almost every football field, there is a sum of money to be paid. 'FOC' fields are extremely rare in Singapore.<br><br>Secondly, there are too many rules everywhere. Just look at the third world countries like Nigeria, Cameroun, Brazil, etc. Kids play soccer (and maybe any other sport) in the streets, on any empty fields, etc. Here, the moment you start doing these sort of things, you will be chased out or complaints will come from everywhere.<br><br>Thirdly, Singapore teams definitely need more support from their own people.<br><br>Well, there are many more reasons why S'pore can't make it to the highest level in Football presently, unless they look at the root of the issue and buid up from there.<br><br>Cheers!<br><br>Club M Singapore</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it's not that there aren't many fields. Even if there're fields, the clubs don't bother to do scouting.<br><br>Many Singapore players doesn't have the basics (ball control, passing, long pass.. etc.) Why ? Simple. No one train them since young. In the SLeague, the youngest age-group is Under-16. Whereas Wayne Rooney break into the EPL at the age of 16! See the difference. The solution is ... we should start training kids at around the age of 6 to 8. Basics need to be learn from young. It's the same as learning Maths. If you don't know what is 2 + 2 ... then don't bother try out differentiation or integration. Similarly, if you can't control a ball or have the proper technique of kicking, then how to play professional football ?<br><br>But I still can't understand why the FAS didn't even think about training kids from young instead of starting from the Under-15 onwards. Hopefully the Sports School is our answer.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Singapore team need more support. Yeah it's true they need more support. But support will come if they can play to delight the fans. If you want support, then you need to have all the attributes of being a footballer. Agrree? Fans want to watch good football. Not lousy ones. Cos fans pay money to watch the games.</div>

Why are we still not successful??<br><br>1) Players earn so much money, but no fitness.<br>How many time do we see players walking in the field like donkeys? We pay to watch horses run.<br><br>2) The local game too slow paced.<br>All bound to fitness.<br><br>3) Our 'professional' players are not 'professional'?<br>Up till now, I dunch even know who play in the national team...

Jalan Besar stadium is suppose to be the National Football Academy. Agree? But who's occupying the stadium instead? Answer = Young Lions, a team with foreigners and an overage player. Yeah they did well, but I still think the current crops are hopeless. I still think we need to invest more on youth as in Under 12, 10 and such.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First and foremost, in my humble opinion, Singapore Football is lacking of proper structure from the bottom of the organisation all the way to its facilities. www.fas.org.sg website is a good example to begin with. Its not updated and it is empty for goodness sake!<br><br>I'm a Singaporean playing amature league football here in Germany and from my personal experience, I agree we do lack facilities and proffessional organisers.<br>If you have the chance to travel to the Southern part of Germany, you will be surprised to see small villages provided with a football pitch with 6 lighting post in the middle of nowhere solely meant for the small clubs in the villages to train throughout the season. Mind you, these football pitches are situated in almost every town and villages in Germany. Some of which are located in the middle of a corn field or in between the mountain ranges. In the club I play in, we have 1 synthetic pitch for wet seasons and more than 12 official grounds.(Grass/Clay)<br>Once again, from my humble opinion, having a proper football pitch is important for modern football players. If you watch European football , you can see how often the players shoots at a long range with great confidence. They wouldnt have done so with confidence if there wasn't a high fence behind the goalpost during training.<br>For us Singaporeans, if we train shooting with full blast somewhere in Singapore, most probably we might end up picking up the ball on the street most of the time.<br>Nevertheless, if the Japanese can build a football court on the rooftop of a building due to lack of space, why the heck can't we even play football in the basketball court or under the void deck when the 'garment' aims for 2010? Wishful thinking.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br>P.S,  If there is anyone who would like to know which football team I play with, feel free to PM me. I would not like to be associated with Singapore football in any case. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree with u .. was on holiday in Denmark, then Sweden, then Norway .. I see football pitch all over .. not just football pitch, QUALITY football pitch for anyone to use .. Will this ever happen in Singapore?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  So sad .. Play under void deck, Garment put nails on the wall. Play on fields available, chances are you will be chased out. Play at basketball court, the basketball players will want a fight. And guess what?

            <div class='col-md body'>Lets not talk about money. Lets talk about what the Garment-the Ministry of Sports whatever, whatever and its sports association are so good at. Propaganda...I'm not surprised if you don't realise this....you probably notice it if you live abroad...Well, yes propaganda is the basic medium which makes Singapore what it is today.You see Buissness leagues, you heard about Prime leagues...we've heard about 7 aside matches in Sentosa, town council matches and organisers from the PAP (for e.g Lee hsien Loong Cup) coming up with 1 day competitions but do you regularly see it in the newspapers?Well why not?SPH is a filthy rich giant and why not? Imagine reading this on the Monday Newspaper in the local sports section. Team Kampong boys striker/karang guniman 'Lim Ah-seng scores  a hatrick for his newborn baby'. Common people on the news, a pride for the neighbourhood. Then again, before Lim Ah-seng appears on the morning paper he should have his signature on a club which is registered with the FAS body.It would also be wonderful if the players are covered by health insurance just like in Germany. We do see fellow mid 30's working class Singaporeans complete with jerseys (their own pocket money) self-organised playing against another team on a sunny morning Sun. Why not set up a league for this real semi-professionals who don't neccessarily play for bets but just for fun unlike the S-league. Get these little kampong players official playing grounds and training timings, get them recognised by FAS as a club which plays for e.g North Division Lower League.Round up all the hardcore football players in bishan park. Then the talks of giving referee clinic will come, coaching clinics and slowly, since these players are working class players, advertising sponsorship will naturally come by. Instead, our tax money went to the building of a Sports School of excellenece which is as wishful thinking as Goal 2010. If our typical athletic lifestyle wannabe Kampong boys does not have the sense of belonging and support of the garment from a lower level of foundation, why aim for a sports school just because Australia or some other sporting nations have their own? A sporting nation begins with small clubs such as the ones I suggested. Not with an expensive sports school I believe. These sports school is just another one of those many propaganda tool to attract foreign athletes  and finally add in to our ageing population. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Tell me your views.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Simple. TNP and Straits Times want easy life. Why bother go down to stadiums to make reports on the Sleague/Prime League/NFL matches when they can stay at their office and browse through the internet (Planetfootball.com/Soccernet.com) and copy paste onto their newspaper for sports readers to read about English Premier League or Italian League the next day. They just can't be bothered at all about local football. The only thing I've seen on papers about local football are criticisms. Footballers are overpaid. So too are these newspapers editors/reporters. Easy job man. Just copy paste from internet and tadaaaaaaa~~ newspaper is ready to be sold the next day.<br><br>But have to salute Ernest Luis of TNP. Like how he bother to go to Portugal to cover the Euro 2004, he actually did cover some Sleague/Singapore Cup matches.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Good job!<br><br></div>
