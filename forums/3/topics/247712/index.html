            <div class='col-md body'>JOSE MOURINHO led Chelsea into the Champions League semi-finals Â— then admitted he may not be at the club next season.<br><br>Michael EssienÂ’s stunning last-minute strike saw off Valencia.<br><br>But with owner Roman Abramovich snubbing one of the BluesÂ’ best-ever European shows, the axe clearly still hangs over the managerÂ’s head.<br><br>Mourinho said: Â“What I want is to  remain in England with Chelsea. I love training the club and I want to stay. But you donÂ’t always get what you wish for.<br><br>Â“If IÂ’m not the manager of Chelsea then I want to train another team.<br><br>Â“This was a great performance, especially in the second half against a good side in a difficult stadium when we were down 1-0.<br><br>Â“At one point we were out of the competition. But our response was amazing.Â”<br><br>Fernando Morientes had given Valencia the lead on aggregate after 32 minutes, with Andriy Shevchenko levelling seven minutes into the second half.<br><br>Skipper John Terry admitted Mourinho had given his players a half-time rollicking.<br><br>He said: Â“We got a kick up the backside.Â”<br><br>But Mourinho added: Â“It was not one of those hot ones. I was just telling them to be strong mentally and not think about losing or going out of the competition.<br><br>Â“We changed it tactically in the second half, with Essien moving to right-back where he was more attacking and with the creativity of Joe Cole coming on. We were very determined. To do that away from home against a good team was a great feat.<br><br>Â“At the end I was telling my staff to get the sports drinks ready for extra-time. Then Essien scored. When we lost him a month ago, it was a big, big loss. But he told me he was ready to come back for this game.Â”<br><br>The Ghana star will miss the semi-final first leg, though, after being booked.<br><br>Mourinho insisted he had no thoughts of avenging the defeat at the same stage by Liverpool two years ago if, as expected, the two clubs meet again.<br><br>He said: Â“Revenge is not for me. Not in football and not in my life. But itÂ’s a tie we will start from behind if we face them.<br><br>Â“Why? That is simple. Liverpool play only for the Champions League and Chelsea for this competition, the FA Cup and the Premiership.<br><br>Â“We also have Essien suspended for the first leg and others on two yellow cards.Â”<br><br><a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2002390000-2007160538,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2002390000-2007160538,00.html</a></div>
