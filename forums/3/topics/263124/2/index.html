            <div class='col-md body'>Contrary to many beliefs, the young gunners will likely step up to the challenge even greater now after the departure of Henry.<br><br>Many said that Arsenal will go flat w/o Patrick Viera in the middle of the park when he joined Inter but Fabregas stepped up and look how much his price tage has risen. Fabregas could walk into any top teams.<br><br>Now that Henry has left... it is up to van Persie or Adebayor to step up to lead the attack.<br><br>Essentially, the current Arsenal squad is still very young but the talents are there.. the youthful exuberence are there and they will still pose threats against the big teams. What they seemed lacking is tactical discipline.</div>
