It also goes without saying they have the makings of having a great campaign - still, I wouldn't see the eventual champion coming from outside Germany, Argentina and England.<br><br>Their defence had already improved markedly in Japan/Korea 4 years ago when Eriksson took charge, but this time around, they've just got the entire package - without a doubt, they have the best defence and midfield in the tournament for me. 4 years on, with players like Ferdinand, Terry, Cole, Lampard, Gerrard and Owen having gained so much more experience at both club and international level, you've got to feel they're better equipped to succeed this time - and yes, the defence will be the cornerstone of their success should that happen.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what is this lack of service that owen is moaning about. football these days is about self serivce. given the midget that he is, any ball that comes into the box he is always second best. the defenders will over shadow him. crouch is a bloody clown, a disgrace to the spider community. the ultimate blame comes down to sven, and mclaren is not the answer.</div>
