Why do they have this type of mentality, maybe because they dont watch other leagues therefore leading to the frog in the well mentality or maybe its because they felt they are a far superior people than the rest of the world (mainly due to historical reasons), or maybe they will think that they were the first to introduce football to the world therefore they felt they have the divine right to be the best and to be the one and only country to win the WC.<br><br>But sadly for those people, things dont turn out the way they want to be.
