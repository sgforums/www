            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, so I know the fashionable thing is to overreact to what we see, and thus assume Argentina are certain to win the World Cup - having probably overcome the mighty Spain in the final - and that England are going to crash out in ignominy sooner rather than later after a good walloping by a team "we should be beating". But can we try and keep a bit of perspective here please - we're only 10 days into the tournament for crying out loud.<br><br>As well as Argentina played - and yes, they were brilliant against Serbia &amp; Montenegro and would arguably beat Brazil at their best if they repeated that performance - how many teams have ever dominated every game at a World Cup? Answer: only one - Brazil in 1970. Elderly Brazilians argue that the 1958 team was their greatest ever, but even they struggled to beat Wales - yes, Wales - in the quarter-finals. And perhaps the most one-sided tournament of them all was in 1954, when Ferenc Puskas's Hungarians ran riot all the way up to the final before being shocked by West Germany, a team they had already annihilated 8-3 in the group stages.<br><br>You see, it doesn't matter how well you play in the first round as long as you qualify. The final week of the tournament is when you need to peak, as the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final are played out. It's very, very rare that a team performs at its best for seven successive games.<br><br>The Czech Republic have already proved this theory. They looked like world-beaters against a United States team that sat off them in the opening game; but after a couple of injuries, their creaking, aged legs were run ragged by an energetic, nothing-to-lose Ghana team just five days later. The Czechs now face a real struggle to reach the last 16.<br><br>Spain - who, incidentally, have only three strikers in their squad, one of whom is recovering from injury and hasn't scored since before Christmas (ring any bells?) - face a different dilemma. They will probably stick half a dozen more goals past Tunisia and Saudi Arabia after their dismantling of Ukraine, but they might then have to beat France and Brazil just to make the final four. Is anyone seriously suggesting this is likely, just because they outshone their two potential opponents in their 2006 debut?<br><br>Which brings us to England. No, they haven't yet set the world alight with exciting, free-flowing football. But they have achieved their goal - easing their way into the competition with two wins, which is more than you can say about France. The key is that England haven't had to play well to get to where they are. Those teams who have dazzled us - the Argentinians, Spaniards, Italians (against Ghana) and Dutch - have either been in one of the two groups of death, or have opened with their toughest group fixture. So they've had to be flying from the start, or else they'd be flying home within a fortnight of arriving.<br><br>England, on the other hand, have had the luxury of knowing they could stay "in second gear", as Steven Gerrard put it, and still make the knockout stages. And, if all goes to plan, a second-round encounter with Ecuador should ensure the clutch isn't required more than once before England meet one of the big guns in the quarter-finals.<br><br>That gives Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen nearly two more weeks to regain their sharpness (though if Owen's header against Trinidad &amp; Tobago had gone the other side of the post, we probably wouldn't be questioning his form); Gary Neville's calf time to recover; and Ashley Cole's body the chance to rebuild the speed and stamina that marked his excellence at Euro 2004.<br><br>In addition, the partnership of John Terry and Rio Ferdinand is finally beginning to look equal to the sum of its parts - Paul Robinson has had as few shots to save as any goalkeeper who's played two matches so far - and their understanding should become even more cohesive in the next two games.<br><br>As for the midfield, they will doubtless be helped by Rooney's return just ahead of them, linking them to the striker. With regards to Frank Lampard, widely criticised for missing several chances, it would be more concerning were he not getting into goalscoring positions. In fact, he's had more attempts at goal (13) than any other player at the World Cup. Joe Cole has looked England's most creative attacking threat, while David Beckham's right boot is still as productive as ever, having set up all three of England's goals.<br><br>The balance of the Lampard-Gerrard axis in the middle is an obvious worry and still needs to be corrected; but with Michael Carrick or Owen Hargreaves ready to drop anchor, Peter Crouch surprisingly showing he can upset defenders at international level, and Aaron Lennon a menace coming off the bench, England now have plans B, C and D in reserve should their style need to be switched.<br><br>I'm not saying England will win the World Cup, but I do think they have at least an even money shot of beating any team you put them up against. They are the opposite to flat-track bullies in that they look terrible against lesser sides, yet raise their game when they meet the more powerful nations who don't just drop deep and defend - to counter the oft-cited losses to Brazil, France and Portugal, remember they have beaten Argentina, Switzerland, Germany, Croatia, Denmark and Turkey in competitive matches during Sven-Goran Eriksson's reign.<br><br>The great thing about this World Cup is that, while the group phase has given us attacking intentions and many superb goals, all the big teams are making their way to the knockout stages, which promise several truly memorable games. When these top sides go head-to-head, then England can acclaim the world's finest. Not yet.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've lost count of the people I have come across who have a knack of jumping on bandwagons - if they needed any reminding, you need look no further than the Germans. The Germans won 2 of their 3 World Cups playing a final in which they were massive underdogs(although both times it happened on home soil).<br><br>In '54, they dismantled a Puskas-inspired Hungary who had been odds-on to win it; in '74, they stopped the Dutch whose brand of 'Total Football' saw them stroll past opponents at a canter. Even at Italia'90, it was hardly a stroll in the park against a Maradona-inspired Argentina and back at Japan/Korea '02 when the Germans were widely touted as the worst German team to have ever turned up at the World Cup finals, they made the final against all odds. How could anyone discount this lot? At the very least, it's certainly a very succinct case in point that the most entertaining team doesn't necessarily always win.<br><br>Like I've said earlier, England are not overwhelming favourites at this tournament, but they've certainly got a team to give anyone - and I mean anyone - a run for their money and if luck is on their side, there is every chance they could go all the way(they are certainly better equipped than their predecessors over the last generation).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

England certainly do stand a great chance of winning it. But as for those fans who only know about England and their players and nothing about others, well they have the same mentality of the English before the 50s.<br><br>The English of the pre 50s era, thought that they were the best and no one else were their match, therefore they felt it was of no sigificance to play in the WC. Well it was a case of a frog in the well. England was knocked out in the first round of the WC after agreeing to appear in their first ever WC tournament. Thier 1-0 defeat to the semi-amatuer US national team still remains today as one of the biggest shocks in WC history.<br><br>The English of today certainly do not have that mentality anymore after so many years of hurt.<br><br>But sadly, some of the fans of England of today, still have the frog in the well mindset. When England loses, they either blame the referee, or that the opponents were lucky instead of admitting that sometimes their opponents were indeed better than them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>
