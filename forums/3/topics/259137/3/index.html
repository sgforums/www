            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, before everyone continues jumping on the bandwagon of saying everything about Chelsea and their fans, please note that this thread is in response to what was posted in another thread and the post was specifically about Chelsea and donations. I can't remember which thread or post, but honestly, I'm too lazy to confirm where it was either.<br><br>This thread was started in retaliaion to that post and I find that post as pointless as the point this one is trying to make. Maybe because I don't take note of such donation news/events.<br><br>I can only say stop riding on it because it's about Chelsea or any other club you dislike. Like somebody else has said, donations also want to fight. End of the day, the real fight if there is any, is on the pitch itself.<br><br>Also, there's no need to slam all other clubs and fans just to talk or brag about your own club. Post the news, but leave the silly comments out of it. Of course, it doesn't help that certain people have a reputation.<br><br>I'm surprised such a topic can have this number of pages by now. But really, overall, it's just Chelsea and a charity/donation event. A lot of other clubs/firms do charity events too. Stop panning it or over-glorifying it just because it is Chelsea.<br><br>That said, good to see some good being done, whoever it is by. Thanks, noted and move on. Since when was donations about inter-club rivalry as well?</div>
