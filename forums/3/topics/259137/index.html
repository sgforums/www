            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.chelsea.vitalfootball.co.uk/resource/teams/chelsea/35_b.jpg"><br>After a successful debut last week, famouscfc returns to the fold with a subject that is well worth exploring.<br><br>Chelsea have come in for a lot of criticism recently in the red-tops once again - this time regarding the Mayday for Nurses Campaign. It seems that a spokesperson for the campaign was shocked that 'not one single player from Chelsea` donated the equivalent of a days salary to help. Whilst on paper I was initially a little shocked to hear this, I feel the criticism was a little unjust.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Firstly, the very same spokeswoman failed to mention that club itself had made a donation which placed them 11th in the 'Premiership league table` of donations received for the cause. Not the best, but far from the worst. It should also be borne in mind that how that donation was composed hasn`t been released by the club - so actual proof that 'not one single player from Chelsea` has donated doesn`t, technically at least, exist.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Secondly, they failed to even mention the extensive charity work Chelsea already does. Many millions have been raised for Clic Sargent - including a high profile auction for Jose`s infamous 'Matalan` coat and other memorabilia. Similarly, various other local, national and even global charity events which the club has been involved in were ignored in both the reports and by the charity`s spokesperson. In addition the club has helped local schools in the community and has set up a Corporate and Social Responsibility Programme - one of the first clubs to do so.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">Indeed, several Chelsea players themselves also support various charities on a high-profile scale: Arjen Robben supports Benin; Andriy Shevchenko supports the SOS Children's Villages as a FIFA charity ambassador; Ballack is a United Nations special representative on HIV / AIDS prevention work; Joe Cole actively carries out charity work for Cystic Fibrosis; and Drogba recently became a UNICEF ambassador Additionally, there is the work the club are currently doing for 'Right to Play` where several representatives are currently in Ghana supporting the charity.</span><br><br>Main Point<br><span style="color: red;">In fact Chelsea and their players have actually raised more money for charity in the last year than any other UK based club by raising over Â£4million. Not one 'journalist` in the weekend`s papers picked up on this - simply using the opportunity to berate Chelsea for not being as generous as some other clubs towards this cause.</span><br><br>Of course, despite the anti-Chelsea quotes attributed to the Charity - and the subsequent articles in the tabloids - everyone wishes the Mayday for Nurses campaign the very best of luck.</div>
