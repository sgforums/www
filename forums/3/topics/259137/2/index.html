You happily called me a neutral when my post agreed with yours, but now change it around to suit your other agenda. The same thing with Stellazio, you compliment one moment then speak rubbish about him the next.<br><br>Like I said, if you didn't post rubbish, people wouldn't and can't say anything about you either.<br><br><strong>[quote]<span style="color: red;">when u slam others also never so HARSH PERVERT</span></strong>You sure? And I don't consider it harsh. But if you really think so, then maybe you can reflect on your posts. I make comments on you mainly because you do silly things in the first place. I do comment on the clonemaster as well, I don't think I'm kinder to him than to you.<br><br>In any case, instead of going about blaming everyone for everything, even your own silly posts, maybe you can do something about your posts instead. I concede you have improved, but you are still up to your antics from time to time.<br><br>I can't make it any clearer for you than I have in the past or anybody else, post your news but leave the snide remarks out. Stop needlessly slamming other clubs and other players.</div>
