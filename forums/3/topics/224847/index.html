No further statements on this matter will be made by the club before that time.'<br><br>The Hammers have lost five out of their last six Premiership matches including both games since Magnusson became chairman - a 4-0 at Bolton on Saturday which followed a 2-0 home defeat against Wigan. </span></div>

I don't like the word pressure, but it has increased.<br><br>"Alan raised the standards to a very high level last year and has possibly become a victim of his own success. That success was expected to be built upon but things outside of his control seemed to take over the football club with talk of new owners and the bringing in of two foreign players, possibly not at his (Pardew's) request, which seemed to destabilise things within that football club.<br><br>"But Alan's a very strong character and seemed to have pulled that around with the Arsenal victory. But unfortunately results haven't gone for him and as all managers will tell you, we are in a results business and in the Premiership that's the bottom line." </span></div>
