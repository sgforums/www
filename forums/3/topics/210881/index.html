            <div class='col-md body'>its a matter of playing system and confidence...<br>england set up and everton system is different...<br><br>with england...you are given only one chance per match to perform...since international matches are few and far compared to epl...<br><br>but with everton...if u can't score this week...there is always weekday match or the coming weekend fixtures...thus more chances to improve your touch and performance...<br><br>another reason could be players like johnson and bent are stars in their own team...but when they go to england...they are surpressed by players like gerrard..lampard and terry...so they tend to feel more laid back and confidence definately will drop too...no confidence=no goals..</div>

There are players like Lennon or even Gerrard.<br><br>Central midfield should put hargreaves and lampard.<br><br>For the left, I think that there is only 1 obvious choice, and that is joe cole. I think he is the only player who can dribble on the ball and create those scoring opportunities for the strikers...Downing also very one-dimensional.<br><br>Strikers, the squad should include darren bent and johnson. Don't forget about rooney too. and crouch, now that he is in hot form.</div></blockquote>i agree wif u! owen dun deserve a call-up! there are alot of strikers who definately deserve more chance than him. only prick like SGE selected players based on more caps in england shirt.<br><br>but one thing i disagree is u mentioned dat downing is 1-D, i feel downing is fast n more than team player comparing to j.cole.</div>

I saw how downing played in the wc2006 and he really looked very ordinary. The reason y he and richardson were picked was because they were left-footers, and there weren't many left-footers available in england.<br><br>Nowadays, some managers like playing right footer players on the left flank and left footer players on the right flank....Cuz most tactics involve cutting in from the wings and maybe try a shot or something.<br><br>Say Ronaldinho, Rosicky, joe cole or C.ronaldo on the left flank, and ppl who are left footers like robben on the right flank.</div>
