He declined and then declined again when I asked last week.<br><br>"He just wants to concentrate on playing for Manchester United and his family, which were the reasons for his decision when he retired from international football last time.<br><br>"I respect those decisions when he retired from international football and I don't expect to be asking him again.<br><br>"But the door is always open and I would never close it on Paul Scholes." </span></div>

John is a natural leader and when he says something everyone in the dressing room listens.<br><br>"I got to know John when I first went into the squad and he really impressed me. He is a great captain, a good leader and a good talker.<br><br>"He does things off the field and organises things behind the scenes that people don't see, but are appreciated by his team-mates.<br><br>"But first and foremost it is his inspiration on the field that lifts the lads. His 100 per cent attitude brings 1 the same response ' from his colleagues and now he is even chipping in with goals.<br><br>"If you aren't doing your job, he will let you know. If you are doing your job he will take the time out to praise you. You are always aware of his presence." </span><br><br>Masterstroke</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everton striker Andy Johnson has pulled out of the England squad due to injury.<br><br>The in-form forward has been forced to withdraw from the squad for the Euro 2008 qualifiers with Macedonia and Croatia with a hamstring problem.<br><br>Johnson picked up the injury in the closing stages of Saturday's 1-1 draw with Manchester City.<br><br>Charlton ace Darren Bent has been drafted in as Johnson's replacement.<br><br>England boss Steve McClaren admitted it was a major blow to lose Johnson for the two games.<br><br>"Andy's out of the games against Macedonia and Croatia with a hamstring injury which he picked up in the last minute against Manchester City on Saturday," McClaren told the FA's official website.<br><br>"It's a real blow because he's made a massive impact already with Everton this season and I've been hugely impressed by him. He's got such a great attitude and is a constant threat to any defence.<br><br>"He was certainly knocking very hard on the door for a place in the team, so it's a disappointment to lose him.<br><br>"However, I've spoken to Peter Taylor and I can confirm that Darren Bent will now join the senior squad when we meet tomorrow.<br><br>"We're fortunate that we are able to call Darren up from the Under-21's. He's already got experience of been involved in several senior squads and he's a player with excellent ability and a real goal threat."</div>
