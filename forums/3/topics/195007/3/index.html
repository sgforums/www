Ah... your 4th, sorry but please enlighten me who could pay 30M for shev? Who can outbid chelsea from la liga or liga la? Don't make me laught ok, i am expecting a serious answer... and if you want to say Real madrid or Barce, don't waste your time cos no one will belief you... Roman can buy the 2 clubs combine let alone the players.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Roman is worth about 15B, the la liga club at most 1B each! </div></blockquote>ahh, let me phrase it more simpler for you to understand.. btw, chelsea is still not the most profitable club in the world.. even bayern munich earns more every year<br><br>and RM has a big kitty every season which can reach as high as 50m and turnover often are far greater than that..

I know they have a big kitty every season which can reach as high as 50m... But what is 50M compare to Roman's 15B... To Roman that amount is "kitten" Can Real M buy shev for 30M answer cannot what, where they can spend this kind of money on a soon to be 30 yrs old player... But Chelsea CAN. Can Real M offer Ballack the salery chelsea give him? Answer also we know lah, no need to say liao... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Like i said earlier, Roman can buy the 2 clubs combine let alone the players.<br><br>And what is this Robson go to newcastle people follow him? What are you talking about... you yourself say "Times have changed" why are you still talking about Robson... he retired long time ago liao remember... Who did he develop at newcastle anyway? Just name me 3 lah.. or nvm 1 can also.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Another mistake you said, <strong>bellamy took a wage cut from blackburn</strong>. Bellamy didn't take a cut from blackburn, he took a cut to join liverpool... Blackburn offerred him more.<br><br>And lastly, don't you worry my friend... my vessels are in good health and so is my keyboard... Do reply cos i am enjoying it.

As I have also pointed out to you that they were all bought after they had passed 18 yrs old, so not developed by NewcastleÂ’s youth academy. Also, Kieron Dyer was a Ruud Gullit signing in 1999 and not RobsonÂ’s.<br><br>If they came to the club after they have passes 18 yrs old, how can you consider them develop by clubÂ’s youth academy? Jenas joint Newcastle at 19 and Dyer at 21.<br><br>The other 2 milner &amp; brambleÂ… Milner, all I said was no need to mention, he is not even worth it. The fact is, I donÂ’t even know who the hell is this fellow so how to say? And BrambleÂ… I also donÂ’t know who he is! If they are such a great prodigy as you have claimed, then at least we should have heard of them rightÂ… All I know is bramble sounds like a fruit to me and not a football player.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br></div>
