Spurs has never even finish top 3  for the last decade and never even played in the CL... If Carrick get a chance to go to man u, he will probably ask for a transfer!</div>

Spurs will still be below man u come next year! Just b'cos they came in 5th this year doesn't mean they can do better next year, for all you know they can alway go down to 8th place with newcastle &amp; bolton doing better.</div>

While at it, might as well say Silvestre before smith also chose man u and also the recent one of Vidic who liverpool was so keen to get but the moment he knew man u also wanted him, he didn't even give a second thought to liverpool's interest.<br><br>And back to Smith, the guy choose to go to man u instead of liverpool not because they offerred him more money but because he wanted to play for the club despite the fact that he knews the Leeds fans will not be happy. It shows you how much more he wanted to play for man U and not for liverpool.<br><br>When players have a choice, they will go for the better club, one that they feel is bigger and will give them a better future. And what is this man u average age is 29? Go an get your facts right first... Man u only got about 6 players over 29 out of 32 players and most of them are under 26 and quite a number 21 and below, so go and check first before you make another false remark.<br><br>Another of your stupid remark, "manu will never be able to outbid chelsea anymore" I ask you who can outbid chelsea in this world? Spurs?... Liverpool? don't forget that liverpool was outbid by chelsea for Damien Duff too. These 2 clubs can't even outbid Man u... sigh... so don't compare. And again, "their youth academy don't seemed to be producing any more world class players" Its not so simple ok, just ask liverpool who have they produce recently? At least Man U still have good young players coming out... Wes Brown, John O'shea, Kieran Richardson, Rossi, Phillip Bardsley... Some of these young guys have already played for their country and i don't mean under 21s ok!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by zocoss:</div><div class="quote_body">Haha... you are still feeling bitter over Smith choosing man u instead of liverpool... cos its been so long ago alrdy and you are still bitching over it here... While at it, might as well say Silvestre before smith also chose man u and also the recent one of Vidic who liverpool was so keen to get but the moment he knew man u also wanted him, he didn't even give a second thought to liverpool's interest.<br><br>And back to Smith, the guy choose to go to man u instead of liverpool not because they offerred him more money but because he wanted to play for the club despite the fact that he knews the Leeds fans will not be happy. It shows you how much more he wanted to play for man U and not for liverpool.<br><br>When players have a choice, they will go for the better club, one that they feel is bigger and will give them a better future. And what is this man u average age is 29? Go an get your facts right first... Man u only got about 6 players over 29 out of 32 players and most of them are under 26 and quite a number 21 and below, so go and check first before you make another false remark.<br><br>Another of your stupid remark, "manu will never be able to outbid chelsea anymore" I ask you who can outbid chelsea in this world? Spurs?... Liverpool? don't forget that liverpool was outbid by chelsea for Damien Duff too. These 2 clubs can't even outbid Man u... sigh... so don't compare. And again, "their youth academy don't seemed to be producing any more world class players" Its not so simple ok, just ask liverpool who have they produce recently? At least Man U still have good young players coming out... Wes Brown, John O'shea, Kieran Richardson, Rossi, Phillip Bardsley... Some of these young guys have already played for their country and i don't mean under 21s ok!<br><br></div></blockquote>joker, if you wanna talk about players who reach prime at 23, every club will compete.. we're talking about 18 year old prodigies or even younger<br><br>so many years like 4 years, newcastle always snapped up players right in front of liverpool's face.. whose the bigger and better club now? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>times changed, SAF is not as attractive as he was before.. they would rather go to wenger, mourinho, jol, benitez to be nurtured<br><br>there is a team that can outbid chelsea, from la liga if you're clueless<br><br>and i'm pointing out some points and facts but apparently kids nowadays get very upset from online forum posts <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>bellamy took a wage cut, and i not sure whether arsenal got offer anot but manu and liverpool did offer while newcastle didn't get a chance because he signed in a record time <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Ah... your 4th, sorry but please enlighten me who could pay 30M for shev? Who can outbid chelsea from la liga or liga la? Don't make me laught ok, i am expecting a serious answer... and if you want to say Real madrid or Barce, don't waste your time cos no one will belief you... Roman can buy the 2 clubs combine let alone the players.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Roman is worth about 15B, the la liga club at most 1B each!</div>
