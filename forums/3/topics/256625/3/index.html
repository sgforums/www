Nadal's very quick on his feet too.. and his forehand is so powerful..<br><br>Federer's classy.. however he somehow came to this competition without much confidence I feel..

Damn predictable.<br>But give it your best shot..<br><br>Federer changed to combat this in the previous french open, by trying to go down the line, going to Nadal's backhand so as to negate. But Nadal using his speed, went around, and uses his forehands instead.<br><br>tennis is a game of brains, skills, but most importantly physique.<br>if you got speed, and power, you are 1/4 there already.<br><br>Rem, Nadal is a right-handed, but trained to use his left-hand for tennis by his uncle. To me, that's talent.<br><br></div>
