            <div class='col-md body'>Making waves in the Northern and Southern part of Malaysia, Red Sevens was participating in 2 tournaments over the same weekend, the former in Penang and the latter in Johor Bahru. In the No Mercy Paintball Challenge which was led by CALGAR (our 3 on 3 paintball expert) and two new players Â– KEV and LUCKY, Red Sevens took part in a tournament comprising of 24 teams. The Red Sevens junior managed to clinich a top 8 ranking by qualifying for the Quarter Finals.<br><br>The team managed to pull off great performances in their qualifying games against Team 69ers, Vendetta Alpha, Lost Boys and Maybank Invaders. The Red Sevens utilized a reverse V formation with two fronts pushing up the left and right flanks with a back man spotting for them. This strategy led to much success. The team garnered a total of 291 points to come in 2nd placing in their group to qualify for the next round.<br><br>During the Quarter Finals against team 300, the Red Sevens tried a new strategy of going strong on the snake side, but unfortunately, due to inexperience, lost the first game. In the following game, the team went back to basics of crossing lanes and forced a tie, creating a hope in the running for the Semi Finals. However, in the final round of the Quarter Finals Â– the team ran out of pellets and eventually lost.<br><br>No Mercy 3 on 3 Paintball Challenge Team Roster<br><br>LUCKY     (Back)<br>CALGAR   (Front)<br>KEV         (Front)<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RED SEVENS PLAY WITH NXE PRODUCTS: www.nxepaintball.com</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RED SEVENS TRAIN AT OCTVILLE GOLF AND COUNTRY CLUB: armourpaintball@gmail.com</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One of my colleagues is going to have a birthday paintball session at TAG at Orchid Country Club - she has never played paintball before so she asked me for "tips on how to play paintball".<br>It got me to thinking what sort of "advice" I was going to give a newbie player like her.<br><br>Whenever I teach people how to play paintball- I tell them "whatever I teach you- when they yell 'game on'- you will forget everything I tell you".<br><br>The first thing I would tell her is to wear long sleeve top and pants and don't be terrified about getting hit- you will get hit and it'll smart for a bit but your adrenaline would be pumping you wouldn't feel it.<br><br>Ok lets break it down to 5 easy points to try to "remember"<br><br>1. RUN (dont walk) TO YOUR BUNKERS when the game starts. Run as far forward and as FAST as possible. Because you don't want to start all the way from the back when the other side starts shooting. Then it'll be harder to move up. The more ground you own the better chance of you winning the game.<br><br>2. Which leads me to the next thing which is to MOVE UP. All newbies will stay in their bunkers and firefight and waste pellets. You have to move up because sitting all the way at the back means you wont be able to shoot anything. DONT STAY AND GUN FIGHT with people you can't kill- you're wasting time and valuable pellets.<br>MOVE when you can- run to the next bunker when you can the more you and your team move up- the better chances you can kill somebody and win the game.<br><br>3. TALK- communicate - something which is drilled into every tournament player. All newbies will sit and keep their mouths shut. You have to communicate - tell your team where the other side is and where you guys are and co-ordinate your movements. Keeping your mouth shut will result is someone coming up and shooting everyone of you in the back without anyone knowing about it.<br><br>4. DONT STICK YOUR GUN OUT OF THE BUNKER. I friggin hate this because everyone does this after I specifically tell I tell them not to.<br>Any part of you gets hit- that includes your marker and your hopper - means that you're out. Sticking your gun out is invitation for people like me to shoot it. Come out - shoot and get yourself and your marker back into the bunker. Don't stay out long and don't come out at the same spot every time or you'll be come predictable and easy prey.<br><br>5. Lastly- BE USEFUL to your team. You are a valuable asset to your team. If you die - your friends will die and you'll all lose the game. Each and everyone of you have to BE USEFUL to your team. You have to either be shooting to kill, shooting to surpress the enemy, providing cover fire - or communicating to your team mates - make yourself useful. If you sit far at the back and don't shoot or are too far back to make any kills or provide cover fire- you're useless to your team. The guys up front will get killed and the otherside is going to come and bunker your ass - run up and shoot you point blank in your bunker.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WCA - world cup asia... many international teams from around the world come to malaysia for the WCA... South African Team Reaper... I heard 3 teams from Australia... Team Datis from Iran etc etc...<br><br>How much do they cost? Well it depends... Like golf, you have a vast price range depending on the quality and brand. You don't even need to buy one to play, you can just rent 'em...<br><br></div>
