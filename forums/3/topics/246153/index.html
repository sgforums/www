            <div class='col-md body'>How come? My friend ordered a VS2 and it was really cheap at only RM800 but it was crap and he had to return it. He ordered a Proto Matrix Rail - one bad idea to another because the PMR is just a problematic. Too many O-rings to maintain and damn hard to get into the marker to fix them.<br><br><img src="http://www.macdev.net/images/07-Cyborg-LHS-Black-Dust---.jpg"><br><br>This is my marker - the 07 Cyborg. Mine is "Stormtrooper" - white colour. My MacDev LegionAir tank just got in the shop and is waiting for me in KL - I can wait to get up there and it rip.<br><br>My team mates are in Australia at the moment- I'm hoping they will get MacDev Cyborgs while they're there... then we'll have some decent firepower. In the last tournament the only guy in our team with a Cyborg averaged 3 kills every game.<br><br><img src="http://www.macdev.net/images/07colours.jpg"></div>

I had a fair share of markers and the A-5 is by far the best.. Never did once had a problem with it. It's still going strong for me...<br><br>Yeah, i'm thinking of getting an ION as my 2nd marker or either that a side arm.. Like those CO2 pistols.<br><br>Btw, just got back from woodsball !

            <div class='col-md body'>We had a good time in JB- some of the JB teams heard that we were coming up to play so they all turned up hoping to get a game with is- one team was hoping we'd coach them.<br><br>The trip was mainly to scout the field - only 2 of us Red Sevens went and we brought 3 kids and a adult friend of mine came along. The ground was good no mud or scuffing despite the rain the night before. New Sup'air Bunkers - new Spyder Pilot house markers which shot pretty straight.<br><br>We met alot of JB players who were very nice and friendly- they came and introduced themselves. I guess we have a new place to practice and we have plenty of ready sparring partners.<br><br>Only draw back is that the place is pretty laid back- bunkers were not set up by the time we got there at 11am and safety....was not that great. Paint wasn't cheap too.</div>
