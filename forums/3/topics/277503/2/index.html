            <div class='col-md body'>Actually i don't find the title offensive at all...  If someone didn't mention it, i didn't even realise there was anything amiss with it. Anyway, Chelski isn't an offensive name i think, Cos its just a word/name most of the English Press use quite frequent to reflect it's a Russian own club... It not as though the TS call it Choa si (Smelly). This i would say is probably offensive but then again, some here have called Man utd, manure... Isn't it worse than Chelski?<br><br>Honestly, i don't see anything wrong with it... Recently Arsenal were also link to a Russian and the English Press came up with a name for them too... Gunnerskis...<br><br>Lets not be too sensitive over a name... its just for fun...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
