"He knows that and the club know he knows it too.<br><br>"Mourinho spent time at Barcelona and he also knows that he will not be as powerful in Spain as he is in England within the club.<br><br>"But he is the No.1 on the shortlist and Real feel he may be ready to move in the summer."<br><br>Real insiders insist that Fabio Capello has become a dead man walking.<br><br>His players appear to have decided to ignore any instructions and are demonstrating no passion for the cause, conceding five goals without reply in back-to back defeats by Recreativo Huelva and Deportivo. </span><br><br>Madrid under Mourinho will be an awesome squad</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i don't understand - whats wrong with the current manager at Real Madrid?<br><br>And seriously I don't think Mourinho will get it easy at Real Madrid.  Already, the culture is wrong at Real Madrid - where several players are designated 'untouchable' whether or not they are actually performing.  Can Mourinho cope with that?<br><br>Also, looking at the recent players that Real Madrid is doing, it would seem its operation modus is quite different - it seemed that the backroom makes a lot of decision (eg: who to buy) and not the manager's.  Furthermore, Real Madrid has a reputation of hire fire snapshot.  Managers are given very little time to prove themselves.  Last but not least, financially, I think Chelsea is still more powerful than Real Madrid.<br><br>Mourinho will expected to win ALL if he takes over at Real Madrid.  This season is gone.  Given the lot of players (and many aging ones expecting to leave),it will take two or more seasons for the new signings to gel.  Furthermore, Barcelona is very strong &amp; this season see a lot of Spanish clubs previously thought to be mid-stream at the top of the league tables - eg: Sevilla.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fabio Capello has won more trophies than JM - I think there is nothing wrong with the manager at the moment.<br><br>The big problem is that Real and Barc etc are impatient spoilt teams who must win at all costs. Two years ago when Barca was so-so they were saying that Frank Rikaard was rubbish and should be fired and look where they are now.<br><br>Only a team like Real is stupid enough to fire their coach (Del Bosco) after winning the Champoins League and then have to go through a search for another coach. If Fabio Capello isn't good enough I cant think of anyone else better not Murino at the moment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ballack in poor form...lampard form is average...but they r still world class players....mayb u r not chelsea fan =) so i doubt u will praise lampard....n i feel tt chelsea haf too much players in the same position...like essien lampard ballack..geremi ferreria glen johnson...unlike benitez..he like to play players out of position...</div>
