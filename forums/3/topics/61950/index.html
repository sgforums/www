            <div class='col-md body'>THE SEA GAMES<br>Run in Games or lose $90k grant<br><br>Ultimatum for Shyam after he hints at skipping SEA Games<br><br>By Peh Shing Huei<br><br>SINGAPORE'S fastest man, U.K. Shyam, is facing the dim prospect of losing his $90,000 subsidies today - if he does not pull up his socks.<br><br>In an exasperated attempt to rein in the capricious national record holder, the Singapore Amateur Athletic Association will issue him an ultimatum today: Run in next month's South-east Asia Games or your grants will be stopped.<br>WHY SHYAM IS GIVEN THE MONEY<br><br>THE Athlete Career and Training programme (ACT) was set up by the Singapore Sports Council to look after an athlete's needs during his sporting career, as well as after.<br><br>Launched by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in 2001, 30 athletes are currently on the scheme, including swimmers Mark Chay, Nicolette Teo, Joscelin Yeo, table tennis player Li Jiawei and bowler Remy Ong.<br><br>ACT helps athletes cover living, training and education expenses. Career development and personal development programmes are also covered.<br><br>The athletes also receive full sports medicine and sports science support, Training Assistance Grants (funding in addition to ACT support), and are medically insured. Under ACT, an athlete can receive up to $80,000 a year in financial support.<br><br>What precipitated it all was 27-year-old Shyam telling the media earlier this week that he was contemplating skipping the Dec 5 to 13 Games in Vietnam because his training had been interrupted by his National University of Singapore examinations.<br><br>The 100 metres silver medallist at the 2001 Kuala Lumpur Games was also quoted as saying he might stay out of competition next year to concentrate on his studies.<br><br>It was the last straw for the SAAA.<br><br>The third-year Arts student has to sit for four exam papers this month. He finished one this week, with the rest coming on Nov 18, 22 and 29.<br><br>When Timesport asked what was bothering him, Shyam said last night: 'I don't know what to do anymore.'<br><br>So SAAA have summoned him for today's meeting, which will also be attended by Shyam's benefactors, the Singapore Sports Council.<br><br>Said SAAA president Loh Lin Kok: 'The mess he is in now is self-made. So he has to find his own solutions.<br><br>'Of course, if he wants counselling, we would be happy to provide it.'<br><br>But Loh is adamant about one thing: If Shyam does not run in the SEA Games, for whatever reasons, the SAAA will recommend that his grants be cancelled.<br><br>Shyam's $90,000 subsidies include study grants, money from SpexTag, the SSC's Training Assistance Grant, and training assistance for his coaches estimated at between $1,500 and $2,000 a month.<br><br>'He must remember,' said Loh, 'that his grants are performance-based. He is under duty to train, to perform.<br><br>'He should have factored his exams into his training schedules and not left things to the last minute.'<br><br>Said Shyam: 'I found out the athletics schedule only three weeks ago.<br><br>'If they take away my scholarship, I won't be able to afford the fees and support my family.'<br><br>For this year, the runner, his mentors and the SAAA set him two targets: below 10.5-sec runs at the Singapore Open and the Asian Track and Field Championships. He failed in both.<br><br>The target set for his SEA Games challenge: 10.4sec.<br><br>But what irks officials is not so much Shyam's poor form but his attitude.<br><br>Said one: 'We are sympathetic to his needs but when an athlete constantly misses meets and comes late for training, one has to question his commitment.'<br><br>The sprinter had been scheduled for three overseas training stints, two to Europe and one to Vietnam. But he only went for one - to Germany in August.<br><br>His no-shows were last-minute calls, citing a heavy school load and family problems.<br><br>Training schedules also had to be changed to suit him.<br><br>As another official put it: 'He is 27 but behaves like an 18-year-old.'<br><br><img src="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2003-11-14/shyam_front.jpg"></div>
