            <div class='col-md body'>Man City boss Pearce wants rivals to condemn their divers<br>tribalfooball.com - December 10, 2006<br><br>Manchester City boss Stuart Pearce is demanding rival managers follow his example and condemn their own players if they dive.<br>Blues striker Bernardo Corradi was sent off by referee Graham Poll in the last minute of Saturday's Manchester derby at Old Trafford after the official decided the Italian had dived in the United box in an attempt to win a penalty.<br><br>Poll showed a second yellow card to the former Parma striker, which will result in a two-game ban as Corradi has already been dismissed once this season.<br><br><span style="color: green;">However, rather than defend his player, as Sir Alex Ferguson did in similar circumstances last weekend when Cristiano Ronaldo won a crucial spot-kick at Middlesbrough, or claim he had been unsighted, Pearce confronted the issue head on.</span><br><br>Corradi can expect to face the wrath of his manager in training early next week but, as the game tries to clean up its image, Pearce believes it is time his fellow managers adopted the same approach.<br><br>"Why should I condone what happened?" said the former England left-back.<br><br>"I expect my players to stay on their feet rather than make the referee's job difficult by forcing him to make a decision - then easy because he sent him off.<br><br>"Bernardo went down too cheaply and I will be talking to him about it this week.<br><br>"But let it not just be me who stands up and gives an honest assessment of what I have seen and be critical about something one of my team has done. It would be nice if some of the other managers did the same.<br><br>"Probably 19 other Premiership managers would give you some cock and bull story about what happened. I am not prepared to do that.<br><br>"We all want a bit of honesty, so we should all come out and say something if one of our players goes down. Let's all do something about it."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you look at the season when Ronaldo just came and compare it to now, he falls less frequently and when he does, he seldom sits there and waves to the ref for a foul. Now he just gets up and gets on with the game.<br><br>But the instinct is still not totally removed, as seen in the boro game. Still, fergie and the team are doing a good job to curb his diving instincts.<br><br>Pearce has his own way of management and fergie has his own too. Fergie rarely condemns his players in the media.<br><br>Ronaldo is already suffering from a hate campaign in england and condemning him in public cant help him much. But behind the scences, fergie will sort it out.<br><br>Its funny how the media only brings up the diving matter when ronaldo is concerned. When other players like the man city striker who dived and the antics of lehmann and drogba yesterday occured, the media conviniently gives it alot less attention.<br><br></div>
