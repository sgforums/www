            <div class='col-md body'>After watching so much of action in the football matches, it is time for us to single out the matches that were interesting which provided us with great entertainment.<br><br>The most dramatic: Germany VS Poland<br>Poland had been pushed to the edge by losing their opening match against Ecuador. They were once favourites to get into the last sixteen together with Germany but their lacking of defence and luck had brought them into a very dire situation. They had to draw or even win in their match against Germany or else they would face early elimination. Their determination to secure at least a draw seemed almost successful as the match entered the final minute of stoppage time after Klose and Ballack both hit the crossbar. Poland was down to ten men in the last 15 minutes of the match and Poland's goal was on Germany's siege. From the first-half to stoppage time, Klose, Podolski and Ballack all missed their chances to eliminate Poland. Poland's goalkeeper seemed invincible and the match was full of quirkiness as Germany failed repeatedly to beat the goalkeeper. However, the most dramatic moment came when Neuville found the net two minutes into stoppage time, when everybody was almost sure of Poland claming the vital point from Germany. The stadium instantly erupted and all the German flags hoisted after 92 minutes of frustration for Germany. I was speechless too when Neuville struck the late late victory for Germany. All I had to say for Poland is that I felt sorry for them and it is a pity to be eliminated in such a heart breaking way. They had played well in defence, containing the Germans and giving their opponents a hard and frustrating time throughout the match. It was all too dramatic for everyone, the most dramatic match amongst all the matches played.<br><br>The most controversial goal: Japan VS Australia<br><br>The most controversial goal was nonetheless Nakamura's pass which went straight over everybody and for the goal. Australians claimed that their goalkeeper was fouled in the penalty area, bringing him to the ground and he only could watch the ball go straight into the net but it was fell on deaf years. Australian coach Hiddink immediately erupted as he was denied of the replay by the officials. At the touchline, he was seen having a big row with the officials and there was some pushing too. It is also the most interesting scene made by a coach so far. There was still much debate about this goal, whether the goalkeeper was really fouled or not. This was ranked the most controversial goal but the scene Hiddink had made was much more interesting than anything else.<br><br>The biggest comeback: None other than Australia's three goals in the final eight minutes<br><br>The biggest surprise: Sweden VS Trinidad and Tobago<br><br>There was nothing much I could say more about this, Trinidad and Tobago in their debut drawing against veterans Sweden.<br><br>The most exciting: Opening match<br>Germany put up the most exciting match in this World Cup Finals so far by scoring four goals against Costa Rica. The marvelous goals from Lahm and Frings had been made the difference for Germany and showed to the world that they had true great attacking power.<br><br>Most beautiful free-kick: David Beckham's free-kick which had caused the own goal by Paraguay's captain, enabling England to secure the full three marks.<br><br>The latest saviour: Saudi Arabia VS Tunisia<br><br>The substitute of Tunisia found the net when his side faced defeat as Tunisia was 1-2 down. He saved the team in the last minute of stoppage time. If not for him, Tunisia's hopes of getting into the last sixteen would be little. He saved the whole team in the eleventh hour.<br><br>Most dangerous player: Robben<br><br>With his sheer speed and skills, the Serbs were forced to make substitution in the first-half just to defend against him. This had been seen by everyone as we marveled this football prodigy.<br></div>
