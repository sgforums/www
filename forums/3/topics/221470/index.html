It is disappointing because we have thrown it away by not scoring goals to win the match.<br><br>"We didn't do enough in the last third of the field and that is what can happen in football if you don't take your chances."<br><br>United's task in a fortnight's time is slightly easier than it was last season given on that occasion they needed to travel to the Stadium of Light and win.<br><br>At least this time the Red Devils only need a point on home soil to qualify, with Ferguson believing his team will get it.<br><br>"Our home form has been very good," he said.<br><br>"I have no worries on that score. We have to be a bit more aggressive and take our chances.<br><br>"Unfortunately we have a couple of big matches to play before then.<br><br>"We can focus on those and put the Champions League on the back burner."<br><br>Ferguson was referring to Sunday's crucial Premiership encounter with Chelsea, when a win will put United six points clear at the top of the table</span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>KNN this morning when i was watching, Man U take free kick then suddenly nah beh, the TV went blank...cursing and swearing...then when it came on, its Louis Saha missing the penalty kick.<br><br>My observation is that Man U tonight held back, or perhaps it was Celtic's defense who did not allow them to use the fullback - wing-back strategy, that overpowered Bolton &amp; Blackburn.  I din see Giggs dribbling on the left, maybe he's tired, he held back or he's old and cannot run.  On the right, Ronaldo is constantly fustrated by the defender (cannot remember name) to the extent when he cross, its so weak, its macham a pass.<br><br>And Louis Saha deserves to be shot, as a striker, the number one rule is you go score goal, why he kpo whether he got off side or not? Just go and shoot lah, the most got offside, referee blow whistle and disallowed the goal mah, but the important thing, go, go , go - we see so many strikers, just go and shoot, even if whistle has blown for offside- they claim they din hear it.  thats the way mah, theres always 50-50 that either linesman / referee din react.  And this morning, it was proven, he stopped himself and looked like a puzzled, shot tamely and no whistle ever came for offside, why, is he anticipating the offside whistle?<br><br>Man U never threatened, crosses (in fact I don't recall any threatening crosses), like that die lah, sure cannot score.  Think they deliberately held back and like against Copenhagen, they were sucker punched towards the end, now they know how Arsenal felt when West Ham beat them.<br><br>Nah beh, at Arsenal came from behind to beat Hamburg.  Maybe SAF wants to do Strachan a favor by allowing Celtic to qualify?</div>
