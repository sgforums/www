            <div class='col-md body'>A further five players have withdrawn from the England squad for Wednesday's friendly against Holland in Amsterdam.<br>Manchester United full-back Gary Neville had already pulled out on Saturday with a calf injury.<br><br>But England boss Steve McClaren has now lost striker Darren Bent, midfielders Stewart Downing and Scott Parker and Spurs defender Ledley King to injury.<br><br>Wigan keeper Chris Kirkland has also been given leave of absence as his wife is due to give birth this week.<br><br>McClaren has opted not to draft any more players into his group and, in Kirkland's absence, just two goalkeepers will make the trip to the Dutch capital.<br><br>606 DEBATE: Should McClaren call up replacements?<br>But with Charlton's Scott Carson on U21 duty in Alkmaar this week, McClaren has an obvious stand-by option should the need arise.<br><br>With both Downing and Parker missing after picking up groin problems at the weekend, McClaren seems almost certain to ask fit-again Joe Cole to fill the left-sided midfield berth.<br><br>The absence of Charlton striker Bent, because of a hamstring injury, opens the way for Everton's Andrew Johnson to play some part, either as substitute or a potential partner for Wayne Rooney.<br><br>King was also expected to be on the bench in Holland but he is still being troubled by a knee injury and the Tottenham skipper has decided to remain at home.<br><br>United skipper Neville, 31, picked up his injury during United's 1-0 win over Blackburn on Saturday night.<br><br>"It's unfortunate. It's a calf muscle injury that keeps recurring," said his manager Sir Alex Ferguson.<br><br>"It is a concern. Fluid keeps getting into the muscle. We will leave him out for a couple of weeks so we can get him back to the level he needs."<br><br>Neville's withdrawal increases the chances of 18-year-old Manchester City defender Micah Richards earning a first cap. Richards, who is playing right-back for City but can also play in the middle of defence, is the only new face in the squad, which is reduced to 22 players after the latest withdrawals.<br><br>And he has received the backing of McClaren who told the Football Association website: "I've watched him play a number of times and he's a strong, quick and athletic player who has really impressed at Man City this season.<br><br>"This match provides us with a great opportunity to have a look at him over the next few days, and he fully deserves his chance."<br><br>Tottenham defender Michael Dawson and Watford keeper Ben Foster are the other uncapped players in the squad.<br><br>Kieran Richardson is the only player omitted from the squad that contested the Euro 2008 qualifiers against Macedonia and Croatia.<br><br>McClaren will be looking for a solid performance from his team following the draw against Macedonia and defeat in Croatia.<br><br>And he expects a tough game at the Amsterdam ArenA.<br><br>"Holland are always tough opponents as they have a great history and tradition and I am sure it will be very competitive," McClaren said.<br><br>Defender Dawson joined Tottenham for Â£4m in January 2005, while keeper Foster is on loan at Watford from Manchester United.<br><br>Dutch coach Marco van Basten has named eight British-based players in his squad for the game.<br><br>Chelsea pair Arjen Robben and Khalid Boulahrouz, Celtic duo Evander Sno and Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink, Wigan's Denny Landzaat, Robin van Persie of Arsenal, Dirk Kuyt of Liverpool and Blackburn's Andre Ooijer have all received call-ups.<br><br>The claims of Real Madrid striker Ruud van Nistelrooy have been ignored, while Van Basten has agreed to rest Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar.<br><br>England have failed to beat Holland in three friendlies since their 4-1 win over the Dutch at Euro 96.<br><br>Holland were 2-0 friendly winners over England in 2001 at White Hart Lane and since then the sides have been inseparable - a 1-1 stalemate at the Amsterdam ArenA in 2002 and a 0-0 draw at Villa Park in 2005.<br><br><strong>England squad</strong>:<br><br>Goalkeepers: Paul Robinson (Tottenham), Ben Foster (Man Utd)<br><br>Defenders: Phil Neville (Everton), Micah Richards (Man City), Rio Ferdinand (Man Utd), John Terry (Chelsea), Jamie Carragher (Liverpool), Wes Brown (Man Utd), Michael Dawson (Tottenham), Ashley Cole (Chelsea), Wayne Bridge (Chelsea).<br><br>Midfield: Aaron Lennon (Tottenham), Shaun Wright-Phillips (Chelsea), Steven Gerrard (Liverpool), Frank Lampard (Chelsea), Michael Carrick (Man Utd), Jermaine Jenas (Tottenham), Joe Cole (Chelsea).<br><br>Forwards: Wayne Rooney (Man Utd), Peter Crouch (Liverpool), Jermain Defoe (Tottenham), Andrew Johnson (Everton).<br><br><strong>Holland squad</strong>:<br><br>Goalkeepers: Maarten Stekelenburg (Ajax), Henk Timmer (Feyenoord).<br><br>Defenders: Khalid Boulahrouz (Chelsea), Giovanni van Bronckhorst (Barcelona), Urby Emanuelson (Ajax), Kew Jaliens (AZ Alkmaar), Joris Mathijsen (Hamburg), Andre Ooijer (Blackburn Rovers).<br><br>Midfielders: Denny Landzaat (Wigan Athletic), Hedwiges Maduro (Ajax), David Mendes da Silva (AZ), Stijn Schaars (AZ), Wesley Sneijder (Ajax), Evander Sno (Celtic), Rafael van der Vaart (Hamburg).<br><br>Forwards: Klaas-Jan Huntelaar (Ajax), Dirk Kuyt (Liverpool), Robin van Persie (Arsenal), Arjen Robben (Chelsea), Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink (Celtic).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas has been ruled out of England's friendly with Holland on Wednesday, with Steve McClaren drafting in Kieran Richardson as his replacement.<br><br>Jenas reported for duty on Monday morning, but was sent back to his club for treatment after his injured calf had been assessed by the England medical team.<br><br>The midfielder played 90 minutes for Spurs on Sunday and it would appear he picked up his calf complaint during the 3-1 defeat at Reading.<br><br>The absence of Jenas has opened for door for Manchester United midfielder Richardson who had initially been overlooked for selection for the meeting with Marco van Basten's Oranje.<br><br>McClaren has seen a number of key players pull out of the squad, with Jenas joining Gary Neville, Darren Bent, Ledley King, Stewart Downing, Scott Parker and Chris Kirkland on the list of absentees for Wednesday's clash in Amsterdam<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>England boss Steve McClaren feels the return of Joe Cole, Aaron Lennon and Andrew Johnson will add the type of pace his side lacked in their recent poor showings against FYR Macedonia and Croatia.<br><br>Having garnered just a solitary point from their last two European Championship qualifiers, England's players and management have become the subjects of intense criticism.<br><br>On Wednesday against Holland, they have an ideal opportunity to restore the public's wavering faith and although the game at the Amsterdam ArenA is only a friendly, McClaren is demanding a vast improvement.<br><br>With the aforementioned trio all back in contention, McClaren feels they will provide the tonic his squad badly needs and it is expected all three will play their part on Wednesday.<br><br>McClaren also points to the upturn in Wayne Rooney and Frank Lampard's form as reasons to be optimistic and the former Middlesbrough chief admits he is looking forward to the opportunity of winning a few skeptics over.<br><br>"We now have Joe Cole, Aaron Lennon and Andrew Johnson available, three players with pace and an ability to take players out of the game," said McClaren.<br><br>"We also have players coming back to form. Wayne Rooney has exploded, Frank Lampard was outstanding against Barcelona and in that match, Ashley Cole gave a great performance too.<br><br>"Then we have Lennon, Steven Gerrard and Gary Neville (who has since withdrawn), who has looked like a striker recently without getting the goals.<br><br>"Our aim is to prove people wrong on the pitch. It's all about winning and to do that ,the players have to play for the shirt, The Three Lions and do it within the laws of the game.<br><br>"There are no friendlies. The performance will be dissected like any other."<br></div>
