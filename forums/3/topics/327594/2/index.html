              <p><br>So it's not right to come to Singapore to play sports because Singapore is able to offer them the opportunity to do so comfortably? I mean, in an environment better than the one they came from I think. If they like the place here, they will feel the sense of belonging.</p>

              <p>you remind me of one of my cousins, she treats outsiders nicer than her own family, for reasons known to herself. so, rather than see a chimp throw the bowling ball well and win legit honors for singapore; you rather give the money to a foreigners.</p>
              <p>it's like when singapore made known of her riches, all the chinaman come over and claim to be a relatives of singapore. they even renounced and cut their ties back home just to be able to have their fingers on the pie.</p>

That is why we local born Singaporean feels comfortable with her. We feel her sincerity to want to be a real Singaporean. Did you just see her on tv? Just only at 9.30pm news? She exclaimed 'Oh my god' in English! She shed her China chinese slang but certainly not LJW. She still speaks like a China Chinese despite she is already 27. How long has she been in Singapore? Age 27 minus 14 which is 13 long years in Singapore and she still speaks like China Chinese. To me she is not genuinely interested in being a true Singaporean. My guess, I will say my guess is because of the carrort that is the prize money. Of course not to say Tao Li is not interested in the prize money. I am sure everyone is. But it's the way they portray themselves. LJW is really out for the money only. You pay me I work and that's it. No love involved.</p>

              <p>Based on the education system we see in singapore, will we ever win a olympic medal? As u realised, people in other countries started training sports seriously below the age of 10. But do you think it’ll happen in Singapore? Will parents take the risk to allow their children to take sports as a life time career? That would mean the amount of time spend studying a day to just a mere few hours? My answer would be no. A true blue singaporean would never ever win a medal based on the education system. Its all about paper chase in Singapore. Just sharing my 2 cents worth <img title="Very Happy" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"></p>
