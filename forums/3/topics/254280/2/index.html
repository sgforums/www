West Ham's 25 and Sheffield's 22 both have a '-' sign infront of it. Which means before the last match, Sheffield had a better goal difference (Did you miss that?). Otherwise, at the time of the table I used, West Ham would have been above Sheffield, wouldn't they?<br><br>They were already level on points, so if they both lost, Sheffield should still be ahead of West Ham as long as they don't lose by 3 goal margin or more. This is assuming West Ham lost by a one goal difference at Old Trafford.<br><br>I kind of stated all this in the other thread, and basically looked at all the possible scenarios I could even outside of my posts.<br><br>In fact, as the final table stands now, Sheffield have a larger goal difference than West Ham. So if West Ham gets docked of 3 points, they would be in the scenario stated above, whereby Sheffield and West Ham would be level on points, but West Ham being lower down becase of a larger negative value goal difference.</div>
