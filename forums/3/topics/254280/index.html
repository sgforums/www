In that sense, Leeds' case was pretty clear-cut.<br><br>However, they have no such regulations (point deduction) against clubs guilty of signing players illegally and that's what Sheff Utd is planning to go to the courts for. And West Ham's situation is very different from Leeds' in a way - it's really hard for any sane and objective person to believe points weren't deducted because their precarious position hadn't been considered when the Premier League met up to deal with their case?</div></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Gerald Krasner, an insolvency specialist, led a consortium of local businessmen which took over Leeds and under his chairmanship oversaw the sale of the clubs' assets, including senior and emerging youth players of any value. Caretaker manager Gray was largely blameless for the performance of the team during the 2003-04 season as the majority of the squad was sold out from underneath him and despite his best efforts, Leeds were relegated after 14 years in the top flight. Following relegation, Gray's reign as caretaker manager was terminated, and Kevin Blackwell was appointed manager. Most of the remaining players were sold or released on free transfers to further reduce the wage bill. Leeds were eventually forced to sell both their training ground, for Â£4.2m,[15] and their Elland Road stadium[16] in the autumn of 2004.<br><br>The club finally managed a financial turn around on 21 January 2005, when Krasner announced the sale of a 50% stake of the club to Ken Bates for Â£10m.[17] Blackwell stabilized the team by signing players on free transfers and low wages and Leeds finished the 2004-05 season mid-table in the Championship. In the 2005-06 season Leeds finished in the top 6 and made the promotion playoff final, which they lost to Watford. On 10 September 2006, Kevin Blackwell announced that within a year the club would be debt-free.[18] However, the 2006-07 season started badly and on 20 September 2006 Kevin Blackwell's contract as manager of Leeds United was terminated. Dennis Wise was eventually installed as his replacement after a month without a permanent manager, but was unable to lift the team out of the relegation zone for much of the season, despite bringing a number of experienced loan players into the squad . With relegation virtually assured, Leeds entered a Company Voluntary Arrangement (administration) on 4th May 2007, thus incurring a league imposed 10 point deduction which officially relegated the club to the third tier of English football.

He started with Van Der Sar, not Kushack (however it's spelt). He did field Ronaldo,Giggs and Scholes although it was only in the second half. If he wasn't trying to win, why even sub them in and risk an injury on the last day? That can be a sign of wanting to chase for a result after conceding. I'm not sure if Rooney was among the 3 subbed off but he started the game. can't say much about the defence bcause Ferguson doesn't exactly have his best options fully fit at the moment.<br><br>By player selection, I wouldn't say Man U were going to throw the game right off. But then, motivation was lacking and for obvious reasons.<br><br>And you need to look at it this way, Man U lost to West Ham earlier in the season too. No doubt it was at West Ham home, but back then, it was a Man U challenging for the title. Sunday night was a Man U with no reason to win other than for the sake of winning the match in itself.<br><br>I'm not saying West Ham deserve to stay up, but Sheffield deserves to go down for not even getting a draw at the very best. And it was home ground for Sheffield United too against a ten man Wigan. By right Sheffield had total control needing to only play for a draw, but they totally lost the plot on that day. Even if West Ham had points deducted, the idea would still have been to get a draw on the last day, because they would have at least one team between them and the relegation zone. If anyone would die first it would still have been Wigan. But Sheffield lost their match, clear and simple. They shouldn't be relying on others to help them with premiership survival.<br><br>I can understand that some of you may just want to have something to say about your least favourite club, all I'm saying is just to take things into totality.</div>
