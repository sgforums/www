You want them to be like Real Madrid, having all the galacticoes bickering among themselves?</div></blockquote>Arrr... which world are you living in, a lot of players have join Liverpool meh?<br><br>Anyway, How can you compare him to the galacticoes? Hatem trabelsi is only a half decent player now.<br><br>At 29 coming to 30 is not exactly what you will call a good player to invest in for the future... Moreover, he is not the same player as he was some 3 to 5yrs back... after suffering chronic knee problems. That explains why Ajax released him and didn't re-new his contract.<br><br>This guy is known as an attacking full-back and after his injury and at age 29, he may have lost some of that speed he is known for liao. That is why he joined Manchester City on a pay-as-you-play deal... If no play means no pay also.<br></div>
