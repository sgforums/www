            <div class='col-md body'>Galactico king Perez quits Real Madrid<br><br>Florentino Perez has resigned as president of Real Madrid.<br><br>The club immediately announced Fernando Martin would replace him, stepping up from his previous role as vice-president.<br><br>Perez was less than two years into his second term as Real president, having been re-elected in July 2004.<br><br>Since the 58-year-old Perez replaced Lorenzo Sanz in 2000, Real have won the Primera Liga title twice and the Champions League once.<br><br>However, the club have not claimed any major silverware since winning the league in 2003 and look likely to finish this season empty-handed following a string of disappointing recent results.<br><br>Real were knocked out of the Copa del Rey semi-finals by Real Zaragoza earlier this month after losing the first leg 6-1, and they also suffered a 1-0 defeat in the opening leg of their Champions League last-16 encounter with Arsenal last week.<br><br>In the league, Sunday's 2-1 defeat at struggling Real Mallorca saw Madrid fall 10 points behind leaders and arch-rivals Barcelona in the standings.<br><br>During his tenure, Perez has employed six different coaches at Real - Vicente Del Bosque, Carlos Queiroz, Jose Antonio Camacho, Mariano Garcia Remon, Wanderley Luxemburgo and Juan Ramon Lopez Caro.<br><br>The current coach, Lopez Caro, was appointed in December following the sacking of Brazilian Luxemburgo.<br><br>Under Perez's charge, Madrid signed England internationals David Beckham, Michael Owen and Jonathan Woodgate, as well as `galacticos' Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo.<br><br>Perez confirmed his decision to resign at a press conference at the club's Bernabeu stadium, saying: 'I called this extraordinary general meeting because I believe we needed a change.<br><br>'Having analysed the situation I considered that this was the time for me to step down.<br><br>'I presented my resignation this afternoon because I believe this will be a change for the best. It is a decision I have thought hard about.'<br><br>good la..they need to change their buying policy..the only good thing he did was to overtake man utd as the top earning club.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when he took over, RM was nearly bankrupted, but he sold the training ground for 300m and bought a lot of galacticos of players to RM and won 1 CL and 2 laliga titles, and help RM to be the richest club in the world today. thats his achievement.<br><br>his failings are: buy and sell players without consulting his manager, who is running the team. hire and fire coaches on a whim of bad runs, thus contributing to the instability of the team.<br><br></div>
