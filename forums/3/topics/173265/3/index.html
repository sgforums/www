            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Same cant be said of Inter Milan. Two times european cup winner Inter Milan has not won the European cup since the 60s and has not won the Serie A for nearly 20 years despite tyre Tycoon Emilliano Moretti pumping tonns of money and investing in big name players like Vieri, Cannavaro, Toldo, Adriano, Crespo, Djorkaeff, Ronaldo, Dennis Bergkamp, Jurgen Klinsmann, lothar mathaeus. etc... They did win some italian cups and a UEFA cup in between, but thier ultimate dream is the Serie A.  </blockquote>Yes Inter Milan had not won the Serie A for a long long time despite  spending alot but dun forget there are clubs who can match their spending power too, lets not forget juventus and Ac Milan. In EPL i doubt any clubs can do match what chelsea did in terms of spending power.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you must put it that way, then I think its best to sit around a table and compare who has more money instead of playing football. The owner with the most money wins everything(the case of Chelsea? I dont see them win the Champions League or FA Cup), without having the players to play any matches.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

Answer is can too..<br>Its just a problem of probability now. Back to this context whether money can buy football success...i would say it strongly enhance...Take any 2 equal clubs and pump in money into one. U would say that the one with funds have a greater chance of success.<br><br>There are many elements to winning. u need good coach,players,form,ambition and not forgetting luck...<br>U cant buy luck,form and ambition... For everything else there is mastercard...<br><br>Money acts like grease to the motor but it does not gurantee the motor will run..if u have a rusty 1..hmmm i guess..take to use ur mastercard  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
