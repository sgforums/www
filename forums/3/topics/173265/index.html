            <div class='col-md body'>People just don't understand that money can only get u so far, its talent and ability that counts on the football pitch. Look at Read Madrid, they are all just playing for themselves, they believe in the Galaticos tag, and their players do not get along with each other. The spanish players like Pavon, Casillas and Helguera do not mix around with Ronaldo, Cicinho, Robinho, Carlos, Julio Baptista. They are not playing as a team.<br><br>Chelsea's success is based on the fact that they are willing to play for the team, and their respect of the coach is 1 major factor. Real Madrid players never really respect their coaches over the years, and see how many have come and go in just 2 seasons. under Mourinho, Chelsea is willing to squad rotate the players, wiling to play as a team, and play according to instructions. That, is what money cannot buy.<br><br>Also, look at Bolton and Wigan. Bolton has consistently performed over the years in the EPL, and they don't spent much. Wigan's players are hardworking and run their socks off, and they are now in the top half of the table. So money really isn't everything.</div>
