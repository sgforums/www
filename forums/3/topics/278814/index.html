Nobody in their right mind was going to take such a risk during those times... When you consider that Liverpool a club as big was sold for about $200m exclude their new stadium. Even with their new stadium, it came up to around $450 - $500 million only and it happen just this year when tv money was just about to roll in. So you could see how big a risk they took.<br><br>To be very honest, everyone does it for the money... Even for those who may also love the sport. And believe it or not, even for someone as rich as Roman! Peter Kenyon, their chief executive is working very hard everyday so that they can be profitable as well. And he has also openly came out and said according to their estimation, they will break even by 2009 and probably make it a profitable club after that...<br><br>There is nothing wrong with clubs wanting to make money, its a way of life... Football and the EPL is going into a new dimension... Fans should stop living in the 70s or 80s anymore and hope that their season ticket prices isn't going to go up... Football has changed. In the past, probably there was only an owner, a manager and a few others in between... Present day, there are so much manpower needed... Apart from the owner, they have CEO to Chairman to Director of Football and finally to Manager... Chelsea alone have all these... But we are still not counting the others that work below the managers... and finally the present day players salaries... You ask yourself, are they still the same as those in the 70s, 80s or even the 90s?<br><br>Present day fans have high demands, the standard of living has also increase, so do they still expect to pay yesteryears prices?<br><br>And i find your statement "Glazer families are known to purchase sports clubs make them big then suck out everything from it before selling it away to who ever that can offer good money to them" really strange cos all i know is the only sport club/franchise they have bought is the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1995. And to date, they still own it... But more importantly, they have taken the once perennial losers The Tampa Bay Buccaneers to their first Super Bowl victory in 2002.<br><br>I personally felt that Malcolm Glazer purchased of Man utd was one of the best thing that has happened to them after a year or two where some major share holders / directors were finding fault with its manager Fergie after a personally disagreement with him. They were putting their personally interest ahead of the club causing all sorts of problems for the team. The club was never their main priority... They just wanted to pressure its manager to drop he lawsuit against them. The club suffer as a result.<br><br>Since the Glazer family took over, Man united has become what it used to be, United. Their non-interference with the football matters is something that i respect them for. They leave that area to the people who knows how to run it rather than tell the team manager to add one of his friend or own people into the team like what we see happening over at Man City...<br><br>And i am not kidding... 600 million really isn't really a big deal when you consider the size of Man utd and the profit they bring in yearly... Their yearly profits are more than enough to service their yearly loan repayments... The Glazer family don't even need to take out their own money cos the loans are stretch out over a period of years... Present day $600 million would probably mean lesser in value in 5 to 10 yrs time. But the club continue to grow in value by the year. And in years to come when they have completed their repayment to the banks and own it fully... You can imagine how much it will be.<br><br>As for the title... I know the players did the job, the manager deserve the credit but the owners also played an important role by not disrupting the team, giving it every support it needed and not cashing in on Ronaldo's new skyrocket value in Jan... It was really very easy to let him go and make a huge profit but instead they were willing to break their pay limit to keep him. Even for this season... Do you seriously think that without their approval we would see Fergie bring in Nani, Anderson, Tevez and Hargreaves for an almost combine fee of $60m? If they were seriously in need for the money to pay off the loan... Then one third of that amount will do, the rest they can use to clear part of their current loan.<br><br>As for some of those disgruntled fans who are against the Glazer family... All i can say is some of them were formerly minority share holders who had their shares bought off them. They are probably still unhappy. But business is business... But if we were to look more into it... Man utd still have one of the cheapest tickets at $40 compare to Arsenal $60, Chelsea $50+ and maybe even Spurs... So what are the season ticket holders complaining about? Shouldn't Arsenal fans be even more unhappy?<br><br></div>
