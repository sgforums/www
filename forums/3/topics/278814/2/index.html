            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Saltiga:</div><div class="quote_body">wow, wasn't expecting such a lenghty reply but guess you've probably just broke the sports folder's record for longest post.<br><br>790million is a risk or not a risk? may i ask you? you started off saying they took a risk with the investment while reverting back to say that its no big deal with such a sum given that ManU is such a profitable company, so its a risk or no a risk?<br><br>everyone is in for the money no doubt but the direct investment from Roman cannot be spoken with the same breath as Glazer, if media reports are anything to base on Glazer families hardly took out a cent from their own pocket for those purchases made by the club all those are self generating funds and budgets from past years.<br><br>Man City's case is of polictical issue so lets not touch on it.<br><br>about Tampa Bay? Check the season tickets price before and after 2002 to get the pic!<br><br>Manchester, Liverpool or Newcastle can never to compare with London and i bet you're not going to buy a property in Jurong base on price from of a property town do you?<br></div></blockquote>Of course its a risk... Even buying Aston Villa or West Ham was also a risk! Every business venture comes with a risk. Had West Ham gone down last season... Their 100 million investment in the club with their new players on high salaries would all very fast become lesser value... Every investment comes with a risk... And in most cases, the greater the risk, the greater the returns or the greater the lost... Its a simple logic.<br><br>When is it a risk? I would say the first step when they decided to buy it fully for $790m with bank loans which the Glazer family will be solely responsible for. That was already about 2 and a half years ago... There was no guarantee that the EPL was going which direction... Had the deal turn bad, they will be the ones that the banks will go looking for... But the "no big deal" comes from the fact that it has been about 2 and a half years since... The Tv deals that were mentioned back then have materialize therefore they can expect a guaranteed yearly sum of $30m just for being in the Premiership and probably $50m should they become champions.<br><br>Nevertheless, this still does not take into account the new long term sponsorships deals struck with companies like AIG, Nike (Both American companies) and other "smaller ones" since the Glazer family came... And in the Champions League... They could also make anything from minimum $10m to a sum of maybe $40 to $80m yearly... depends on how far they progress in the competition... And apart from all these... They still manage to have a full house 70+ thousand fans to every match... The gate collections probably come up to around a few million every match.<br><br>The fact that the fundamentals of the club is strong, it is known worldwide and has strong support around the globe that why i said its not a big deal cos over a period of 5 to 10 yrs... they could actually clear everything. The money that the club generates are more than adequate to service their yearly loans.<br><br>From how i see it, the only difference the investment made by Roman and Glazer family is... Malcolm Glazer took a greater risk. He probably put half of his fortunes into it whereas in Roman's case... even the whole of chelsea with all its signings... probably cost $500m, would not really cost him much worry should he lose it if he is worth $18b.<br><br>It sounds rather silly when you said "Glazer families hardly took out a cent from their own pocket for those purchases made by the club all those are self generating funds and budgets from past years." I have to tell you that when you takeover a business or company, you take over its past, its present and its future as well. You also takeover its debts should it have any as in Newcastle and Liverpool's case. You cannot say that what was created in the past does not belong to them cos once they officially takeover, everything from the light bulb in the stadium to the grass on the field belongs to them already... and even the club's bank account for they paid for it in their $790m deal.<br><br>About Tampa Bay... Of course it will go up. Prices in 2002 can't be the same as in 1995 right... Even here in Singapore, can you tell me that most tickets prices today are the same as in 1995? Even my bus fare ticket is going up...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>But more importantly, The Tampa Bay Buccaneers team was a bunch of losers... Tickets were hardly going easily because the team was losing most of the time. It was only after Malcolm Glazer took over that investments were made... New qualified football coaches were brought in... Better quality players came as well which finally enable them to their first Super Bowl victory... Malcolm Glazer paid $192 million for it in 1995 and today its worth a few time more.<br><br>And finally, Manchester and London isn't exactly our Jurong and town areas compare... More like our Orchard and Bukit Timah kind of comparison... For Manchester is a major city in it own right and probably bigger then some other European cities. Anyway, i don't think i broke any records... But i can write longer if you like...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
