So your bitterness towards him posting a thread is all because you don't like to see a non-united fan openly praising another club other than your chelsea right?<br><br>So tell me, what makes you think you have a right to post? You have your answer already right... Ok, good.<br><br>So what makes you think that you have a right to tell him what to or not to post? Simple, you don't have that right!<br><br>So in future must he still get your permission on what he can or wishes to post? Simple NO!<br><br>Remember, you have a choice to ignore it or not read it... but you should not tell others what they can or cannot post. Unless this Sgforum belongs to you... Does it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>This thread doesn't have an ounce of insult to anyone of anything, if there was, the mod will know what to do like he have done before. Its just a simple post of his opinion. So grow up and just live with it man and stop feeling so bitter about it.</div>
