Chelsea lost to Liverpool last year in the Euro cup as well, didn't they? let me repeat what i've posted before comparing to Man Utd, Chelsea will still have lesser cups in their cabinet 10 years down the road... so wise up!! Chelsea is playing really well currently but who are you?? you wouldn't even get to smell their boots even if they win the Euro cup end of the season.. agreed that you'll feel proud that your supported team is playing well and winning but that doesn't gives you a right to put down another teams supporter..<br><br>does it makes your ego soar high when doing name calling hidding behind your computer screen???</div>

If we continue to play sexy football like now Uefa Cup will do fine for me. Just hope we will get rid of uncommitted players at the end of this season. I would rather play less talented but hungry youngsters rather than   gifted yet whiny experienced players. We need players who are really willing to run their lungs out for the club.  Outstanding examples are reyes and Toure. They are my Heroes! As for some other player, he can hope on the next plane to Spain for all I care. We will accept the $30 million and say thank you very much for the years of magic and goals that you have given us. We will welcome you back with open arms if you want to return to the Emirate Stadium in future on a free transfer.</div>
