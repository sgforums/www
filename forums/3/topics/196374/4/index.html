            <div class='col-md body'>England looks like potential world champions in the first half. Their performance surprised me especially after Crouch came on but second half was a different story. Sweden could or should have won the game. 2 shots hit the cross bar, one shot clear off the line. England is lucky to get the draw in the end. If they maintain the first half standard, they may stand a chance. Judging by their weakness at corner kicks. If Ecardor can explore that, it might be a tough game for England next round.</div>

This has noting to do with Chelsea, so keep chelsea out of this. I am not commenting on this match alone, the overall 3 matches lampard &amp; J cole have been wasting chances by shooting from way too far without even hitting the target most of the time. Even owen was complaining that the midfield was not passing the ball.<br>Lampard is an attacking midfielder in his own right, But he is not doing what's he has done all season with chelsea. At chelsea, Mourinho emphasized alot on team work. But lampard has became an individual when he plays for england. Only thinking of himself, going for own glory like J cole. Joe was lucky he scored... but thats the point, even as far out like that he was trying pot shots and no intention of passing the strikers. I remembered when mourinho first took over, he told J cole off for trying to show off and threatened to bench him if he continue his ways. Seems like Joe has gone back to his old ways &amp; lampard has follow him.<br><br>Sadly, these 2 if they continue to be selfish, whatever little hope england has is finish.</div>

This has noting to do with Chelsea, so keep chelsea out of this. I am not commenting on this match alone, the overall 3 matches lampard &amp; J cole have been wasting chances by shooting from way too far without even hitting the target most of the time. Even owen was complaining that the midfield was not passing the ball.<br>Lampard is an attacking midfielder in his own right, But he is not doing what's he has done all season with chelsea. At chelsea, Mourinho emphasized alot on team work. But lampard has became an individual when he plays for england. Only thinking of himself, going for own glory like J cole. Joe was lucky he scored... but thats the point, even as far out like that he was trying pot shots and no intention of passing the strikers. I remembered when mourinho first took over, he told J cole off for trying to show off and threatened to bench him if he continue his ways. Seems like Joe has gone back to his old ways &amp; lampard has follow him.<br><br>Sadly, these 2 if they continue to be selfish, whatever little hope england has is finish. </div></blockquote>maybe its sven tactic to blast long shots, knowing that his midfielders are all capable of doing it..anyway england has never been creative with the ball nor do they play free flowing short passes like argentina,spain etc..only rooney is the exception and he too can blast one from long range..so yea, play to ur strengths, just sadly most of them off target.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

If crouch suay suay get yellow card again which i dunno is lucky or not since crouch's performance is that bad,walcott to come out with zero experience to take over? Walcott should have being sub out in the sweden game to get some experience already,dunno what the hell is SGE thinking.</div>
