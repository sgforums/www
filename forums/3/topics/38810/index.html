Ajax do not deserve it. As far as i see, Ajax, Valencia and Juventus will not go far in the competition. Juventus need some spark and be more zai to make it. Arsenal definitely is in contention for the EPL crown, provided their solve their problems they have now. Man U, they r damn good at taking their chances, but they lack the cutting edge. Look at other teams such as Newcastle, Barcelona, Real madrid. They cannot win spectacularly. If u say their 3-0 win over juventus is something to celebrate, i dun think so. It is just a gift for man u from juventus. Man u have barthez to thanks for this season's performance so far. U r rite that arsenal is complacent in the EPL and inexperienced in the champs league. Man u does not have the capability to win the champs and EPL. They dun deserve it. Even if they win both, it'll be a case as with the treble. SHEER LUCK!</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I think Alex Ferguson would rather Arsenal make it to the quarter finals. Reason being, in the EPL, Man U is only 2 pts behind now, so if Arsenal is still in the CL competition, they woud be distracted and Man U may be able to chase up and as for the CL, anything could happen on the night of the match. But now arsenal is out, they will put all their focus on the EPL and that by any means is no good news to Man U. I tip Arsenal to win EPL with Man U probably a place in CL final and 2nd place in CL and Newcastle and Liverpool 3rd and 4th respectively.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its true that luck was on Utd's side in 1999 but they deserved it. both keane and becks then were playing great esp keane. the yorke-cole combo was deadly. in EPL then, they grinded out all the results that was required, including a comeback from 1-0 down to beat Spurs on the last game to win. in FA Cup, they beat Arsenal in the semis with schmeichel denying bergkamp's penalty and an amazing goal from giggs. in Champs League, they were tactically astute altho i must say that bayern could have won had basler's chip not hit the cross bar.<br><br>i do hope everton can get at least a point from Arsenal tomorrow especially when vieira and campbell may not be playing.</div>
