            <div class='col-md body'>Though i don't think this deal will come close... Well, since its was reported i share it over here...<br><br>Manchester United target Carlos Tevez has revealed he wants to quit Brazilian club Corinthians for a move to Europe.<br><br>United boss Sir Alex Ferguson is a long-term admirer of the Argentinian striker and could now make a move.<br><br>Tevez demanded a transfer after falling out with new coach and former Brazil goalkeeper Emerson Leao, according to the Daily Mirror.<br><br>The pair clashed after Tevez was stripped of the club captaincy because he cannot speak Portuguese.<br><br>Tevez is valued at around Â£25 million and United will face stiff competition for his signature from Bayern Munich and AC Milan.<br><br>He said: "This may have been my last game in the Corinthians shirt.<br><br>"I would like to stay but I have to think about what is better for me and my family."<br><br>His agent Adrian Ruocco confirmed: "Carlos wants to go to Europe."<br><br>When Corinthians signed Tevez in 2004, he attended a press conference wearing a United shirt and has never hidden interest in playing for the Red Devils.<br><br>Ferguson may hold the upper hand in the race to sign the World Cup star, given he has already admitted he supports the club and once turned up to a Corinthians press conference wearing a Manchester Unites strip.<br><br></div>

I don't want this getting in the way of my job, I am here to coach the team.<br><br>"I need to improve Corinthians and the more good players I have, the better.<br><br>"I'm not going to make allowances for those that don't deserve it. I arrived only a short time ago and have a two-year contract.<br><br>"Tevez has missed other training sessions so this is nothing new. From what I have seen, the team played 45 games last year and he played only 24.<br><br>"Does anyone understand what Tevez says when he speaks, because I don't.<br><br>"He is a citizen who has to answer for his own actions and he has no reason for his absence.<br><br>"Corinthians received no official notice and we need to work with concrete, reliable facts."<br><br>Corinthians confirmed that Tevez was AWOL.<br><br>"Tevez has not appeared," said Corinthians spokesperson Luciano Signorini:<br><br>"He has not called to give any reason why he has missed training. We don't know what is going on with him."<br><br>New of Tevez's unrest is sure to alert Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho - both of whom have shown an interest.</div>
