            <div class='col-md body'>CHAMPIONS LEAGUE, 2ND LEG: CHELSEA 2 PORTO 1 CHELSEA WIN 3-2 ON AGGREGATE FROM STAMFORD BRIDGE<br><br>BALLACK FINALLY COMES GOOD TO KEEP QUADRUPLE DREAM ALIVE<br>Martin Lipton Chief Football Writer 07/03/2007<br><br>JOSE MOURINHO has spent the past week moaning about the lucky breaks Manchester United have been getting.<br><br>But at Stamford Bridge last night the Chelsea boss was bailed out by the sort of outrageous fortune that makes you start to believe it is his destiny to end his Blues career in Athens in May.<br><br>All season, even when Michael Ballack has admitted he is playing woefully, Mourinho has kept faith with the German.<br>Advertisement<br><br>Yet just as Ballack's entire campaign of underachievement and Â£130,000 per-week complacency appeared set to be summed up in the space of 90 minutes, it was the German who sent Mourinho's men through to the last eight of the Champions League, and ensured Roman Abramovich will have to wait before signing that inevitable execution warrant for the boss.<br><br>Ballack had spent most of the match in his own little dream world, wandering around aimlessly, mocked by home fans.<br><br>Indeed, Mourinho alone will know how the German stayed on the pitch at half-time, with Claude Makelele sacrificed as John Obi Mikel injected high octane fuel into a midfield seemingly powered from the Tesco forecourt.<br><br>Mid-way through the second half, as Ballack took advantage of a break in play to slip down the tunnel, one home supporter stood to shout at Mourinho: "Leave him in there - and lock the door".<br><br>But after a howler by Porto keeper Helton gifted Arjen Robben and Mourinho's men a lifeline back into the tie, it was Ballack who popped up with the sort of goal he was signed to score. Mikel's persistence 11 minutes from time won back the ball and as he swept wide to Ashley Cole on the left, Ballack stirred from his lethargy to make his move.<br><br>Didier Drogba and Andriy Shevchenko combined with a bout of head tennis and as the ball dropped near the penalty spot, there was Ballack to pounce, swivel and thunder home with a left-footed volley.<br><br>Stamford Bridge erupted, more in surprise than joy perhaps, aware that this was a night in which they could have seen their Quadruple dream crumble and die.<br><br>Chelsea's failure to heed the lessons of the first leg, when it was only the introduction of Mikel that shackled Ricardo Quaresma, could so easily have proved fatal.<br><br>It certainly looked that way when Makelele lost a tackle in midfield and Argentine Lucho Gonzalez sent the flying Quaresma streaking clear of Ricardo Carvalho to plant under the exposed Petr Cech and into the middle of the vacant net.<br><br>Chelsea struggled to create clearcut openings. Drogba was thwarted by defender Bruno Alves after one penetrating Cole run and cross and when Ballack swung his right foot only to make contact with fresh air, the groans reflected the mood of simmering discontent.<br><br>Yet when the half ended with an outrageous Robben dive in the vicinity of defender Fucile that rightly saw the Dutch winger booked for cheating, the poverty of Chelsea's display was impossible to ignore.<br><br>Mourinho shot down the tunnel early, determined to give his side both barrels at half time.<br><br>Yet it was a Porto player who made the crucial contribution after the break. Receiving from Lassana Diarra, Robben had time to line up his left-footer from 22 yards, only to scuff the effort.<br><br>Helton could have walked across and picked it up yet incredibly managed to dive so badly to his left that he sent the ball spinning over his right shoulder and into the net.<br><br>Suddenly the night was very different as Porto deflated like a balloon. It still looked like it would go to extra-time.<br><br>Ballack, though, had other ideas, his act of redemption one that may look even more pivotal over the next three months. Mourinho and his men live to fight another day.<br><br>As Fergie might tell him, you make your own luck. The trick is to take full advantage. Chelsea now have the chance to do that.<br><br>CHELSEA: Cech, Diarra (Ferreira 65), Essien, Carvalho, A Cole, Makelele (Mikel 46), Robben, Ballack, Lampard, Shevchenko (Kalou 84), Drogba.<br><br>FC PORTO: Helton, Fucile, Pepe, Bruno Alves, Cech (Ibson 55), Gonzalez, Ricardo Costa, Paulo Assuncao, Raul Meireles (Adriano 55), Lopez (Bruno Moraes 82), Quaresma.<br><br>57% POSSESSION 43%<br><br>2 SHOTS ON TARGET 3<br><br>11 SHOTS OFF TARGET 0<br><br>1 OFFSIDES 4<br><br>5 CORNERS 0<br><br>17 FOULS 16<br><br>2 YELLOW CARDS 3<br><br>0 RED CARDS 0<br><br>ATTENDANCE: 39,041<br><br>MAN OF THE MATCH: Mikel</div>
