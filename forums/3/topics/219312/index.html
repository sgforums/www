McFadden clearly said far too much for Poll's liking as he raced past the referee, who instantly produced a red card and Everton were down to 10 men.<br><br>Poll has now issued 66 yellow and three red cards this season, and this latest incident is also certain to be heavily scrutinised. </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Yet again a referee has managed to steal the limelight in a game that should be all about the players.

            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]Originally posted by ghimpheng:<br>[b]<span style="color: blue;">tribalfooball.com - November 07, 2006<br><br>Referee Graham Poll could be suspended over claims made by Chelsea about his performance on Sunday.<br>In an almost unprecedented move, Soho chiefs have stopped short of backing an official in a dispute and, instead, have called for evidence of wrongdoing.<br><br>Blues players insist Poll told them during the 2-1 defeat at Spurs that "their discipline is out of order and they needed to be taught a lesson."<br><br>Left-back Ashley Cole was extremely critical of Poll's decisions and cited comments made to team-mate Frank Lampard during the clash.<br>Poll has simply insisted he did not make the comment about 'teaching Chelsea a lesson'.<br>He also dismissed Cole's comments as 'tittle tattle'</span><br><br>I think poll didnt made the comments, chelsea needed to be taught a lesson. remember all refs carried a microphone with them, if he said that, it would be heard by the assistants and the ref assessor at the match, and also the commentators. CCTV or microphone dun lie, people do.<br><br>I think frankie and cole put words into poll's mouth, taking a cue from mourinho, who accuses frisks of entering into barcelona's dressing room at half time, or denying being at the same hotel with cole to discuss abt tranferring to chelsea from arsenal<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it look as if they're trying to bully the ref into something lor.. the way they behave is like they're above the law.. just like what happen to danish ref after the Barca match.. seriously.. i also agreed that Chelsea should be tot a lesson and i bet Roman will soon get tired with all these childish stuff and move on to something else.. by then lets see if Chelsea will still be able to act like a bully...<br><br>all teams, Man Utd included, has at some point in time be subjected to unfair decision and thats football lor.. its some of such decisions, together with some superb football and some funny momment that adds up to give the exictment in football with all these and by adding in the video and other technology advance stuff into football will be a certain extend takes away alot of fun from football.. and maybe by then, we'll be better off playing FM or CM game on the net..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>which team has not been on the receiving end of dubious ref decisions? does that mean ref hate all these teams?<br><br>if everytime u court a girl and they ignore you. maybe its not the girls' problem, it could be yours.<br><br>if everytime u leave the house and get knock down by the car. perhaps its not that drivers hate u, it might be your recklessness.</div>
