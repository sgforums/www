            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal's Wenger rubbishes Real Madrid Cole link<br>tribalfootball.com - February 25, 2006<br><br>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has played down speculation that left-back Ashley Cole was set to join Real Madrid.<br><br>Wenger said: "We have beaten Real Madrid and now my whole team is going to play in Madrid! The speculation is frustrating, but I cannot stop it, so it is better I do not worry about it. I feel he is more committed. His attitude has never been a problem to me this season.<br><br>"He was always highly focused and committed. In fairness, he was very unlucky because he had a very good start to the season. Unfortunately he got his injury."<br><br>He added: "He signed only a one-year extension because we had this problem to give him a pay rise and you can only do it by extending your contract.<br><br>"He wanted one year, if he had wanted three years, I would have given him three years. We settled down for that and to see where we go. But he still has two years to go from the end of the season - for me, it is not a real problem, frankly. At the end of the season he has two years, so we will start maybe in September or October."<br></div>
