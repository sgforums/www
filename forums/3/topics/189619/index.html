            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson left Ruud van Nistelrooy out of the line-up for the last day win over Charlton Athletic because he felt the Dutchman was upsetting the spirit at the club.<br><br>Ferguson appears to have made a ruthless decision regarding his top scorer, who drove away from Old Trafford when informed of the news and played no part in the 4-0 triumph.<br><br>Paul Scholes made his comeback from an eye problem as a second half substitute which pleased the Red Devils chief.<br><br>The United manager also remains hopeful Wayne Rooney will still feature in the World Cup finals after the striker walked around the pitch without crutches during the lap of honour.<br><br>"It was absolutely terrific," Ferguson stated to Sky Sports. "I enjoyed the game, the players enjoyed it.<br><br>"We've got second place, [going] directly into the Champions League, which is what we wanted anyway so it's been a satisfying day.<br><br>"Paul Scholes has been doing so well in training in the last two or three weeks, I felt it was essential, given the importance of the game, that, as a sub, he would be a good one if we needed him, he was going to be there.<br><br>"[As for van Nistelrooy], there have been a couple of issues during the week which concerned me in terms of the spirit at the club. It was such an important day but I felt Ruud should be left out. It's straightforward and all I need to say, at the moment.<br><br>"I'll be discussing it with the club directors tomorrow and Tuesday and that's it. We're going to discuss the whole thing - that's important."<br><br>As for Rooney, Ferguson admits it is still a long shot that the England striker will play some part in Germany.<br><br>"He's been having the oxygen treatment," said the Scot. "He's not enjoying it but he's doing it twice a day and shown great determination to try and get ready for the World Cup.<br><br>"We know it's a forlorn hope but we're giving it a try. I think that's fair enough [naming him in the preliminary England squad]. I would do the same if I was Sven [Goran Eriksson]. If he were to get fit, he's such a big player you'd have to have him there.<br><br>"Let's see how he gets on in the next couple of weeks."</div>

People dont hear much things about him because his beloved club Atletico de Madrid has been underachieving in the Spanish league for the past few seasons therefore deprieving this young starlet a chance to show case his talents in European club competitions.<br><br>From what I know, Torres is a type of striker who is not just good at poaching goals, but good with the ball at his feet as well. He likes to drift to the flanks occasionally to help out his fellow striker or teamates create goal scoring chances. A host of top european clubs are reportedly after him, namely Man Utd, Chelsea, Arsenal, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Newcastle and Tottenham Hotspurs<br><br>To sum it up, Torres possesses great pace and is technically very gifted. You will see more of him during the FIFA world cup that is for sure.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

In fact, he drops back numerous time to help out in the defence. It's frustration for a striker to play at his position in the long run. U provide him with service from the flanks, he shld be turning them into goals. And he is actually quite a tall and strong lad himself.</div>
