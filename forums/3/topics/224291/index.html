            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;"> tribalfooball.com - December 07, 2006<br><br>Real Madrid striker Ronaldo was back to his old best last night with a stunning brace as his team came from 2-0 down to draw with Dynamo Kiev.<br><br>"It was a difficult game, not because of the cold or the opposition, but because of the way we played," said Ronaldo afterwards. "In games like these it's hard to find the motivation because we were already qualified.<br><br>"The best thing is that in the second-half we have done well enough, we have dominated, we created enough chances, even to win. I believe that in the end we could have finished as winners if the game had gone longer."<br><br>On his great understanding with David Beckham, Ronaldo added: "It is unnecessary to praise Beckham. I have always understood him very well. Without looking he knows where I want the ball, he understands my movements very well.<br><br>"He sent very good passes to me and always finds me when I am unmarked."<br><br>On his own form, Ronaldo also said: "I feel good, I know what I must do, score goals and show that I continue being my old self. I believe that I can help with my goals for Madrid and little by little win a place for me within the team." </span><br><br>got so kua zhang ma ?</div>

It has been an average year with continuous injuries. Now it seems that things are going well. I am involved in the project and I want to continue being important to the team."<br><br>Asked about the demands of coach Fabio Capello, Ronaldo replied: "I like that he demands a lot from me. I always want that my trainer works me hard.<br><br>"He demands a lot from me, some times we do not understand eachother and we have to talk, but this is what happens in football. He is interested in me. I am an important player for him and he trusts me."<br><br>Of his critics, Ronaldo added: "When you score goals, you are great and when you don't you're fat. The only thing I can say is that I always work hard in training. If people want to criticise, I can't do anything about that."</span><br><br>@ least Ronaldo is not so fat now and run fast and scoring goals</div>
