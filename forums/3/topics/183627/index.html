            <div class='col-md body'>a football team is not just about a single person.<br><br>A striker that is good in one team may not be good in another,so what if shearer did good in blackburn and then newcastle?It does not means that he will be good in Manu.Or for that matter if he really went to Manu,would have actually caused Manu to not win some matches.<br><br>It is easy to say when Manu have won lots of trophies in the past decade and thinking if shearer was there,shearer would also have alot of trophies.But who is to say that if he was really there,Manu would actually not be that good and thus win nothing much?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, even as I booed Shearer for rejecting MUFC, I respect him for the decision.<br><br>he tried to win for his favourite club and due not to his errors, that never happen.<br><br>he would have won the world with MUFC, but he chose quality instead of quantity.<br><br>Kudos to a fanastic player, but I would have loved having him at MUFC.</div>
