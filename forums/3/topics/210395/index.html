At the time of his arrest, he was considered the most powerful of the Russian business oligarchs.<br><br>Abramovich see also sure got scare what... Abramovich said that he would not run for governor again after his term of office expired in 2005, as it is "too expensive".<br><br>However, Russian President Vladimir Putin changed the law to abolish elections for regional governors, and on October 2005 Abramovich was reappointed governor for another term cos in September 2005 Abramovich sold off his money making petroleum company Sibneft cheaply to the Russian-government controlled Gazprom.<br><br>The transaction is interpreted as indicating that he remains on good terms with President Vladimir Putin, unlike fellow-oligarch Mikhail Khodorkhovsky, who was recently jailed for nine years.<br><br>Abramovich, Of Jewish background, is a firm supporter of Jewish and Israeli causes, seen his funding of several projects in the Abramovich neighbourhood in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv... He probably thought it was safer to put his money in England &amp; Israel, far away from the Russian government.<br><br></div>
