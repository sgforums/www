            <div class='col-md body'>Well.. there are no MMA type matches here in Sg but there are 2 gyms that I know of.<br><br>Mixed Martial Arts Academy - Run by Darren Da Silva. Alot of training partners and a good mix between hardcore and leisure students. The only club with someone who has fought MMA in Indonesia before. Located at 41A North Canal Road, opp Speakers Corner. You can call Darren at 91852887. They recently had an advert in the New Paper. Darren also came out in an article there recently as well.<br><br>Contact Kinetics - Run by Chris De Wett, one of the top Kyokushin Full-Contact Karate fighters in Singapore. They do MMA too. Not sure of the standard though, but I heard it's not bad. Gym is located at the boxing gym in Farrer Park. Website is www.contactkinetics.com<br><br>You ask me, I'm a little biased cause I used to train at Darren's. But I suggest you check out both before making a decision. =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Went for the weigh in in the evening. Saw the fighters from overseas. Thusal...small size thai guys...one indonesian, one dutch boy and a tall south african guy. The pro fight match card is scheduled as:-<br><br>Match 1 will feature two thai guy sloggin it out in a 3min 5 round contest. Joy from BXG represnting Singapore will go against a thai guy from phuket camp. Joy hails from Nakhon Pahnom North East Thailand. KO specialist.<br><br>Match 2. Johnny's guy from Hilltop against an Indonesian guy. Sorry..I dun have much info on that.<br><br>Match 3. Steven Ong Lana's Camp from Singapore against another thai guy from phuket camp. Only know that Steven had stayed in thailand for a couple of years and he speaks thai better than english. His opponent looks pretty young and is also in pretty good shape.<br><br>Match 4. Zack handsome dude who trains together with us in BXG. His opponent is the South African guy. Both are in good shape. Both are also quite tall. And I know Zacks kick packs a awesome load of power.<br><br>Match 5. Joe from BXG will pair up with the Dutch guy. Well...The only thing I can say here is...Joe's is in superb shape and have dedicated in training for this fight. His body is awesome with no fats in side and he looks much more intimidating than his 'farang' oppponent.<br><br>Personal view...BXg guys should win their respective matches. Maybe I am a bit bias cos i am from bxg, but its their training and devotion to muay thai that i will put my bets on them.<br><br>For me? haha....I just be fighting for experince. Saw that most of the fighters are somehow nearly half my age!! Well....just wish all the fighters all the best and may the best fighter win their repective fight.<br><br>BTW, i apologise for wrong information. Dont think the local media will broadcast it live. That is my wishful thought.<br><br>Tickets are still available at Seletar Camp Mornington Club. Amatuer starts at 6pm...and estimatedfight for the pro will commence at 8pm...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys..result time... oh..i lost my first amatuer fight! damn...not aggresive enough...and worst part is i drop my contact lens halfway thru the 3rd round...and that was part of the reason i kena left right center!!But lucky no KO...So pai seh!! Now both legs stiff like hell...but credit to my opponent half my age..his aggression won the day...<br><br>ok to the pro fights.<br><br>Match 1. Joy from BXG vs Thai guy from phuket camp.<br><br>The game ended in a draw....very diplomatic fight...cos thai embassy was there....eh... those who were there will know that who is the better fighter...<br><br>Match 2. Hilltop vs Indonesia<br><br>Din really see the match. BUt i know that indonesian guy went on the mat...claiming he got kick in the grion... Hilltop won.<br><br>Match 3. Steven from Lana vs Thai guy<br><br>also din see much....but was closed...but i see that the thai boy landed his kick on target most of the times.... Thailand won.<br><br>Match 4. Zack vs South Africa.<br><br>Clash of heavy weights..Both at 70kg.Rare in muay thai for this cat. Zack did lots of damage to the angmoh with his powerful kicks. Very nice kick to the head. Zack won. Well done Zack!<br><br>Match 5. Joe from BXG vs Dutch boy.<br><br>To me..its a mismatch. The angmoh was totally outclass in the first round... He was lucky to survive from getting ko. Round 2 saw joe got a cut to his lips. But<br>still..the dutch boy is no match for Joe's powerful low kick and right punch.<br><br>Clear winner..Joe Bxg!<br><br>Well...rather awesome atmosphere....good crowd of around 400 plus ppl cramp in a hall.... Good experince for me also... oh yes..i will be back to compete....will have to train harder now....<br><br></div>

Even though you didn't win - it still takes alot of balls to step up and fight. Haha contact lenses, I sympathise man - what's your degree? I'm about 600 on each eye so it's a real b itch when that happens.<br><br>Btw, do you know how Tham Boon Kit did in the amateur bouts? My Kyokushin senior.</div>

My exams are starting soon. Won't have enough time to train. Plus, I heard the rules... Don't think anybody in their right mind would bother with it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Haha yah, I heard about the mix up. As for Muay Thai exposure, I heard there are more events lined up next year? Cool man... Maybe there'll be a league.<br><br>Haha just need to allow gambling and confirm Muay Thai will become one of the top sports here.</div>
