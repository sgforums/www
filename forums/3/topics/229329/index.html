            <div class='col-md body'>the signs are that all not is well in chelsea, especially with suspensions, loss of form, injuries and dressing room revolt (sure some players will not be happy after Mourinho blasted them in public for their poor performances, especially Ballack, Sheva, Boularouz, Ferrera, Hilario, Geremi, Kalou, SWP), it doesnt help Chelsea's cause, either he is hoping to galvanise so that will raise their performances, or it may backfire on him, its a double edge sword and reverse psychology.<br><br>The signs are there, when Cech is out since Oct, Terry out for almost 1 month, Cole out for the season. injuries to key players does not help, but Chelsea shd be able to cope as they have the money and the squad to cope when the key players are out injured. Other teams like Man City, West Ham, or Bolton can only dream of having squad players like SWP, Kalou, Mikel, bridge, cudicini, Boularouz, Ferrera waiting in the wings or on the bench waiting to be called upon, so thats not an excuse to use for loss of form. He shd have kept Huth, but heck he sold Huth to Boro, and also Duff to magpies. I suppose he must have regreted it as he didnt forsee that injuries would affect his choice  of players this season.<br><br>I still think 6 points is not  a lot, but when Man U travel to Chelsea still 6 points ahead, it is out of Chelsea hands, ie they will be hoping other teams can do them a favour by drawing or beating Man U. Momemtum is with Man U now, but there is still a long way to go. Its in Man U hands now,  whether or not they will land the title come May, thats the million dollar question isnt it.<br>They do not have to depend on other teams drawing or beating Chelsea, as they only need to concentrate on their own results and matches. If they keep on winning and concentrating on their own results, then there is a great chance for them to win the epl title come May  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
