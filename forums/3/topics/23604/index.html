I hv many frens who used to support Forest(when they were a good team of course!) and when forest was relegated, they switch to supporting ManU... no character in my opinion...<br><br>For those loyal Liverpool fans out there, I wud think our sufferings will be over in 2 seasons time(this season excluded)... Houllier is moving in the right dirn and the youngsters are maturing all the time... give them some time...<br><br>besides being a Liverpool supporter, I also support AC Milan(Italy), Real Madrid(Spain) and Ajax(Holland).<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

So to all Man U fans out there...enjoy your dominance while u can...you may be on top...but u cannot stay there forever  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Most of the Premiership clubs are catching up with Man U in terms of quality, and it would be unlikely that Man U would enjoy the same degree of luck as seen in last season's (lucky) treble.<br><br>Anyways, I for one would be very keen to watch the league match between Arsenal and Man U at Trafford on 24th Jan 2000. I would not speculate on the results here, but without excessive suspension/injuries to the Gunners, I'm very sure Man U won't be in for an easy ride  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>May any Team but Man U win the premiership this season!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br></div>

Through thick and thin...<br><br>unlike some Man U fans I know... they'll proudly wear the Man U jersey after a victory but won't even touch it when Man U loses.<br><br>I'm not against the club... just that I can't stand the arrogance of the fans and players like Beckham, Scholes, Butt, Neville brothers... The English versions of our local Chow Ah Bengs!<br><br>IMHO, Beckham doesn't even deserve to be nominated as best player in england, he can produce some fine crosses.. but let's face it, he's not as good as what most media make him out to be... KANU is soooo much better... heck! I would prefer Stephen Hughes over beckham anytime!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ppl. Too bad I am a Man U fan. I have been supporting them since the 80's when they were actually winning nothing. To be honest, I am also very disappointed in all the others so called Man U fans. These are not true fans. They only jump on to the bandwagon when our team started to win.<br><br>However, to all the fans of the other clubs, let's be honest....all winning team display arrogance....they deserve it...its been like that for ages and it will be for many more years to come.<br><br>My advice to all true soccer fans...support your team, but let's not be childish and start hating the winning teams...everyone will have their day of feeling proud that their supported club is doing well.<br><br>Liverpool fans had it their way back in the 80's...weren't they also arrogant and taunting us Man U fans? Fact is, the world is round and all non Man U fans will have their chance...let's face it, Man U won't win forever...but that won't stop me from supporting them anyhow.<br><br>Let's be real soccer fans...not some childish supporters or haters.</div>
