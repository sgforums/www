            <div class='col-md body'>well, Ajax will always reign in my heart...but Man U is a sentimental favorite, while England holds court in terms of favorite nation...although it also means having to suffer the countless heartaches in following the rocky-as-hell adventure of the English national team...*sigh*<br><br>hmmm...as always, genuine Man U supporters are getting bashed and kicked around = P<br>but it is rather unfair, with the exception of those so-called fans of Man U or Lazio, or Bayern or whoever is on top.  like someone said earlier, there are these pretenders out there who supports a team/country merely by judging who is on top.  i know a guy who right after the France vs Croatia SF, went out to a shirt importer and ordered the World Cup French team shirt with Zidane's name and number...and he declared himself a French fan for life...but when Brazil won the Copa America, guess who is his new "favorite" team is...?<br><br>but on the other hand, my teacher at my old HS is not only a fan of Man U, he's a die-hard...he's 64 years old and he's been following them since his days as a young lad, from the days of the Munich air disaster, through the glory days of the Busby Babes and the George Best show...he was there at Wembley when Man U defeated Benfica (i think...either that or FC Porto) to win the European Cup...but before that, Man U was a bit of a joke in the league, they got relegated a few times, but he stuck with them...and now, he's enjoying the fruits of success by the team.  can anyone tell it to my teacher's face, that he's a ManUre?<br><br>anyways, rivaling teams are what makes football tick, but genuine fans should not be mistaken for the in-sincere ones.  like Sir Matt Busby once said, "all's fair in love and war, but not football...".<br>that shouldn't be taken out of context.<br>=)<br><br>------------------<br>the statement below is true.<br>the statement above is false.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pluckaduck (edited 13-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i am part of an anti-leeds alliance in another board and here are are the reasons.<br><br>1. The furore over the release of players last season for the World U-20 Championships<br>in Nigeria. O'Leary dug his heels in over two of the Irish squad, Paul Donnolly and<br>Stephen McPhail, and completely overreacted, claiming their release would cost his<br>team a UEFA Cup place. This despite the fact that Donnolly was let go on a free at the<br>end of the season, and McPhail was hardly a first-team regular in the run-in.<br><br>2. They blackmail Aussie teenagers and force them to take out UK citizenship, so that<br>they cannot represent Australia at international level.<br><br>3. The re-arrangement of all three of their UEFA Cup away ties were as a result of<br>Leeds's various objections, based on flimsy evidence.<br><br>4. Kewell dived to win that penalty against Derby, and O'Leary was unapologetic<br>afterwards.<br><br>5. Players withdrawing from international squads because of phoney injuries. Ian Harte was almost certainly prompted by O'Leary to withdraw from the Irish squad because of a so-called back injury. Well, Harte seemed in perfectly good nick against Bradford the following Saturday!<br><br>6. Their fans and the sick songs they sing about the Munich Air Disaster.<br><br>7. The behaviour of one or two of their players off the field is unbecoming of a<br>professional footballer. I'm thinking of Lee Bowyer, in particular.<br><br>8. O'Leary's post-match interviews are drab, and not at all as innocent as they're intended to sound.<br><br>9. They've ridden their luck for most of this season,<br><br>10. In November 1999 the club blamed everyone but itself for Kewell not playing for<br>Australia. They went on to add that they fully support International teams and are<br>proud of their players for representing their country.<br>However on their own website in March 1999, David O'Leary stated that he didn't like<br>players getting picked for internationals and that they were being burnt out. He went<br>on to add that the club would not release players if they could help it. (Hypocracy)<br><br>11. In March 1999 it was only with the intervention of FIFA that players were released for Ireland U20 side competing in the World Youth Cup. FIFA threatened a fifteen point penalty.<br><br>12. Lucas Radebe had a similar issue as Kewell when travelling to South Africa last<br>year.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm so incensed at the comments David O'Leary made after that game against Derby "...we played better on the night, and that fella brought Kewell down, thank you very much, we'll take the three points then..." (say it with a thick Irish accent and you'll know just how arrogant and condescending he is liao...)<br><br>it's just one of the many reasons why Leeds United should be ashamed of themselves.  i support Kewell cuz he's an Aussie, but i can't tolerate him diving...hell, i think blatant diving should get a red-card like a tackle from behind would.<br><br>but coming back to Kewell, i'm so pissed off cuz time and time again O'Leary prevents Kewell from returning home...so frsutrating lah...esp against Brazil a month ago.  i have no doubts whatsoever that he was persuaded, perhaps even threatened, by the club officials not to travel to Australia.  all that even after Soccer Australia threatened to invoke the FIFA ban on Kewell...and consequently, he was banned from the match against Bradford City, but even then Leeds still tried to talk its way out of the suspension, stating that the period of time between the suposed international is more than 5 days, which is the max number of days a player's suspension can take place. ie. it has to take place within a 5 day period after the disputed international game.  and this has been a problem with Leeds for a long time, and it's not only Australia, O'Leary gives virtually everyone a hard time when it comes to releasing players for international duty...which is ironic, since O'Leary himself played a lot of internationals for Republic of Ireland...<br><br>i have nothing against Leeds' players, i think it's wonderful to see young lads beating the older players, but i can't stand the arrogance and the pompous attitude exerted by the club officials, especiall O'Leary and Peter Risdale (the chairman).<br>it's time that Leeds are reprimanded by UEFA or FIFA...and i think it's time for Kewell to find a new club if he wants his international career to blossom, i'm sure there'll be dozens of clubs who wants his signature.<br><br>------------------<br>the statement below is true.<br>the statement above is false.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, I would like to tell everyone not to refer to the wonderful game of FOOTBALL as the pirated American version of SOCCER!!!<br><br>The game is called FOOTBALL, not SOCCER! Please, if you were even much of a fan, you would know the correct term is FOOTBALL, heck, go to UK and say soccer and you'd probably be laughed at like no tommorrow.<br><br>Secondly, I would like to say that I'm totally put off by Serie A Italian football.<br>If you'd notice now that the players dive at every single little tiny nudge. That's bloody pathetic! And the bloody referees allow it too! Thats so damn crap.<br>If you wanna enjoy some skilful football, I would recommend you go watch Spanish football, especially those of lower standings<br><br>Thirdly, It seems that the fans in Singapore all seem to be either Man Ure, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea or Leeds fans.... Hmmmm, how surprising!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>
