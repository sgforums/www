              <p>Its another stalemate and the longer it remain unsolved it will look bad for Singapore's sporting reputation - The Singapore Brand!</p>
              <p><em>ST - Just when it looked as if they were headed for a peaceful resolution, developments between the Singapore Table Tennis Association (STTA) and former head coach Liu Guodong took a new twist on Sunday.</em></p>
              <p><em>Following STTA’s refusal to nominate Liu for Coach of the Year honours and comments made by table tennis chief Lee Bee Wah about Liu, the 35—year—old had returned to Singapore from China last Thursday to seek a meeting with his former employers.</em></p>
              <p><em>Liu met with STTA’s honorary secretary Soon Min Sin and chief executive officer Chew Soo Sheng on Friday and after it ended, he described the meeting as "cordial and friendly" and expressed confidence the STTA would accept his conditions.</em></p>
              <p><em>Both parties met for a second discussion on Saturday night, but this time, Liu emerged from it flustered and angry.</em></p>
              <p><em>"They (STTA) brought an English document over, which I couldn’t read as I don’t understand English and I got someone to help look at it," said Liu, who showed a copy of the letter to reporters on Sunday.</em></p>
              <p><em>The draft letter, which was to be a joint statement from the STTA and Liu, stated that the association acknowledged the contributions of the former coach in guiding the women’s team to the Olympic silver medal at last year’s Beijing Games.</em></p>
              <p><em>It also said that the STTA have the right to choose who to nominate for the Singapore Sports Awards, and that they stood by their decision not to nominate Liu.</em></p>
              <p><em>The letter also said that comments made about coach Liu were not in any way meant to take away his contributions to Singapore table tennis, nor were they meant to suggest any acts of dishonesty on his part.</em></p>
              <p><em>The former coach has taken issue with the letter’s contents.</em></p>
              <p><em>"I’m not happy with a large part of this document. Them saying I understand their decision not to nominate me, it means I’m guilty and I’m not pursuing it. I told them to tell me why I didn’t get it, bring some evidence and show me. This document is what I get after two discussions, should I be continuing with the discussions?"</em></p>
              <p><em>Liu, now coach of the Indonesian national team, also questioned the sincerity of the STTA.</em></p>
              <p><em>"After two discussions, Lee Bee Wah wasn’t even present once. I think with this attitude, they say one thing, and then mean another. They have not honestly acknowledged this matter. I will not sign anything with them because I have no relationship with them."</em></p>
              <p><em>Liu goes back to China for the China Table Tennis Super League tournament and to resume training with the Indonesian team on Tuesday.</em></p>
              <p><em>He says he is still not satisfied and plans to return to Singapore to pursue the matter, although he did not give a date.</em></p>
              <p><em>STTA could not be reached for comment.</em></p>
              <p>If STTA thinks that they are right in not awarding Him... just let him sue! Say we will see each in court then!</p>

              <p>STTA probably made him an offer(compensation) to shut the f... up.</p>
              <p>And the greedy China man was not happy because he wanted more.</p>
              <p>LBW must be really stupid, not to know the consequences of making such a remarks. She should have just let sleeping dogs lie.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>This is Singapore style. Official is the King. They should try to be relax abit not let people feel that there is authority everywhere. The Chinese coach had done very well which winning a very first silver medal under his good guides. He hav to balance the pro and con to acheive not the official. LBW CB mouth should be sewed. She started the comment to the press without having close door investigation first. This is not the corrcet way a organisation way to release news. LBW should face the coach or the press when his in singapore and talk it out clearly to him and not hiding. This kind of management will keep Singapore sports at Singapore level only. One small breakthrough only already strated so much problem. If win 3 olympic gold, Singapore will become war zone. STTA spokesman have to bear the backfire started by her.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>SG wanted gold why dont concentrate on individual sports first like Tennis, Golf and other sport that u can define potential winner more easily. Individual sport hav less worry and the sportsman know he win or lose is by himself only( Prize money no need to share also).Waste so much money in team of many ppl and still worry cannot control (Player that are very obedient YES SIR/NO SIR only) better must know how to three legged to the management. Team loss, the ppl hav many reason for excuse ( Defender sleeping, Coach no gd, Goal keeper lousy, Ball too big?)</p></div>
