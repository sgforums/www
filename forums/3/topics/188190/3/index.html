Don't know how many million paid and not first class? What you mean first class? Now you say Man U got first class? What you talking bruder? Lampard, Crespo, Drogba, Joe Cole, Robben, Duff, Makelele, Essien, Terry, all second class, no class? If you consider Fletcher first class, then I hope Chelsea are willing to pay millions and millions for him. Man U gladly to sell. Chelsea good lah correct no doubt. Better then Man U. But how they get so good? Money lor... Not say Man U no money but a lot of business minded people inside lah, cannot release the funds.. If not Robben, Essien, Ronaldinho, inside Man U already, you think Chelsea still be winning? It is an open fact that Chelsea's successes are partly due to the ease they can get their talent with money. Don't say its the manager lah. Partly yes it can be the manager, stupid Ranieri, got all the money in the world don't know how to use it, but you throw Wenger or Fergie inside Chelsea, they can win things also lah.. Be realistic..<br>Understand lah, now Chelsea win can suka suka flame Man U lah flame this flame that. But I doubt it will be for long.

But for your info, Ronaldinho chooses to go Barca even if Man Utd wants to fork out the money for him. He mentioned before that he wanted to emulate form greats like Rivaldo, Figo, Stiochkov, Romario, Johan Cruff (not Jordi Cruff), Maradona by playing for Barca. Now he has truly joined them in the list of some of the greatest players who wore the Barca shirt.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Indeed in some aspects they sometimes do disgrace the game of football, but NOT IN ALL aspects like the anti-chelsea fans claimed. To say everything is bad about Chelsea in every aspect is naive to say the least.  Give credit when its due, and criticise when it is neccessary.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Note: Not a Chelsea fan</div>
