            <div class='col-md body'>Steven Gerrard has set his Liverpool team-mates the challenge of overcoming their Champions League heartbreak to make sure they are back in the competition next season.<br>The Reds' defence of their crown ended against Benfica on Wednesday night as they failed to overturn a 1-0 first leg deficit and crashed to a 2-0 defeat on the night, despite creating a host of first half chances.<br><br>Gerrard admits their failure to score an early goal ultimately proved costly, but he insists there's no time to dwell on the disappointing defeat with a crucial league game to come at Arsenal this weekend.<br><br>"The fans were superb tonight and got behind us - but when you are 1-0 down it is important to get a goal," he said.<br><br>"We created two or three chances in the first 20 minutes - and when they don't go in and they score you start to worry.<br><br>"Good luck to them, but it is very frustrating. We never took our chances - we could not put them away.<br><br>"It is a lack of confidence, and I think we need to work on it - extra shooting sessions in training, I think.<br><br>"We need to pick ourselves up. The FA cup becomes even more important now; we need a trophy.<br><br>"And of course we want to finish the league season strongly because we want to be back in Europe again next year.
