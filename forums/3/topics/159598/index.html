            <div class='col-md body'>It's really strange that they have not won the title since 1989. They are a team of great players. Not only quality but quantity as well. Without Adriano, they have Martins, Cruz, Recoba. Definitely no lack of quantity in the strikers department. I believe about the internal conflict thing though. I guess that's what happens when there are too many national team players in the team, especially when there are Argentinians and Brazilians. A team like Inter shouldn't even lose to the likes of Juve or Milan at home, let alone Roma. Title contenders every season, but always disappointment for their fans. Sad.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that the problem lies with the players' ego, they dont work or play as a team, well maybe some of them, a few years ago when Lippi was in charge of Inter, he said that most of the Inter players were arrogant and that they have the superstar mentality.<br><br>Indisipline is also a factor, but maybe an Inter fan would be the best person to tell us what he thinks is wrong with his beloved club :-)</div>
