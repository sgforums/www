            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo has been quoted in the Spanish press as saying he is ready to leave Old Trafford to move to Real Madrid.<br><br>The Spanish giants are currently in the process of finding a new president and the Portuguese World Cup winger says he will pursue a move to the Bernabeu if candidate Juan Miguel Villar Mir is elected as the chosen man.<br><br>Ronaldo is seen as a crucial cog in Sir Alex Ferguson's long term plans with The Red Devils, and his apparent decision to leave The Premiership will come as a shock after he penned a contract extension on November.<br><br>Currently in Germany preparing for a World Cup quarter final with England on Saturday, Ronaldo has now voiced his desire to bring an end to his time at Old Trafford as he closes in on his fourth season under Ferguson.<br><br>"I have told my agent I am prepared to leave. I want to do it in the best manner possible," Ronaldo is quoted as saying by Marca.<br><br>"I want to play for Real Madrid and dream of doing so.<br><br>"I have gone with Villar Mir's project because it is serious and follows correct procedures.<br><br>"They have explained to me their plans and the next step is they will talk to Manchester United to open negotiations.<br><br>"Other candidates wanted me to sign a document which is not legal. Villar Mir has promised me he will talk to the club and all we have done is talk through an agent."<br><br>Villar Mir has emerged as one of the front-runners for the Bernabeu's top job, and Ronaldo's declaration could well galvanise his campaign as all the hopefuls make their election pledges.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">here is the rumours part, but then again, i suspect that it could be a ploy used in the presidential race to gather votes just as perez did when he promised to sign figo few years ago.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes i understand that it was reported but this is just speculation from the spainish media<br>which the uk media pick up to report. It is nothing new to read such report coming from spain especially<br>during an election for president of the club. It has become a trend in spain where the candidates promise<br>this player that managerÂ…etcÂ… This same candidate Villar Mir has also said he have a deal with<br>Arsene Wenger to take over as manager if he wins but Ansene has since came out to deny it<br>and have also pledge his future to arsenal. So what more can we expect from this Mr Villar Mir?<br><br>And on the Ronaldo issue, you can read this at the Manchester utd web page.<br><br><div>code:<pre>United are Â“astonishedÂ” at comments from Juan Miguel Villar Mir,<br>a Real Madrid presidential candidate, claiming he is in talks with the<br>club over a deal to take Cristiano Ronaldo to the Bernabeu.<br>Spanish newspaper Marca carried quotes from the United winger claiming<br>a deal would be done to take the 21-year-old to the Santiago Bernabeu if Juan<br>Miguel Villar Mir is voted in. However, a known political tactic in the past<br>has been for presidential candidates to promise big-name signings.<br>On Tuesday Villar Mir claimed the reports were true, saying: "With Cristiano Ronaldo<br>it's all correct, as he himself has recognised.<br>We are acting by respecting the norms of FIFA. Manchester know that we<br>are talking to him."United immediately countered Villar MirÂ’s<br>remarks, unequivocally denying being in talks over a deal for the 21-year-old.<br>"Manchester United is astonished with Villar Mir comments," the club said<br>in a statement.<br><br>"There has been no contact between Manchester United, his election<br>team and or Real Madrid and any suggestion there has is incorrect.<br>"Unfortunately these tactics seem to be a common occurrence in elections<br>of this nature.<br>"Ronaldo has signed a long term contract until June 2010 and will be<br>a player with Manchester United next season."</pre></div><br><br>As for Ruud, no need to say, everyone knows united are trying to find a club that will take him of their hands.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be honest, Ronaldo if he does leave which I donÂ’t think he will wouldnÂ’t be very much of a problem. Cos looking at how Ronaldo plays, he has a lot of talent and he can move with the ball really well but the thing is he likes to show off a little and by the time he gets the ball into the opponents box, the defenders would have probably returned to cover, giving very little chance for the counter attack to succeedÂ… Watching last 2 seasons, offen i see united starts a counter attack then ronaldo would hold up the ball then the chance is lost. Honestly, I prefer the Beck style more where he rush up and cross early giving cole, york &amp; rvn better chances befor the defenders get backÂ…<br><br>If man u can get 25 of 30 M for him, I feel they should sell him and go get Aaron Lennon from spurs which of course they may not be keen to sell. But maybe 15 to 20M and Lennon asking for a transfer may then be possible.<br><br>But the player they must not lose is Rooney. He is now the heartbeat of the team since Keane left.<br></div>

If man U can get 8 - 12M for him happy liao. Afterall they already got 12M for nothing from chelsea for some john guy... and with another 8M, they can use the money to buy another good striker right.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Ronaldo as he really show off too much.... look at what a bad world cup they both had?<br><br>It will be good if they both can fetch 40m?<br><br>Then go for Torres to replace RVN, Maxi to replace c.ronaldo....</div>
