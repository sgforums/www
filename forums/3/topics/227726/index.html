But he gave Chelsea a hard time.<br><br>"Emile does an awful lot of unselfish work and he can sometimes take on a bit too much and be too much of a team player. He thinks about the other players and the team too much and I would rather him be more greedy and more selfish. That's what we have been telling him this week.<br><br>"When we are having a good run, he is involved in most of the things we do, whether it be a cross or a header or good movement.<br><br>"I know he has his critics and people question his goals record, but from a manager's point of view, he works his tail off. Let's face it, if he got the goals he should get, he might not be here," added Jewell, whose side are 13th in the table.<br><br>"He can head it, he can shoot with either foot and he is quick and strong. If he gets 10 goals a season, Camara gets ten and McCulloch gets eight, we'll be OK."<br><br>While Jewell is focusing upon his problems in the forward department ahead of Tuesday's clash, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has an embarrassment of riches from which to select in that area.<br><br>Wayne Rooney was rested at Villa Park although he still saw action as a second half substitute and the indications are that he will return to the starting line-up against Wigan.<br><br>Ferguson, whose side are two points clear of Chelsea at the top, has also moved swiftly to counter suggestions that England midfielder Michael Carrick faces a lengthy spell out with an ankle injury.<br><br>"Michael was back in light training on Friday and has a slight problem with his ankle," said Ferguson. "He will be back for the Reading game but reports that he's going to be out for a month are rubbish."<br><br>The United veteran remains a firm fan of Wigan and their highly-rated manager Jewell although Ferguson agreed with his opposite number's recent assertion that managers are placed under the spotlight excessively in the modern game.<br><br>"The thing about Wigan is you always seem to get common sense from them," said Ferguson. "Whether it's (owner) David Whelan or Paul Jewell, and they seem to work in tandem very well. He was talking this morning about managers and how over-rated they are and that they get too much credit.<br><br>"And he's absolutely 100 percent correct, it's players that win you games," said the Scot. "We all contribute as managers, of course we do but I think he's right. Paul's done a terrific job at Wigan but I think more credit should be given to the players rather than the managers. Apart from myself of course!"</span></div>

Jose Mourinho's team are still counting the cost of their last encounter with the Royals, when both the Londoners' first-choice goalkeepers Cech and Carlo Cudicini were hospitalised after clashes with Stephen Hunt and Ibrahima Sonko respectively. - AFP<br><br>Chelsea have been ice-cool in their pursuit of a third consecutive Premiership title but Tuesday's meeting with Reading here at Stamford Bridge promises to test their temperament to the limit.<br><br>Jose Mourinho's team are still counting the cost of their last encounter with the Royals in October, when both the Londoners' first-choice goalkeepers Petr Cech and Carlo Cudicini were hospitalised after clashes with Stephen Hunt and Ibrahima Sonko respectively.<br><br>Cech has not played since after fracturing his skull in the collision with Hunt - with Mourinho angrily accusing the Irishman of deliberately attempting to hurt the Czech international - and the repercussions from that match are still rumbling on.<br><br>A police investigation into a series of death threats sent to Hunt and Sonko, apparently by disgruntled Chelsea supporters, is still ongoing, while Mourinho has refused to retract his criticisms of both the former Crystal Palace winger and the standard of healthcare at the Madejski Stadium, which he felt had endangered the lives of his players.<br><br>Steve Coppell, the Reading manager, has no intention of resting the duo for the trip to west London, despite the possibility they will be targeted by the home supporters. Hunt, for one, is expecting a reaction.<br><br>"People have singled me out for little things that normally people wouldn't make a fuss over," he said. "I don't know why they do it and I wish everyone would just let me get on with playing.<br><br>"The collision was just one of those things and an awful lot of games have been played since then. I'm an honest player - I'm going to play hard but I will also be fair."<br><br>The simmering acrimony between the two clubs creates a spicy backdrop to an occasion which is already crucial in determining Chelsea's hopes of retaining the title.<br><br>Chelsea have failed to sparkle for much of the season but their character has never been in doubt.<br><br>In their last two league matches, a pair of 3-2 victories away to Everton and Wigan have been plucked virtually out of thin air.<br><br>But another win in the early kick-off on Boxing Day will see them displace Manchester United at the top of the table, although Sir Alex Ferguson's side could regain the lead when they meet Wigan two hours later.<br><br>The championship race is tantalisingly poised ahead of the English game's traditionally stuffed Christmas schedule, but Didier Drogba, the Chelsea forward, harbours no doubts over his side's prospects.<br><br>"The race for the title is just between Manchester United and us but before long we will take over the leadership and United will be finished," he said.<br><br>"The matches this Christmas will be decisive but our team is very concentrated and united. This is the reason for our success: I warn everyone that we want to win all the competitions this season."<br><br>But if that was fighting talk, Drogba has also shown a rare talent for peace-making by claiming Hunt does not deserve to be abused for the incidents in October.<br><br>"Chelsea are not seeking revenge in this game," added the Ivory Coast international, scorer of 17 goals so far this season.<br><br>"I want to forget the incidents in the first match and the injuries to our goalkeepers and I hope Hunt does not have problems at Stamford Bridge. Let this be a normal home game in which we add three points."</span></div>

My wife has stayed with me for 11 years so six points from these two games is definitely possible!"<br><br>Royals skipper Graeme Murty agrees that his team-mates should keep faith with the tactics that have put them in the top half of the table at the halfway point.<br><br>"The manager has challenged us to have the mentality to go there and win, or will we just put our backs to the wall and gut it out?" he said on official website, www.readingfc.co.uk.<br><br>"We want to go and express ourselves."<br><br>The match takes centre stage on a full day of Premiership football, as the first fixture between the two clubs at the Madejski Stadium saw Petr Cech carried off on a stretcher with a fractured skull following a challenge by Stephen Hunt.<br><br>Hunt has since received death threats, as has Ibrahima Sonko after the centre-back injured substitute goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini later in the match. </span></div>

He shld have let Hilario take the ball.  The cross was to no one in particular, there isn't any Reading players behind.  The ball flew of Lita's head, I think.<br><br>And you are right.  Ferdinand, Brown and most recently Neville scored own goals.  its unfortunate type of thing, you suay you genna.  Tough luck.<br><br>But I still want to underline the fact that Chelsea given its credentials, should have packed the game up long time ago and shouldn't be leading just 2-1 before conceding the own goal.</div>
