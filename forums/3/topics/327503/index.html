              <p>After watching the table tennis game between us Singapore vs Koreans,</p>
              <p>a sudden thought suddenly came across my mind.Did we really won?</p>
              <p>First of all, the coach Liu Guo Dong is from China.He's the brother of China's head coach of China table tennis team Liu Guo Liang.</p>
              <p>Second, all our players are from China.From the guys to the Womens.Not one are true born Singaporeans.Even our only local Cheng Pei Feng was not seen anywhere during the match.I wonder isit because she had to make way for more better China imported player?If this is the reason, so that mean she wont ever get to gain more experience even if she might lost.Is this the right kind of Olympic spirit?</p>
              <p>Just to win the stupid medal, we had to ask our local Cheng Pei Feng to make way for China import?</p>
              <p>I am a table tennis player myself, and i know the in and out of our STTA.If you guys can do some scotting into the STTA, you guys will be surprise that all the players, from the coach to the assistant coach, players, players sparing parthers all are import from China.Their proud attitude will sure piss you off because i myself experience it before.They really think that we had to rely on them to get the medals and so, that make them more proud to call themselves China born.</p>
              <p>Because of our 'medal mined' government, they themselves(China imports) know very well that they are the one who will bring us medal, and if without them, we will not get any medals.And that make them more despise on us the Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>And you think they will want to be a true Singaporeans given that we are really so lousy that we can't produce good quality sportmens?</p>
              <p>Just imagine this, the head of our coach is the brother of the china's head coach.</p>
              <p>You think he will want to fight against his own brother or let's say his own country?</p>
              <p>He himself already admited to the reporters that his mission is already completed and that he is very happy he helped Singapore to get the medal.And he will not even think of getting the gold.</p>
              <p>What kind of attitude is that?I wonder if that is what we want to hear from a head coach.Is this the right attitude to surrender even before a bullet is fire?</p>
              <p>Even if China team is so strong, isit the right way to say we are not their match and our mission is accomplished?The true fact is, because he is not local born and he wont put in the effort to do more.Because he's only paid to do what he suppose to do.That's the problem with importers.</p>
              <p>The Koreans even through they lost, i think i respect them more than our own team.</p>
              <p>They fight with their own locals.They rely on their own local coach.They are not highly paid and they did not get the sum of money our own team get if they won the medal.Don't believe me, can go and do a check.Their government did not give them million to fight for the gold.They do it because they know they love their country and they calll themselves the Koreans.And they are proud of it.This is the true spirit of Olympic sport.</p>
              <p>Our government not only teach us the bad way, but also spoil the table tennis market by importing whole lots of China players just to get the medal to boast their own face.By putting the million on the table, our government is telling the world, without money, you can't be loyal.Haha, and that's why our MP is so highly paid because they only can be loyal if they are highly paid! Is that so, my Singapore Government???To all who read my post, please circulate this post and let the whole Singapore and better still the whole world know what our government is doing.let them know our government is so afraid of not getting any medal they had to resort to this kind of low level action. ;)</p>

              <p>if you will to ask, our fore-father were also from China, if you are a Chinese. So it really didin't matter if they won under the Singapore citizenship. Let's just hope they stay a Singaporean after all these and become a true Singaporean with with children born in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Today, the world is getting smaller and we are also being globalise. SIngapore to China is mere 4-5 hours apart. Look at all the world cup/european cup etc sports. How many are also imports.</p>

              <p>I agree with you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Medals so what? At the expense of diluted national pride.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's not just that these people are not Singapore-born. They did not even immigrate here the normal way. They were bought by the country, much like commodity, for lack of a better phrase, it's true.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What pride about that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If they can be arrogant about being china-born as a differentiating factor and that's why they can win the medal, ask them why are they here? Would CHina have given them the chance? Their chances are sponsored with SINGAPOREAN money, without which they would be nothing, for they are china rejects. That's why they come here. No need to feel superior. Just feel grateful that we accepted their coming,gave them a home, and taught (or least paid for them to learn) them how to get a medal!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I stopped watching the NDP since about 10 years ago. No longer interested in a country that thinks everything can be bought.</p>
              <p>Welcome to Singapore, where things and just about anything can be bought!</p>

              <p>I feel the same too - winning through foreign talents just isn't
              quite the same.<br> Their achievements may boost our morale and national pride for now
              but like what the threadstarter said, they're probably doing
              it more for the money than for Singapore.<br> Afterall, would they have come all the way here from China if
              not for the "carrots" which our govt dangled in
              front of them?<br> So similarly, other countries can dangle better
              "carrots" and our medallist will probably
              leave.<br> The public may not realise the significance behind this right now,
              but one fine day they might just find our
              present medalist (whom they had cheered their hearts and lungs
              out for) playing against us instead. Won't that
              be ironic? <br> Just like how valuable soccer players get traded around,
              allegiance becomes a matter of who's able to pay
              you more.<br> <br> Some people may say that Singapore started out with
              immigrants, so it's not a strange thing that we have new immigrants
              joining us and becoming a part of us.<br> It's true but these new immigrants have a different agenda from the
              rest of us who grew up here. They know perfectly well that if they
              don't perform, they have no value to us and will probably be sent
              back when their contract ends.<br> So it is any surprise at all that they should feel no sense of
              belonging to Singapore?</p>

I feel that the only solution to this issue is after helping us win the medal, we take back their citizenship, dont pay them any money at all, sack the coach, and deport them all back to china. motherfucking chinese people. i buy meat ball porridge from them purposely give me damn little, then ownself eat all the meatball. fuckheads.</div>

              <p>Its not a matter of playing sports to be Singaporean or be Singaporean then play sports. Ultimately they all want to be here, for whatever reason they have. I'm not God and I don't know them personally so i can't tell whether they will leave.</p>

              The natives, together with immigrants from China, India and other
