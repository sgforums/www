              <p>Nope. As said, their shirt have a singapore flag. Tat makes it a target, something to root for in the olympics. If there is no such team, then we would probably be working, no one cares about the olympic and the thread here will be scolding the gov for doing too little to cultivate sports</p>

              <p>it has to do with your national sports policy, stupid. if singapore do not have a pro-sports policy, nothing will lift singapore out of the doldrums.</p>
              <p>just to give you a positive spin so you don't think i am anti-singapore thru' and tru'. i do think singapore will breed a local world champ in the next 10 years via the sports school program. in fact, we already have world beaters in bowling.</p>
