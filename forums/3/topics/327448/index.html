              EVEN as Beijing Olympic swimming finalist Tao Li (picture)
              worries about catching up with her school work, plans are afoot to
              ensure that Singapore’s raw diamond is not left behind by her
              international rivals in the pool.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              And a possible million-dollar
              makeover of the teenager is in the offing as she prepares for London
              2012. The sum being bandied about to ensure that the 18-year-old
              butterfly specialist finishes on the podium at the London Games will go
              towards high performance coaching and support, sports medicine and
              sports science (SMSS), nutrition and strength and conditioning, and
              overseas training and competition.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Singapore Sports Council (SSC)
              high performance chief Wayde Clews told Today that money is not to be
              an issue as the SSC will pull out all the stops in helping the swimmer
              push for Olympic glory.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “<span style="color: #ff0000;">Money will not be a
              prohibitive factor in providing the support and necessary resources for
              Tao Li</span> to reach her full potential,” he said. “It’s about providing all
              the resources necessary to realise her full potential, with the 2012
              Olympics as the target.”
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              The Singapore Sports School
              student went into the on-going Beijing Games ranked 26th out of 49 in
              the 100m fly. But the 1.60m tall Olympic rookie, the smallest in the
              field, stunned everyone by winning her heat on Saturday in a then-Asian
              record of 57.77sec, which China’s Zhou Yafei later lowered to 57.70s.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              The pocket dynamite reclaimed
              the Asian record barely 12 hours later, clocking 57.54s in the
              semi-finals, becoming the first Singaporean to qualify for an Olympic
              swimming final. The time was also 0.18s faster than Australian Petria
              Thomas’ gold medal-winning effort at the 2004 Athens meet, making her
              one of the top 10 all-time butterfly swimmers.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Tao Li returns to Singapore on
              Monday, and along with coach Peter Churchill, is expected to discuss
              her future plans with the authorities.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Said Clews: “The SSC will work closely with her on how to map and implement an SMSS programme to help her stayinjury-free.”
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              The SSC invests between $30,000 to $100,000 annually in SMSS support and services for each of the Republic’s elite athletes.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Tao Li, who is currently in
              Secondary 3 at the sports school, is expected to continue studying
              there until she graduates with a diploma in sports science under a
              tie-up with the Auckland University of Technology.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “The SSC have been very
              supportive, and I’m very grateful that they will continue to be,” the
              swimmer told Today in a telephone interview yesterday from Beijing,
              where she met President S R Nathan.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              High on her wish-list is to work with top physiotherapist Roger Fitzgerald of Australia.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “He knows my condition very
              well, and he was with us at the 2006 Asian Games, where he helped me
              get conditioned for my 50m fly race,” said Tao Li, whose victory in the
              event at Doha propelled her into the international spotlight.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “After the first two days of
              racing at the Beijing Olympics, my body was fatigued but he wasn’t
              around. So it would be great if he’s with me for the next four years.
              I’d also like more opportunities to train and compete overseas over the
              next four years.”
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Coach Churchill agreed.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “She needs more experience competing at the highest levels and not idolising the superstars,” said the Australian.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>

              can only get better. “There is still a lot of room for improvement. But
              for now, I’ve to get back to school. I’ve missed a lot of classes and
              need to catch up.”</div>

Are they not here because of the money? Do they have even the smallest measurable pint of patrioticism towards S'pore in them?</div>

Money should be put on the welfare, it should be used to develop our Nation's infrastructure so that it will be a better place for authentic Singaporeans. Money is not supposed to be spent on building the muscles of a Chinese athlete who does all but win worthless medals.<br></div>

              <p>i am not against all sort of immigrants.</p>
              <p>IMO, i'm fine with little kids, since they will get assimilated into local society, regardless of their parents' influence and their upbringing. they are the one who will find it very hard to find a identity with their birth country. they are singaporeans at heart.</p>
              <p>it is the parents which are the crux of the loyalty problem. they are the one who still have strong ties back home, and wouldn't hesitate to leave singapore if singapore turns for the worse or if their homeland turns for the better. they are not really singaporeans at heart.</p>
              <p>so, if we want to focus on integration of immigrants, we should focus more on the little ones, then to focus on the more unpredictable adult immigrants.</p>
