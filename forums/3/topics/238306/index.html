"The noise was terrible and we simply couldn't sleep through it. At first it sounded like late-night revelry and we knew the Liverpool squad were downstairs. But then things seemed to get out of hand and the police arrived."<br><br>Mr Lover said one player with an Eastern European accent, thought to be Jerzy Dudek, the Poland goalkeeper, was handcuffed by police before eventually being released. And only when a member of Liverpool's management team arrived did things calm down.<br><br>"He kept telling the police how much he loved them, as if he was pleading to be allowed to go free," Mr Lover said. "At one point, the police seemed to be slapping him around the face, trying to bring him round and sober him up because he was so drunk. He kept apologising over and over again but the police didn't want to know. It was only after a while that the police found someone from the Liverpool management, who managed to calm things down and talk quietly. Eventually, the police let the player go after some negotiations and he seemed very relieved indeed and kept thanking them.<br><br>"We have many teams around the complex and there is usually no trouble at all, but this was not a very pleasant experience. It was thoroughly shameful and brings a terrible name to a club like Liverpool. These players get paid so much and are often so young, but for something like this to happen is awful."</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Liverpool owners set to bomb out Bellamy<br>tribalfooball.com - February 18, 2007<br><br>Liverpool striker Craig Bellamy risks being bombed out of Anfield after last week's amazing brawl in Portugal.<br><br>Bellamy allegedly lashed out at team-mate John Arne Riise with a golf club during their training camp in Portugal.<br><br>New American owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks are said to be furious and Hicks, in particular, will not accept misbehaviour.<br><br>Kenny Rogers, star pitcher for the Texas Rangers baseball team, was involved in an ugly clash with a TV crew two years ago.<br><br>Hicks dumped him when his contract expired at the end of the season.<br><br>Bellamy spent Saturday watching Cardiff beat Leeds.<br><br>Asked why, he said: "I am from down here, so I go to the matches sometimes. But I am a Liverpool supporter. That is my club." </span></div>

But it all went wrong when Craig tried to drag John up for a song. There was a karaoke competition going on, but John's a quiet one off the pitch and wasn't having it at all.<br><br>"It started off as a bit of a lark with some of the other lads having a go but then it got completely out of hand. John went ballistic because Craig wouldn't take no for an answer. He was screaming at Craig to leave him alone, saying he wouldn't do it and yelling insults.<br><br>"Everyone was completely stunned by it because they were really having a go, standing there toe to toe swearing at each other. There were about 20 players in the bar including all the senior guys, like Steven Gerrard, Peter Crouch and Dirk Kuyt.<br><br>"They were warned to keep a lid on it and it appeared to calm down.<br><br>"It was really late, about 2am, and the players eventually started drifting off to bed. But Craig, who was sharing with Steve Finnan, was so wound up he couldn't sleep.<br><br>"He suddenly grabbed a golf club and went looking for John. And when he found him he waded in, hacking at his legs with the club.<br><br>"All hell was let loose and John suffered a lot of bruising. Craig was out of control and shouting that John had belittled him in front of the lads." </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Liverpool stars caught in booze storm<br>tribalfooball.com - February 17, 2007<br><br>Liverpool stars are being caught up in an alleged booze storm over their training camp in Portugal last week.<br><br>The Daily Mail says goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek, Jermaine Pennant and former England striker Robbie Fowler were named by local newspapers as being involved in a drunken spree at the Barringtons Golf and Health Club, in Vale do Lobo, on the Algarve, in the early hours of Friday morning.<br><br>Dudek, a hero of Liverpool's Champions League triumph in Istanbul two years ago, was reported to have been handcuffed after the incident, which is alleged to have occurred at the end of a warm-weather training camp undertaken to prepare for Liverpool's Champions League game in Barcelona on Wednesday.<br><br>A Liverpool spokesman said last night: "The matter will be dealt with internally."<br><br>Local sources claim the trouble began at a bar called Monty's, in Vale do Lobo, where about 15 members of the squad had gone for a drink after a team meal on the eve of their departure from Portugal.<br><br>After several rounds of beer, the party reportedly became rowdy and, despite the efforts of captain Steven Gerrard and England international Peter Crouch to defuse the situation, police were called. </span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is supposed to be a soccer training camp and not a wrestling camp.<br>But really, the players should be responsible enough to answer for their actions. But have you all wondered why only the fringe players were mentioned? Fowler, Dudek, Pennant and Bellamy are always playing second fiddle.

Bellamy and Jerzy Dudek, who was involved in a separate drunken incident, have been hit with fines of two weeks' wages. But most of the rest of the squad broke a late night curfew and will also be punished.<br><br>Benitez will impose fines on 15 of the players - but refused to identify the culprits and does not want to comment any more on the trip.<br><br>But he made it clear he wants the players to put on a show in the Nou Camp for the fans who have been let down.<br></span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Liverpool's Bellamy made scapegoat for Portugal chaos<br>tribalfooball.com - February 19, 2007<br><br>Liverpool striker Craig Bellamy could be the subject of a witch-hunt to drive the Welshman out of Anfield, it is reported.<br>The Liverpool Echo says sources within the club suggest the 27-year-old Welsh international was exploited as an easy target to deflect blame from a large number of players involved in breaches of discipline.<br><br>Other players said to have been involved include Robbie Fowler, Jermaine Pennant and Jerzy Dudek.<br><br>Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez is understood to regard Bellamy as no more or less guilty than any of the players involved. Up to six players have now been fined by the manager, most for breaking curfew.<br><br>While Bellamy WAS involved in a dust-up with John Arne Riise, the Liverpool Echo reports it was far less serious than presented by Sunday newspapers.<br><br>Claims have been made that Bellamy repeatedly swung a golf club at the 26-year-old Norwegian's legs, yet Riise is fit and likely to start Wednesday night's game with Barcelona.<br></span></div>
