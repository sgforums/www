I have been at Chelsea all my career and have the privilege of being captain.<br><br>Â“Now it's time to look forward to the new season which we are all very confident about."<br><br>Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon welcomed the news.<br><br>Â“This is an important day for Chelsea. This was the right deal for us and for John,Â” said Kenyon.<br><br>Â“As a club we are committed to try and keep our players together on long term deals and this was a natural progression from last season when other players also committed themselves for the long term.<br><br>Â“As captain, John is clearly a key player for Chelsea and also a great symbol of the club so naturally we are pleased this has been agreed.Â”</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">10 Reasons John Terry is Worth Â£135,000 a week<br>Filed in archive Players by daryl on July 31, 2007<br><br>The Â£135,000 a week Chelsea will be paying John Terry until 2012 is a fortune. A hideous amount of money to pay one man and further proof that football operates on a whole other level of reality.<br><br>But in purely relative terms, JT is probably worth that obscene amount. Here are 10 reasons why:<br><br>1. Lucas Neill is reportedly earning Â£60,000 a week at West Ham, so relatively speaking Â£135,000 a week for John Terry is an absolute bargain.<br><br>2. Michael Ballack and Andriy Shevchenko are both on Â£130,000 a week. John Terry has to be worth Â£5k a week more than either of those two, based on what they contribute to Chelsea.<br><br>3. The England captain is only 26. Based on the careers of other central defenders, his best five years are ahead of him.<br><br>4. Given the problems even the richest clubs have finding suitable centre backs, Chelsea would be insane not to pay whatever it took to keep John Terry at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>5. Despite his recent mega-wealth, the presence of John Terry prevents Chelsea looking like a traveling band of foreign millionaire playboys. I'm aware that that's a Sci-Fi Channel worthy paradox. But in the era of expensive, overpaid foreigners (that, in all fairness, Chelsea helped usher in) having a London born and bred captain and talisman who looks like he could win a pub brawl is literally priceless.<br><br>6. Especially when you're Roman Abramovich, and the word priceless has no meaning.<br><br>7. One club men should be rewarded.<br><br>8. How do we know someone hasn't broken down what John Terry actually contributes on the field and decided to pay him Â£1,000 per tackle, header or clearance, plus Â£10,000 for every time he shouts loudly and points at someone?<br><br>9. Did you see Chelsea without him last season?<br><br>10. John Terry singlehandedly disproves the rule that you should never trust a man with two first names.</span></div>
