            <div class='col-md body'>Asian Handicap<br>Manchester Utd 0 : 1 Tottenham<br><br>Injuries (Man Utd) :<br>Anderson is set to return after missing the previous game at Reading.<br>Scholes could be named as substitute at Old Trafford after a three-month absence.<br>Gary Neville (ankle) and Louis Saha (knee) remain sidelined through injury for the fourth round match.<br><br>Injuries (Tottenham) :<br><br>Sixteen million pounds striker Darren Bent is still out with a knee injury.<br>Benoit Assou-Ekotto (knee), Gareth Bale (foot) and Anthony Gardner (ankle) remain sidelined<br><br>Missing In Action:<br><br>(Man Utd) : Nil<br><br>(Tottenham) : Pascal Chimbonda is suspended for the FA Cup fourth-round clash while Didier Zokora is on international duty with the Ivory Coast.<br><br>Spurs' confidence levels should be sky high.<br><br>Spurs' midweek heroics meant that they will be going into this game thinking they could get a result here. However, the history of the games between the two team seems to beckon otherwise. The last time they won at Old Trafford was in 1989 and Man Utd is still unbeaten in 2008.<br><br>I believe anyone that had seen a Man Utd game in recent time would had noticed a pattern in their game. They would start these games without any fear and go about attacking the opposing team, racking up high percentage of possession as well as attempts on goal.<br><br>The thing about their play is that they would push 7-8 players in support of their attack and leave only Rio Ferdinard and Vidic at the back to defend any counterattack. Although this would make them very vunerable to any quick counter, it also showed the amount of confidence they have in the two defenders. Early in Rio Ferdinard's career, he always suffered from a lack of concentration. However, in recent times, he seem to have cleared it up and has not commit any major errors recently. The match would be a big game as he would have to mark out the quick-thinking Berbetov who would be looking to spring a surprise against the team that was supposed to be interested in signing him.<br><br>The fact that Man Utd was in holiday while Tottenham kicked Arsenal's young ass meant that they would be the fresher of the two. I would also like to point out that Tottenham only managed to win Arsenal's second team and it would be a tougher opposition they would be facing when they march out on Sunday. I can't imagine Owen Hargreaves giving J Jenas the space Denilson did.<br><br>I also believe that being at home, Man Utd would win the match. However, I find it 50/50 to whether Man Utd can clear the handicap of 1 goal. However, i suggest anyone looking for a bargain to try the under/over 2.5 goals bet. Man utd always tries to score a second goal to make it safe. I believe this match wouldn't be too different. I would hope that Tottenham can at least score one goal to clear the handicap.<br><br>My prediction for this FA Cup 4th round Match:<br><br>Man Utd 2 Tottenham 1<br></div>

              <p><br>You are very funny leh..... you always choose the examples that most show how poor your soccer knowledge is. If you complained about other decisions also not so strange, but you choose to talk about one of the most obvious case of a penalty.</p>
              <p>You can even say Ronaldo was lucky to get a deflected 3rd goal, but no, you choose the one thing that most shows how little you know.</p>

              <p>I think it was a sad thing for Michael Dawson, he conceded the penalty more because of over-eagerness to stop Rooney from scoring. If he had wanted to intentionally throw the match, he didn't need to wait for the ball to bounce before handling it.</p>
              <p>It was only because he missed the ball the first time round and after the bounce, the ball had already gone beyond him. Even with a header there was no way he was going to get to the ball.</p>
              <p>In that quick instant, all he was thinking was probably,'Don't let Rooney score'.</p>

              <p>I may not be a Man U fan, but here's a word of truth for the clonemaster. Noisy is when you can't talk soccer and can only resort to insulting people using their families and all. Noisy is when you are not talking soccer but just making horrible insults and not saying anything that's even remotely based on at least a basic knowledge of soccer. If think anyone is noisy, please look at yourself first.</p>
