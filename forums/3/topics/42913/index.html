            <div class='col-md body'>No shame in losing to a classy Real Madrid.<br><br>I always believed that whoever won this match would most likely go on to win the European cup.<br><br>Frankly, MU made way too many mistakes in their passing, did not create enuff and could not breach the Real rearguard when it mattered. It didn't help that Iker Casillas was having an inspired game. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>I think it's time Ferguson take a serious look at the eccentricities of Fabian Barthez. The first Ronaldo goal was clearly a goalkeeping error. He showed too much space for Ronaldo and didn't cover his near post well. This is not the first time he has made such a mistake. That goal was pivotal as it allowed Real to settle down.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>If MU are to triumph, Ferguson should pick solid and reliable keepers and defenders who perform consistently...not just those with the "world-class" tag printed on them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>And certainly, MU need more invention in midfield. It was obvious that Scholes was sorely missed and that Veron was not even match-fit.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>It's also a time to change tactics. Almost every team who plays MU know that they also use giggs and beckham on the wings with Van the target man in the center. When beckham is tightly marked, the main supply of crosses is cut off. Similarly, Giggs is no longer the force he used to be and Keane shd stick his mouth up his own hole for claiming to be "back to his best"....he was always second best on the pitch and second best is for losers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Why ferguson is not looking at more creative players and strikers who can at least dribble is beyond me. After all, you can't win every game with the same tactics.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The Beckham free kick was a stunner though... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its bcoz real madrid have the 2 goals advantage, else if they never stop attacking i think ManU can be thrashed once again. just see how many attack Real have made and they score almost everytime with the attacks. anyway why never mention about Real defense? they conceded 2 own goals and 1 tyco goal by RVN( forever tyco).<br>i think the scoreline is good enough for ManU fans. Wow! they won Real Madrid!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ya it is true real was rather relaxed doing just enough to win the quater.They mainly stroked the ball around and barely attacked unless they did not have the lead.They could easily have killed the game off with a 2 goal lead but they didnt i i wondered why....oh well.But the Italian teams would be raped i believe</div>
