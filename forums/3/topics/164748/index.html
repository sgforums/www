EPL players get paid this amt in a matter of weeks... not medals or trophies.<br>and then again, singapore is a small country. so we should concentrate our energy in the corporate society, get into the World Level in terms of other areas like finance and influence. just let the foreign talents do the sports.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Both have soccer teams in the world cup.<br><br>It isn't that we are a small country but the fact that we think small and have been psyched up during our youth that sports have no future in SG. That is truly an oversight our education system has mistakenly preached.<br><br>That mistake is being corrected right now but more must be done. Money is indeed the right way to go but one cannot compare superstars to our world cup hopefuls: One earns through legitimate clubs and sponsership deals while the other comes from SSC reward schemes.<br><br>Which is why it is important to optimise SSC into a financial subsidiary which can 'pay' our atheletes to excel, hence promoting sports as a career.<br><br></div>
