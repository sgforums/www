            <div class='col-md body'>I agree. At a time when money is the numero uno, Del Piero staying on at Juve is a rarity. it really shows his commitment and loyalty. But I was even more suprised that Buffon will be staying. He is a world cup winner, he can easily walk into any club in the world, and yet he is not leaving. It is cases like him that makes a Juve fan like me happy, at a time when I am upset that Zambrotta, Thuram, Ibrahimovic, Cannavaro, Emerson and Capello all leave the club.<br><br>And also I am suprised that Trezequet hasn't been signed to other clubs yet, when u read all day about how Liverpool, Newcastle and Man U are interested in signing him. But then again, considering his form last season wasn't that impressive, it could have sway opinions against him. Not that I am complaining. I would rather he stay on at Juve, and help us score tons of goals and grab as many points as possible. Remember, we are starting at a 17 points deficit, so every match is cruical.</div>
