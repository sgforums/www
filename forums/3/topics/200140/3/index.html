Are they the ones who help ur team put the ball in the back of the net? If Juve couldn't scold goals during a match, will the referee insist that Juve won the match? How absurd is that? Thank god its now only a 17point deficit. And with Lazio, Fiorentina still in the top flight, it will be much easier 2 be promoted at the first attempt.<br><br>Plus the fact that Trezequet, Ibrahimovic, Buffon and Del Piero are still around will help make the job easier.</div>

A lot of clubs involved I feel.<br>I really pity those smaller clubs, who are not involved, tried so hard just to stay alive in the league only to find out that their fate is in other people's hands.</div>

Moggi asked for favourable referees, i admit, but as I was trying to say, that won't help to win matches 100%. U still need players 2 hit the back of the net, and to strip the club of the past 2 titles is an insult to the players of the club.<br><br>And how laughable that Inter are champions of Italy by default and despite them finishing third.</div>
