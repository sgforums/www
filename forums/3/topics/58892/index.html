            <div class='col-md body'>Hi fellow Singaporeans. I have lived in Australia for many years now and have really taken to the sport of Rugby League. Some of you might have seen it on TV before. It is a very fast and exciting game. Rugby League sometimes gets confused with Rugby Union but they are totally different.<br>Anyway, there is a group of people trying to bring Rugby League to Singapore. They are trying to start a national team and then start a domestic competition over in Singapore. If you know of any ex-pats that live in Singapore who come from England/NZ/Australia who have played Rugby League before could you let them know about joining the Singapore Rugby League team. The contact is  Or if you have seen this sport and want to give it a try also email that address. Thanks guys. If Rugby League comes to Singapore it will be great for Singapore sport and give Singaporeans another team to support.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So if any of you browsing this forum have any friends that are ex-pats from Australia/NZ/England could you ask them whether they would like to play Rugby League. If they would they can email singaporerugbyleague@hotmail.com Even if your not an ex-pat and you have seen Rugby League on TV and enjoy it and want to give it a go. Please don't hesitate to get in contact. Thanks again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I was at the Grand Final mate. I was sitting with all the Roosters supporters even though I was going for Penrith. Penrith deserve there Grand Final vistory. They played awesome. There was a telecast in Singapore but it was on Star Asia, I think.<br>I watched all 3 State Of Origin games. The 3rd game was unbelieveable. Qld played brilliant.<br>The website is nearly ready to launch. We are still after more players that qualify to play for Singapore. I have some from the UK and Australia. Hopefully the Singapore Rugby League can get the support of the Singapore community as we are representing the nation as a whole.<br>Hopefully Rugby League will take off in Singapore. With the high amounts of ex-pats living there and hopefully some locals taking the game up we should have a bright future.<br>Well good luck to your mighty Panthers when they take on Bradford Bulls for the World Club Challenge.</div>
