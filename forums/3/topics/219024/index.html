In addition, he offered to be the guarantor to a couple of his business partners who went bankrupt, leaving him with their loans to clear.<br><br>Heck, when a friend of his wanted to buy a second-hand car from him, he gave him another car dealer's contacts instead. Apparently he felt bad about earning money from his friend.<br><br>In fact, he was offered technical directorship of Pahang, but turned it down as he feared that another good friend of his (who is the Pahang coach) may be shunted to the periphery.<br>It's sad that being too much of a nice guy can be bad.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>this is the dilemma of the new modern age metro sexual guy.<br><br>to be a guarantor for anything is already bad, how much more as guarantor for businesses. when there is a default for payment, guess who the banks is going to chase after? guarantor of course. moral of the story is, dun ever be a guarantor for anyone, even your relatives. you dunno what you are signing for as a guarantor until default of payment happened, then you are in big trouble.<br><br>not only footballers, actors / actresses, sportsman like remy ong (bowler) popiah business also went bust. they dunno a thing in business and just go along with their partners as they provide part of the capital, like a sleeping partner. they have no clue on how to do business, where to get clients, how much money needed to sustain rental and labour costs etc.<br><br>moral of the story, most sportsmen businesses went bust, but minority like wigan owner Noel Whelan JJB retails business in UK is a classic case of sportsman make good, but that is only a handful of successful sportsmen making a transition.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think normally you will act for a guarantor unless you got burned before or the person you are doing this service has a bad record.<br>Either way, hard for anyone to know until it happens.<br><br>For him, I read in the papers that there were some tensions within the family, but I sincerely hope for the best to happen to Fandi.<br><br>And yes, he should do something close to what his interests and impt, what he is good at, and that's a soccer academy.<br><br>he can be the technical director or something and have professionals to run the business. that way he can't be "makan"ed.<br><br>either way, sometimes we need to fall, to learn how to stand.</div>
