            <div class='col-md body'>to be frank, nowadaus when a top team play arsenal, i always fear arsenal can be beaten by any physical team or technically more experience team.<br><br>arsenal play this season does indeed lack variations. seasons before last they are good in EPL because thei style of play was more focus for the EPL. strong midfield phyical presence evolving around the likes of vieira, edu, gilberto, petit, parlour, grimandies, to tough tackling no nonsence defenders from keown, adams, dixon, winterburn, campbell to the now already old, injury/ mistake prone like campbells, cygan, senderos. even the usally strong dept goalkeepers start to leak in goals from silly goalkeeping errors. i do miss david seamen.<br><br>today chelsea are like arsenal of old. build around a nonsence backfour, tough tacking midfield to hold the line and choke the opponents midfield to the ever running and penetrating of wingers + attackers who can head the ball, shot the ball from long range . wasnt that arsenal of old?<br>do we miss overmars/pires penetrating run down the wing. ian wright and alan smith heading ability. petit and vieira partners in midfield that scare the hell of opponents midfield. to the ever hard working and tough tacking of martin keown, adamns, dixon, winterburn.<br>i do miss the arsenal of old which i hope more english base player can be adopted in the current arsenal line up<br></div>

Nobody should question Wenger at the moment after what he has brought to the EPL.<br><br>I think they could be done with a stronger midfield player and it could be time to punt on Pires and Ljungberg and play Reyes and Hleb in the wide positions and leave Gilberto, Fabregas and a new signing (Oliver Dacourt!!) in midfield.<br><br>Anton Ferdinand or William Gallas would be a great signing at the back along with Carlo Cudicini or Stefan Klos for goal.<br><br>Upfront Van Persie looks like the new Bergkamp.<br><br>But i expect Arsenal to be back next season.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What Arsenal needs:<br><br>Immediate: A Defensive Midfilder with experience like Thomas Gravasen (Quit struggling and sign him aready!).<br><br>Near Future: A good goal keeper (Lehnman is getting on age), A good defender (For god's sake, get rid of Cygan), A good striker (Relying on Henry alone isnt going to help and Bergkamp is retiring.)<br><br>What Arsene Wenger needs: Time and Money!<br><br>I think he needs to be given time to get the players to settle down and get the new players to their full potential. It took him awhile to get Henry to where he is now. Same goes for some signings he made in the past (Pires, etc).<br><br>Money is one issue also.

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The REAL problem is that there's not enough competition for places in the squad. Look at the players. Ljungberg and Pires have gone off form for damn long already, never score as much as they used to. It's not that wenger doesn't have enough players. He doesnt want to use his reserve team strikers. Those two are brilliant. The players have become complacent. Gilberto knows he'll always play, since vieira's gone. Pires and Ljungberg also.<br><br>The only players who are working their socks off for the team?<br><br>Fabregas, Reyes, Van Persie, Toure.<br><br>Arsenal need more power in midfield and new goalkeepers. Other than that they're already quite established in the other areas.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm maybe you dont watch arsenal enough to see how he's running his legs off every match (Maybe except for the wigan match). Anyway. It's 7-0. See what happens when the professor decides to go back to 4-4-2?</div>
