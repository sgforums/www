            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Arsene Wenger has always had a shrew eye in the transfer market. Alexender Hleb is an excellent buy in line with Arsenal's thrill of entertaining soccer. His current suggestions that teams that score &gt;3 goals should be awarded an extra point deserves merit.<br><br>I'm sure inflated prices have worked against Arsenal this season. Wenger has in the past insisted that they would not pay over the top for a player and will definitely not be held to ransom over player's wages or transfer fees by other clubs and agents. This gives Wenger every opportunity to dig into the youth ranks. Mathieu Flamini and Fabregas are excellent young players, as is Gael Clichy. Philippe Sanderos played well last season but is only coming into form now after horrendous mistakes in the opening games.<br><br>Give them some time and they will do well as a team. I would agree, however that they need a genuine replacement for Patrick Viera. Someone aggressive and stylish like Claude Makelele (Chelsea) or a solid, holding player like Mohd Sissisko (Liverpool).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To me, I feel that Arsenal lack variations to win games. When they cant score playing with their type of football, they lost the plot. Sometimes, u have to play different tactics to beat different teams. Why is Chelsea doing well in the league and Europe, but Arsenal cant? Losing Vieira is a big factor, no more ball winner. Losing Henry is one factor, but not the biggest in terms of attack. To me, Bergkamp not perform is the biggest factor in terms of attack. He is the only player in the team capable of doing the passes like Riquelme of Villareal. And he is the fastest thinking player in the team. He can think steps ahead of many players, just like playing chess. Before the ball goes to him, he already know what to do with it. That's a big factor for not scoring enough goals I feel. The defence? Not doing well. But with no good DM protecting them, even the likes of Milan defence will leak goals.<br><br>Just my opinion anyway.</div>
