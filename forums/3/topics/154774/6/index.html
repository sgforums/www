I thought that our resources would be more limited than they really are.<br><br>"So I'm a bit of a prisoner of my own policy today. We are obliged to stay with our reasoning to the end and to keep giving the youngsters their chance.<br><br>"We have a team which is a little too young at times to win 1-0 instead of losing 1-0.<br><br>"The other teams have progressed in quality and we have lost a little ground because, temporarily, we are a little less mature. But if we can stay together for two or three years, we really will do a lot of damage." </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well at least lehman's giving 100%. Henry doesnt even look like he's bothered. The only people who are putting in effort right now are lehman, toure, fabregas and the other youngsters. I dunno what the hell happened to the seniors.</div>
