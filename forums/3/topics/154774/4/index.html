But the Frenchman was asked whether he would be looking to make his side stronger physically, a criticism that surfaced after the recent defeats at Bolton and Newcastle<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t know yet,Â” he replied. Â“I feel we have the needed response physically and we have a very strong team but in the challenges you are not at 18 like you are at 22. That is why this team will be better and better because they will slowly rectify that.Â”<br><br>Various names will be linked with Arsenal over the next few weeks.
