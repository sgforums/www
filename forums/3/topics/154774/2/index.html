            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hjxfabio:</div><div class="quote_body">To me, I feel that Arsenal lack variations to win games. When they cant score playing with their type of football, they lost the plot. Sometimes, u have to play different tactics to beat different teams. Why is Chelsea doing well in the league and Europe, but Arsenal cant? Losing Vieira is a big factor, no more ball winner. Losing Henry is one factor, but not the biggest in terms of attack. To me, Bergkamp not perform is the biggest factor in terms of attack. He is the only player in the team capable of doing the passes like Riquelme of Villareal. And he is the fastest thinking player in the team. He can think steps ahead of many players, just like playing chess. Before the ball goes to him, he already know what to do with it. That's a big factor for not scoring enough goals I feel. The defence? Not doing well. But with no good DM protecting them, even the likes of Milan defence will leak goals.<br><br>Just my opinion anyway.</div></blockquote>Agreed.<br><br>They play delightful soccer but when opposing teams stifle their play by flooding the midfield, they lack the aggressiveness to push forward in search of an 'ugly' goal. They want to win beautifully, which i admire, but is causing them much grief in europe<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i do agree that arsenal havea  good youth players like flamini and fabregas, clichy, hoyte, van persie. but the core of arsenal success evolve around henry, lunjberg, pires and viera and campbell if all are fit. during the unbeaten feat 2 season ago, all key players are free of long terms injury. but the past season and this season has seen many key players suffer from injury. where the backup crew?<br>arsenal are especially weak in central midfield. they use to have edu, gilberto, flamini, fabregas, vieira competing in central midfield. now, edu and vieira are gone.  left a big whole fill by youngsters + helb.<br>this will sent a mesage to henry. arsenal indeed really lack of ambition to challenge chelsea for the title. If henry dont sign new contract by end of this season. arsenal will probably sold him than lose him for nothing. until then, more clubs will hold arsenal for ranson should gunners start approach player to replace him. even i feel arsenal lack of ambition this season by failing to sign a few players to bolster the squad.<br>pires will definitely leave after this season. i hope hleb can score as much goals as pires otherwise, arsenal have no player who can score outside the penalty box. man utd have scholes. chelsea have lampard. arsenal dont have a player who wait around outside penalty box and score goals.<br><br>arsenal indeed need variation especially when competing in europe. that the possible reason why arsenal play poorly in champion league. this season with depleted squad and improve of premiership teams , arsenal maybe will struggle to beat them.<br>i hope wenger sign a target man striker such as iqaunita of udinese.riqualme of villareal , murphy of charlton.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not many teams can variate their play without a host of players to support it.<br><br>Arsenal has been hampened in the last two years by the building of their new emirates stadium. With a distinct lack of funds, they cannot hope to compete with the likes of Man Utd, Real Mardrid and Chelsea. As it is, they failed in their bid to bring Baptista from Sevilla, who prefered to go Real instead.<br><br>This shows a lack of interest by players to play in the EPL. Loyalty is no longer repaid these days. Look at Ronaldo and Luis Figo, who jumped ship the moment they were offered millions. One can understand the 'judas' chants hurled at Figo during Barca-Real matches of the past.<br><br>Arsenal has done magnificantly with such limited funds. By bringing up their young quality players and giving them 1st team chances, they can only get better. Viera may be gone, but they just need to be patient and source for a capable replacement, one who does not cost too much. Perhaps in the january transfer window we can see Wenger making some quiet buys.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As an arsenal fan it's very very frustrating to see arsenal like that now.<br>Vieira gone, Henry wanting to go barcelona, wenger thinking his youngsters are gods...<br><br>Arsenal's problems, i think, has to do with they players' morale and the lack of depth in the squad. Selling vieira before ensuring that baptista would sign for arsenal was quite dumb. Vieira is not only a ball winner, he is a good passer and has tremendous influence over the team. Arsenal has a very weak midfield in my opinion. Fabregas is getting back his form of last season, but gilberto is not as effective ball winner as vieira.<br><br>Arsenal need a backup defender. Without sol campbell wenger plays the inexperienced senderos or worse, the horrifying pascal cygan. Arsenal need good defensive cover.<br><br>And arsenal are over reliant on henry. Other than Henry arsenal has no proven striker, although reyes is looking very good at the moment. Reyes needs support in the form of bergkamp or someone else who is a good shadow striker.<br><br>Wenger thinks his youngsters are gods. Granted, they are good. But they are still very inexperienced. He needs to bring in a couple of good players to strengthen the squad. He has to spend.<br><br>I hope henry doesn't go. If he does arsenal will just fall apart.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>vela who??<br>the new mexican youngster whom arsenal are desperate to sign.<br>yes we need to build a strong core of youngster. but these youngster cant be developed into first team action immediately. some show promise in younger days but might not make it big in professional stage.<br><br>how many teams now do we see have a huge core of youngster that win trophies. maybe we have to look back to Ajax 10years ago with the like to de boer brothers, seedorf, davids, kluivert, van der sar, reizerger, overmars, litmanen.<br><br>we might not be able to compete with chelsea in terms of financial means but at the sametime, we need to be more active in the transfer market to recruit players which has the experience to play first team football.<br>i definitely mr. wenger are keeping us in the dark and secretly making inquiry to few experience players to booster the strength of the squad and savage our season and make a stronger challenge to chelsea. it is such a pain that we already conceded the title to chelsea so earlier in the season. by looking at the bench of arsenal team, to be frank i dont see how we can challenge for the premiership not to mention champion league.<br><br>who you hope arsenal to sign??<br>i hope :<br>1. danny murphy (arsenal need the physical playing style of english players.)<br>2. juninho of Lyon. (playermaker that helps to create and score).<br>3. riqualme of villareal( strong, playermaker and can score from range).<br>4. ferdinand of westham (good player, cover as central defender. def. better than cygan).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its sad that a team like Arsenal is disintegrating, from the moment vieira left, the alarm bells are ringing. Vieira is a vital player to Arsenal, not just the ability he can offer, but the mental side as well. With Vieira, players who like to play free flowing football like Henry, Bergkamp, Pires, Lunjberg can fully concentrate on the attacking side.<br><br>No doubt Cesc Fabregas is a talented player, a player who has the potential to be as good as Josep Guardiola, but he is still relatively inexperienced and lightweigth. Like Freddie Ljunberg said, you can't win trophies with kids except for Ajax whom 10 years ago won the CL. Arsenal should get at least one or two more players to bolster the squad, one who has the experience. As for fabregas, he is like a fruit that has yet to be fully ripe. If you want to eat it, its gonna be sour, wait a few more years maybe. But problem is, can the fans wait and maybe after a few more years, can fabregas really develop into the player we expect him to be? Only time will tell....</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Several reasons.<br><br>1) I believe this to be the most important factor. Cliques in the Arsenal locker room, dominated by the French players. I am sure most of u have read or heard about the fact that the French players are kings in the dressing room. Somehow, the french clique seems to think that with a French boss in charge, they can rule the roast. Ashley Cole, Graham Stack have said it several times that the French clique has caused morale to dip in the locker room. Remember Reyes was once tricked into saying he wanted to join Real Madrid? It emerged that he was unhappy at Arsenal and that there is no unity in the locker room, which of course points at factions at Highbury. When u have unhappy players, how do u expect them to gel as a team? Robert Pires seems to be buddy-buddy with Henry more than others, as seen in that crap penalty against Man City. And when Vieira left the club, who voiced out his displeasure early on? Pires and Henry again. If nothing is done, the team may no longer be able to play as a team again. Something has to give.<br><br>2)The Vieira factor. He was never adquately replaced. Helb is more of an attack-minded player, and we can't really expect Gilberto to do two jobs. Flamini, Fabregas are still too young, although the young players are improving pretty fast. Clichy, Senderos, Flamini, Reyes, persie, Fabregas will be the heart of the team in time to come. But right now, they still need time and experience. they need a leader on the pitch, which Vieira was to Arsenal. Henry has too many responsbilities on his hand now. Sign a world-class central midfielder, and things in the middle will return to normal.<br><br>3)The Chelsea factor. Arsene has spent a lot of team to attack Chelsea in the paprs. It only goes to show that Arsene has silently admit that Chelsea is the team of the EPL. Arsene used to only worry about Sir Alex, now he has to contend with Mourinho also. And their never-ending pocket gives Arsene a bigger headache. Arsenal as a whole seems to worry about Chelsea too much to realise that there are 18 other teams in the EPL too. They think how to play catch-up with Chelsea such that they didn't really think much about other teams. That's why West Brom was able to beat them. That's why Tottenham, Wigan are now in front of them in the table<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I was always a  fan of the flowing and offensive style of play Arsene Wenger makes his team play. The short 1-2 passes, spread play to the wings, brilliant teamwork and clinical finishes epitomises the way football should be played.<br><br>This season hasn't been the best for Arsenal and I can understand why. Any team, maybe apart from Chelsea, that loses 3 of their best players will struggle to find form.<br><br>Viera's departure was shocking.Wenger's failure to secure a replacement was even more shocking. Flamini and Fabregas are exciting prospects but are not near the finished article.  Hleb is good but the holding midfield position is not exactly his best.<br><br>Henry's injury woes have hurt the team. Without Henry, Arsenal are like rhinos without their horns.<br><br>To top things up, the team has missed the experience, pace and quality of Ashley Cole, probably the best left back in the country at the moment.<br><br>However, with Henry returning from injury, recent results have been better. Arsenal fans can expect things to improve.<br><br>In January, Wenger needs to fill the void left by Viera and try to keep the Gunners in the black while doing so, attributed very much to the large amount of funds going into their new arena.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no_1_idiot indeed.<br><br>Anyway. Look what happened last week. Lost to bolton. Arsenal are in a left back crisis now. Pascal Cygan just sucks, wenger should use anyone else. Cygan was nowhere near the ball and gilberto had to track back to cover for him. Both goals were a result of Cygan's error. It's obvious arsene wenger should drop him or sell him. I wonder how he ever got the award for french player of the year.<br><br>That aside, i'd like arsenal to bring in some experience.<br><br>They need a solid defensive midfielder to take vieira's place. Someone like gattuso.<br><br>I think arsenal lacks young centre-backs, i havent seen anyone yet.<br><br>Also, i think they need an experienced striker who can still deliver the goods to partner henry and give the youngsters a few pointers, someone like del piero.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They were good until for 49 games and then .... confidence shattered after that defeat by MU . A beginning of a downfall .<br><br>They need money for that new Emirates Stadium , so Mega Star footballer not in their book for now .<br><br>They missed Vieira . Wenger assume Fabregas and Gilberto can do a job , NO ! They didn't , they can't !<br><br>Henry was distracted .... by those transfer allegations .<br><br>It will take a few years for Arsenal to get back on track , they can only be good if new players comes in . This bunch of players are tired of seeing each other everyday .<br><br>Arsenal will be lucky if they can stay Top-4 and still pursue the elusive UCL Eurpean Cup .<br><br>On form , they are going to struggle , but they cope it . credit to them .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another away game, another lose!!! Just what is Arsenal doing???<br><br>Its getting on fans nerves everytime they go see away games and see their team lose. I think its the beginning of the end for Arsenal. They are going to have serious problems even finishing 4th this season based on current form.<br><br>Whats nxt? Dec 18, vs Chelsea at Highbury. Arsenal's season will break if they fail to win this game nxt week!</div>
