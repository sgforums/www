You canÂ’t accept that someone now owns something that you said you once loved. I was just pointing out what a normal supporter is like from a fair weather one. ThatÂ’s all.<br>It doesnÂ’t have to be Man U, it can be any other club or even a basketball team for that matter. The kind of loyalty you have for something is rather worrying. You said that you are not a band wagon jumper. Well your words donÂ’t seem to suggest that you are one but your actions certainly does.<br><br>Anyway, I wasnÂ’t giving you history lessens cos I couldnÂ’t bother. I was just pointing out a simple error that you have overlook which is man u belonged to the fans and public which in fact, is the club was owned by one man way before you became a fan or during the time you claimed to became a fan until 1999 when it was floated on the stock market. TodayÂ’s situation is quite similar to pre 1999 thatÂ’s all. It doesnÂ’t matter if Glazer or someone else took over as long as the club continues in its path loyal supporters will continue to support it.<br><br>As I have said earlier, your example is too extremeÂ… and rather ridiculous too considering present day Â“the team starts promoting evil drugs for commercial purposes, change into a bunch of hooligans taking crack and encouraging vice then you must be one of those blindly supporting themÂ” Come onÂ… any right minded person here can tell you should it come to that day we can make up our minds if we still want to support this kind of stuff!<br><br>Lastly, You mentioned that you used to support Man Utd... till Glazer took over. And now we know how much you loved Man Utd before Glazer came, apparently not much enough!</div></blockquote>Firstly, I think you do not understand me well enough, especially the part on the motivations that got me supported man utd in the first place, which I have tried to highlight but you just don't get it, so obviously, you keep ranting about the history again totally shows me that you're quite clueless here. Funny thing is that you keep trying to tell me what I am, as if you understand me, now that's what I call something to worry about. If you don't know something well enough, it's more polite to reserve your comments to yourself, otherwise I see a fool in the making really.<br><br>Oh yeah, might as well highlight once again, check/read the motivations on why I supported man utd in the first place, otherwise you're going to mention the history again, lol. Might as well do it 3 times yah so you can show like you understand me inside out.<br><br>The fact that you mentioned that my examples were too extreme was surprising really. It's either you do not know how modern soccer players live their lives now, as in nightclubs, s[I][/I]ex, drugs, either that or you are trying to act smart again down here. Yeah, go ahead, act like you know everything.<br><br>As for the last statement you made, I wonder if I know myself better or someone like you mr know-it-all, who has never met me or understand me well enough, knows me any better. Think about it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Oh yeah, gotta add 1 more point. The last thing I need is for someone from I-don't-know-where to tell me what to be what I am, how to be what I should be, and think how I believe I will live my life. I just can't believe someone wants to tell me if I truly love something when I'm the only person who knows it best, and funny thing is, that person is trying so hard to make me believe he knows better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

And for your info, there were players like that too back in 1993. In fact, if you know who is George Best, which I donÂ’t think you will for a bandwagon one he played during the 60s and earlier 70s, He had a reputation for parties and women but that didnÂ’t stop him from becoming a football legend at the club.<br><br>Honestly, I am glad that there are some sincere supporters here still as the three threads after your last proved. Frankly, it doesnÂ’t matter if you are a man u supporter in 1993, 1983 or 2003Â… as long as you are sincere and serious about it, thatÂ’s good enough, one can learn more about the club in 1 yr if you are serious about it than in 10 yrs if you are just a glory seeker supporter.<br><br>Oh yeah, I donÂ’t dare to be a Â“mr know-it-allÂ” but if you insist, I donÂ’t mind lah, I can play alongÂ…he..he.<br><br>Lastly, donÂ’t be so defensive lah, this is a forum for discussion only wat.

Just like one doesn't have to know inside out all mathematics theories to be a mathematician.<br><br>Clearly, you still doesn't know my initial motivations of being a fan in the first place (and as much as I would like to be direct enough to list them all down, but emotions is a pretty complicated affair and it's not so often in black and white), but you're assuming you do understand. Ignorance is fine, but the fact of being someone ignorant and stubborn is a different matter, add to that someone who mix up assumptions and facts. Well, there is a reason why assumptions are assumptions and not facts. Facts is like truth, your opinion/assumptions of how a loyal fan should behave is based more on a set of your personal prejudices.<br><br>You mentioned though that noone is suggesting anyone to blindly support a team, then why are you suggesting a loyal fan should be what YOU think they should be, that's another assumption you've made, see you don't really give much leeway here. In some way, it's contradicting.<br><br>You got me right though on some things. I am very defensive when someone impose their opinions on me especially on matters that means much to me. However, at the same time, if you notice my replies to others, when I am in the wrong, I have the flexibility to drop my ego and realize that I was, well, in the wrong. And yeah, this is a discussion and maybe I have over-reacted, but that's how things are when someone challenges my stand on things that I have strong emotions for. I think it's quite normal for people get a bigger reaction when others is insulting/challenging matters close to their heart, like your family members, but I'm not into that. That's what Man Utd is about to me and the last thing I need is for someone to tell me what they know man utd is about to me. In some way, you have a point that I shouldn't be upset over such "small" issues, but there is a saying, a man's thrash might be the treasure of another man. It may not matter much to you, but when the issue of man utd comes up to me, it's a very sensitive matter to me.<br><br>At the same time, perhaps you are a hard core man utd fan yourself and I see no need to debate so furiously against someone like that, besides you have reminded me that this is just a discussion forum and I should lighten up, valid point. Besides I usually have great admiration, and no ill feelings towards any man utd fan. Still can't believe things started after the post on me praising Park Ji Sung on being handsome, come to think of it, it's kinda funny.</div>

Just like one doesn't have to know inside out all mathematics theories to be a mathematician.<br><br>Clearly, you still doesn't know my initial motivations of being a fan in the first place (and as much as I would like to be direct enough to list them all down, but emotions is a pretty complicated affair and it's not so often in black and white), but you're assuming you do understand. Ignorance is fine, but the fact of being someone ignorant and stubborn is a different matter, add to that someone who mix up assumptions and facts. Well, there is a reason why assumptions are assumptions and not facts. Facts is like truth, your opinion/assumptions of how a loyal fan should behave is based more on a set of your personal prejudices.<br><br>You mentioned though that noone is suggesting anyone to blindly support a team, then why are you suggesting a loyal fan should be what YOU think they should be, that's another assumption you've made, see you don't really give much leeway here. In some way, it's contradicting.<br><br>You got me right though on some things. I am very defensive when someone impose their opinions on me especially on matters that means much to me. However, at the same time, if you notice my replies to others, when I am in the wrong, I have the flexibility to drop my ego and realize that I was, well, in the wrong.

Reading your last post has convinced me that you still have a Â“Red Hot HeartÂ” in you for man utd. I do apologize if I had offended you during the course of our discussions. Cos sometimes things get out of handÂ…  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, it has been fun. I must say I kind of enjoyed our discussion. Ha haÂ… I donÂ’t see why we canÂ’t be friends online since we are both fans of man u in this forum and who knows, we may cross path again in future if we continue to stay in this forum.<br><br>Do have a nice day.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  And Agenda stay out of this, we know you are not a man u fan.<br></div>

Some friendly banter occassionally helps keep things &amp; minds active for awhile. Besides, I guess I learn something from everybody once a while from such discussions, like I tend to over react on certain issues and I don't even realize it until someone puts a reminder on it.
