Anyway, just stating why most people watch football for. Excitement &amp; Skill, not good looking guys. That part can keep for the ladies &amp; the gays community.<br><br>People, Have you ever wondered if you watch a match with a guy friend and they only keep looking out for good looking players... Do you suspect their sexuality?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by zocoss:</div><div class="quote_body">It seems like you don't understand the meaning of being a Man U supporter yourself. Since you mentioned you were a man u supporter from 1991, you should know that the club manchester united belongs to a Mr Martin Edwards from 1970s before the club was floated on the stock market in the late 90's. Before that time man u always had only one owner, the public never own the club before that time.<br><br>A true supporter supports the club and not the owners. Because come what may, the owners will change in time but the club will continue to live on like it has for the past 100 over years... Your example is too extreme, actually man u turn down an indonesian sponsor cos they were related to gambling &amp; the smoking industry.</div></blockquote>Apparently, you seems to have a narrow view of what being a true supporter is, and it differs from mine. And sadly, you very much want to impose such restrictions upon me and decide for me that if I were to be a true supporter, I should think like you. Give me a break, I know how much I love Man Utd before Glazer came, so don't act like you know me or anything. I surely don't believe you can put an oath for me that I wasn't a true man utd supporter. I'm not a band wagon jumper or anything, it's ever since they lost to Everton on the FA cup that I admire the team's spirit and never say die attitude as they fought to the last minute of the match and never mind the fact they lost. Read the reasons why it made me a man utd fan in the first place, I don't really need your history lessons but thanks anyway. I love the spirit of the team players, the fans, the unity and the attitude. But if one day the motivations changed, eg. the team change into a bunch of hooligans taking crack and encouraging vice or a person gaining control of the club for their own benefit, I will need to start thinking if I should carry on supporting a team like that, and it's because I can think for myself. I do not need your thinking and education to teach me that if I were to be a true supporter, I will have to support the team players no matter what, because I have my own liberation to choose and decide for myself. So spare me what you think everyone should do to be like you, because your opinion is bias.</div>

You canÂ’t accept that someone now owns something that you said you once loved. I was just pointing out what a normal supporter is like from a fair weather one. ThatÂ’s all.<br>It doesnÂ’t have to be Man U, it can be any other club or even a basketball team for that matter. The kind of loyalty you have for something is rather worrying. You said that you are not a band wagon jumper. Well your words donÂ’t seem to suggest that you are one but your actions certainly does.<br><br>Anyway, I wasnÂ’t giving you history lessens cos I couldnÂ’t bother. I was just pointing out a simple error that you have overlook which is man u belonged to the fans and public which in fact, is the club was owned by one man way before you became a fan or during the time you claimed to became a fan until 1999 when it was floated on the stock market. TodayÂ’s situation is quite similar to pre 1999 thatÂ’s all. It doesnÂ’t matter if Glazer or someone else took over as long as the club continues in its path loyal supporters will continue to support it.<br><br>As I have said earlier, your example is too extremeÂ… and rather ridiculous too considering present day Â“the team starts promoting evil drugs for commercial purposes, change into a bunch of hooligans taking crack and encouraging vice then you must be one of those blindly supporting themÂ” Come onÂ… any right minded person here can tell you should it come to that day we can make up our minds if we still want to support this kind of stuff!<br><br>Lastly, You mentioned that you used to support Man Utd... till Glazer took over. And now we know how much you loved Man Utd before Glazer came, apparently not much enough!<br><br></div>
