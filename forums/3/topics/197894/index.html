This way they make the players themselves unhappy at their original club and ask for a transfer.<br><br>Once the player have asked for a transfer, They come in officially to make an offer. So in a way, they didn't approach the players illegally at all... Same for the Anelka case, he came to know RM wanted him then he starts to throw tantrum at arsenel and at this time, RM came in with an official offer followed by another when arsenal reject their first leaving arsenal no choice but to let him go rather than keep an unhappy player.
