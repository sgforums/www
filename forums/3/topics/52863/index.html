            <div class='col-md body'>I think Man U needs a player like Keano. He has surpassed my expectation of him as a player and captain. With Keano's playing days numbered due to his age, I think they need another player of his calibre. Fergie has always said that Djemba (x2) could be the one, but it remains to be seen. I won't be too disappointed if Man U doesn't win the league this season, so long as these new crop of players matures and who knows, they may eventually work all the way to be come champions again. Let's wait til the new year to see how it goes.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ronaldo is too young for now, But he will mature. He is the suitable player for the right-wing in my opinion. He just have to work on his crosses. I am so amazed by his ability to take free kicks with both feet. That's a real asset! For most of last season, I thought Solksjaer played on the right much effectively than Beckham. So I hope Solksjaer recovers quickly. Then there is the up and coming Fletcher, Fergie rates him highly.<br><br>In the heart of defence. I pray that Wes Brown stop getting himself injured. That way, Fergie will have a healthy headache when it comes to chosing defenders (O'Shea, Nevelle Bros, Slivestre, Fortunre, Rio).<br><br></div>

It's like their stars were meant to collide at the same time in order to play together in the same team. It's really hard to see any team do what they did. Most of the teams have one or two potential who made it. However a lot of rejects grow up to be major players as they developed. So a lot is still to be seen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Man U will feel the pinch when Rio does get suspended for the drug test thing. Rio may not be that fantastic so far, but he is a pillar in the team.<br><br>Kleberson just returned from injury, so it's still too early to say. He hasn't played enough Engish football yet. And I forgot to add that Phil Neville has been in fantastic form. I cannot say the same for his older brother, because I think his performance is more eratic and less consistent. However when he is at his game, he is one heck of a right back.</div>

Those young punk they signed...good in foot work but seldom hit target!........<br><br>RVN and giggs tricks is all known by EPL players....once close down RVN and giggs MU since to be struggling....... Ronaldo got nice foot work but didnt learn to shoot on target..... But i must say the GK was a good buy......</div>
