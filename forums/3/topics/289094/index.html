They are third in Group B, four points behind leaders Chelsea.<br><br>Valencia, who are fourth in the Primera Liga, face leaders Real Madrid at the Mestalla later on Wednesday.<br><br>Sanchez Flores was the third coach to have been sacked by Valencia in three years with predecessors Antonio Lopez and Claudio Ranieri also failing to live up to expectations following the success under previous boss Rafa Benitez.<br><br>Koeman was a member of the Barcelona team that won the 1992 European Cup and four consecutive Primera Liga titles in the early 1990s and he had a spell as assistant at the Catalan club when he began his coaching career.<br><br>He returned to the Netherlands to take the job of head coach at Vitesse Arnhem in 2000 and then took charge of former team Ajax the following year, leading the Amsterdam side to the league and Cup double in 2002 and another league title in 2004.<br><br>He stepped down in 2005 following a UEFA Cup defeat to Auxerre and then moved to Portuguese champions Benfica, but resigned less than 12 months later after they finished third in the league and signed a two-year deal with PSV.<br><br>PSV currently lead the Dutch first division after nine games, two points clear of rivals Ajax and Feyenoord. </span></div>
