            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>FIFA spokesman Andreas Herren told around 50 reporters at FIFA's headquarters: 'Both players have a congruent separate account of what was said. The words will remain private, but they were of an insulting nature, not a racist nature.'<br><br>However Paolo Maldini, captain of AC Milan and former captain of Italy's national team said FIFA's ruling was scandalous.<br><br>'It's <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">scandalous to suspend a player for having said something</span></span>. It's the first time it's been done and it's only because <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Materazzi is Italian </span></span>and because they wanted to justify the action of a great champion (Zidane) but who was in the wrong.' </strong></span><br><br>For full article, read here:<a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=374170&amp;cc=4716" rel="nofollow">www. soccernet.com</a><br><br>Despite the fact that Zidane was clearly in the wrong, Maldini has the cheek to insuinate that opposing players has the right to insult and verbally abuse soccer players in a match, hardly sportsmanship and definitely not the hallmark of a CHAMPION.<br><br>Sad that someone like Paolo would stoop so low to degrade those who seek to redress fairness in the beautiful game. My respect for him has dropped considerably.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The situation is very subjective I feel.<br>Different players handle insults differently.<br>The best example given before is Lilian Thuram. He has been insulted with racist remarks, but he said before that the best way to respond is to keep quiet and play well to shut the other party up. He has done that very well I feel.<br><br>How Materazzi should be punished? We will never get a common answer. It's too grey area I feel.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm afraid there's no Mr. Nice Guy in the modern football world anymore. Their objective is to win games, not to make friends. They can do anything to win games. What Materazzi did to Zidane, is similar to what C.Ronaldo did to Rooney, objective is to get them sent off. We may call it no sportsmanship, others call it smart move. No such thing as a "clean" game in football nowadays anymore.</div>
