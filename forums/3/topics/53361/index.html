I need to confirm that LFC has indeed offered me a 4 years contract at 35,000 pounds/week. Reebok has also offered me a 6 years endorsement deal worth US$23m. Please rest assured wonderful people of sgForum, because I will still be posting here and sharing my life experiences.<br><br>"I am absolutely flabbergasted yet elated at the prospect of plying my trade with such a talented and promising squad in such a respected club with a huge tradition for success. It is true that though several other major clubs like Man Utd, AC Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid have shown a distinct interest in my services, I must say, they were kind of late in offering me a contract. Though when they finally put their words onto paper, mostly offering double or more of LFC's contract, I have already decided to pledge my future with LFC. The fact that I have been a fan of LFC since I can remember, helped to tip the scales in their favour. It has always been my childhood dream to exhibit my undisputed talent on the global stage and I look forward to winning championships and trophies with LFC. As soon as possible." - Sun Sports</div>
