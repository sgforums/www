"If you tell me there is no problem with Joe Cole and we lose 10-0 then that is better.<br><br>"The problem today is that we don't want injuries, especially in pre-season.<br><br>"Joe Cole is injured but I am not a doctor and I don't want to speak too much about it because it's not my job.<br><br>"But everybody is worried because I think it's something to do with his knee ligaments.<br><br>"We will have to wait until we go back to London to see the specialist but he looks really injured.<br><br>"It's a problem because he is a big player for us. He was only on for five minutes but he gave a lot to the game during that time.<br><br>"You could see his quality as a player. He is a player that I need but don't have."<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Lost to "Baseball" team and damaged ligaments....PWNED </span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

It knocks him back a bit but it's something we have to handle as we have done many times in the past."<br><br>Carrick's injury capped a dismal couple of days for United in the Dutch capital.<br><br>They were already without injured trio Gary Neville, Nemanja Vidic and Gabriel Heinze, while Cristiano Ronaldo, Louis Saha and Mikael Silvestre were not deemed fit enough to travel.<br><br>United then lost Rio Ferdinand to an ankle injury sustained in the warm-up prior to yesterday's win over Porto and John O'Shea picked up a dead leg in the same game.<br><br>Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes are also facing the possibility of starting the season with three-match bans following their dismissals against the Portuguese champions.<br><br>"Your hope for the start of every season is a clean bill of health," said Ferguson.<br><br>"The last two years have been horrendous for us in terms of injuries. I was hoping we would get a free run this year but it hasn't happened.<br><br>"But we have a big squad and we have to get on with it. We have great experience and hopefully that will give us a good chance."<br><br>Ferguson confirmed his intention to play Rooney, Heinze, Saha and Silvestre against Oxford on Tuesday and also restated his belief there will be at least one new addition to his squad over the next fortnight.<br><br>"I am confident of bringing in one more player before the season starts," he said.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">PWNED NO. 2 </span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
