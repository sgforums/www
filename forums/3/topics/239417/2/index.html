Now with Chelsea, cos Jose had won most matches between the 2.<br><br>With all the finger pointing coming from broad fan base, Arsenal fan can't argue much. When they start to play dull football in the 90's they were named boring boring Arsenal. When they beat pool and Man U, they said Arsenal Sux. They always seem to be the bad guy in EPL. Now Chelsea not happy with yesterday fight, and happy to see gunner kana fine and get ban for matches.
