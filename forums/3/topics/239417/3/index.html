Broadcast material indicates that Essien cuffed Denilson on the face, and Drogba slapped the back of Cesc Fabregas' head. The FA also has access to film that was not broadcast on the day.<br><br>If the FA is prepared to follow the letter of the law, and risk the wrath of Chelsea and their lawyers, Drogba and Essien should be suspended for three games, the penalty for "violent conduct".</div>
