              <p><strong>A dive for penalty is given to ManU to help them in their 2-1 victory against Liverpool in the early Sunday game.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Torres score a splendid early goal to shock United, but<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <span style="color: #ff0000;">the referee helped ManU wif a spot kick which was won by a dive</span> </span>&amp; was converted by Rooney after it bounce off a Reina save. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Referee later threw 3 straight yellows on Reds to knock their momentum off. Rafa was fuming against United star Valencia</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>Elsewhere in the later Chelsea and Blackburn game, Referee Steve Bennett <span style="text-decoration: underline;">denied Chelsea <span style="color: #0000ff;">10 penalties, 5 of which is stonewall fouls in the box</span></span> against the likes of Drogba, Lampard, Anelka, Malouda, etc... esp Ivanovic who went off injured.</strong></p>

              <p>I don't think got 10 pens so much lah.</p>
              <p>Just 4 only..... though they are quite obviously in the Penalty area.</p>
              <p>Ref did not do a good job, but seriously Chelsea players had chances which they converted poorly.</p>
              <p>I'm a Chelsea supporter, but even i have to admit some of the players really CMI.</p>

              <p>actually, DivingUtd, do you realise one thing, when did U first become so negative about MU and diving?</p>
              <p>I tell you la, when Mourinho and the portugese players came to EPL.. you may want to single out Ronaldo, but he already in La Liga, Mourinho came and conquer Chelsea.. But Ronaldo's diving partner still in EPL leh, yep, the one feature in Tiger commerical.</p>
              <p>Now if only the joker who is trying to pull Valencia to the ground did a decent job, n outside the white line, the chance of diving/penalty would not have surfaced. But JavierM, chickenshit, afraid he may get a red, try to do a half-F job, try to carress Valencia's arm,  gets penalised, and what happens?</p>
              <p>but i bet you are so biased MU, diving started way back from you know when right?</p>
              <p>anyway, the more you post, the more success MU is having. It is just super shiok la.</p>

              <h3>Benitez backtracks: It was a penalty</h3>
              <p class="excerpt">Rafael Benitez conceded that the referee was right to
               award Manchester United a penalty during Liverpool's 2-1 league loss.</p>
              <p>Benitez
               has backtracked his earlier statement about Antonio Valencia diving 
              after the winger was adjudged to have been fouled in the box by Javier 
              Mascherano although the initial contact was made outside the box. 
              Mascherano was booked for his troubles.</p>
              <p>But Benitez later admitted to Sky Sports News that it was a penalty.</p>
              <p>"It appears that it was inside so it was a penalty, and Carra was 
              there so it was a yellow card," said Benitez.</p>

              <p>Actually, the more U say, the more of a fucking moron U sound like. But that's wat's a ManU fan is abt now rite?</p>
              <p>I stop being a ManU fan just after the Beckham incident which is not far fr the Treble season. I just saw too much kelong in the build-up to it..... that ManU is never a football team.</p>
              <p>After Chelsea trashed ManU 5-0 after that United Cheating Treble 99 season, i decided that there are really teams that still play Real Ultimate football.</p>
              <p>Not dive-ball or cheating ball...... but real FOOTBALL!</p>
              <p>Not wif hands, not wif refs help, not wif a FA chairman's help......just football.</p>

              <div class="content"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Manchester United reclaimed the top spot 
              yesterday with a 2-1 win over Liverpool but the goal that levelled it at
               1-1 was a little controversial.  Javier Mascherano clearly fouled 
              Antonio Valencia just outside the box but his run carried him into the 
              area, where he happened to lose his balance and end up on his backside. 
               The penalty was awarded and Rooney scored on the rebound but should it 
              have been a penalty at all?<br><br>Would a free kick outside the box 
              have been a fairer decision? which was asked of Sir Alex and he replied that "In honest view, it might not had been a penalty and United might had just gone home with 1 point."<br></span></div>
              <div class="content"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span></div>
              <div class="content"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Are attacking players entitled to delay 
              their fall until they're over the line?</span></div>
              <div class="content"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Do you think 
              the full time result would have been significantly different if the

              <p>you must be fickled minded where your loyalty is concerned. real fan dun change their loyalty so easily. they support the club thru thick and thin, even when the club is relegated. I have very huge doubts if you are a man u fan before. the reasons you mentioned for leaving united is lame to the max. so now you support chelsea? who is to say you wont support arsenal or liverpool next, whenever your next lame reason comes along.</p>

              <p><strong>Even if U realise your choice of club is wrong?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Maybe, i put it this way. ManU fans been writing a lot bout Terry saga.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>but..... surely cheating against one's wife or cheating behind a good friend EX-wife is not  wrong bah? going by ManU fan's logic!</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p><strong>But why are they saying it "wrong" time &amp; time again?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>So now is supporting something wrong a right thing, rooney9</strong> <strong>????</strong></p>

              <p>LOL, stop disturbing the ManU fans lah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, it not a penalty by any measure.</p>
              <p>I saw some TV replays. Clearly if 
              Mascherano did brought Valencia down, why did not Howard Webb shown him 
              an red card as well since he award the penalty ?</p>
              <p><br>Quite obvious. He is
               pressured into giving that penalty because the game is played at Old 
              Trafford. Howard Webb got it wrong here. The tackle was outside the 
              penalty box and the momentum of the tackle and fall brought Valencia 
              into the penalty box.</p>
              <p>Howard Webb got forced into giving an penalty when
               it is not. He should have consulted his line man first. But he did not.</p>
              <p>Liverpool fans will say "no" and ManU fans "yes". The rest won't care 
              enough to comment.</p>
              <p>One thing is you never see Ferguson to come out and say that any penalty Man U won 
              was rightly awarded.  As divingutd proved in that fergie's interview!</p>
