            <div class='col-md body'>To the manu fans dreaming of this move, u can continue gng on cos vieira has joined inter...<br><br><strong>VIEIRA MAKES INTER SWITCH</strong><br><br>France midfielder Patrick Vieira has been sold to Internazionale from Juventus for ｣6.5million.<br><br>The announcement was made by Juventus this morning through the Italian stock exchange.<br><br>The Turin giants bought Vieira from Arsenal for ｣13.7million last summer, but players are being sold following the team's relegation to Serie B as punishment for their role in the Italian match-fixing scandal.<br><br>The statement said: "French midfielder Patrick Vieira is officially sold from Juventus to Inter for 9.5m euros, payable in three years."<br><br>As well as dropping into Italy's second division, Juventus have been told they face a 17-point deduction to start the 2006-07 campaign.<br><br>The club have lodged an appeal against the penalty to CONI (the Italian Olympic Committee), the highest sporting body in Italy.<br><br>But by joining Inter, Vieira will play for title contenders in Serie A and he will also take part in the Champions League.<br><br>One of the consequences of Juventus' punishment is they were stripped of last season's title, and with second-placed AC Milan also punished for match-fixing, Inter were awarded the Serie A crown.<br><br>Vieira, who played for France when they hosted and won the World Cup in 1998 and also captured the European Championship two years later, has signed a four-year contract at Inter.<br><br>He shot to prominence in England with Arsenal, moving to the Gunners from AC Milan in August 1996.<br><br>Under French coach Arsene Wenger, Vieira won three league titles and four FA Cups during his time at Highbury.<br><br>The 30-year-old started his career with French club Cannes before leaving in November 1995 to join Milan, where he spent less than one season before moving on to Arsenal for Â£4million.<br><br>Vieira, who made 31 league appearances for Juve last season and scored five goals, was strongly linked with Manchester United but instead has opted to remain in the north of Italy.<br></div>
