            <div class='col-md body'>PATRICK VIEIRA wants to join Manchester United Â— and hopes to have a deal done inside 48 hours.<br><br>The ex-Arsenal star, 30, has decided to quit Juventus after their relegation in the Serie A match-fixing scandal.<br><br>Vieira said: Â“Everyone wants to play for a club like Manchester United at the very highest level. It might be difficult after nine years at Arsenal but anything can happen in football.<br><br>Â“I will certainly not be playing for Juventus next season after they were relegated to Serie B.<br><br>Â“I believe my future will be sorted out in the next 48 hours.Â”<br><br>If Vieira goes to Old Trafford he will link up with midfielder Michael Carrick, who completed an Â£18.6million move from Tottenham yesterday.<br><br>Vieira joined Juventus for Â£13.7m last summer after nine years at the Gunners.<br><br>But with the Turin side dumped from ItalyÂ’s top flight and without Champions League football, Juve need to off-load their highly-paid stars.<br><br>That means United boss Alex Ferguson could get Vieira for as little as Â£6m.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>finally a piece of good news - hopefully SAF moves to sign Viera, he's known to be admirer of Viera.<br><br>But reservation is that he may not have the fire in him anymore  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>It will defintely add bite to the midfield.  Then we have midfield of Ronaldo, Scholes, Carrick, Viera &amp; Park (or Giggs).  Scholes plays behind Rooney, who will be the lone striker.<br><br>Solsj can go to the bench and I await to see if he still live up to the reputation of "super-sub" &amp; I hope SAF don't need to call on his svc at all for the new season....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If Patrick Vieira does go the Inter, it will complete one of the most ironic moves in his career.<br><br>As a player at Milan, he formed part of the team that won the scudetto in 1996 but was plagued by racism and vowed never to play in Italy again. When he was finally brought to Arsenal for 4 mil pounds, it began as a match-made in Heaven for the frenchman. Together with Emmanual Petit, he brought steel to the Arsenal Midfield, with Bergkamp creating the chances and Overmars and Anelka banging in the goals.<br><br>After the controversial sale to Juve, and now an unlikely final destination at Inter, it seems he has come full circle back to the place that started his career: Milano.</div>
