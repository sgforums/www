Actually I feel that Peckerman did his calculations wrongly. If the gk was not injured, I believe Messi will definitely be used. Messi has the fresh legs to dribble the ball to the penalty area to allow the German defenders to foul him. With all 3 subs used, I think Maxi Rodriguez switched to Riquelme's position for more attacking options but the damage has already been done by Klose's equalizer.<br><br></div>

We should be able to do the same as sportsmen."<br><br>Punches and kicks appeared to be thrown in chaotic scenes which went on for approximately 90 seconds in front of a 72,000 crowd.<br><br>Bierhoff told German TV that he intervened after Cufre trod on German defender Per Mertesacker, leaving the player lying on the ground.<br><br>Germany and ourselves have great respect for each other and this was a thing of the moment<br><br>The trouble seemed to start when midfielder Tim Borowski gestured towards the Argentina players to "keep quiet" having scored his penalty to make it 4-2 in Germany's favour.<br><br>Several of the South American players walked towards him and when the final Argentina spot-kick was saved, the Argentina defender Fabricio Coloccini approached Germany's Oliver Neuville.<br><br>Punches were thrown in a brief melee before it was broken up.<br><br>"It's a shame that in a game like a quarter-final such pictures end up getting sent around the world," Bierhoff added.<br><br>Germany coach Jurgen Klinsmann put the trouble down to the intensity of Germany's dramatic win.<br><br>"I'd like to remind people that in football there is so much tension, so many emotions and if it goes all the way to penalties someone can lose control," he said.<br><br>"Football is just so emotional. It's just normal. It's no big deal, no problem at all."<br><br>And he was backed by Argentine coach Jose Pekerman.<br><br>"At times emotions run away with themselves at a match and it's not what we feel. Germany and ourselves have great respect for each other and this was a thing of the moment," he said.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not a great game but not one for the faint-hearted.<br><br>The game was decided on tactics.

Messi would have made a huge difference to the outcome.<br><br>For some strange reason, subbing Riquelme meant that Argentina lost control of the midfield.<br><br>Sad game which neither side deserved to lose..... but that's World Cup heartache for you.

            <div class='col-md body'>This is  the second time Argentina, having been hailed as favourites, have been uncharacteristically knocked out prematurely.<br><br>Perhaps the 6-0 hammering of S n M gave fans too high an expectation and people should have paid more attention to their dour 0-0 match with holland. That was probably a flicker of things to come.<br><br>However, there's no shame in losing to another attack-minded team, unlike the 2002 WC, where defensive minded England and Sweden practically upset their adventurous play.<br><br>Still, as many have pointed out, Jose Pekerman chose to stifle attack by taking out Crespo and Riquelme when the team was leading, effectively removing his sole creative talent up front and allowing Ballack &amp; Co a license to control the midfield.<br><br>It was a defensive gamble that failed this time round.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Argentina paid the price<br><br>So operation "Score a goal then put 10 men behind the ball and defend for our lives" failed, miserably. They got complacent with that one goal they scored and took all their attacking players for defensive players then stayed in their half, Barely looking for another goal, I must say they're even more boring than to watch than Home Utd.<br><br>Taking a versatile Riquelme for Cambiasso was a big bad mistake, They weren't able to cope with crosses and Odonkor's pace. Then they took off one of their best striker for Cruz. Honestly I think they deserve to lose, Good for Germany today.. But tommorow a peaceful german village is probably gonna be razed to the ground by England fans when they get knocked out.<br><br>BTW, Who did the argentinians jumped on after the shoot-out?
