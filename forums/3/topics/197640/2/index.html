            <div class='col-md body'>Klose: Argentina unlucky to draw the hosts<br><br>BERLIN, June 28 (Reuters) - Argentina have been unlucky to draw hosts Germany in the World Cup quarter-finals, striker Miroslav Klose said on Wednesday.<br><br>Klose, displaying the confidence of a player who has already scored four goals at these finals, recognised Argentina as a top team but said Germany would triumph on Friday in Berlin.<br><br>'We're not nervous about this game,' Klose told a news conference. 'Argentina were the favourites to win the World Cup but now they've had the bad luck to be drawn against us.'<br><br>Argentina were made favourites after beating Ivory Coast 2-1 in a high-quality match and then lifting their game to an even higher level in a memorable 6-0 win over Serbia &amp; Montenegro.<br><br>They drew 0-0 with Netherlands to clinch top spot in Group C before beating Mexico 2-1 in extra time in the second round.<br><br>Germany have also scored 10 goals and conceded two but their passage has been even smoother, with four straight victories over Costa Rica, Poland, Ecuador and Sweden.<br><br>'We know we have a good opportunity to beat them,' Klose said. 'They're a good team but if we press them for the full 90 minutes they will make mistakes. It's then up to us to exploit them.'<br><br>Klose scored five at the last World Cup but his all-round play has been even better this time.<br><br>He scored twice against Costa Rica, got two more against Ecuador and set up both goals for strike partner Lukas Podolski in the commanding 2-0 win over Sweden in the second round.<br><br>'I'm on top of my game and I want to prove it,' the 28-year-old said. 'I have certain goals at this tournament and I'm glad I'm reaching them. I'm very ambitious.<br><br>'Argentina are a top team at this tournament but it's just unlucky for them that they have to play us.'<br><br>West Germany and Argentina met in the 1986 and 1990 World Cup finals. Argentina lifted the trophy when they won the first showdown 3-2 in Mexico, with the Germans gaining revenge with a 1-0 win in the showpiece match in Italy four years later<br><br>So confident?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Germany soccer style has changed dramatically ever since Klinsmann take over as coach. Still remember back in my teenage years, ppl always complain Germans play boring soccer. Score 1-0 and then defend like mad to run down the clock. The pre-World Cup friendlies also exposed their vulnerabilities but all that is being over-shadowed by their achievement so far in World Cup 2006.<br><br>In this tournament we see a changed side. They attack and attack to get goals of 2-0, 3-0 etc. However as all teams, they let in goals too in their effort to push too far into enemy territory. German defence has always been good but now not so good due partly to the choice of players Klinsmann chose. Even German defenders are a bit attack oriented. Lahm is a defender covering the flank and even score a running goal in the first goal of WC 2006. Torsten Frings goal was fantastic too.<br><br>In this classic encounter, it is a hard match to predict the winner. My gut feel is a 1-0 in German favor due to home crowd support and past historical statistics that seem to favor host nation. If come down to penalties shoot-out I can safely say should be German favor as German has always been pretty strong in dead ball situation.<br><br>Let's enjoy the match <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Confident Klose feels for 'unlucky' Argentina<br><br>In-form Germany striker Miroslav Klose pities Argentina for their 'bad luck' in having to play the hosts in the World Cup quarter-finals.<br><br>The 1990 World Cup finalists are preparing for what could be one of the most thrilling and hard-fought matches of the whole tournament.<br><br>Backed by a euphoric home crowd, Germany have won all their first four matches - while unbeaten Argentina looked especially impressive in a 6-0 thrashing of Serbia and Montenegro.<br><br>But self-confident Klose, who has four goals to his name, insists there is no reason for his country to be 'nervous' about tomorrow's match in Berlin.<br><br>'We know they are a strong team and were considered favourites to win it all,' said the 28-year-old.<br><br>'But it's bad luck for them to meet us, because we want to reach the next round - and therefore we will beat them.<br><br>'If we keep them under pressure for 90 minutes they will commit mistakes - and then we will capitalise.'<br><br>Germany twice drew 2-2 against Argentina in the first half of 2005.<br><br>'I could not play in both matches, so I am very happy to participate this time out,' said Klose.<br><br>The Werder Bremen striker, who netted 25 goals in the last Bundesliga season, is warning his team-mates not to get carried away with their encouraging form.<br><br>'After two or three good matches, I don't think we should speculate about whether we are a force again or not,' he said.<br><br>'It is important to focus on the next opponent.'<br><br>Klose is full of praise for Argentina's attacking strength.<br><br>'They are very strong up front,' he said.<br><br>'(Javier) Saviola is extremely quick, and (Hernan) Crespo is always a force in front of the goal. He is like (Ruud) van Nistelrooy. But I am in great shape as well and must not hide myself.'<br><br>Four years ago, Klose scored a hat-trick in Germany's 8-0 rout of Saudi Arabia and followed up with two more goals in the group stages.<br><br>He has four goals to his name this time but still has to find the back of the net in the World Cup knockout stages.<br><br>'I have had a plan for the tournament, and things have gone well thus far,' he said.<br><br>'I always want to reach the maximum and I am going the right way.'<br><br>Germany's back-up goalkeeper Oliver Kahn has hailed Klose's overall development on and off the pitch.<br><br>'He has developed not only as a player but also as a person,' said Kahn.<br><br>'Four years ago he remained very quiet and modest despite being one of the stars of the tournament. He has a strong personality with a lot of leadership skills.'<br><br>Really hope Germany lose.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Argentina's defence should prove a mean test against Germany's attackers. Klose will be tightly marked.<br><br>Germany will hv the majority of the crowd cheering them on but that wun unfaze the men in blue&amp;white stripes. The more clinical finishings from Argentina's front two shld prove decisive in this match.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, both team are very exciting to watch,<br>and perhaps Germany being the more consistent among the 2...<br>but, lets not forget Argentine can have all 11 players defending and yet can still score goals...they are highly effective...<br>they had 40+ shots and scored 10, germans took 80+ shots to do the same...<br>hence thats the difference i feel....<br>and Pekerman is far more experienced than Klinsman...<br>most importantly, German will be pressured to win,<br>and Argentine have nothing to lose..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>any of u noticed that lehmann has not saved a good shot yet? i'm sure argentina players can test him to see whether he is a good goalie.<br><br>even though lehmann is Arsenal player (my fav club), i hope my fav team, Argentina can caused him to make mistakes and score more goals. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
