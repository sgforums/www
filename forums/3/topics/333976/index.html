              <p>Excellently informative news from Seah Chiang Nee:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>Li Jiawei</em><br><strong>She's leaving and that's that</strong><br>If what is surmised is true and she's going for good, it’ll be a big setback for Singapore's overseas medal-scouting ventures. red sports.<br>Oct 15, 2008</span><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br><br><strong>By Sports Fan</strong><br>A member of the public, Edmund Lin, wrote to a local newspaper (see full letter below) about Li Jiawei’s probable departure for Beijing to get married and pursue her studies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I couldn’t help being amused by Edmund Lin’s last paragraph in which he wondered whether the Singapore Table Tennis Association (STTA) and the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) will pull out all the stops to encourage Li to stay on and contribute to the local sports scene.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Let’s be realistic.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There is NOTHING that the STTA and the SSC can do to keep Li in Singapore simply because she does not have a sense of belonging to the country beyond table tennis. In fact, I wonder whether Li has ever felt a sense of belonging to Singapore in the first place.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Don’t get me wrong. The above sentence is not - I repeat - not a criticism of her.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">But it harks back to my previous postings of what the Singapore passport and the pink identity card means to all these foreign sports talents who have been scouted and brought in by some of our national sports associations (in particular, the Singapore Table Tennis Association and the Singapore Badminton Association).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As I wrote previously, the Singapore passport, in such instances, is just the symbol of the exchange of services that takes place between the foreign-born athlete and the National Sporting Association (NSA).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The NSA offers the foreign-born athlete citizenship and the chance to represent a country at the highest levels of competition, opportunities which will not come the athlete’s way if he or she continues to stay in his or her country. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This offer also includes many lovely carrots too, namely all the financial rewards that can be reaped from winning international competitions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In return, the foreign-born athlete offers the NSA the best years of his/her life as a professional athlete, and immerses himself/herself in a life that revolves only around training, competition and bringing sporting success to the country.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">After several years of servitude, the foreign-born athlete decides to retire or stop playing. When that happens, there’s nothing left to attach him or her to the country. Why? Because it’s just the end of a well-paying playing contract.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The foreign-born athlete decides it’s time to go home to his/her country of origin - and Singapore sports fans throw up their arms in despair because the numerous sporting honours that the athlete has won for Singapore suddenly seems hollow and meaningless.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Sense of belonging<br>- never likely</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Coming back to Li - how could one have ever expected her to feel a sense of belonging to Singapore when each and every single day of her 15 years here was spent either in training or travelling overseas to represent Singapore in competition?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I am given to understand that she never had any form of public or private education here, and spent many years living in STTA quarters. So the chances of her interacting with Singaporeans on a daily basis were minimal at best.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It’s also why even after 15 years, she is still only seen and heard speaking in Mandarin and can barely utter a sentence in English/Singlish.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Also, look at who she has (publicly) fallen in love with in the time she has been here: first it was Ronald Susilo. Now, it’s this Beijing businessman. One can only conclude from here that she is only able to identify with a fellow foreign-born athlete or with a fellow Chinese national.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So, really, could one really expect Li to continue living in Singapore after wrapping up her playing career?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Once again, the people at fault here would have to be the STTA officials and to a certain extent, the SSC.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">And let me clarify: when I say STTA officials, I don’t mean Lee Bee Wah, who became the NSA’s new president in July, and her management team.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I mean the people of the previous regime - in this case, the ones responsible for scounting her and bringing her in 15 years ago and who have been looking after her development as a player.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Clearly, there were no efforts by them to help the likes of Li and her fellow foreign sports talents to get to know their new country better. It doesn’t look as though the SSC did much either to ensure that the STTA do a better job of integrating their new citizens with their new country.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So now, the STTA, the SSC and Singapore sports find themselves finally reaping what they have sown. And my, my, what a bitter harvest it is turning out to be, hey?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Silver meal: A sour taste</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">What’s worse, there’s nothing both organisations can do now by way of damage control. Because the damage was done a long ago. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">And as a result, slowly but surely, the sweet euphoria of winning that Olympic silver medal in Beijing is starting to leave a bitter aftertaste in the mouth. The sense of national pride in that achievement is starting to deflate and the win is now increasingly looking like a hollow victory.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Can you imagine what you will be telling your children or even your grandchildren in future if they should ever ask about this historic sporting achievement?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Can you imagine yourself saying: “Yes, we won an Olympic medal after 48 long years. But most of the players who won it for us have all gone back to China. I don’t know what they are doing now.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Better start practising - because it’s going to happen.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Even heroine Feng may leave</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Because now that national women’s table tennis coach Liu Guodong has huffily rejected a new contact with the STTA (see report here), the word is out that his protege, Feng Tianwei, regarded by many Singaporeans as the true heroine of the Singapore team’s capture of the Olympic silver medal, may soon leave to join him wherever he goes (they have a very close relationship, apparently). </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Well, like I said, we are now reaping what was callously sowed by the previous regime of the STTA. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Nice feeling, hey?<br><strong>redsports</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Comments</strong><br><strong>singaporesportsfan says: </strong><br>To be honest, there’s nothing wrong in trying to make a living out of sports. If a country is willing to let you represent it and help you to make a living out of it, then why not.<br>But I am starting to conclude that it is the national sports association that is at fault when these foreign-born athletes decide to leave Singapore when their playing careers are over.<br>What has the NSA done to help them to feel a sense of belonging to Singapore? If the NSA has been remiss in this, then really, the real betrayers of Singapore - and Singapore sport - are its officials, not these athletes.<br>Like I said, we are now paying the price for these NSAs’ relentless pursuit of personal glory.<br>Now the next question has to be asked: did they really want to achieve something for Singapore, or was it for their own glory and bragging rights ie the chance to swagger around and boast: “Hey, it was me that helped Singapore to win that Olympic medal, you know?”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>watanabe says: </strong><br>They are Singaprean, aint they? These foreign has no sense of belonging to Singapore. You call them Singaporeans but what they have in heart is the $$$-dollars that Singapore can provide…<br>When you buy service byusing $$$ it is very natural that the loyalty is very short and weak.<br>It is like marrying a woman who only sees the old man’s money, no love just sex in exchange for wealth.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>jan says: </strong><br>This is so true. <br>It’s funny how Singapore fails to ‘retain’ the Chinese talent, which is never an issue for other nations that take in foreign talents from China. I mean, I do not think that the Chinese foreign talents I know in France, Germany or Netherlands or other European nations do ‘identify’ with the country too, yet they stay on. <br>BUT, I do notice that these Chinese nationals have all picked up the local language because there is no way they can survive speaking in their mother tongue unlike in Singapore.<br>So this makes me consider how this ‘retaining talent’ issue mght have to do with the complex issue of how Singaporeans also struggle in defining a ‘national identity’, so I think it is even tougher for these foreign talents to identify with the country no matter what is implemented to ‘assimilate’ them. <br>Even the younger Singaporean generation themselves struggle with identifying with the nation too, hence brain draining overseas. <br>Moreover, Singapore being the pragmatic society it is, the prospects of retiring as a sports personnel is very bleak, which explains why the local youths are not encouraged to pursue a full-time sporting career. <br>I trust there may be the prospects of a well-paying coaching contract, however, if it is implicated with the issue of marriage, then it is a different story altogether. <br>I mean, recent statistics show that, Singapore is not doing that well in ensuring that Singaporean women marry locally, Li’s choice doesn’t come to me as a surprise at all.</span></p>

              <p>Don't blame her.</p>
              <p>The SSC never put in enough effort to cultivate her sense of belonging to Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She sang the PRC anthem when she was standing in the podium donning Singapore colours.</p>

              <p><br>i think the man u're referring to is Li Hou Lin (æ�ŽåŽšéœ–). LHL did get into the rumor that he was going to marry Li Jia Wei, but very soon both of them stood out to clarify that they did not know each other.</p>
