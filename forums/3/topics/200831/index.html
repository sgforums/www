They must be open to international level and not only asian or worse middle east region. Sure win.<br><br>ANother reasons becos, they dun cost much. Brazil are reportedly being the most heaviest in debt country. Even their poor youth got the chance to beat singapore. There maybe even a chance to grow a superstar here in sgp.  Both is a win win sitaution and they had nothing to lose.<br><br>Good for Singapore..<br>Samba Soccer!</div>
