"We know it will take time to integrate them into a team; [the former Argentina internationals] Ricky Villa and Ossie Ardiles took a while to adapt."<br><br>Having resurrected West Ham's fortunes in his 36-month reign as manager, during which time they have put their finances on an even keel and returned to the Premiership after relegation, the former Reading manager enjoys strong boardroom backing.<br><br>The dreadful run in the Championship which began in March last year, when a two-point return from five matches left West Ham seemingly out of the play-off race, remains fresh in the memory.<br><br>"Compared to the pressure of 18 months ago, it is a walk in the park," said the source. </span><br><br>but the results don't speak for them</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cool it guys... we are all here because of our passion for football and not picking fights, so lets cut some slack on the poor guy, will we? much as i agreed with you guys that he is not correct on this instance and of course alot of others times as well but lets just let it go and move on.. no point having so many people explaining and trying to knock some sences into him when he is not trying to understand what other people's intentions are, certain people only selectively listen to what they like and disregards those that they don't like, so all your saying is not going to help him unless he decided to open his mind and look at things from a different prospective instead of constantly having doubts that people are trying to bad mouth him as well as the club he support.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>
