            <div class='col-md body'>Arse should just forget this season and start planning for next season, the constructing of new stadium really kill them and the US guy also only brought around 10% of the shares, guess unless more investment comes in else it'll probably take them 3 more years to see the benifit of moving to a big stadium.<br><br>but the differences between the top 4 and the rest will be as such that even without much strengthening they'll still be the top 4 teams so even if no ECL to look forward to they'll still see some euro action.</div>
