            <div class='col-md body'>Raymond Domenech has warned Chelsea midfielder Claude Makelele he will face a two-match club ban if he fails to link up with France's squad for their upcoming Euro 2008 qualifiers.<br><br>The 33-year-old has been included in Domenech's squad for games against Georgia and Italy next month, despite announcing his retirement after the World Cup final defeat to Italy.<br><br>The France coach is determined to have Makelele available for the opening games of their Group B campaign.<br><br>Under Fifa rules, any player who refuses an international call-up can be banned for two club games and Domenech says he will have no qualms about imposing the suspension.<br><br>Domenech has spoken with both Makelele and Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho and believes he is right to call up the former Real Madrid midfielder into his squad.<br><br>"We had a discussion (with Makelele) but I didn't ask for his opinion," Domenech said.<br><br>"For me it would be unthinkable to see a great player playing for a great club not playing for his national team.<br><br>"A player who refuses to accept a selection is liable to a two-match suspension.<br><br>"I had a discussion with Mourinho as I often do with the coaches of our international players but it was not a matter of reaching an agreement over Makelele.<br><br>"I told him where I stood, he told me where he stood. We still have the law for us."<br><br>The France Football Federation previously asked Nicolas Anelka to be banned for two Manchester City games after he turned down a call-up from Jaques Santini.<br><br>The ban was not upheld because Anelka had not been notified of his call-up in sufficient time.</div>

He is not a football player, he is a slave.<br><br>Â“He wants to retire but if he is not playing for France he will be suspended from Chelsea.

            <div class='col-md body'>Claude Makelele has dampened the furore over his selection by France, describing the claims by Jose Mourinho that he was being treated like "a slave" as excessive and emphasising that he takes great pride in playing for his country.<br><br>Chelsea's midfielder is believed to have verbally agreed with Mourinho last year that he would retire from international football after this summer's World Cup.<br><br>It was assumed Makelele would concentrate on Chelsea after the World Cup, having initially stepped down from internationals in 2004. However, Makelele disputed that he was being treated like a slave by France's coach, Raymond Domenech. "My coach's [Mourinho's] words are a bit too strong, he's probably gone too far,"<br><br>Mourinho has said Makelele had to accept the call-up, claiming for every France game the midfielder refused to play in, he would be forced to miss two Chelsea matches. A similar threat was first raised by Domenech but in fact Fifa's regulations merely state that a refusenik international cannot turn out for his club during the period of the release or for five days afterwards.<br><br><span style="color: red;">"There is no Fifa rule to prevent any player stopping his international career, that's up to him," a spokesman for world football's governing body said. "The one thing that has to be considered is that the intention to leave a national team or put an end to an international career needs to be communicated prior to a specific summons." </span><br><br>Mourinho may want Makelele to explain to him why he has been persuaded to continue with France. "We take these players but we don't have a knife against their necks," Domenech said.<br><br></div>
