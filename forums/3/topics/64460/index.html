He can basically play anywhere except the striker's position.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah!  same thoughts here!<br><br>i loved del piero, but ya, after that injury at the hands of udinese that time... never the same... he was almost coming back to power when he twisted his damn cruciates again earlier this season. oh well...<br><br>miccoli took a looong time to warm up, just like di vaio, but both are goal poachers... very useful for scoring goals, but i still think delpiero n nedved do most of the thinking on the field.<br><br>zambrotta is arguably juve's most important, underrated player.  he's awesome. nonstop runnin, no complainin, solid performances. indispensible.<br><br>appiah looks tobe hot, but im wondering why lippi doesnt wanna use davids till he actually expires.<br><br>legro has great potential and is already rather cool for his age. just in time coz i think montero's losing it a bit</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Juve is linked to purchase Lucio from Bayer Leverkusen when the transfer window opens in January. Lucio also expressed interest for playing for such an illustrious club. If he really switched clubs, would it finally be the end of the Paolo Montero-Ciro Ferarra partnership in defense that lasted for nearly 8 years? And the next generation of Juve's defense will develop between Nicola Legrottaglie and Lucio....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what rossoneri.......AC Milan not too bad either ar<br><br>but i'm a damn hardcore Bianconeri fan........and this is what i feel abt the whole team....<br>overall, it has improved and it's by far the best this season.....good decision to sell zidane....not it is a team of juventus not so concentrated on a few individuals<br>buffon definitely one the the best keepers in the whole but he got his weaknesses...not very strong in the air, likes to commit early(that's waht makes his saves spectacular) and prefer to punch sometimes. chimenti not too bad can stand in for buffon if really necessary<br>thuram is good but his crossing needs to improve when overlapping. i was very impressed with birindelli's performance marking figo vs real madrid last season. he is not too bad, versatile. montero zai as per normal but will turn off sometimes. luliano also. legrota needs to iron out some control and zai-ness at the back but he'll be an able successor to montero in time to come. tudor same as legrot....but a bit slow, but damn fcuking strong. other defenders i shall not mention.<br>zambrotta good at left and right but his left leg if better means he will be damn fcuking good. he can take on r.carlos last season for pace means he is damn fast. davids is out of favour thanks to his temperament and he getting himself sent off is a potential to spoiling a match so that's probably y he is out of favour. tacchinardi is good. he is 1 of my favourite local players at juve. handsome model with strength and bite in DM and good shooting left and right. very very good. camoranesi a bit inconsistent but he adds another dimension to juve's play, dribbling on the right flank. maresca too a bit inconsistent but basically a more visional/creative passing individual. appiah got potential to take over davids and he is good with both left and right but not too zai and driven as davids. but he is stronger and more controlled. lastly nedved. 1 word. SOLID. i luv the way he ramps the ball. fcuk man.....but age a bit catching up on him seen him taking on players less often. he luvs fast direct football sometimes but if he can slow down on that, juve might be more efficient sometimes. especially against those got fast defences such as man u.<br>captain Del piero.....no doubt he is zai. i rate him as the best free kick taker within 20-25 yards last season. but as mentioned by many, he's a different player now. but all credit to him last season beating real madrid. superb. he lacks power in his shooting sometimes that's the bad part. but he is a very very good support striker with right main foot and good left foot capable of playing on left side forward role. trezegol.....flair striker with good finishing. but 1 thing bad is if he is marked very tight but someone stronger than him, might be a bit dry sometimes. di vaio is a bit of everything that possesses a good shot with his right. miccoli similarly to di vaio with faster pace and creativity. zalayeta.....did not forget the goal he scored against barcelona last season.....big bang man from birindelli's cross.....sucker punch.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh yeah.....i forgot old uncle ciro ferrara...ex teammate of diego maradona........<br>he is a wonder man.....he is still that committed when he plays....absolutely salute him. even mr fergie have to salute him too. not skillfull or as zai as thuram but he is very experienced and respected even by referees. u see him play foul referee also dun really dare to say him or book him, unless is really bo bian knn.........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hahah i luve vicente of valencia also man.....fcuking exciting player but poor finishing.....but he is still young........<br><br>i still remember 2 or 3 seasons ago under ancelotti that time, wa lao.......the match perugia vs juve 0-0 half-time then rain match delayed during half-time then i book in army and next morning juve lost the title cannot win perugia away.......fcuk man so disappointed....during that season got 1 more game dunno against who .last min inzaghi should have scored n win the game but hit the post and if that went in also win title but wasted....but now seeing them back on track is fcuking hell just makes my day. especially last season whack real madrid up solid solid. knn if u all got watch the 2 legs. especially the 2nd leg, WTF is madrid man. 3-0 no answer.....the penalty ok lar fair enff zidane goal is juve slack liao but that match real madrid really cut off. it is not their off day but they were shut down. damn solid team perforamnce.<br><br>i also noticed a lot of ex-juve players been good even after leaving juve. zidane, henry, inzaghi still good especially last season fcuking lethal, edwin van der sar, not to forget vialli n robbi baggio also. salas a bit wasted broke his leg after coming from lazio. i was damn bloody happy when juve bought nedved from lazio. he was damn driven and good and is my dream 11 players in midfield and he completes the puzzle for juve with zidane leaving. simply superb.<br><br>i have supported juve since the days of roberto baggio........</div>

By the way, which jersey do you think is the worse design Juve ever wore?
