            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez has angrily spoken out against the prospect of his side being forced to travel to Israel for a Champions League match next month.<br><br>Liverpool have been drawn against Maccabi Haifa in the third qualifying round, and face a second leg in Israel on August 22 or 23. Benitez is appalled at the prospect of the club's staff, players and fans travelling for a game in Israel at a time when that country could still be involved in military action in Lebanon.<br><br>Benitez said: "It's a crazy situation and totally unacceptable to even think about us going over there at this time. The situation is as bad as it is now."<br><br>"It's impossible to prepare for a game in these circumstances.<br>Benitez told the club's website, Liverpoolfctv.com: "There is no way we should be going to Israel to play a game of football at this time. It's crazy to even consider it. UEFA cannot put anyone at risk.<br><br>"The situation is very clear in my mind. I feel sad for the people over there at the moment because it's a terrible time for them, but we have to put the security and safety of everyone involved before anything else and that means we cannot travel there. It would be impossible to concentrate on the game.<br><br>"UEFA need to make a decision quickly because there will be lots of our supporters wanting to know what is happening."<br><br>Liverpool are set to make an official representation to UEFA about the situation and ask for the game to be moved to a neutral country.<br><br><strong>The question is what if a rocket fly into the studium while Liverool were playing and the whole Liverpool team was wipe-out? How will you all feel? </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MACCABI HAIFA have pleaded with Liverpool to defy the bombs and face them in Tel Aviv.<br><br>The Maccabi president insists they will be safe playing next monthÂ’s Champions League qualifier there.<br><br>Understandably, Liverpool are unlikely to be convinced.<br><br>Three days ago, two rockets landed 100 yards from the Israeli championsÂ’ tiny Kiriag Elyiezer Stadium.<br><br>No one was hurt but the car belonging to defender Alon Harazi suffered extensive damage in the blast.<br><br>Tel Aviv is just 50 miles south of Haifa, a port city which has borne the brunt of recent missile attacks.<br><br>Maccabi Haifa president YaÂ’akov Shachov insists the game can go ahead peacefully in the national stadium in Tel Aviv.<br><br>He said: Â“I know Liverpool tried to speak with UEFA and that they do not want to play in Israel.<br><br>Â“I am not surprised by this attitude. But there is no danger in Tel Aviv, I can assure them.<br><br>Â“We must speak with Liverpool and remind them that there is no war in Tel Aviv and there is no risk playing here. There would be no problems.<br><br>Â“Tel Aviv is quiet Â— letÂ’s hope things will stay quiet and we will be able to host Liverpool. ItÂ’s an unpleasant situation, although we understand LiverpoolÂ’s concerns.Â”<br><br></div>
