            <div class='col-md body'>What do u pple think of these world cup referees? i think they anyhow flash out the yellow cards on most occassion..dunno is it due to the pressure fifa gave to cramp down any fouls or to protect those so called star players..the worst referee i witness till now is the switzerland-france match..he booked the swiss player for not listening to him and kick the ball out when one of the france player is injured outside the pitch...<br><br>I personally thot this is ridiculous decision..how come a ref forced a player to be sportmanship? if the swiss doesnt kick the ball out for the inj for treatment..he will only be booed for unsporting likes..but to caution him? i was amazed!! Look, the player is already outside the pitch and he can receive the treatment from the medics, y the hell the opposition need to kick the ball out to stop play? he doesnt need to be stretched off or permission for the medics to enter the field so y the booking?<br><br>The Holland-Ivory Coast oso got similar situation where twice the player inj outside the field..but the ref din stop play..so y the double standard? Some of the red cards given were rather harsh..the red card on the ukraine player oso another incident..the ghanian player booked for kicking the penalty b4 the ref blow his whistle..seems like referees nowadays dun give warning..book whenever there is any physical contact or mischieve..is there a need? not only they slow the pace of the game..it affects the players too..in my opionon, all teams now played to the world cup standard in every match..but its the ref who are the let downs of this tournament..sad to see the standard of football rise only to give in to the sub standard of refereeing...</div>
