In a recent publication, tickets at Arsenal's new stadium is priced at about $60 pounds, not euros... The highest priced in England, probably the world cos English football being the richest... At Man utd its about $40 pounds, with Liverpool, Chelsea, Spurs all between $45 to $55 pounds each i think and Newcastle slightly below $40 pounds followed by the rest.<br><br>If its true then that may explain the bulk of their seatings are all season ticket holders cos Arsenal at $60 pounds per tic which is 3 times that of Barce's also has their season tickets all snap up for the next few years too and don't have a problem to fill their 60,000 every match.<br><br>Tho i am not sure it could be much more if you care to check out these pages.<br><br><a href="http://www.footballticketshop.com/match_details.asp?mtId=243" rel="nofollow">http://www.footballticketshop.com/match_details.asp?mtId=243</a><br><br><a href="http://www.footballticketshop.com/match_details.asp?mtId=741" rel="nofollow">http://www.footballticketshop.com/match_details.asp?mtId=741</a><br><br>But if base on the $30 euro for Barce with 90,000 seats &amp; $60 pounds for Arsenal's 60,000 seats, it could mean that Arsenal collects almost twice the amount Barce collects each match tho their stadium capacity is smaller.</div>
