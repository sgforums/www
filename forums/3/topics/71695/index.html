            <div class='col-md body'><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> Each time I hear that the singapore team has a match coming up. I always thought to myself how much they are going to lose this time. I was a supporter during the old times when we were playing in the Msia cup. At least they can score goals and bring pride and joy to singaporeans. Now a days, I hear excuses after excuses when they lost a match. Something is very very wrong with FAS.<br>Something needs to be done before the team lose even to school teams.<br><br>Even with S-league, the standard is far from satisfactory. Sad case.<br><br>Talk about 2010 tgt to reach world cup ... Please lah!!<br>Cannot even be the top team in SE Asia, talking about W-cup.<br>Can they beat the Thais?, Malaysia ? now I think Vietnam also pose big problem for them, VERY DISAPPOINTED !<br><br>Not to mention Japan, Korea and China.....and the Middle Eastern teams. I say show me you are number 1 in SE asia, if not better not think about W-cup. Lost to Pakistan even in the qualifying round, how to go W-cup ????? Relying on foreign players is not the answer.<br><br>Our boys have to buck up. I mean what is going on. ????<br>The S-league is a sheer waste of money, it is just a job for the players, no passion just jobs. Just kick some ball around and get paid, why not !! I know there are some who try but I would say it is just not good enough. They better work harder ??<br><br>Bring coach like Douglas moor where he pushed hard for skills and fitness many years back. And all players complainted is tough, what a joke ? but they were better after that. You think the S-league teams any better ? I seriously doubt it. ....<br><br>I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED, AND I NO LONGER SUPPORT OUR SINGAPORE TEAM. SORRY !!!!!!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore's state of soccer is on the ever decline. Look at all the talk abt GOAL 2010? haha.. that must be the joke of the year.<br>The ministers have forgotten that in the mist of promoting soccer at a higher level, they have fail to appeal soccer to the mass. What i mean by this? Every saturday, i used to play soccer at some place. For no apparent reason, a security guard was installed there to prevent us from playing there. Now the place jus lie unsed there every saturday when it could be used for hrs of enjoyment for a gp of pple tt loves soccer<br><br>I find it hard to find venues to play a decent game of football, such frustrations have led to many of my frd quiting or givin up the sport. I , too used to go back to my secondary sch to enjoy a game of soccer. But the security caught up with us again. THey install security cameras and called the police to round us up when we play our game there. GOAL 2010 ? My foot !!!!!!!!! Can't they jus realise that we are jus a bunch of harmless pple that want to enjoy sweating out on a saturday/sunday afternoon? haiZzZ<br><br>ANother things is the removal of EPL soccer from CH5. I could not believe my eyes when i read the papers that TCS has lost the rights to show the EPL to SCV !!! what nonsenses is this? i do suspect conspircy theory in that. I grew up in the days of admiring ronaldo, hoping 1 day to be like him( jus a stupid dream tt doesn't come true), my bro admired giggs in his heyday, when becks is not ard yet., so on and so for........ but wat abt the next generation? The cost of living in singapore is alreadi quite high, and having to pay an extra 22 dollars a mth to see a decent game of soccer??? not every household can afford that. From e EPL, pple drew their inspirations and interests to play soccer... now they can only watch s-league to inspire them.<br><br>GOAL 2010 ???!?!? anyone talking abt it still? the minister that brings it up doesn't seem to have anythin to say abt it animore...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree, he needs to come out with something creative and spectcular to annouce himself into the sporting scene. Admist all the talk abt the importance of sports and CCAs to admissions to courses, singaporeans are still of the paper chase type.<br><br>1 of the UNI courses i applied to requires you to fill up a form with your grades <strong>only</strong>. Nothing asked about your CCA records, testimonials.... what  a joke. And they only admit 40 students. Purely judged on acdemic achievements. How to change such a mentality when the sch of such reputation decided to bank on such ways to choose its students? Will pple dare to take up sports or CCAs? since it doesn't seem to help with my admission at all.</div>

If we cannot achieve it in 2010, then we'll try again at 2014, if not then 2018. It can be achieve as long as we dont give up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
