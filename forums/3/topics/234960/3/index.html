            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by omnipresent:</div><div class="quote_body">Its just a game. But singapore plays boring football.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>Actually recently they have been giving rather nail-biting matches...<br><br>In any case I don't see why some of the people here (not to mention some who create accounts just for this express purpose) see the need to blast Singapore for what happened. The penalty was given, we took it, and what happened happened. If many of the Thaiphiles haven't noticed the Singaporeans basically took a hands-off approach to this whole issue, and simply moved along with whatever was decided in the end.<br><br>We didn't leave the field when the thais left as if demanding the penalty, and we didn't plant the ball when they were gone and netted it, and the Lions certainly didn't go on some quest to demand automatic disqualification from the Thais for their behaviour. They just waited, and did what they had to do when the time came.<br><br>In retrospect the entire Thai protest was a disaster, pior to that they had the Lions off balanced and were in dominance until the penalty. Their protest basically took away any will they had to play the game, not to mention removed their focus from the pitch, and then a cold start to them both physically and mentally when they returned to the game.<br><br>It could be argued that the Thai keeper would have stood a better chance at saving that penalty had they just gone on with it, him having his focus still on the ball and on the game instead of coming back from a long protest, his phyiscal and mental condition needing to start again and what have you not. The post-penalty dominance of the Lions over the Thais showed that for a moment, the Thais were pretty broken as a team.<br><br>All in all, the Thais should have know that the protest was a one way ticket for them. It was either do or die. Either they carry out the protest to its logical conclusion or don't bother with it at all. But they did neither, and paid the price I suppose.<br><br>A loss is a loss, all teams lose at times. Some lose fairly and others lose because things just weren't in their favour. But how you react and handle to this loss is often far more important. Would the Thais be far better of and having the moral high ground to play if they walked out of the match losing 2-1 but having not launched their protest until after the game? Would not they have their heads held up high?<br><br>Instead they lost more in the protest. They were flustered, their minds on thoughts of things they can't possibly do anything about, and helplessly watched as they destroyed their own reputation as well as losing the match to go with it.<br><br>So yeah, who will be happy if their team loses in such a way? But condone a walkout like that? I wouldn't want the Lions to do that. The Thais have some serious soul searching to do instead of taking out their fustrations on another party that by all means, was playing the game no matter how it turned out.<br><br>So am I happy the Lions won? Of course. I thought they did a fine job against the Thais (thought they still have to work on areas of focus and composure) and handled an unexpected situtation a lot better then their traditionally superior foe. If you realize Sing v. Thai is more of a match of the underdog vs. the expert rather then the contest of equals... maybe the Thais have something to learn from the underdog.</div>

I for once think Singapore play pretty attractive football. Better than those thais as they can only play low and relies on speed most of the time.<br><br>Singapore, on the other hand, are good at both high and low balls. Good at defence unlike the thai's sloppy defence.</div>
