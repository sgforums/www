Even the team has the right to let opponent win by not continue playing, it is immature to do so for protesting the rule -- referee is always right.<br><br>Anyway, some people here made me surprised. If I were Singaporean, I wouldn't be able to accept myself to feel proud for the victory that my country get it by the mistake of the referee.<br><br>However, I feel a little bit thankful for that referee.

That's not very right, you know?<br><br>Yeah, we're proud of the victory because we worked hard for it. Thailand scored the equaliser with their first shot on target in the 2nd half against the run of play. And even that was a mistake made by Daniel Bennett because he played them onside by chasing after them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As xiaomayi has reiterated in another thread 'Politics and Sports should not mix'. I think Siamese Patriot everyone here agrees that it was a soft penalty and as such a certain team won because of that penalty. As much as u feel pride in being Thai, similarly most of the forumites here being Singaporean will feel proud that their national team did achieve a victory over South-East Asia's power house in soccer. Put it this way Siamese Patriot, cast the politics aside, if the penalty has gone the other way, then who would be the one celebrating and who would be the one biting the dust? My point is that Soccer is game, governed by rules, the refree is the official who governs the rules. Hence, when a mistake like this is made, it is the failure of the rules which has lead to the outcome. In the professional leagues in Europe where millions upon billions are at stake, several voices have been calling for video-replays. However, UEFA and FIFA have been against this proposal because it defies 'tradition'. Hence, if anyone is to be blame for the result, blame the rules.<br><br>As I said, the reacton of the Thai players is unacceptable but understandable. I hope the forumites here and all back in Singapore understand this. Similarly, I hope all SiamesePatriot that you'll be convince that majority Singaporeans bear no disdain  against Thais. Most Singaporeans treasure and understand how far back both nations go as joint founders of Asean and similarities and commonalities we share in the fight against terrorism and economic co-operation in line with the new global reality. Therefore, evermore, we as as Singaporeans or Thais, for both our mutual benefits should push for a long lasting friendship. At the end of the day, why let ourselves bear grudges for some political soap opera being played at the higher achalones of both countries. Let them play their games, while we cheer on the games that matter to us. May the best team win on sunday. Even if my Lions lose on Sunday, I'll still be proud of them. Even if your Thai team loses, I'm sure you'll be proud of them as well. Cheers!</div>

Have you seen the Thai players diving all over the pitch? Most of those tackles you talk about are 50/50 challenges, commonly seen every week in the EPL. It's part and parcel of the game. Any infringement of those nature are known as "fouls" and could get the offensive player booked or even sent off.<br><br>The Thais didn't get sent off for any professional fouls - they simply boycotted the match. What was the fucking big deal about that penalty that they have to resort to such unprofessional and clownish behaviour? You don't see the England players walking off the pitch after Diego Maradona scored his infamous "Hand Of God" goal against England in World Cup 1986 quarter-final, do you? That's the fucking World Cup, you know?!<br><br>And for those of you who say SG players should tell the referee that "it was not a penalty" or refuse to take the penalty, the players involved too would face punishment for not respecting the referee's decision.<br><br>Sportsmanship? Was that sportsmanship when that Thai striker knocked Lionel Lewis out cold during that meaningless King's Cup match in order to shoot into an open goal? It's basic courtesy, but hey, he didn't even apologise for that.<br><br>Unsportsmanlike conduct/Ungentlemanly conduct (Thais):<br><br><blockquote>Unsportsmanlike conduct (or unsporting behaviour, or archaically ungentlemanly conduct) is a term used in most professional sports to refer to a <strong>particular player or team who have acted inappropriately and/or unprofessionally in the context of the game. Such behaviour is not necessarily illegal according to the sport in question's rules, but is frowned upon by the vast majority of both players and spectators. The term is distinct from cheating in that it also includes conduct meant to incite others.<br><br>Examples of unsportsmanlike conduct include taunting an opposition player, the referee or the crowd, spitting, arguing, fighting, and losing one's temper. </strong></blockquote><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsportsmanlike_conduct" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsportsmanlike_conduct</a><br><br>For the definition of "fouls", read this:<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foul_%28football%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foul_%28football%29</a><br><br>Professional fouls:<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_foul" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_foul</a></div>
