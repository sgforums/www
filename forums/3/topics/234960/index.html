Simple boys from simple humble backgrounds. Here they are facing an opponent from a nation that they have been made to believe are screwing up their country. It is soccer, it is a patriotic game. When you lose in such a manner as they did, you obviously feel that you've been cheated, that destiny has done it again. I understand their reaction, and hope that they wil give our boys a hell of a game in Thailand. </div></blockquote>Sports is sports. Politics is politics. They shouldn't mix both together.</div>

As it is the referee was being nice to them - he could have flashed the yellow card to the entire team after five minutes of their childish behaviour for time-wasting.<br><br>Heck, we were nice to them - both the FAS chief and Noh Alam Shah (the guy who was tugged in the first place) urged them to continue playing. The two of them could have easily just kept quiet and wait for the referee to call off the match and award it to Singapore.<br><br>I seriously hope that the AFC or FIFA places sanctions on the Thai team. This is after all not the first time that they spat on the Beautiful Game and trampled on it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is true that the action of the Thai boys were unsportsmanlike, no one is denying that to any effect. What I am saying is that that their behaviour is causal and should be understood, instead of being blatantly brandished as 'Unsportsmanlike' just because they did not meet a certain 'sportsmanlike' standard. Yes, sports and politics should not mix, it just kills whatever positives brought about through the interaction of wills. Thus any action which pervades this order should not be accepted. Therefore, the action of the Thai players should not be accepted.</div>
