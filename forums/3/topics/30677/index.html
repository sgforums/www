            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Manchester United v Westham</strong><br>manchester united did england proud by defeating european arch rivals deportivo by 2-0, both coming from red hot hitman rvn. it is not the scoreline thats impressive, but the style of play from manchester united that left lots of fans breathless. the endless wave of attacks from the red devils, pivoted by ryan giggs dazzling runs from the left, solskjaer right wide flank attacking options, the surging forward runs by scholes, and the ever threatening rvn in the box. even when deportivo surged forward -- one of the best attacking european sides, they are nullified by the defenisve midfield play from phillip nev, who seems to fit in perfectly to this role! and the central defence combination of wes brown and silvestre is getting rave reviews - pace, discipline, and organised. even john o'shea is realishing his role in the left back which gary nev is playing superbly game after game since the bloppers in the manchester derby. butterfingers barthez seems to be putting doubts abt him behind, and is proving to be one of the best in his field once again!<br>as for westham, they are unlucky to go away with a draw last weekend versus middlesbrough, joe cole being called up for captaincy after canio is sidelined, and seems to taken up the responsibilty easily. however it is their defence that still needs more work to be done, they are simply giving too much balls away, and their aerial defence seems pretty weak, even against a weak aerial boro side. it is in midfield they need to be strengthen up as well, westham creative midfield crumbles against a more physical opposition midifeld, unless they are able to win more balls, get more pocession, it will deplete the supplies to their strikers.<br>matching up manchester united and westham at this moment, is like dwarf versus giant, manchester is definitely going stronger game after game, gaining more more confidence in their trusty attacking play. the attacking options of manchester is definitely going to create problems from the start to the end for westham, and in the midfield, i can see phillip nev winning poccession for the devils, shutting down the creative plays from westham. and in this game, westham will definitely miss the magical moment of di canio, without his magical boots, it is hard to see westham creating much a problem for manchester. especially the pace of silvestre and wes brown will match those of westham's. with a decent performance of manchester united, cheered by their passionate fans -- who seen manchester united revival and wanted more, i see an easy manchester united victory, once they open the 1st goal, the flood gates will be open! manchester united home form is too good now, either go with it or do not bet against the devils. i suggest a medium to high bet for this high confidence bet -- unless calmity james is wearing a superman suit, it is hard to see a clear cut manchester united victory!<br><br>MU WIN  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   GOOD LUCK<br><br></div>
