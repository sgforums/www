            <div class='col-md body'>Recently, I watched the match between Home United and Gombak United. As expected, both teams play as though they were amateurs and I feel that watching S-league in Singapore is like a comedy because the way they play is like a bunch of amatuers kicking the ball.<br>I watched one of the S-league match last year between Tampines and Jurong. I almost laughed. Have you seen a player get a yellow card becos of trying to waste time taking a throw in. What's even funnier was the fact that later in the match when he took the throw-in, he also try to waste time and ended up getting a red card. Then later they tried to waste time by kicking the ball over the stadium and the match officials have to use the new ball. Not once did they kick the ball over the stadium but twice or thrice, which really portrays how poor the S-league is.<br>I enjoy most is when I sit with the fans and I hear some of the fans shouting the player to lose weight. As the player is damn fat and clumsy.No wonder Sleague ticket match only cwan be sold $5 foi adults and $1 for children. In fact, with this price, the stadium is not packed and they have to give free tickets.If given a choice, I rather watch the Malaysian league then the S league. Wonder what are the views of yours about the Singapore Professional League?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bro, I fully agreed wif u! S-League really sux big time!!! Sad to say or fortunately...i've never been to a 'Live" match at the stadium b4! Tried watching the matches on tv and i fell asleep!!!! The standard is super duperly low and the pace is slow! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> Wonder if FAS could make it to Goal 2010, and we r 8yrs away from that elusive dream of making to the World Cup!<br>Surely. the days of M-League was much much better than the S-league... I missed the unity of 50,000 odd fans cheering the Lions at the National Stadium. Tot that maybe S-league and M-league could merge and become Peninsula League or P-League....then we would have more teams and standard would be raise!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with you Clu. The S league should not be formed in the first place. In fact, teams like SAF is so much stronger than teams like Gombak or Sengkang. There is no competition. In fact the smaller clubs in S league will not have the determination to perform better as they will not be affected much. They will just receive less prize money and that's all.<br>However in the English premier league, it is a totally different scenario. Teams like Charlton or Fulham, if they do not perform well enough, they may be relegated and it really affects them.They will be relegated in Division 1. Therefore they may try their best and the club has the desire to achieve more buying better experience players.<br>The clubs in S league however, do not have the resources to afford players of that high standard. And every year, I always see the same 12 clubs in the S league. If only,as you said the P league was formed, Singapore is able to get enough resources to get just one or two professional players and it will really make a big difference. In this way, the resources are combined and better players can be bought.<br>If that happens, I really dun mind, say travel to Malaysia just to watch a football match. Wow, it really will be interesting. In this way, playing professional football can help groom our local players to player even better. Maybe Indra Sadan maybe the next Ruud Van Nistelroy or Ahmad Latiff may be the next Beckham.<br>I really hope that more people can point out their views how Singapore soccer can be further improved as being a Singaporean, I really wish that my country is one of the best in Asian soccer, overtaking the likes of South Korea and Japan. Maybe fans will be cheering players like Lionel Lewis, Mohd Nor Alam Sham or Indra Sadan</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the standard of s league is like very bad lor.Firstly there is no future in soccer coz a soccer player lasts till about 30+ then he starts to fade,unless he becomes a coach,and the s-league is a very poor league.more money should be invested into it so as to attract bigger stars.Look at the pitch and stadiums...They are quite crappy...<br><br>the standard itself is already v. bad,players train a few times a week,whereas in the EPL,players train almost every week and training is very serious.Singapore has set a target:goal 2010,but has done little to work toward it...<br><br>why?cozz talented players like me have not been picked out  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
