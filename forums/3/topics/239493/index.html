            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">tribalfooball.com - February 25, 2007<br><br>Manchester City's board will meet today to discuss the prospect of selling up.<br>A British-based consortium led by Ray Ranson, a former City player and wealthy entrepreneur, is rivalling unnamed United States investors for control of City. The Americans are understood to be favoured by the club.<br><br>City's share price rose from about 25p to 33p to value the company at about Â£18 million after an announcement on Thursday that the club were in "preliminary discussions" that "may or may not lead" to an offer being made.<br><br>The Times says the American bid is believed to be leveraged and could result in the club, who have existing debts in excess of Â£50 million, falling deeper into the red, a nightmare scenario for supporters who fear that the club could be saddled with a debt in much the same way Manchester United were when the Glazer family took over at Old Trafford.<br><br>That factor may play into the hands of Ranson, whose attempts to buy the club have been rebuffed and who failed with a Â£45 million bid for Aston Villa last summer. City are understood to have concerns about whether Ranson's consortium has sufficient resources, but it is thought to be prepared to take on City's debts and not saddle the club with additional debt. </span><br><br>EPL will be more interesting in 2 years time</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With all the takeovers going on, I think EPL is getting more and more boring cos teams will be buying ready-made products instead of utilising their youth team.<br><br>For example, no matter how well Scott Sinclair did at Plymouth, there's no way he can force himself into Chelsea's starting 11 becos of the manager's policy to buy a new player if that player in that position is not performing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>
