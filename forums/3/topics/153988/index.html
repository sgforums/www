            <div class='col-md body'>BEIJING : Shambolic Serena Williams suffered the worst loss of her career Wednesday night, dropping a 6-2, 7-6 (9-7) opening match to 127th-ranked Tiantian Sun at the 585,000-dollar China Open.<br><br>Former world number one Williams couldn't have looked less interested in the proceedings on court as she all but sleep-walked through to the second-round loss. Wearing no jewelry, even her trademark scream had gone missing.<br><br>The defeat marked the lowest point on court for the seven-time Grand Slam winner since going full-time on the WTA in 1997.<br><br>In November 1995, 14-year-old Williams was beaten by 149th-ranked Annie Miller in qualifying rounds in Quebec.<br><br>Sun, the Olympic doubles champion, clocked China's third win from as many matches on the day, with Peng Shuai and Zie Zheng reaching the quarters.<br><br>Only a day before, Williams had joked about the power of the Chinese in tennis, warning the world to "look out for those Chinese".<br><br>Sun got the message: "I never expected this victory, it's a breakthrough for me -- not a miracle.<br><br>"My serve and returns worked well, they were the key for me. This win will surely give me more confidence."<br><br>Williams, the defending champion, who had been banking on a dream final with her sister Venus, was generously credited with just 22 unforced errors in an embarrassing rout lasting one hour, 39 minutes.<br><br>Sun was clearly nervous in the closing stages as she played the American whose current 2005 form has been a shadow of her former self.<br><br>The Chinese right-hander caught the line with a looping return to erupt in relief after the bout of nerves which twice prevented her from serving out the upset.<br><br>Williams suffered her seventh loss of the season and can now do little but perhaps watch Venus try to pick up the family honour with her own opening contest against Spain's Nuria Llagostera Vives Thursday.<br><br>"I'm very disappointed, I struggled all night, I played terrible," said the American. "I never expected a tough match like this.<br><br>"I was struggling with my left knee. I'm disappointed I couldn't perform better. Sun played well, she was ready for the match."<br><br>Earlier, fast-rising Peng teetered on the edge of defeat, letting a 4-0 final-set lead slip before rescuing a 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7/0) victory over Mariana Diaz-Oliva.<br><br>The top-ranked Chinese at 33rd in the world gave her home nation a roller-coaster ride as they watched her apparent winning margin evaporate against the 29-year-old Argentine baseliner in the second round.<br><br>"I played very well up to 4-0 in the third, but I was too eager to win," admitted Peng. "I forced my shots and made a lot of unforced errors.<br><br>"But I'm very happy to have fought back to win. It's a good experience for me, winning a difficult match like this."<br><br>She added: "Playing in China makes me more nervous, there's a lot of pressure on me."<br><br>Peng will Friday face off against German Anna-Lena Groenfeld, placed into the draw with a bye after second seed Lindsay Davenport failed to appear this week due to injury.<br><br>Groenfeld reached the quarter-finals with a win over Japan's Ai Sugiyama.<br><br>Wednesday's run of local success is yet another sign of the Chinese women's tennis explosion which threatens to rival the current Russian boom in the game within a few seasons. - AFP /dt<br><br></div>
