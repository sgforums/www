They alrdy got so many english men playing in the team <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Look at Man Utd's youth policy. Interesting bit is 80-90% are of English/ British talent in the region. I think Ferguson firmly believes in the British roots and is willing to compromise players with greater talent outside the region.<br><br>I think the league needs to know what it is after. Either entertainment and revenue, or boosting the quality of the national team. No doubt, if this rule comes into place, the English team will benefit greatly, but will also compromise the entertainment value of the league.</div>
