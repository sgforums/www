There's nothing wrong with being very strong - they can play, too. They have a lot of class players.</span><br><br>"Chelsea were much better than us. They were really excellent, particularly in the second half, and we were unable to cope with them."<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Villa's American owner Randy Lerner splashed �100,000 on 96 coaches to bus 6,000 Villa fans down to Stamford Bridge.<br><br>But the plan backfired as an empty plastic bottle was thrown at Chelsea keeper Carlo Cudicini and a pound coin was also thrown on to the pitch. </span><br><br>Neither missile struck a player but ref Mark Halsey will mention the incidents in his official report.<br><br>O'Neill said: "We've enjoyed fantastic support but the bottle incident is not what we want."<br></div>
