            <div class='col-md body'>Asean Football Championship 2007<br><br>11 players, 11 goals<br><br>What a game it was indeed. Singapore did extremely well in winning the game against Laos, with an impressive score of 11-0. I made history yesterday, by being one of the 5000-6000, crowd at the National Stadium. Nobody expected such a score margin, in fact during pre match there were some who even thought Singapore would go down 1-0 to Laos. Each time Singapore scored, the crowd would ask for one more goal and they got it. What constituted to Singapore winning formula, besides the fact that Laos lacked in fitness, was the technical perfection of the basics of the game by Singapore.<br><br>The passes were accurate and the finishing was good. Finally, Singapore played how the fans wanted them to play. No flair but a discipline play was well greeted by the Singapore supporters. Alam Shah scored seven goals and he finished the game, with an excellent half volley in mid air, to the delight of the happy fans in the National Stadium. Even though the crowd size was small, they were in full support of the team. Professor Ho from the Football Association of Singapore must be jumping up and down after the game.<br>Singapore led 3-0 at half time and scored eight goals, during the second half, a massive feet I must say. With all the awe, the game was enjoyable for players and their fans. Singapore meets Indonesia tomorrow and what the fans are looking forward to, is a win by the lions, to top the group table and reach the semis in style.<br><br>(In a nutshell, get your basics right, that was exactly what happened in this game)<br></div>
