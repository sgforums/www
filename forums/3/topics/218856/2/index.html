It ridiculous to field an entire team of expatriates when playing in a domestic league.  If I am a fan, I feel cheated, imagine 60,000+ English fans paying huge money to watch a team of foreigners playing for a local club.  What contribution is Arsenal doing in terms of promoting sports / developing football talent?  They shld play a part and putting in a cap on the number of English players makes it a more level playing field and provide more opportunities for English players.<br><br>Nowhere in Europe do we see teams fielding an entire foreign players - not in Italy, not in Spain.  heck, even Barcalona and Real Madrid has local players on their first team.  What Arsenal (which, incidentially a club with long rich history in English football) is doing, is really not helping the greater things at all.  and they still have the cheek to fight (both off and on the sidelines).<br></div></blockquote>you hit the nail on the head.<br></div>
