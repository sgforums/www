            <div class='col-md body'>ANGRY Arsene Wenger last night vowed to fight FIFA plans to force Arsenal to field SIX English players in his team.<br><br>http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/tm_headline=wenger-vows-to-fight-fifa-plans%26method=full%26objectid=18043830%26siteid=94762-name_page.html.<br><br>Personally, it is a joke when Gunners field a team not having a single English.<br><br>I feel that no doubt, we want the best for your fans, but opportunities have to be given to local players to stage their claims.<br><br>It is the same logics if you reflect that to job market. Imagine all is kept for Foreign Talent cause they are cheaper &amp; seems better.<br><br>This is a big problem that is hitting our shores too. Look at how our Local soccer have not progressed despite the occassional Tiger Cup.<br><br>Look deeper and you can see that it also affects the economic binding of each country.<br><br>Issue: - is , do you want to give your locals a chance?  Certainly a cap of FT is a logicial thing to ensure certain% are locals, right?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>English player will be over price as the numbers of good players to field in every EPL teams is not many. To field six, they need atleast 10 Englishmen in the squad of 22. That's what Man U and Chelsea are buying them at a very high price which not many team can do, the only way is to train and develop youngster which I think the FA want.</div>

Where to find that much $$$?[/b][/quote]<br><br>enforcing teams to field 6 English players is like a double edged sword.. on one hand it might gives the locals a better chances of claiming a place in the league but on the other hand, is it what they deserved? will it lower the standard of the league in general? and why 6?<br><br>oh..and btw, investing heavily in academies is nothing compare to buying players.. its not the money outlay that makes clubs not will to invest so much on them..its more because even with investment the returns in term of having a player good enough to progress to the 1st team might not happen hence a easier and surest way is to just go out and buy a player worthy of the 1st team, which is what is happening to most of the teams that doesn't have a good blend of English players in their team.. bad choice.. but its the market demand that forced them to do so...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the whole point of having a football league is to:<br><br>a. provide entertainment<br>b. promote sports<br>c. provide opportunities for football players &amp; indirectly raise the overall football level of the community/country.<br><br>Look at Arsenal, they are not doing that.  It ridiculous to field an entire team of expatriates when playing in a domestic league.  If I am a fan, I feel cheated, imagine 60,000+ English fans paying huge money to watch a team of foreigners playing for a local club.  What contribution is Arsenal doing in terms of promoting sports / developing football talent?  They shld play a part and putting in a cap on the number of English players makes it a more level playing field and provide more opportunities for English players.<br><br>Nowhere in Europe do we see teams fielding an entire foreign players - not in Italy, not in Spain.  heck, even Barcalona and Real Madrid has local players on their first team.  What Arsenal (which, incidentially a club with long rich history in English football) is doing, is really not helping the greater things at all.  and they still have the cheek to fight (both off and on the sidelines).<br></div>
