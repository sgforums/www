A win is 3 points.<br><br>Even Chelsea strategy is to attack, attack and attack to get the 1st goal and then they lock you. They don't defend, defend and defend and then last 10 mins try to look for a goal. The 1st team to score has a much higher % to win the match!<br><br>Success is not == to Winning the league.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually there is no 1st or 2nd person. Only the 1st kicker. At the start,<br><br>1) A goal may be scored by shooting into the opponent goal;<br>2) the kicker cannot touch the ball a second time until it has touched another player.<br><br>But the 1st movement of the ball MUST move forward instead backward to your own half.<br><br>Suckthumb kiddo, go kick yourself lah! whahaha....<br><br>Stop making a fool of yourself!</div>
