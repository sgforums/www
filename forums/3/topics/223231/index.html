            <div class='col-md body'>this joker is just having a direct dig at Icefatboy with this thread... poor thing! a true no life man.. and a hopeless punter...ahahahaha and BTW, your quote of Kenny Dalglish is not strong enough to backup your claim of attacking football lor.. or was it that you just know abt him nia.. hence no others to quote...hahahahaha<br><br>now back to the topic... well, Kenny Dalglish did had quite a couple of success with Liverpool as their manager, even thou it was being widely regarded that that very team is so strong that they will be able to win anything put infront of them even without a manager...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>IMHO, attack is the best form of defends and i seriously think that teams should play more attacking football if they want more netural to suppport their club, however, in this modern era, plain attacking football is not going to get you anywhere, gone are the days of the proud Brazilan players where their thinking is as such that if the other team score 1 goal we will score 3 kinda thingy.. these days strong defends are a must and not just strong in the back 4 or 5 or 3 or whatever even strikers are make to put up the 1st line of defence once they lose possision of the ball.<br><br>oh and the best way to prove that defences is just as important as attack is just look at the famous Kelvin Keegan's Newcastle back in the 90s.. they are very very strong in attack but clueless in defences hence much as they win lots of fans they can't quite win the league..<br><br>also if you think that Dalglish's Blackburn is just abt attack then you're wrong... they does play with a very sound defences too..with players like Collien Henry, Henning Berg and Tim Flowers they can't be considered as lousy right??? neither can they be classified as attacking kingpin mah???<br><br>now..if only the smart alec can give me a couple of lopsided team which wins lots of sucess then maybe we'll talk football in this thread else its just his plain revenge on Icefatboy for starting this thread..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not really, good team have very good striker .But attack alone can win game but cannot win the league. To win the league you need strong defend cos your striker some days take off,meaning cannot score.</div>
