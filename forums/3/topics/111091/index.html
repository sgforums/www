            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>There are quite a few Muaythai, boxing and MMA places....but not all are genuine, so be careful.<br><br>The one I would recommend is BXG at Big Splash - a bit expensive, but with the best facilities and genuine.  Website is at <a href="http://www.bxgfitness.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bxgfitness.com</a>.<br><br>There are at least 5-6 other boxing-based places, but most are without gyms (just personal trainers with pads).  Many are fakes....just people who know a bit, talk big and out to earn some money from the public.<br><br>Just curious, why not Kadir's place (at Mountbatten)?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Joe, a 29-year-old martial arts fanatic, owns and runs the east coast one, called BXG.  <a href="http://www.bxgfitness.com" rel="nofollow">www.bxgfitness.com</a>.  This is the best one I can recommend.  Joe has had fighting experience in Thailand before.<br><br>A guy called Johnnie (54 years old) runs a muaythai group at Bukit Batok hill and Farrer Park (the ex-gym for the Singapore boxing team).  He has no official website.  Johnnie has had fighting experience in Thailand before and also trains in some Chinese Kungfu stuff.<br><br>A guy called Zach (just out from NS last year) runs free-lance classes at the East Cost area under personal training sessions.  He has had fighting experience in Thailand before, but under amatuer rules only.  He has no gym (means no sandbags, boxing ring, etc), but can train anywhere convenient for you (in your house, outdoors, etc).  He has no website.....and I lost his number (he was a friend with whom I lost touch since he went to NS).  <span style="color: red;">UPDATE 26 JAN 2005:</span>  By coincidence, I met Zach this evening and watched him train.  Wah, not bad.  He said he was in Thailand for 3 months.  I have his number now, if anyone is interested.  <span style="color: red;">UPDATE 3 FEB 2005</span>:  This information supercedes the outdated information I gave above:  Just found out that Zach has had professional-class fights in Thailand before (sorry, Zach!).  He also has access to a gym now.<br><br>A guy called Alvin (this one I don't know personally, sorry) runs free-lance classes outdoors.  He has no gym.  Alvin has also trained in Thailand before, I think. He has a website but I'm too lazy to find it.....try a google search.<br><br>A 44-year-old lady called Lana teaches muay thai at some community centre (do a google search).  She has no permanent gym and relies on using thai pads only.  I don't believe she's ever fought before, but surprisingly some of her students turned out not too bad!<br><br>A ya-ya guy (late 30's) called Thomas teaches muaythai at some hotel gym in Orchard Area.  This guy is a fake, but is very charismatic.  Even when we go for supper, he talks like a master to the prata guy....but its all fake.  Don't even bother looking for him.  <span style="color: red;">UPDATE 26 JAN 2005:</span>  This is the guy teaching at Revenue House (opposite Novena)...I think its on the 6th floor.<br><br>A guy called Colin, in his 40's (he knows nothing about muaythai - he's a businessman) used to run a school at east coast, then turf city, then now I heard he's moved to somewhere at the beach road side.  He has a website.  Do a google search for "first muaythai singapore".  The last time I met him was years ago and I don't get along with him very well.<br><br>Kadir's boxing gym (a western boxing gym at the Katong area) also has some muaythai sometimes.  Do a search using google.  Never been there, but I know someone who trains there.<br><br>A guy (late 20's) called Darren DeSilva runs a muaythai/MMA school in the town area on certain nights only.  He rents a gym for training on 1-2 nights a week, I think.  The last time I met this guy was before he even started running a school....so I don't know how he's doing now.  Once again, try doing a search on google.<br><br>Um....there must be a few more places, but its lunch time now, sorry! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I highly agree that the muay thai lesson at bxg have not only the best facilities,they also have a very very experience thai trainer teaching in the advance class. Once u reach the intermediate stage, there will be lots and lots of sparring. You get to spar with different people (japan,austalia,france,sweden...etc) ...boy...those ang mohs are real hard hitters!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">! I learn a lot from them too.....<br>!!So for those who are interested in sparring and learning muay thai techniques....this is a good place to train...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>though i have never been to the hilltop training(johnnie), heard that this fellow is one hardcore trainer..... His training is more on pyhsical aspect than techniques......and johnnie is damn fit even though he is in his 50s...<br><br>bacaraat</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>true....u dont need good training facilities to be a better fighter......just need the basic equipment.... however, wouldnt it be much better if they have well equip facilities, good coaches and trainers and with a good enviroment u can actually be better trained?<br><br>no doubt i am trying to promote bxg( i dont earn from it), but a training place with 10 sandbags, all round mirror, 5 sets of pads, 10 pairs of boxing gloves, skipping ropes, free weights and most important a boxing ring. I dont think there is any other muay thai or boxing club with this kind of facilities.<br><br>Oh yes....bxg does have some pretty ladies member.....some of them can really kick asses!!<br><br>no doubt the price is a little steep, especially for students....but Joe is working out on the price for students to be cheaper.....cos some of my students wanted to join as well but was put of by the price......<br><br>www.bxgfitness.com</div>

I have his number now, if anyone is interested.<br><br>A guy called Alvin (this one I don't know personally, sorry) runs free-lance classes outdoors.  He has no gym.  Alvin has also trained in Thailand before, I think. He has a website but I'm too lazy to find it.....try a google search.<br><br>A 44-year-old lady called Lana teaches muay thai at some community centre (do a google search).  She has no permanent gym and relies on using thai pads only.  I don't believe she's ever fought before, but surprisingly some of her students turned out not too bad!<br><br>A ya-ya guy (late 30's) called Thomas teaches muaythai at some hotel gym in Orchard Area.  This guy is a fake, but is very charismatic.  Even when we go for supper, he talks like a master to the prata guy....but its all fake.  Don't even bother looking for him.  <span style="color: red;">UPDATE 26 JAN 2005:</span>  This is the guy teaching at Revenue House (opposite Novena)...I think its on the 6th floor.<br><br>A guy called Colin, in his 40's (he knows nothing about muaythai - he's a businessman) used to run a school at east coast, then turf city, then now I heard he's moved to somewhere at the beach road side.  He has a website.  Do a google search for "first muaythai singapore".  The last time I met him was years ago and I don't get along with him very well.<br><br>Kadir's boxing gym (a western boxing gym at the Katong area) also has some muaythai sometimes.  Do a search using google.  Never been there, but I know someone who trains there.<br><br>A guy (late 20's) called Darren DeSilva runs a muaythai/MMA school in the town area on certain nights only.  He rents a gym for training on 1-2 nights a week, I think.  The last time I met this guy was before he even started running a school....so I don't know how he's doing now.  Once again, try doing a search on google.<br><br>Um....there must be a few more places, but its lunch time now, sorry! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div></blockquote>Well, you seem you have done your home work.<br>Every trainer in Singapore has their own unique way of training students. Lana got fighting experience or not does'nt matter ,some of her boys fought really well,. tats true.It up to her students to believe in her.Some ppl are born to teach, so are born to learn.As long as you n your trainers understand n believe in one another . A good fighter will be born.A good fighter may not necessary be a good trainer.N a good trainer may not be a good fighter.<br>Even for thomas he got his own group of boys.you said he's a fake but are you fit enought to criticises others?? or made comparisim ??.

Royce lured Akebono into his guard by practically falling down. Once on the ground, Royce scooted to the side and tried for a variation of the americana. That failed so he transitioned to a reverse armbar + a goose hold on Akebono's Wrist. Official result is that Akebono tapped out to the wrist crank.<br><br>Royce is great but imo, he took a very risky strategy. Imagine if Akebono managed to keep his posture and started to drop bombs!<br></div>
