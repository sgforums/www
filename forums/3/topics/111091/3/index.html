I posted at 1:32am and you replied back at 2:51am. I'm pretty sure you didn't verify any of your info that "you think" or "you heard" with Master Johnnie, Alvin or Lana. You were the first one on this message thread to tell people not to make irresponsible comments and criticisms:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by TheGreatest:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, you seem you have done your home work.<br>Every trainer in Singapore has their own unique way of training students. Lana got fighting experience or not does'nt matter ,some of her boys fought really well,. tats true.It up to her students to believe in her.Some ppl are born to teach, so are born to learn.As long as you n your trainers understand n believe in one another . A good fighter will be born.A good fighter may not necessary be a good trainer.N a good trainer may not be a good fighter.<br>Even for thomas he got his own group of boys.you said he's a fake but are you fit enought to criticises others?? or made comparisim ??. I think you a just a carb only know how to said n no action.<br></div></blockquote>So perhaps it would be good if you could listen to your own advice and do your own "home work" as you put it.<br><br>Secondly, I did not compare Darren's gym with Vos gym. I compared training approach because you seem to think that traditional training is the only way to go. 50 years ago policeman wear shorts doesn't mean today he still have to wear shorts.<br><br>Thirdly, just because you can't further your training, doesn't mean other people can't. If you want to let yourself become trapped and let your dreams die, don't project your failures onto others. People have dreams and people do achieve them - all those Singaporeans who trained and went to fight in Thailand, even Darren's fighter who you said lost in Indonesia. At least they tried to live their dreams. They don't sit behind a computer, criticise others and say that this and that is not possible.<br></div>

Weren't you the one who said that fighting experience was not important, blah blah blah....so why are you talking about fighting experience now...etc?<br><br>And weren't you the one who told me that we should not criticise others?  And now, what have you just done to Darren?  I can justify my criticisms of Thomas.....can you justify yours of Darren?<br><br>You said:  <strong>I can only said " eyes is a better tools than ears'' </strong>.  Yes, but why did you rely so much on your ears, hearing this, hearing that, etc?  See what you wrote yourself: <strong>i heard he was giving excuses to avoid sparring with the thais during their visit in singapore.</strong>  So you HEARD huh?<br><br>You said: <strong>We can only progress till a certain standard n you'll reach a stop point. cos of school,ns, work, girlfriend, married #%*$ like tat.</strong>  You mean foreigners don't go to school, work, get married, etc?  Have you trained with foreigners overseas before?  I have...and so have many others....and we know for sure that foreigners are humans as well and have their own lives as well.<br><br>By the way, you also said that most of the trainers suck at English.  You seem to think that you're qualified to make fun or other people's English?<br><br>This started off as a nice thread for those interested in muaythai to discuss it.  We shared our opinions without putting down others, tried to provide sincere information, etc....which should be the way its supposed to be.  If you have nothing intelligent or useful to contribute, then please just don't contribute at all.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Samadi_fire,<br><br>Its interesting that you've trained in Thailand before....seems to be a growing trend now among Singaporeans.<br><br>I have too, on and off for the past 15+ years (I used to travel to Bangkok quite often)....I had no other choice at that time because there was no muaythai in Singapore yet.  Which gym did you train at?  I trained at Jitti's and Sor Vorapin's (which used to be related to each other).  I also sometimes trained with a personal friend.  In fact, I have already gone twice this year.<br><br>But I'm just a hobbyist... "tourist training" type.  hahaha.  I never went for the morning sessions because waking up at 6 am is already hard enough for me.  Waking up at 6 am to run long distance is impossible for me.  hahahaha.<br><br>At my gym, there were some international fighters too.  There was this NZ guy who was a K-1 2003 finalist.  He lost in the end, but the way he pushed himself was amazing.  Even after all of us (including some Japanese competition fighters) gave up, he was still pushing on and on...and I could see that he was already too tired to stand straight and wanted to vomit....but he just didn't care and pushed on and on.  He had a day job in Bangkok too, teaching English (what else? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">).  Oh, he never came for the morning training too.<br><br>And of course there were the Thais who could always smile and joke, no matter how tired they were.<br><br>Hey, tell me about your gym please.  PM if you want privacy.<br><br></div>

Because the adversary in real life situation are normally guys.  If you can handle a guy, chances are that you can handle a girl (not always, but chances are).<br><br>(2) If you are still very conservative and only want to train with ladies, then it doesn't matter if the instructor is a male or female.  The instructor doesn't always have very much contact with you anyway.  Its the fellow trainees which have to be female.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gentlerock,<br><br>Fwah... 15+ years. That's a damn long time that you've been doing Muay Thai man. Can become Sifu liao... Haha. Hmm... So you're training at Hilltop now or do you have your own classes?<br><br>For myself, I didn't train in Bangkok. I was up in Ubon last december. That's somewhere near the Laos border. Was deciding between the gym I went to and two gyms in Bangkok, one of which was Sor Vorapin.<br><br>I ended up at KRS Gym. You can read up a little about it at <a href="http://www.chokemuay.com/KRSgym.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chokemuay.com/KRSgym.htm</a>. It's a nice small gym - haha really small man. About 4 bags, a ring and a small open area but the people there were great. Ubon was also very fun. It's kinda like a much smaller scale of Bangkok minus the constant traffic jams and pollution. Plus, the people there are nice - they're not trying to con you all the time.<br><br>Haha I didn't manage to make it for the morning trainings at first but there was this Swiss guy who kept trying to drag me down in the mornings. After awhile, it got very irritating so I just went for the morning trainings. Haha train then sleep then wake up, go for afternoon training. But then, there was this lake there that we ran around in the morning so it was kinda nice running in the morning. After that, I developed a liking for running so in the end, it was good.<br><br>In Ubon, there were very little foreigners. After awhile, you'll know most of them. At my gym, there were quite a number of Japanese fighters. All very funny and damn psycho. Once they get drunk - anything also can do. Sometimes, you check your email, their manager will send you naked pictures of them from last night's party. Manager say strip means strip. Haha. As for the rest of the foreigners, mostly europeans and one or two australians. Haha europeans are quite wierd sometimes but the aussies are great. Like I said, very little foreigners so it's easy to make friends with the ones that are there. Most of the people at my gym were fighters. I didn't fight though... Maybe the next time when I go up. See how it goes.<br><br>But it was quite interesting. When I was there, twice we travelled to the neighbouring towns cause some of our fighters were fighting. Sit behind the pickup truck and endure the cold for 2 - 4 hours. And the places where they fought were like those carnival fairs that you see in Beautiful Boxer. Quite interesting.<br><br>Thinking of going back up to Ubon maybe in July. Don't think I'd want to train in Bangkok. When I was in transit from Ubon to Singapore in Bangkok, I was damn pissed. Getting stuck in traffic jams all the time and dealing with all the people trying to cheat your money. In Ubon, the jeans start at 200Baht and you bargain down. In Bangkok, they start at 1000Baht. Plus, when I went - the weather up in Ubon was great. Very cooling.<br><br>Anyway, this time around, I'll probably going to my friend's new gym. He left KRS and opened up a new gym with his wife. He married a Thai girl. Yah, sponsored by Superleague gym some more - it's the official superleague gym so they'll be sending their upcoming fighters there to train. If you're interested, let me know. He's a very nice guy. His website is at <a href="http://www.all4glory.com" rel="nofollow">www.all4glory.com</a>.<br><br>Yup, that's about. As for the training regime - standard Thai training I guess.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Samadhi_fire,<br><br>I suspect you might have misread my post.  I wrote 15+ years <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on and off</span>.  If you accumulated all the serious training I've done for the past 15+ years, it adds up to about....er.....one week? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  It means I'm still a novice lah.<br><br>I've always loved to travel and thats what I did during my schooldays (just after NS).  If you add this to 15+ years, you'll know my rough age now....and you'll easily realise that I'm way overaged too.<br><br>Bangkok was the furthest I could go, without needing visas or air-tickets (which were extremely expensive back then).  So being a cheapo, I always ended up at the backpacker's joint in Bangkok, Kaosarn Road....and always stayed at PB Guest House, owned by a guy called Mr. Lu.  His Thai name is Surapon or something like that.  We got along well because of lingo association (we're both Teochews).  He owns S.Vorapin (then called Jitti's) and one day, he asked me to try training.<br><br>Well, I did.  Having had years of TKD and some other martial arts experiences, I thought nothing of it.  But heck, I was so wrong.  On the very first day at the gym, there was this skinny 16-year-old S.Vorapin figher who sparred with me (just a light, friendly, playful one).  Throughout the whole session, he hit me around like roti prata....and I only managed to hit him....well, just once.  And that was an accidental kick too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">.  Since then, I knew that muaythai was for me.<br><br>I got a bit addicted to it and kept going back.  My visit frequency increased tremendously when I started dating a Japanese girl at the gym <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.  Good incentive to train.  Unfortunately she decided later that she wanted someone more permanent and married a Thai (boxer too), moved back to Japan and now had 3 kids already.  We're still in touch, as friends.  So now, you know how serious I was at training muaythai....hahaha...<br><br>I still go back once in a while now....I was at S.Vorapin's just last week and met Mr. Lu and his son Peeraphan again.  His son is a very gentle guy and quite a salesman.  His trainers are also a bit joker conmen type.  They always try to con me to buy them drinks, etc....and in return, sometimes they would offer to smuggle me into the stadium on fight nights (as part of the gym's entourage).  Thats free ringside seats, worth 1000 baht!<br><br>I like training at S.Vorapin because of the atmosphere there.  There are all nationalities, lots of serious fighters and lots of people like myself who go there to shake-shake and make friends only <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.  People are relaxed, easy-going....but of course the are a few stuck-up ones too (especially the Jap and angmoh serious fighters, who were just interested in serious training and not socialising).  Other than that, the rest of us got along just fine, including the Thais.  Well, at least there was no sicko talk-big macho sh<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>it who went around criticising others, like we have here (you know who I mean - you've just had a run-in with him too right here in this forum <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">).<br><br>I've never fought competitively too and never intended too (remember, my main incentive was dating that girl lah).  Sparring, of course was part and parcel of it and thats as far as I'd go.....although I'm always the one who gets whacked.  I've gotten whacked by Thais, angmohs, Jap guys, Jap girls, a French girl, Singaporeans (eg. Joe of BXG, Johnnie of Hilltop, etc.).  You just name any person in this world and they've probably whacked me before <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">.  Geee...did you say that I can be sifu?  hahahaha....<br><br>Er.....I need to insert here that the French girl cheated.  She told me that she only had karate experience.  It was at S.Vorapin and she asked to spar (hands only, no legs).  I said OK.  She said slowly and lightly only.  I said OK.  So we started relaxed for about a minute....then suddenly and unexpectedly, she came in with a flurry of full-strength, full-contact hooks, which skillfully went around my guard and hit my jaw, cheeks and ears.  Basket!!  My face felt really blur already and if she had continued, I would've been KO-ed.  Later, I found out that she was a semi-professional boxer (Queensbury rules) back home.  Double basket!!  But nevermind lah, because she bought me pizza later.  Yep, I'm a cheap guy....I'll get whacked by girls for a free dinner with them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Besides S.Vorapin, I also train occasionally with a friend in Bangkok.  He's 23 years old and an ex-fighter.  As usual, a typical Thai - very gentle and humble.  But he's a monster.....he could go on the pads for 50+ minutes and still smile, joke and talk normally with you.  I think maybe he's not human.<br><br>When First Muaythai opened in Singapore, I joined their gym to use the facilities (never took any classes there).  It was there that I got to know Johnnie, Zach, Darren, Thomas, etc.  (I never really knew Darren...we just said "hi" to each other during that time).  And soon after, I trained with Johnnie for about two years (it was convenient for me because I worked in that area).  About 4-5 years ago, I changed jobs and stopped training at Hilltop too.  Nowadays, I train with a friend, or use BXG's facilities (I didn't sign up for classes - no money), or train by myself at any gym with a bag to hit (eg. Planet Fitness Suntec, etc.).  Muaythai is just a hobby and a form of exercise to me lah.....it was never my ambition to be a top expert in it.<br><br>Hey, thanks for the info about Thai camps.  The reason I asked was to see if I could try a different camp next time....but I'm looking for something in Bangkok area (convenience for my work).<br><br>I have a friend's husband who just returned from 2 weeks at Lanna (in Chiang Mai).  He seemed to have enjoyed his training there.<br><br>Hey, we Singaporeans can learn to relax a bit.  In a Bangkok traffic jam, just close your eyes and fill your mind with the cheap and wonderful buffets, shopping and massages coming later.....and everything will be fine. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I'd go through those jams a thousand times for the said pleasures of life!<br><br>In Bangkok, if you go to MBK Centre, Future Park (Rangsit), Victory Monument, etc....you can find jeans for 300+ baht.  You'll have to look for the shops at the obscure corners though...and they're all locally made jeans, but they're nice and comfortable.  I've got a few pairs myself.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by watermyforest:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi gentlerock, does Planet Fitness Suntec really has some sandbags?</div></blockquote>Hi,<br><br>All three Planet Fitness gyms (Suntec, Great World City, Far East Square) have a heavy bag each (or else I won't join, because thats the only equipment I use there).  I believe other bigger gyms (eg. California Fitness) may have bags too....not sure about this.<br><br>There is a fourth Planet Fitness gym coming up at Caltex House, but I'm not sure if there is a bag there.<br><br>Last year, the bag  broke 3-4 times and it took some time to hang it up again (I was quite pissed).  Once, it broke because of old age.  Twice, it broke because some big-sized angmoh elbowed it too hard (the chain was too short and the bag didn't have enough space to swing away).  Once, it broke because a friend of mine was pulling on it, practicing his knee strikes.<br><br>Finally, we suggested to the gym to extend the length of the chain on which the bag hangs....and now everything is fine (this was partly why when someone asked in the ChitChat column about hanging bags in HDB flat, I advised against it).<br><br>Er....I don't know how experienced you are, but if you are, then you'll realise that the bag just provides a small portion of the full training you'll need.  Its always better to have a sparring partner, or someone who can hold the pads for you.<br><br>Anyway, if you see someone whacking away at the Planet Fitness Suntec bag like a mad dog....its probably me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  (I joined Planet Fitness because I get a special price for it.....and its cheaper than joining a Muaythai gym for me.  But I still do train with friends and I still do hold memberships at some muaythai gyms - they complement each other.  Also, if we always use just one place....after a while, very sian lah!).<br><br>Oh, and Planet Fitness girls are nicer than the muaythai gym girls too.<br><br></div>
