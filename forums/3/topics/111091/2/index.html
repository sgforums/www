If you have done any ground fighting before (and i'm not saying you haven't) you will know that being pinned under a person that outweighs you by even just 20kg is incredibly uncomfortable. If Akebono mounted me or got good side control on me, i believe i would just tap out from the pressure on my chest and ribs.<br><br>Imo, these type of matches are good for the sport because they are entertaining. Most ppl would find MMA matches boring because they do not understand the sport. Such matches at least get ppl watching and with time, those ppl may start to understand what its all about.<br><br>Also, love or hate the gracies, i do not think anyone can doubt their skill and ability.<br><br>Sigh - i have no satellite and thus was unable to catch UFC 51. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Royce Gracie fought Yoshida twice before this match and against Sakuraba in the Pride GP so he wasn't really coming out of retirement. Out of those matches he lost against Sakuraba, he got screwed by the ref against Yoshida and thus lost and he won the rematch even thought it was declared a draw. He only fights when the rules and money suit him which is why he doesn't fight in the UFC anymore.<br><br>If other fighters can adapt their style according to the rules then I don't see why Royce cannot. It shows a total lack of respect for the organisation and other fighters in my opinion. Also if other Gracie members can abide by the same rules as other fighters, I don't understand why Royce can't. One reason could be that where as other Gracies cross train to a decent level Royce has yet to catch up and obviously realises that he is at a disadvantage.<br><br>I didn't want to watch the Gracie vs Akebono fight simply because I knew that Royce would win. Period. Akenbono has yet to win a K-1 or mma rules fight and I doubt that he has of yet acquired any decent striking skill or ground skill apart from sit on top of the opponent and ground and pound the poor guy on the floor.  But firstly that can only happen if Akebono has the skill to get into the mount position on Royce which I doubt no matter what his weight is.<br><br>Well the match played out like this:<br>Akebono charged towards Royce and Royce fell back so that Akebono fell into his guard which was perfect for royce as he's in his element on the ground. Akebono didn't know what to do and eventually royce slapped on an am triangle for the win.<br><br>I may not like the Gracies but I still appreciate and respect their skill and what they have done for MMA.</div>

Don't even bother looking for him.  <span style="color: red;">UPDATE 26 JAN 2005:</span>  This is the guy teaching at Revenue House (opposite Novena)...I think its on the 6th floor.<br><br>A guy called Colin, in his 40's (he knows nothing about muaythai - he's a businessman) used to run a school at east coast, then turf city, then now I heard he's moved to somewhere at the beach road side.  He has a website.  Do a google search for "first muaythai singapore".  The last time I met him was years ago and I don't get along with him very well.<br><br>Kadir's boxing gym (a western boxing gym at the Katong area) also has some muaythai sometimes.  Do a search using google.  Never been there, but I know someone who trains there.<br><br>A guy (late 20's) called Darren DeSilva runs a muaythai/MMA school in the town area on certain nights only.  He rents a gym for training on 1-2 nights a week, I think.  The last time I met this guy was before he even started running a school....so I don't know how he's doing now.  Once again, try doing a search on google.<br><br>Um....there must be a few more places, but its lunch time now, sorry! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div></blockquote>Lana and Alvin are both Darren's former students.<br><br>Also, Darren (now in his early 30s =) ) has his gym in the town area - beside Clarkey Quay MRT Station. It's a full-time academy and there're lessons there every night. Fight experience - tons of it. One of his fighters was fighitng in TPI in Indonesia as well. I'm a student there and I highly recommend it.<br><br>Oh yah, at Darren's academy, there're now lessons there in Muay Thai, Submission Grappling, MMA, Kali/Escrima, Tomiki Aikido and Kyokushin Karate.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi TheGreatest,<br><br>Yup, Darren was chief instructor at Muay Thai Fitness before he left... and Lana was one of his instructors. Alvin also began his Muay Thai career at Muay Thai Fitness. You said "dont think [Lana] train with darren before." Why don't you ask both Lana and Alvin before coming to a conclusion since you seem to know them well? I am sure they'll have good things to say about Darren.<br><br>As for what you "heard" about him giving excuses to avoid sparring with the thais, that's probably just a certain Mr C**** spreading malicious rumours. The visiting Thais were brought down to teach the instructors at Muay Thai Fitness traditional Muay Thai training. The same Mr C*** is involved in whatever "VCDs incident" that you heard about. He left Muay Thai Fitness because he did not see eye to eye with the same Mr C*** on bad terms so you can put one and one together.<br><br>I think you're referring to one of Darren's fighters fighting in TPI FC in Indonesia, not Darren. As for that match, Bruce broke his opponent's nose but slipped and fell to the ground in the process. Opponent tries to mount him and tries to start raining punches down. Referee thinks that Bruce was KOed and stops match but Bruce was not KOed. Referee then asks Bruce if he wants to continue, Bruce says yes. Referee asks opponent if he wants to continue, opponent says no because of his broken nose. Opponent is declared winner. Ah well... that's Indonesia. Opponent was also subsequently ranked No. 1 in TPI.<br><br>It's true - Darren does not teach traditional Muay Thai. So what? He has incorporated very good training methods and his training is comparable to the good Muay Thai schools in Thailand in terms of intensity and techniques. If the Thais want to remain "traditional" then let them but the rest of the world and the Japs and the Dutch esp (Meijiro Gym, Vos Gym) have evolved their Muay Thai training methods so why should we be left behind?<br><br>I have trained in Thailand before as well. I was training with the current IKF European Middleweight Champion who also competes in the Superleague and also with the All-Japan Kickboxing Federation number 4 ranked fighter in his weight division (can't remember what). Both of them are my good friends. So I believe that I am in a position to compare the training methods in Thailand with Darren's. And to this, I say that the training approach is indeed different but both are very good.<br><br>As for Darren's relationship with Master Johnny, I have been told that it is a good one. Darren has nothing but respect and admiration for Master Johnny whom he holds as one of the most humble and respectable Masters around. Before commenting on their relationship, why don't you clarify with Master Johnny first? It seems that you train at Hilltop so before you make such comments, at least check with Master Johnny first.<br><br>Yup, hope this clears things out a little. I have been training with Darren since 2002 and I must say that he is a good teacher and a good person.<br><br>Cheers.<br></div>

At least others have fighting and teaching experience. And you? Just hiding behind your computer talking big. I think you won't stand a round of sparring with Darren or his fighters.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like you have done your homework with darren yesterday.I can only said " eyes is a better tools than ears''<br>Are you out of your mind?? you're comparing Vos Gym to Darren's?? It one of the biggest F***ing gym in holland. Enesto Hoost was from there. Holland is the top european country tat produce alot of world class fighters. So i dont think you're quailified to compare n give comments since you only trained for 3 years.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  n you didnt even mention your fighting exp.<br>Listen , we should know our limits ,as a singaporean training time is very limited. We can only progress till a certain standard n you'll reach a stop point. cos of school,ns, work, girlfriend, married shit like tat. We cant compare wif other countries . No way.We can chit chat about the latest Pride championship during class n it really sound inpressive infront of a newbie cos he may thinks you know alot. Especially you mentioned you trained with certain champion in certain gym.<br>Well the fact is ,you need to used the training methods you learned n try it out with the rest of the world .n Train hard cos fighting has nothing to do with luck.</div>
