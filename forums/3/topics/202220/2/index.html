            <div class='col-md body'>"Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur can confirm that they have agreed terms for the transfer of the registration of Michael Carrick conditional upon the player agreeing personal terms with Manchester United," read an official statement from United.<br><br>Red Devils boss Sir Alex Ferguson has been a firm admirer of the England midfielder for some time and has been trying to bring him to Old Trafford all summer.<br><br>A bid of around Â£10 million was rejected before the World Cup as Spurs coach Martin Jol looked to build his side around Carrick.<br><br>However, Ferguson's persistence has finally paid off, Carrick is now set to complete his protracted move to Old Trafford just as soon as he undergoes a medical and agrees personal terms.<br><br>Jol has admitted that he was reluctant to let Carrick leave, but did not want to stand in the way of a lifelong dream. "This is a move that Michael wants to make," he explained. "We have given him every reason to stay, but he has asked to be allowed to leave."<br><br>United insist the fee for the 25-year-old Geordie is nowhere near Â£17m. And Fergie hopes Carrick will be involved at the Amsterdam tournament which starts Friday.<br><br>But the United chief will NOT be making a second raid on Spurs for striker Jermain Defoe.<br><br>He added: Â“There has not been any interest from us in Defoe. Carrick is the only Tottenham player we are interested in at the moment and I think it will stay that way.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that Carrick is overpriced. I rate him at the cost of $7 millon the most. I think what Man utd needs is a change of management. SAF needs to go , the more he upsets essential players , the more they will leave. Already letting go of RVN for only 11 million and getting a replacement of his calibre is hard. Well all I can say is good luck Man utd.</div>

Nothing wrong rite? If you thought I was referring to you then sorry lah, can?<br><br>Since you say you understand English players do cost more but you just dun know why. So i just explain to you only what, the teams in the EPL represent english football, they also represent England, so it is important to have English base players. It represents not just your estate team, but also your country.<br><br>If Chelsea or Arsenal wins the CL, people in England will feel more proud with a Chelsea win cos they have a few English born players in their team, something they can relate to but in Arsenal's case, probably their supporters and a few others only as ordinary Englishmen wonÂ’t be too proud that a team without any fellow countrymen won it.<br><br>This is not something only special to England, even in Singapore, The passed few years the Singapore football team when to play with 2 to 3 so call new citizen players in the team and people were not happy already calling them foreign talent. They were not happy to see Australians, Africans or an Englishman playing in our team and they even make fun of it like even if they had won, itÂ’s not a win for Singapore football.<br><br>Yes, clubs exist to win honours, but it is also important to maintain heritage and traditions as much as it is possible. Cos fans feel passionate of such thingsÂ…<br>Nobody is asking for all 11 to be home grown players but at least a few will help, like 3 or 4. You ask yourself would you be proud if our Singapore team was made up of Australians, Africans and other foreigners? Obvious not rightÂ… you will probably be a shame of the team knowing they didnÂ’t grow up or develop their talent in this country in the first place and should they win anything, others will always make jokes about it too. Like we donÂ’t even have our own talent must get foreigners to do the job for us.<br><br>As to theo, I think you have mistaken what I saidÂ… if you go see it again you will know. I didnÂ’t say he costs 2.5X more than carrick, I said he cost 2 Â½  more than his actual value and Carrick 1 Â½ more than his actual value.<br><br>And on the why Chelsea paid $12m for establish Robben and willing to pay $21m for new boy SWP, ThatÂ’s the point I am trying to say, Chelsea has a shrewd CEO and manager who knows how to run the club and they are certainly no idiots to such deals, they might probably have weight the pros &amp; cons to pay such huge amount for a player and the importants of having english base players in their teamÂ… They are trying not just to build a football team but a football club so having home base players will attract fans to their club and in the long run, your fans base will grow bigger that is why they are also willing to spend $25m on A cole tells you their emphasis on home base players.<br><br>Btw, I have read a number of your post before and you seem like a nice guy so hope no hard feeling ahÂ… cos I never take it too serious here, just exchange of opinions thatÂ’s all. Anyway, thanks for your word correction I seem to have forgotten it, I will also return one to you. I think there is no such word as verbageÂ… if my dictionary serve me correctly.<br></div>
