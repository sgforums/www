He is very strong and he looks very sharp.<br><br>"He is great in the air and very strong in defensive actions. He is at the top of his game. Now it is just a question of him staying there for a long time.<br><br>"At the moment I don't think there is anybody better in the world scoring or playing like him.<br><br>"He is scoring in every competition - the Premiership, the Champions League, the Carling Cup. He is playing amazing stuff.<br><br>"His improvement has been at every level. I don't like to use the word unstoppable but he is great in every aspect of his game. He attacks the ball, he dominates in the air, he holds the ball well, he is at the top of his game. I never saw a better Drogba than now."<br><br>While Drogba took the individual honours, Chelsea swept Watford aside thanks to a midfield trio that gets more accomplished with every game.<br><br>Claude Makelele, Frank Lampard and Michael Ballack were always in control as Watford struggled to cope with a Chelsea side that never reached top gear all afternoon.<br><br>Mourinho added: "At the moment with the way our midfield is playing, it is easy to be a striker.<br><br>"Our midfield is playing fantastic. Watford play direct football but they know what they are doing on the pitch.<br><br>"If you don't defend well then you are in trouble but we did very well in that aspect.<br><br>"We scored four goals and it was quite a good game. We played very consistent and collectively it was a good performance. It was also a positive performance individually. I am happy with the points and the performance."<br><br>Watford boss Adrian Boothroyd was the second manager in four days to visit Stamford Bridge and accept his side were well beaten.<br><br>Watford never had any firepower to trouble the champions and Boothroyd offered no excuses.<br><br>He said: "We were not unlucky. They were far better than us on the day and we got what we deserved.<br><br>"I thought we gave them some problems for the first half-hour. They were panicking a bit but they are machine and ground out a result.<br><br>"They had a purple patch in the second half and are an exceptional team and were terrific."<br><br>Boothroyd also singled out Drogba as the "epitome of a modern-day professional" after the Blues striker had ruined his day.<br><br>He added: "He epitomises what a professional should be. He's quick and got everything a top player should have.<br><br>"But what makes him a true professional in my opinion is that he was chasing down the back four in the 93rd minute. That's all you can ask, that they give their all and he does that."</span></div>
