            <div class='col-md body'>China in group with Iraq, Singapore and Palestine<br>(AFP)<br>Updated: 2006-01-05 09:23<br><br>SINGAPORE (AFP) - China were pitted with Palestine, Iraq and Singapore in the qualifying draw of 2007 Asian Cup.<br><br>The Asia's top tournament will be co-hosted by four Southeast Asian countries - Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, while China should have no problem progressing against minnows Palestine but Iraq and fast-improving Singapore could cause them a headache.<br><br>asian cup, china Defending champions Japan avoided South Korea and arch-rivals China on Wednesday, whom Japan beat 3-1 in a bad-tempered final in Beijing in 2004.<br><br>Also in Japan's group are India and Yemen, with the top two going through to the finals from July 9-27, 2007, which will be co-hosted by Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.<br><br>The co-hosting is a decision the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) now regrets.<br><br>"It is proving very difficult for us. We have to have four organising committees, four media centres and there are also financial considerations," AFC president Mohammed Bin Hammam told AFP.<br><br>"It was my mistake. If we had a choice we definitely wouldn't do it again."<br><br>Japan and Saudi Arabia have both won the Asian Cup three times. The two met in the final in 2000, with Japan emerging victorious 1-0.<br><br>"We will field our first team for all the matches," said Kohzo Tashima, technical director of the Japan national team. "The group is not that easy and we have to make our qualification doubly sure."<br><br>Twenty-four Asian teams went into the hat for the draw with the qualifying games to be played on February 22, March 1, August 16, September 6, October 11 and November 15.<br><br>South Korea, led by Dick Advocaat, will take on Asia's number two team Iran in Group B. Both sides will also be in Germany at the World Cup this year. Taiwan and Syria round out their group.<br><br>China in group with Iraq, Singapore and Palestine<br>(AFP)<br>Updated: 2006-01-05 09:23<br><br>"I am satisfied with the draw. We will have no major difficulties to advance to the next round," said Song Ki-Ryong, a spokesman for the Korea Football Association.<br><br>Guus Hiddink's Australia, which will be competing in an Asian Cup for the first time after offically joining the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) this month, will have a tough time against Bahrain, Lebanon and Kuwait.<br><br>It means the Australians face three long journeys to the Middle East where they will have little support. Kuwait are always difficult to beat at home while Bahrain shocked everyone by making the semi-finals in China.<br><br>Lebanon, meanwhile, have a sizable expatriate population in Australia for support.<br><br>On the flip side, the shorter travelling distance from Europe could encourage Australia's European-based stars like Harry Kewell, Mark Viduka and Tim Cahill to made the trip.<br><br>AFC president Mohammed Bin Hammam said there was no excuse for them not to play.<br><br>"It is easy for them to travel," he said. "Australia are lucky because all their games in the Middle East are only five hours or so from Europe."<br><br>But Gary Moretti, a Football Australia official, said it was not that easy, pointing out that February 22 was not a FIFA match day -- meaning clubs are not duty-bound to release players.<br><br>"The challenge for us will be to see what sort of squad we are able to assemble for these games because it won't be easy to get a full-strength team out every time," he said.<br><br>Bin Hammam said he expected all the top teams to progress, and was relieved that the possibility of three leading teams being drawn in the same group didn't happen.<br><br>"It could have been a worse scenario, where one of the top teams faced elimination, but now I think all the top teams will go through," he said.<br><br>"From our point of view, the commercial side of things is going well. The TV is fixed up and all we need now is for the fans to fill the stadiums," he said.<br><br>Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Jordan will fight for honours in Group C while Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Qatar and Uzbekistan are pitted in Group F.<br><br>The Asian Cup was first played in 1956.</div>

You think their soccer really good? Full of corruptions, selfish players, and etc. China soccer is only good at talking. You think they really can qualify for World Cup? ThatÂ’s only because Japan and Korea hosting, if not, do you think they can really make it?<br><br>Their players also, no discipline, whack A$$ League referee, escape training, and etc. Really shame on them. Mama never taught them to be a good boy meh?<br><br>This zaobao also, pro-China, every time JiHai playing, the paper will come out like, Â“JiHai played 90 minutes!!!!Â” but at the end lose, Â“JiHai got chance to play tonightÂ” but just a sub who did badly, Â“JiHai offered new contractÂ” but in fact only a cheap cheap one. Everyday, if JiHai any fuk, zaobao online will make it as a BIG news, fuk la.<br><br>Then in China league, only corruption can survive. All the investors and sponsors are treated like BIG FISH. The FA, players, and all soccer related fukers will suck their blood until dry. China for soccer?
