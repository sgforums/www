            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger sees no reason why his chargers cannot compete for this season's Premiership title.<br><br>Many believe the North Londoners are already out of the title race having slipped 12 points behind leaders Manchester United - although they have a game in hand.<br><br>The Gunners are the only side to have inflicted defeat on Sir Alex Ferguson's side this term and Wenger retains the belief they can catch the leading duo.<br><br>"We can still win the championship. Look at the numbers, we have the potential to do it," insisted Wenger.<br><br>"Either Manchester United or Chelsea could have dropped a few points at the start and that is what happened to us.<br><br>"We have lost twice, Chelsea twice and Manchester United once - but the difference is the points we dropped at home."<br><br>Meanwhile, Wenger has confirmed Arsenal will not be splashing the cash with the transfer window re-opens in January.<br><br>The French tactician has confirmed his admiration for Watford's exciting winger Ashley Young, but they will not be getting out the chequebook.<br><br>"I like Young because he is mobile and has good movement, a high work-rate and is a creative player," he continued.<br><br>"He is an interesting boy - but we will not buy anybody in January. At the moment we have enough players.<br><br>"If you look at the number of players we have on loan - like [Nicklas] Bendtner and [Arturo] Lupoli - we are not going out on the market at all."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Arsene Wenger admitted his side had fallen too far behind the Premiership leaders following Arsenal's 3-1 defeat at Bolton.<br><br>Former Arsenal striker Nicolas Anelka scored twice to inspire Bolton to victory and leave The Gunners nine points behind Chelsea and 12 adrift of Manchester United.<br><br>Wenger felt his side deserved to leave The Reebok Stadium with something to show for their efforts, and conceded that dropping points while still playing well was becoming a depressingly familiar habit.<br><br>"We are too far behind," he told PremPlus. "If you look at the number of points we have dropped and the way we have played it is really difficult to take.<br><br>"You feel on one hand there is a lot of quality in the side, but on the other hand we cannot transform that into points, so it is very disappointing to be such a long way behind because I feel we have a good chance to play with the top teams."<br><br>Wenger paid tribute to Arsenal's character against Bolton, but declared that a lack of experience may have cost his side.<br><br>"It is disappointing to lose the game because we gave a lot, but the decisive moments of the game we did not control well," he assessed.<br><br>"The second half was all us and I think the third goal was offside, but that killed the game off.<br><br>"We showed resilience, character and going forward we always looked dangerous, but you are never happy when you lose a game because it is very difficult to take.<br><br>"It is a learning curve for our team at the moment. We do not get enough, considering the quality of our game, because we lack experience in the decisive moments of the game."</div>
