This was found out too in the Holland team after playing for them 2 games only. The best is he leave to another new club, this way he will be forced to work harder as he won't have the "Old Bird" mentality and thinks he is above everyone else in the team.<br><br>And of the 3 you mentioned, only Rooney is worth keeping. But we know he won't be going anywhere soon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>So hard luck Mr Liverbird fan!</div>

We are living in a real world today and people don't owe you a living. What you did, you were paid well for it too and if you are no longer willing to work as hard, there will always be another guy who is willing.<br><br>Players that are loyal and faithful to the club like Scholes, Giggs and even Solskjaer who is already so old for a striker, will always be like and remembered by the club supporters cos they are hard working players.<br><br>Solskjaer was even offerred a new contract despite his age coming to 34 and little games played. These are players that are worth keeping even tho they are no longer at their best form but their hard work and loyalty is rewarded.<br><br>But players that are lazy, selfish, think only for himself can leave. If not for his selfish ways, Saha may have got more, the team may have got more if he was willing to pass the ball to others in a better position to score and not only think about himself so offen.<br><br>His selfish and lazy ways are the reason why he is losing the fans support and nothing else.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>obviously u don't know how to appreciate RVN's style of play. i don't know about u. but i probably wouldn't be watching or playing soccer if every single 11 players in each team and league plays the same way, namely hardworking. if football is all about running, how about asking the 100m sprinters or the cross-country runners to play. if being hardworking is so important, get a buffalo off the padi field and teach him how to play football. u will get the results, i'm sure. so my point is u need more than hardwork. u need instincts esp. if u're a striker. u can be lazy and stroll around but suddnely come alive when the ball comes near u inside the box and *bham* and the ball is into the net. that's what RVN is all about. Saha is well OK. sure he's fast and hardworking but he's also profligate in front of the goal. obviously his finishing is not RVN's league. and rooney ya for all the hype about him being a world-class player, he can be extremely selfish too. and on somedays just counterproductive with his headless chicken runs. not to forget his tantrums.<br><br>PS: i'm not a MAN U nor RVN fan. In fact i'm a POOL fan and on any day i will take RVN in exchange for Crouch. MAN U fans just don't appreciate what they have in their team well unless until they have Crouch.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A lot of you seem to have gotten confused between whether Man Utd are forcing RVN out or are circumstances making his stay untenable.<br><br>The real reason why he is being marginalized is because there was a disagreement between him and the gaffer. And Ferguson is not someone who forgets easily. That is something about him i dislike, the 'my way or the highway' mentality. He runs Man Utd like a tyrant rather than a manager.<br><br>I'm sure the bulk of Man Utd are fully appreciative of RVN and his goal scoring record. Several MU players were previously quoted as 'praying to god that no injuries befall RVN' because his goals were the only thing keeping MU ahead of the pack.<br><br>Fans and players alike will definitely rally around him, given the chance; but it's up to the gaffer to decide his fate. The same way Beckham was cold-shouldered out of the MU dressing room, i believe the same fate awaits RVN, again not because he screwed up, but rather he earned the wraith of one Alex Ferguson.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From Man Utd's point of view, it is the logical thing to do... Rvn is already over 30, he was their main striker, his form is not getting better, his attitude towards the game at utd is a problem cos he have this "Old Boy" mentality and thinks he is above everyone else in the team, he cannot accept not being in the first team...<br><br>He is still good but he is definitely not the same player as when he first came... His first 2 yrs there were good but the last 2, especially the last was not up to the mark.<br><br>His problem is in his attitude towards the game. His laziness not to run and he give up too easily. He continued this same attitude with his national team cos he was also their main striker and also an "Old Boy" in the team. This was eventually found out by the Holland manager after playing for them 2 games only as he was drop from then... and he also had an argument with MVB the manager for dropping him...<br><br>Someone here mentioned the reason why he is being marginalized is because his disagreement with FergusonÂ… Well, I belief that is true. I guess he forgotten who is the manager and who is the player here. Manager chooses the team, players play. If players were choosing the team than even the youth players will feel they deserve to play too. If the Manager thinks that another playerÂ’s form is better than him, he should accept it like most players do and not throw tantrums.<br><br>I believe going to a new club will do him betterÂ… Cos at a new place, he wonÂ’t have the mentality that he is above everyone as he will be a new boy. So even if he is benched, I donÂ’t think he will show his unhappiness openly. I am guessing he wonÂ’t be the first choice striker at Real but he will have to learn to accept being benched eventually over there as Real have a number of good strikers too like Robinho, Antonio Cassano, Ronaldo, Raul, Julio Baptista. I see him starting the season but eventually will play a role like Gudjohnsen for Barcelona coming on in the second half if they are down type.<br><br>Player like Solskjaer was offered a new 2yrs contract despite being 33yrs old. Reason being cos he is a hardworking player, willing to accept being benched for the sake of the team and not demand he plays every game.<br><br>Another guy here compared him with Crouch. They are totally different players, Crouch is still young and still has potential whereas Ruud, he is already passed 30 and may have another 2 to 3 yrs left of his playing days. Even their prices are so different, I think Liverpool paid less than 10m for Crouch whereas RuudÂ’s being an old striker still cost more than Crouch. So how can you compare?<br><br>Anyway like I said, it is a smart and logical thing to sell. He can no longer play as a first choice striker at Man utd and he canÂ’t accept being benched. And also no point having a sub striker whose salary is 90,000 where you can get a younger and faster guy at half that salary. He is also already passed 30, 2yrs left on his contract, 90,000 a week salary. If utd donÂ’t sell him now, he will be worthless in 2 yrs time. Now at least they can still get $12m for him and save a cool 90,000 a weekÂ… money that can go into a younger star striker that can play much longer than him.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
