            <div class='col-md body'>SYDNEY (Reuters) - Arsenal striker Thierry Henry is poised to sign a new contract with the Premier League club, media reported on Friday.<br>The French international had been strongly linked with a move to Barcelona, who beat Arsenal 2-1 in the Champions League final on Wednesday. However, he now appears set to stay in London.<br><br>"I hope to stay as long as I can keep running," Henry told The Sun newspaper. "I couldn't leave the fans, they're like family.<br><br>"I love Barcelona but on Wednesday Arsenal showed they had heart. I hope to finalise details today."<br><br>The 28-year-old joined Arsenal from Juventus in 1999 and scored his 200th goal for the London club last season, making him their leading scorer.<br><br>He was named English Football Writers' player of the year last month, the third time he has won the award.<br><br>If Henry does re-sign it will be a huge boost to the club ahead of their move to a new stadium next season.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well if anything goes,if Arsenal had won the Champion league,he would had be much more certain to leave Arsenal since then he would have won everything possible for Arsenal and leave as a hero with gratitudes repaid.No one will even say that he is not worthy of wanting to move on to a new challenge.So well with the rebuiding around the new young players,it would be a much better team to come.</div>

I am happier to see that by staying back in Arsenal, the EPL will be a more competitive place next season. Boring to see one-horse race too often.  Erosion of good players also result in an erosion in quality of the league.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it was a blessing in disguise that the events of Thursday morning enfolded the way it did. I'm sure it left a very bad taste in the mouth of all the Arsenal players, having been 'robbed' of the champs league. I'm not surprise if other players who wanted to go, have a change of mind as well, as thursday, though being a lost, has bought about a new vigour and unity into the team. Anyway, should he sign, I guess losing one European Cup is quite a bargain for one Thierry Henry, and not forgetting that youngsters that Arsenal are cultivating.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thierry Henry says he will never play for a Spanish team after deciding against pushing for a move to Barcelona.<br><br>The Arsenal captain has agreed a new four-year contract after confessing he thought long and hard about heading for La Liga, and Barcelona in particular.<br><br>It was the joy he gets from playing in England that helped convince the Frenchman to remain in London.<br><br>"Obviously, when you have this kind of team, you're mentioning Barcelona, wanting you, I was kind of maybe thinking about it," he said on Sky Sports News. "But my heart belongs here.<br><br>"If I can say, I'm an honest guy, that would have been the team [Barcelona].  Maybe yes, if I had left I would have gone for them but I said I'm here, that's all I know.<br><br>"I have to say I usually don't listen to this kind of thing [the press writing that The Premiership needs players like Henry] but when I hear this kind of stuff, I can't just not take them into consideration, to be honest.<br><br>"I don't know where you can have that other than England.<br><br>"I'm pretty sorry I've never played in Spain and never will. I played in Italy and in France and can tell you, for sure, it's [England] the best country to play football. Sometimes it's not easy to take some of the stuff you are writing but it's still the best country to play football.<br><br>"That's my last contract. I said to you it's where I belong, where my heart is, so I stop.<br><br>"Just look at everything, the passion. I watch the games on TV every weekend. If it's not Juventus, Real Madrid or Barcelona, the stadium is not full. In France, surely it's not full if it's not Lyon, Marseille or Paris [Saint Germain].<br><br>"I enjoy playing away from home here. Even getting stick if it's the right kind, I just enjoy it. I like the passion.<br><br>"The people here respect the players and I feel it.<br><br>"They understand maybe on the day the other team is better and they respect football. You won't see that a lot in some of the other leagues."<br><br>Henry hit back at questions suggesting did he fear following Patrick Vieria out of the club and not enjoying the same success or that his decision to stay showed a lack of ambition.<br><br>"Patrick's just won the league so, for me, he's been successful," blasted the ex-Juventus man. "Sylvain Wiltord has left and been successful.<br><br>"It's got nothing to do with people who have left or stayed. My decision is what I wanted to do to give to my fans and the club, where my heart was. I didn't look at Patrick leaving or whoever. It's their life and I respect it.<br><br>"If winning the league, staying unbeaten, winning the cups, being in the Champions League final for the first time, if staying at a club like that is lacking ambition then I invite everyone to come here."</div>
