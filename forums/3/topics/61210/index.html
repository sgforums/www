            <div class='col-md body'>What's your prediction for this weekend's clash?<br><br>Liverpool has been really inconsistent, but the goals against Fulham (even the build-up to the penalty) was awesome! I think they have to mark Forlan out of the game, coz if not, I think he will score again.<br><br>Man U's erractic form this season makes them hard to predict. They can have a bad game but still win the game. RVN is having a bad spell at the moment and their midfield can be in disarray when they lack concentration.<br><br>Liverpool would want to avenge their two league loses last season. However, judging from team form and the hunger to win, I'd say Man Yoo have the upper-hand.</div>

Liverpool are much more civilised than Arsenal. I think the rivalry between Arsenal and MAn U is more heated than Livepool and Man U's for now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well I really think it all depends on who Fergie decides to rest.... If he plays the same team as last nights CL match then Liverpool will find the going tough. Esp if owen doesn't recover in time.<br><br>All in all, Man U should prob take it by the odd goal....<br><br></div>
