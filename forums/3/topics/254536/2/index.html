Cause it was TOO FAST for you to catch it. Once you see him go down, DIVE, all brain functions ceased, even when you see the opposing player legs trying to do a tango. I suggest you watch all CRonaldo's "DIVE", but put it to slowest speed, and maybe maybe, you can then catch one dive.<br><br>Print it out, tattoo it on your chest or back, go to Orchard, displayed it to everyone, get a petition of like one million people who believed you.<br>Send it to FA League, the UEFA, FIFA, banned Ronaldo from soccer altogether..<br><br>Or best, paste it on your email, add some gibberish, send it to new paper, and you get letter of the year, and then you win!!!<br><br>or else, just drop it lah. You super bo-liaos.<br><br>The world spin and there are so many things, choose another soccer topic like "how Chelsea is going to crush MUFC cause their millions spend can't equate to only one carling cup.." or "how many times Jose needs to kiss Roman's ass to secure his job?" or "Jose will win the league next season within first 10 games."<br><br>You beginning to smell like rotten eggs.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Retrospective and Projective Labeling<br><br>Once people stigmatize a person, they may engage in retrospective labeling, interperting someone's past in light of some present deviance. For example, after discovering a priest has sexually moslested a child, others rethink his past, perhaps musing,"He always did want to be around young children." Retrospective labeling distorts a person's biography by bring highly selective and helps deepen a deviant identity.<br><br>Similarly, people may engage in projective labeling of a stigmatized person. That is, they use a deviant identity to predict future action. People might say of the priest, for example, "He's just going to keep at it until he gets caught." Such expectations may increase the likehood that they will come true.<br><br>Ghimpheng You are just biased <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> dont worry we all are guilty of Retrospective and Projective Labeling <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
