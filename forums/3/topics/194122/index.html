I think Chelsea was so cheap that he even covered the debts Chelsea had at that time. If he had gone for Man U, Robben and Ronaldinho is probably playing for Man U now.. Damn Ronaldinho, "I wanna be the first Brazilian to play for the Red Devils" damn it.. Instead it was Kleberson..

            <div class='col-md body'>tarcki, perhaps we started on the wrong foot. Paiseh if I ruffle your feathers.<br><br>yes, I believe Chelsea has more potential compared with MUFC, but I believe there are many others rea$ons.<br><br>Ballack is looking for his last hurray, and for him, as a top German player, he wants instant success and instant cash if he is to move out of Germany.<br><br>With the way, Liverpool and Arsenal doing well in Champion Leagues, it shows that Chelsea got the players but lack the brains. The special one won it with a relatively low profile with Porto, but with Chelsea, all other teams are determined to stop them, and pride themselves on that so Chelsea will not win it unless they got the ball "luck".<br><br>They won't become a real madrid cause real madrid don't have the deep pockets that Roman has. Some players want to win, I see that in Terry &amp; Lampard. But try talking to players like Glen Johnson, SWP, Huth, Cudcini, Geremi, these players aren't exactly winners.<br><br>Anyway, Chelsea is the team of the moment, and they pratically own the transfer market. I believe soon, they have enough players to play in all 3 leagues, La Liga, Italian and EPL.<br><br>But as the oil keep flowing, the players will keep coming.</div>
