            <div class='col-md body'>Football is not simply all about sports anymore, it has become a platform of business. With MG taking more control of Man U might signal a wave of changes, this can be both good and bad.<br><br>A reason which the fans are unhappy about is that they fear the 1st thing MG will do now that he has taken over is to totally revamping the club. Since nobody likes change as it brings about insecurity, thus the fans are unhappy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Soccer will not be ever be a major sport here until they start getting 5-4, 4-3, etc. scores.  Americans want either sustained excitment, high scoring or both.  Soccer doesn't provide either.  They can hardly get 15 (combined) shots on goal or actually scoring chances in the 90 minutes that they play.<br><br>Every other sport has a sudden death situation like a last minute goal, last play or buzzer beater play to decide a game.  Soccer doesn't, heck, we normally don't even know when the game will actually stop,  the timing isn;t set.  Example:  Basketball (barring OT) is 4 quaters of 15 mintues, Baseball 9 innings etc.  Soccer is 2 45-minute halves plus injury time which is how long?  Only the referee knows.<br><br>For its defense, I know friends who have gotten into soccer and say its a strategic based sport which they think is interesting and is growing on them but no way it's going to takeover any of the sports they're used to watching.</div>
