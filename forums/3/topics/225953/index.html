            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Mourinho fumes as Chelsea's Drogba wins it<br>tribalfooball.com - December 17, 2006<br><br>Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho criticised Everton striker Andy Johnson after their dramatic 3-2 win.<br>Mourinho was so incensed when Johnson tumbled over Hilario during the opening stages of Chelsea's 3-2 win, a member of Merseyside Police entered the technical area to tell assistant Steve Clarke to calm his boss down.<br><br>Waving an imaginary yellow card in the air, Mourinho was adamant at the time Johnson had dived even though TV replays, which Everton counterpart David Moyes suggested he looked at, showed the Toffees front-man had been shoved by Khaled Boulahrouz and would have been felled by Hilario had he not taken evasive action.<br><br>However, Mourinho, without actually claiming Johnson had cheated, clearly inferred that was exactly what he felt the England international had done.<br><br>"In my country we would call him an 'intelligent' player. Here, you are more critical," said Mourinho.<br><br>"I have been in this country for three years now, I am influenced by your culture. It is a culture I admire. I am proud to be part of it.<br><br>"So, when a player chases a penalty, he is not the intelligent player I would have called him a few years ago. If I want to be polite, I would call him a dangerous kind of opponent. You cannot trust him and I was not happy.<br><br>"I think he felt a bit embarrassed because after that he behaved very well."<br><br>Mourinho dismissed questions from local Merseyside media about the incident, claiming "You are Johnson's friend, no?"<br><br>However, recalling the incident at Reading involving Stephen Hunt which left Petr Cech with a depressed fracture of the skull earlier this season, Moyes gave Mourinho's complaints short shrift, quickly turning the spotlight on matchwinner Didier Drogba.<br><br>"It wasn't a penalty but it certainly wasn't a dive either," countered the Everton boss.<br><br>"There was a big complaint earlier in the season because a player went into a goalkeeper, are we now saying they have to go into them? Make your mind up.<br><br>"By acting the way he did Jose probably did inflame the situation but then he has a 15-stone striker up there who is quite partial to doing it himself."<br><br>The row overshadowed a sensational game in which Chelsea seemed certain to drop more points in their quest for a title hat-trick until they were saved by Drogba's astonishing 40-yard matchwinner.<br><br>Six minutes after stand-in skipper Frank Lampard had pulled the Blues level with a superb 20-yard strike, to become the most prolific midfielder in Chelsea history, Drogba collected Andriy Shevchenko's knock-down, then turned towards goal before letting fly with an audacious volley that gave Tim Howard no chance.<br><br>The effort was tough luck on Everton, who led twice, initially through a Mikel Arteta penalty, then, after Michael Ballack's free-kick had bounced in off Howard's back, a Joseph Yobo header, but could ultimately not close out the game.<br><br>"It was a cruel way to lose," said Moyes.<br><br>"We have conceded three goals from about 30 yards and, while we could have done better with them all, we didn't deserve that."<br><br>For Mourinho, it was further confirmation of his side's potential to stay in the championship hunt despite not being at their best.<br><br>"If you can't play great music, at least play some," said the Chelsea boss, who refused to put a timescale on John Terry's absence after he sat out the game with a recurrence of his back problem.<br><br>"When other teams were having bad moments last season and things were perfect for us, they were 12-15 points behind us.<br><br>"This season, we are having a bad moment but are much closer</span></div>
