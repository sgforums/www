            <div class='col-md body'>Alright my piece here we go..<br>First of all, Lampard is disappointing. He should stick to defensive roles in midfield while Gerrard do the creative bit. I don't think Owen should be blamed. The service to him is just not there! They are pumping in the long balls for Crouch. It's all about Beckham and Crouch connection. But when they brought in Lennon and Downing, there seem to be an alternative tactic. Pull the opposition defence to the wings and to the byline and get the ball in the box. Any clearance headers, Gerrard and Lampard are there to provide those missle-like shots. Owen, Walcott, Rooney(if totally fit) and Joe Cole, should play together to provide another alternative. Rooney and Joe Cole feeding direct balls for Owen and Walcott to latch on. This quartet can be played similar to Brazil style with Gerrard and Lampard holding back with the defensive qualities providing the glances of long range shots.</div>

A decent long-ball playing side. I agree with some of the peeps here that England huff and puff against T &amp; T side. Not becos they were good but they played the right tactics. And silly Sven just playing into the T &amp; T tactics. Against Owen who mind u does still possess pace, the T &amp; T defence will always play deep. And with a targetman like Crouch, England's main tactic was always going to be uncompromisingly long and longer balls to the BASKETBALLER which btw to anyone who understands and watches soccer will know is useless against a deep defense for one simple reason. When T &amp; T played deep in defense, the space between the last defender and the goalkeeper which Crouch has to flick the ball into for Owen to latch on is effectively reduced. And to make things worse, Crouch's flick-ons are WAYWARD!! If I am Sven, I would drop the profligate Crouch and put on Walcott. While he may not be as TALL as Crouch, he does possess the pace to run at defenders and this would have forced the T &amp; T defense to push up to try and stop his runs and free up the space between the last defender and the goalkeeper for Owen to run into. Unfortunately, Sven does not seem to get it. </div></blockquote>I think if you drop Crouch , the game may have ended stalemate. Do you think by playing an inexperienced but talented Walcott will solve the problem ? I dont think so at all . In the first place , Sven should have picked Defoe instead . Wilcott has plenty of years ahead of him. Unfortunately for your opinion, I dont think your solution would solve the problem. Sorry.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Crappy team with crappy tactics. Crouch and Beckham connection will flop big time man. Right..strikers are not all about scoring but creating as well. But from what i can see is that Crouch does neither. Put it this way, he's much like the Andy Cole of England. Give him 10 chances and he will probly put away one. And to the peeps who earlier on mentioned that neither Owen and Rooney could have head that one in cos they are vertically challenged. I will do well to remind u that Owen has scored a couple of headers for Newcastle before getting injured. And recall the more recent Argentina goal? And Aan Shearer, how tall is this England legend? Not much taller than us? But man can this guy head. Height is no prob. While Owen may lacked the height or strength but he more than made up with his speed of thought and sleight feet by sneaking into empty space. What is impt is the quality of the cross. And let me remind all those peeps who tot Owen was crap and Crouch was heroic, Shearer and Owen actually formed quite a lethal strikeforce for Newcastle. So whose the prob? Peter Crouch.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by owen82:</div><div class="quote_body">Crappy team with crappy tactics. Crouch and Beckham connection will flop big time man. Right..strikers are not all about scoring but creating as well. But from what i can see is that Crouch does neither. Put it this way, he's much like the Andy Cole of England. Give him 10 chances and he will probly put away one. And to the peeps who earlier on mentioned that neither Owen and Rooney could have head that one in cos they are vertically challenged. I will do well to remind u that Owen has scored a couple of headers for Newcastle before getting injured. And recall the more recent Argentina goal? And Aan Shearer, how tall is this England legend? Not much taller than us? But man can this guy head. Height is no prob. While Owen may lacked the height or strength but he more than made up with his speed of thought and sleight feet by sneaking into empty space. What is impt is the quality of the cross. And let me remind all those peeps who tot Owen was crap and Crouch was heroic, Shearer and Owen actually formed quite a lethal strikeforce for Newcastle. So whose the prob? Peter Crouch. </div></blockquote>Shearer and Owen formed a lethal strikeforce?? go check how many goals scored between them in newcastle n in england. U will see they hardly connect when goals scored.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Connect? Do u mean Shearer making the final pass for Owen? Well maybe not but when they play together there were plenty of goals. For England, i think u will have to read Owen's autobiography for a better idea. Noone in the right frame of mind will ask Owen to be Shearer's foil. Well Keagan did and quite rightly he got the boot after Euro 2000. And when we talked about a successful big-small man partnership, the big man has to work his socks off to create the opening for the small man to finish off the chances. Do i see it from Crouch? No. In fact from what i see so far, its small man trying to feed big man i.e. Owen passing to Crouch. Why? Because Crouch's passes are way-off. And has he done his part as a big man to take the rough housing which Shearer always do to take the attention away from Owen? No. It seems like Owen's having to take all the bruising by himself. True the goal for Eng might not have come if not for Crouch's height. But give him another similar chance could he have scored? This man needs many chances just to convert one. And there's no such luxuries when u faced Italy or Brazil. And sad to say the English style of long ball is oudated and the English must develop more sophisticated style of breaking down more organized defense and Crouch is not the option for Pool and England.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Other teams have to use 2 men to mark Becks, Rooney and Gerrad or they will be in trouble. where are they going to find so many defenders? Unless like T&amp;T last night... almost everybody in England's half and yet England score twice and could have scored a few more if they were not so unlucky.<br><br>Rooney only have to stand in the middle of the penalty box and all the defenders crowd around around him.... he doesn't even need to play. Only pull defenders away from the others... Brilliant is England.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>England were overly one dimensional. The long ball tactic was extremely ineffective and boring to watch.<br><br>Only when Sven brought on the pacy wide men did the English attacks look more dangerous. Lampard did everything right except score. I still think its a REAL PITY to deploy Gerrard in a defensive role.<br><br>Based on last night's performance, Ecuador will have ripped the English apart. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
