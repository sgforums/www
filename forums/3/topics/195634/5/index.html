            <div class='col-md body'>No Crouch pls. It's the World Cup for soccer not for basketball. And pls u can't have players who missed so many chances in the 1st team. U think he get so many chances against the likes of Italy or even Germany? And one peep from one of the earlier posts u mentioned Owen missing chances. Hello.. the only gd chances Owen got were the knee shot and diving header and mind u.. the knee shot was by no courtesy of England's WORLD CLASS midfield. Now u will ask where has all the gd service went to.. well the answer is plain to see. CROUCH. Poor flick-ons..even worse finishing..he should have been sent packing back to England. And all thanks to Rooney's presence which lifted England, Crouch became the hero and Sven the master tactician. Play Crouch at your own risk England. Cos chances against top teams don't come easy as they do like T &amp; D. And God bless u without Owen.<br><br>PS: I'm a Pool fan. And I certainly understand the pain of having a F-up finisher in ya fav teams. And imagine I have to suffer for both Eng and Pool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Owen and Rooney still the best partnership for Eng. Crouch is useless against T &amp; D. To praise Crouch for that goal is an insult to Beckham's cross. Crouch offers nothing special except his flick-ons which btw was far from pinpoint. Certainly not in Koller's league. And when u have a defense which plays 11 men behind the ball like T &amp; D. Crouch is as gd as a lamp post on the soccer pitch. His flick-ons reaches his Siamese twin, the Lawerence Guy from T &amp; D. He doesn't draw out the players like Rooney does by taking them on. Neither does he pack powerful long shots against Hislop. In a nutshell, he doesn't create anything for Owen. Crouch is simply not gd enuff fer Pool and not gd enuff surely for England. Bring on Ashton, Bent and Beattie anytime.</div>

Crouch is useless against T &amp; D. To praise Crouch for that goal is an insult to Beckham's cross. Crouch offers nothing special except his flick-ons which btw was far from pinpoint. Certainly not in Koller's league. And when u have a defense which plays 11 men behind the ball like T &amp; D. Crouch is as gd as a lamp post on the soccer pitch. His flick-ons reaches his Siamese twin, the Lawerence Guy from T &amp; D. He doesn't draw out the players like Rooney does by taking them on. Neither does he pack powerful long shots against Hislop. In a nutshell, he doesn't create anything for Owen. Crouch is simply not gd enuff fer Pool and not gd enuff surely for England. Bring on Ashton, Bent and Beattie anytime. </div></blockquote>well said  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>england's strikers performed so badly that i serious think even putting on walcott will do them a better job......England had so many chances and so many of those supposed to be goals did not even needed a save from the TNT GK.</div>

Next time like in the Paraguay match... needed only 1 good shot by Becks.... maybe Rooney would have converted all those chances or would have converted with just 1 good chance.<br><br>It was clear that Roooney help by attracting defenders to himself and open up the T&amp;T defence, for the Crouch and Gerrad goals...</div>
