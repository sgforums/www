At least they managed to reach the world cup, and nearly created shock when 10-men T and T nearly won against Sweden when Stern John hit the crossbar.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, i see nothing wrong with Crouch...It's just that many hate/dislike him becoz he missed chances...well..which soccer players dun miss chances....<br><br>As for his header goal from Beckham's cross, i'll see more praises to Beckham's efforts n precise crosses, but if it wasn't Crouch in that position to head the ball in at that height level, u think Rooney/Owen can head it in?<br><br>I dun see well between the partnership of Owen n Rooney....it'll still be Crouch that i'll prefer to partner with either Rooney or Owen.....<br><br>Also, the reason why i think Sven did not sub. Crouch out, is becoz T&amp;T is playing very defensively....and England has yet score a goal, so, in order to increase their chances, England needs Crouch's height to tackle in aerial while Rooney on ground , long shots from the midfielders (Lampard and Gerrald), crosses from Beckham and flanking from Downing n Lennon(Damn...he's fast)...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Crouch is making England just so predictable. A decent long-ball playing side. I agree with some of the peeps here that England huff and puff against T &amp; T side. Not becos they were good but they played the right tactics. And silly Sven just playing into the T &amp; T tactics. Against Owen who mind u does still possess pace, the T &amp; T defence will always play deep. And with a targetman like Crouch, England's main tactic was always going to be uncompromisingly long and longer balls to the BASKETBALLER which btw to anyone who understands and watches soccer will know is useless against a deep defense for one simple reason. When T &amp; T played deep in defense, the space between the last defender and the goalkeeper which Crouch has to flick the ball into for Owen to latch on is effectively reduced. And to make things worse, Crouch's flick-ons are WAYWARD!! If I am Sven, I would drop the profligate Crouch and put on Walcott. While he may not be as TALL as Crouch, he does possess the pace to run at defenders and this would have forced the T &amp; T defense to push up to try and stop his runs and free up the space between the last defender and the goalkeeper for Owen to run into. Unfortunately, Sven does not seem to get it.</div>
