            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson has vowed to unleash his full battalion on Celtic in three weeks time when Manchester United head to Glasgow looking to finally confirm their place in the Champions League knockout phase.<br><br>The Red Devils wasted their first opportunity to seal a last-16 berth in the Parken Stadion when they went down to a 1-0 defeat against Group F Minnows FC Copenhagen.<br><br>Aston Villa flop Marcus Allback bundled home the winner 17 minutes from time and the result means United must get a point from their trip to Celtic to go through.<br><br>However, Ferguson is determined to get all three.<br><br>"We want to finish this group really strongly," said the United boss.<br><br>"The situation is more open now but we know if we win at Celtic we will win the group and that is what we will attempt to do."<br><br>Ferguson took a calculated risk in leaving out Rio Ferdinand, Patrice Evra and Paul Scholes from his starting line-up against the Danish champions.<br><br>However, the move backfired as, Wayne Rooney apart, the visitors were well below the standard of recent weeks and saw their seven-game winning streak brought to an abrupt end.<br><br>"I am satisfied with the effort but disappointed we failed to deal with the corner when they scored," said Ferguson.<br><br>"We knew they would play a lot of long balls into our area and I felt we defended very well apart from that one instance and it cost us the game."<br><br>If the defeat was not bad enough for United, reminiscent of a far more costly loss against Lille last season, Ferguson must also do without veteran striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for the foreseeable future after he limped off with a hamstring injury in the final minute when United had already used their three allotted substitutes<br><br>However, while upset at the absence of the Norwegian, Ferguson was thankful the damage was not more serious.<br><br>"It's unfortunate for Ole," he said.<br><br>"It is a hamstring and he will be out for a few weeks. But I am actually quite happy.<br><br>"Given his previous history of knee problems, I was a bit concerned when he came off but, fortunately, it is only a hamstring.<br><br>Copenhagen can now qualify for the knockout round themselves having finally scored a Champions League goal and recorded a result coach Stolle Sollbakken had predicted prior to the game.<br><br>"I didn't think either side would score more than one," said the former Wimbledon player.<br><br>"United created more chances that us and we did need to ride our luck. But I thought they would run over us in the final 10 minutes, but it didn't happen.<br><br>"We still need another miracle against Benfica in three weeks' time but, if we can get through that, I am confident about beating Celtic in our final game."<br></div>
