            <div class='col-md body'>Dear ghimpheng:<br><br>Why are you so work-up? i just post what some people felt only what... You are entitle to your opinion and i respect it but i am also entitle to mine too. I did watch the Dive again last night to re-confirm myself and i can say again, i don't have any doubt about it. Maybe you should go and watch it again. What i saw was, even the free kick which lead to the penalty shouldn't have been given... Anyway, when it was taken, the ball wasn't even going close to Captain Diver. he ran, choose to go down easily and turn around looking at the referee asking for a penalty.<br><br>What Mourinho said doesn't surprise me at all, What else do you expected him to say? YES TERRY DIVED?<br><br>After the match, reporters were asking him England captain John Terry dived to win their second-half penalty at Ewood Park... He is good at such things. He is just trying to deflect attention from Terry's act. Last year he said Spurs or Blackburn parked a bus in front of their goalpost when his team couldn't score against them... I ask, Did you see a bus parked there?<br><br>Again, i am not being bias to the chelsea players, I only pointed out Terry's act thats all. I also said he is not a young kid like 20, 21 anymore... He is now England's captain so he also has a responsibility to behave and act honestly as he is the role model for many younger players now...<br><br>Do you recalled Beck diving in an England shirt during his 5, 6 yrs as captain or when he is playing for Real M...? Honestly, i don't even recall him diving when he was at Man u.<br><br>That is why i say Terry's act is a shame, nothing to do with chelsea cos he is quite a good player so no need to resort to this kind of things... I am not the only one feeling that way, their main newspapers carried it on their front pages mind you! Need i say more?<br><br>I understand accusation can be right or wrong. Like i said, you are entitle to your opinion. Others are entitled to theirs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>

We have different opinions we exchange our views thats all, nothing more.<br><br>If some of you have a different opinion or choose not to see it, fine. I can accept it but I and others also have ours. This post is purely regards to Terry's act and his position as new England captain and nothing about Chelsea as someone here have said.<br><br>But obviously some Chelsea fans can't seem to understand and assume i am attacking Chelsea the club when all i said was Terry's the players act which was a let down cos he is the new England's captain therefore an example for many kids not just in UK but those that watched the match too.<br><br>I understand its a 50-50 to some but enough editors in UK felt that it was good enough to put it on their frontpage says a lot. I suggest you go and watch it again. Later around 7.10pm or so channel 23 have show again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

You are entitle to your opinion and I respect it but I am entitle to mine too right? The important thing is not Chelsea 5 points behind or in front, thatÂ’s irrelevant. The important thing is the New England Captain had to stood so low as to Dived to win a penalty to save the match! SighÂ…</div>

Since this is a forum for sport discussion, we are only here to share our views and opinions of what happened recently and I guess in a few days we will all probably forget what was discuss here alsoÂ… Anyway, what may seem inconsequential to you may be of interest to others. No one is here to incite flame as you seem to suggest.<br><br>Your second paragraph onwards I will just take it as your opinion and accept it alright as you are entitle to your views too.<br><br>Btw, If you have come across or have seen my earlier posts, you will know that I said more than this regarding Man uÂ’s Ronaldo itÂ’s just that not many answered so I didnÂ’t need to reply.<br><br>And to your third paragraph, itÂ’s very obvious isnÂ’t itÂ… HelloÂ… his is EnglandÂ’s New Captain so naturally the spotlight on him will definitely be more from now on right? Have you forgotten how much Beck had to put up? Compare to this itÂ’s child's play. It comes with the job, itÂ’s part and parcel. You just have to accept it.<br></div>
