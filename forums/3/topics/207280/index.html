            <div class='col-md body'>MARK HUGHES has accused John Terry of diving to earn the penalty that set up ChelseaÂ’s win.<br><br>Blackburn manager Sparky said: Â“ThereÂ’s a real sense in our dressing room that we were mugged.<br><br>Â“Terry allowed his legs to collapse from under him to get the penalty.<br><br>Â“He knew the ref was watching the marking because of the FIFA directive about pulling players back Â— and he used that to his advantage.<br><br>Â“He went down under a fair challenge from Andre Ooijer and the referee gave the penalty. ItÂ’s something thatÂ’s creeping into the English game and you will see more of it if players know they can use it to gain an advantage.<br><br>Â“The penalty changed the game. Referees need to get the big decisions right and today he got them wrong.Â”<br><br>Blues skipper Terry denied he had taken a dive, saying: Â“It was definitely a penalty. He held me back.Â”</div>

So who says diving is out? Even the captain is at it, so why can't the rest... After all, Mc Claren wants players to follow Terry as an example.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, true. Thats why i wonder why he went down so easily...nothing to despise chelsea about its Terry's own acted.<br><br><strong>Captain Diver</strong> went for it even when the ball was not near or coming towards him... I guess is probably he felt they couldn't break the deadlock and time was running out fast and he didn't want another Middlesbrough. That's why he took the easy way out...</div>

He is not a young kid like 20, 21 anymore... He has just been made England's captain, I know, next you are going to say he is also human... But he also has a responsibility to behave and act honestly as he is the role model for many younger players now... That's the price for being England's captain. I don't recalled Beck diving in an England shirt during his 5 yrs as captain or when he is playing for Real M...<br><br>That is why i say Terry's act is a shame cos he is quite a good player so no need to resort to this kind of things... Now even the newspaper carry it on their front page.<br><br>Hopefully, we will see the real Terry from now rather than <strong>Captain Diver.</strong></div>
