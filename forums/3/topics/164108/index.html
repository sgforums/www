            <div class='col-md body'>I will give it to Rooney or Smith because of their tenacity and the way they give 100% in all their games. They may be young but with them holding the captaincy, it will serve as a reminder to the more experienced guys that experience does not equal leadership.<br><br>Giving it to Nistelrooy may prompt him to drop deeper in games coz of the added responsibility. That may make him less effective.<br><br>Giving it to Scholes doesnt work so far.<br><br>Giving it to Gary is fine but he is prone to careless backpasses and is not influential.<br><br>Giving it to Ferdinand? Oh please....<br><br>But then again, that's why im only plying my trade on CM.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Post Match press conference with Ferguson:<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong><span class="large">I got rid of Keane for United's good, says Ferguson </span></strong><br><br>But he refuses to give his version of events that led to captain's sacking<br><br>Nov 23, 2005<br>The Straits Times<br><br>LONDON - TOO old. That is Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson's stated reason for getting rid of captain Roy Keane.<br><br>Ferguson finally broke his silence on Keane's sudden exit last Friday.<br><br>United's position on Keane's departure had until then been simply that it was by 'mutual consent'. Ferguson's statement now apparently confirms that the 34-year-old was sacked because he had become a liability, The Mirror reported yesterday.<br><br>'Players do get older, and that's the horrible part when you've been the manager at this club for a long time,' Ferguson was quoted as saying.<br><br>'It's always sad when a player departs the scene of his triumphs, but football doesn't stand still. We parted company in a decision we considered in the best interests of club and player.<br><br>'You see your great players get older and you have to make changes quicker than other clubs, because the demands of our club are so great.<br><br>'So when we make moves, it's not for any other reason than to get better and keep this club at the top.<br><br>'We've been trying for the last couple of years to build a new team, and I think there's plenty of evidence of that. We won the Champions League in 1999, but you know that can't last forever.'<br><br>Ferguson, however, admitted that United may pay a price for getting rid of Keane seven months before his contract expired.<br><br>'The teams who have won the European Cup were all experienced, with an average age of 28 to 30. You can't say that about our (current) team. Five of our players were under 21 against Chelsea. It's asking a lot to get consistency with such a raw team,' he said.<br><br>It took much prodding from reporters before Ferguson talked about Keane in the press conference ahead of yesterday's Champions League match against Villarreal.<br><br>In his programme notes for the match, Ferguson devoted only two paragraphs out of 800 words to the most successful captain in the club's history.<br><br>In response to the first Keane-related question, Ferguson stiffened in his seat and said tartly: 'Has that got anything to do with the Villarreal game?'<br><br>He was pressed for his version of events surrounding Keane's departure and replied: 'I've already given it.'<br><br>A proper explanation?<br><br>'Well, that's all you're going to get from me. Nice try, though.'<br><br>It was put to him that millions of United fans were waiting to hear his side of the story.<br><br>He replied: 'I am sure they are interested. I'm interested, too.'<br><br>It seems Ferguson would be only too happy to never hear Keane's name again.</span><br><br>Some obvious animosity between the two at Keano's departure? How sad that the pride of the coach was allowed to win the day over the inescapable truth of Keane's rebuke of his teammate's poor committment and a select money-greedy players.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>firstly, i am a Man U fan.<br><br>secondly, im tired of staying up late to watch them run around like headless chickens.<br><br>for goodness sake, give the armband to rooney...he's been the most consistent performer who gives his all in every single game while the rest seems clueless.<br><br>against Villareal, i could almost see the opposition keeper, Barnosa chatting with the ballboy while having a cup of coffee. TO lose is one thing, Not to trouble the opposition keeper is disgraceful.<br><br>Defenders tend to bypass the midfield and pump long hopeful ball for the strikers to chase.<br><br>Midfielders run around chasing shadows and tend to rush their passes.<br><br>Strikers try to do it alone, too individualistic at times. Only with the introduction of Saha do we see some interpassing between frontmen.<br><br>Fergie &amp; Queroz.........stupid for playing Fletcher when Riquelme is not even playing.....too defense-oriented midfield that puts to much burden on the wight of Ruud &amp; Rooney...C.Ronaldo lagi worst.....cannot be relied upon for supplies (too selfish &amp; indecisive).<br><br>Sack Fergie &amp; Queroz!</div>

Alan tackles too much that he tackles blindly... Gabriel is also one of my choices...</div>
