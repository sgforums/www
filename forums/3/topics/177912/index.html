            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">tribalfootball.com - February 10, 2006<br><br>Chelsea captain John Terry is demanding his club be given credit for their success over the last 18 months.<br><br>"Our siege mentality helps us," Terry said. "We go into every game thinking we're going to win and that confidence has been instilled since the manager arrived. We go into every game knowing that we're going to play good football, knowing the result's going to come. We've got that confidence, not arrogance, to go out there and believe in ourselves.<br><br>"We're slightly annoyed, but it does help. It gets you together as a team and as a unit. We're lucky enough to have a great young squad. Everybody's fully committed to each other, we love each other to bits on and off the pitch and that's one of the reasons we're doing so well.<br><br>"I understand where the manager's coming from when he says we don't get enough credit," Terry said. "Look at the position we are in the league, the Champions League and the FA Cup. We're in a very strong position and there's not really been a team like that over the last five or six years that's done as well as we've done.<br><br>"It seems as if that's been taken away a bit by little things that happen in games. That's been the main focus, rather than Chelsea winning another game and being 15 points clear. I don't think it's fair criticism. You're looking at small instances that happen in games over 90 minutes. We're coming away from those games with good results, good performances from individuals and the team. But those little things are being highlighted a lot more than the result, which is the point the manager's trying to prove."</span><br><br>yes..........Chelsea deserve more respect and recognition actually............lots of clubs are already respecting Chelsea by keep talking about them and commenting about them this show that they fear the club and want to play mind games with the club to lower thier morale just like what Manchester United And Arsenal Always Did To Each Other</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes now? but surely, your "now" is based on what you achieved right?<br><br>I respect Chelsea for the consistency they achieved. winning week in &amp; week out to be top of EPL.<br><br>but not for the way they play, and the way they conduct themselves.<br>they like to sweep from left to right, trying to use Robben or Duff to sweep, or FL to drive from centre to shoot thunderbolts. What Boro did was to put two man on Robben and well, struck in neutral.<br><br>read about what happen to joe cole??<br><br>No doubt, Mourinho is a breath of fresh air cause he does speak his mind. And I respect that.<br><br></div>
