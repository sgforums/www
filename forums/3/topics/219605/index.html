            <div class='col-md body'>Terry, Lampard and Cole said Poll uttered that Chelsea shd be taught a lesson during last sunday matches.<br><br>Terry said Poll changed his mind for his sending off, initially for his altercation with Ledley King.<br><br>my take in this matter is Poll is carrying a microphone and his assistant and ref assessors at the match would have listened if Poll really said chelsea needed to be taught a lesson isn't it. I would urge people to critically think and analyse chelsea players claim.<br><br>how ironic it came from chelsea players mouth, as they were the ones who got the bad decision from Poll isnt it.  I rather listened to Poll's and the assistants and ref assessor's  explanation than chelsea players if FA really investigate this matter. if players can dive to get a pk, they will also lie isnt it to get the ref into trouble, especially when they dun get the decisions from refs.<br><br>In court, will the jury or judge listen to the accused version or the victim's and prosecutors one?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dun really want to comments much abt Chelsea match cos whatever i said would have been seen as an attack against HIS team.. but on Poll's other match.. i kinda believe that James McFadden did said something pretty offensive to him but whether its Fcuking Cheat or Fcuking Sh!t as claimed by McFadden is only known to himself... however Chelsea players imo really went over the line this time round.. they shouldn't have keep bitting on his pants.. getting the ref to quit or to whatever is not going to change anything.. as a matter of fact, its probably going to make ppl pissed if things really boils over anyway like some guys mentioned before.. Form is temporary whereas class is permanent.. and i dun see any class in this at all..</div>
