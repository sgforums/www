            <div class='col-md body'>It's easy to pass Chelsea off as a boring team, and maybe that statement could be made with conviction if Chelsea weren't at the same time capable of <span style="font-style: italic;">destroying </span>teams e.g 4-1 Liverpool and 5-1 Bolton.<br><br>It's arguably not the lack of goals that counts, but the fact that Chelsea are very organised, especially at the back. Their dominance in defence and midfield allows them to lower the tempo of matches and thus they can score goals but it is not very exciting because there is a lack of tension and fast paced action as compared to Man Utd or Arsenal during their championship years.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think chelsea is a team based on a very solid and organized defence.. some games they may not attack well but they always defend well.. thats why they may be labelled as boring.. teams with not enough quality will just try and pack their defense and hope to get away with a point.. this is what happens when some teams are bloody rich and the others get left behind.. chelsea effectively has two teams.. both equally as good.. they already hve a head start in this regard..<br>i think there should be a rule that will help promote young players to come up from the club academies..<br></div>

One thing that is strange about Man Utd, when they dominate EPL with 4 titles straight as well as the treble, they won it with home grown players, that is they are from the youth system. But when they attempt to so call "BUY THE TITLE" they ended up 2 years without winning the title. After the dominant years of the mighty Man Utd, they have splashed the cash on players like Rio Ferdinand 20+mil, 16 year old Rooney 20+mil, Ronaldo 10+mil, Saha 10+mil, who can forget Veron 20+mil, Van the Man(Van Nisterooy) 20+mil, Park Ji Sung around 5 to 15 mil, Alan Smith 10+mil IN AN ATTEMPT TO "BUY THE EPL TITLE" but not to much success except for an FA cup victory against a division 1 or 2 side i forgot with a certain Dennis Wise previously from the pre Abramovic era Chelski.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
