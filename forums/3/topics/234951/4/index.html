He should have stamp his authority from the start. Maybe, a word or two before the cards.<br><br>2) Sadly, the replay was lousy so I was not able to see why the penalty was given, but from referee's action, he judged there was a tugging and hence a foul. But it was harsh. In other parts, you are able to see from multiple angles and then it is more convincing.<br><br>3) I think the Thais walked off due to many incidents and not just this one where they felt they are not "protected" from the physical play.<br>Sadly, I would expect Thais to give the Lions a taste of their medicine once back in their own backyards.<br><br>4) For a min, the TV was zoomed in to the crowd where police was there. Were there any crowd trouble?<br><br>5) Considering this was a final, shouldn't it be play one match in a neutral ground and get it over with? Why play two legs, and then no away goals rule? What's the purpose? Revenue generating?? I am puzzled. Perhaps some can enlighten me.<br><br>6) Given the walk-about, would the Thais be punished? before the 2nd leg or after?<br><br>7) with the 2-1, the Lions may have wasted a good chance cause a quick goal in 2nd leg by thais, and game on.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Finally, I do hope that no matter the results, it will still remains a game, no strings attached such as political or etc. And our players can fly back safely.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>first thing first, it is not a penalty imo.<br><br>secondly, why must they get someone from SEA to referee the final? they cld hv gotten a korean, jap, or even a hongkee to referee the final, it would have been more fair. anyone inside the SEA circle is all suspect if things go awry, like this one.....<br><br>the MY ref did a bad job imo. i watch it on telly and there are many bad calls. thais got away with play acting and then conceded a soft penalty.....<br><br>however, i still think TH will win by 2 clear goals in BKK.</div>
