            <div class='col-md body'>why the replay is so blur. not like the EPL 100% clear. tsk tsk tsk.<br><br>i think from the ref's view, he sees it as the thai player pulled the shirt of ahlam sah and both fell together.<br><br>it was a rough game in all.<br><br>the thai player didnt show any sportsmanship and called the team mates to leave the pitch. you see epl, sometimes the player fall even when the finger touch one strand of hair and a penalty is given but the players had no choice but to respect the ref's decision and go on with the game<br><br>even though sometimes the ref is really kelong. players with great sportsmanship will continue playing even though the decision was F uped.<br>they can complain about it later after the game.<br><br>what's worst, the thai players surronded the ref after the whistle was blown. what the hell? there's still a 2nd leg at thai home ground what is there to complain about unless the thais are not confident that they can make a come back.<br><br>all in all. i think the thais should not have walked off the pitch and the COACH and MANAGER should not have supported them. they should have told them to go back and play and maybe they can get a come back.</div>
