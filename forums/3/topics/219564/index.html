            <div class='col-md body'>Like i've mentioned in the other thread, United should close down quickly on Morten Gamst Pedersen and David Bentley as well as on-form striker Benni McCarthy.<br><br>If you've noticed, both Pedersen and Bentley are wing players. They like to use their pace and trickery to get pass oppositions. And who are United's Right and Left Back last season? Neville and Heinze. Both are considerably slow players.<br><br>I think in this match, Neville should stay back and attack only when necessary cos if Blackburn has the opportunity to launch a counter-attack den its GG to United. Evra should keep his place at left-back because he's in form right now and his pace should neutralise Bentley's run.<br><br>Again, I'd like to see Rooney get into the scoresheet and United to win 2-0.<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>

I think he is not injured and will play tml lar. he is in magnificent form since the season started, even after he came back from his injury. I think giggs will start, but maybe he will not last the match.<br><br>I dun think man u will be treating BB lightly, after they have beaten them home and away last season, BB is a difficult team to beat like bolton, they are a physical side,  especially after they bought benni mccarthy from porto.<br>Man U defenders better mark mccarthy tightly, he has the potential to wreak havoc to VDS goal.<br><br>This season man u defending is good, hope they can keep the momentum going till may, matching chelsea stride for stride. if they can keep the 3 pts gap when they meet chelsea, man u will be very motivated to beat chelsea as it will be increased to 6 pts if they does beat them at OT on 26 Nov.<br><br></div>

Evra is maybe still adapting to epl fast pace of football. he shd be fine later on.<br><br>If not cos of the weather, BB would be massacred like bolton. man u shd be 3 or 4 nils if not for rooney 2 clear cut misses.</div>

FAS appiled for trial with the clubs then decide who is best to send after they get the date allocate but other then players from ard our region there are hundreds and thousands of players waiting to go for trial with them.. hence usually the SEA region will get such "not too good" dates, imo going for trial in England is useless..they dun know how to mature Asians, a better place to go to would be Holland, whom have over the years mature players whom are non European and had built almost similar to Asians, in a nutshell, it means youth in Holland clubs given more room for skillful players (not that any of our players are thou) whereas England are for well known for their strength and sheer size..</div>

We should do that before doing a big 2010 thingy.<br><br></div>
