            <div class='col-md body'>yeah i agreed wif u..<br>in this modern football inorder to hav a team success, def has to be superb 1st..<br>as a superb def can break down opponent attack n thus brings in confident into e team..<br>furthermore wif a superb def, a team can steady build on a superb midfield n also its attack..<br>moreover almost every team 50% of its 1st 11 will be in its def..<br>such as a 4-4-2 formation, 4 def n 1 gk..3-5-2, 3 def n 1 gk..<br>anyway nowadays almost every team plays wif 4 def..<br>therefore defence is a key part of e team..<br>tats my view, as diff ppl diff views..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The BEST team in the 5 years from 1999-2004 was arguably Valencia.<br><br>You don't reach 2 European Cup Finals in consecutive years,win 2 league titles and the UEFA Cup with a sieve like defence.<br><br>Indeed,their defence led by Ayala was rockhard,but so too was their central midfield consisting of Baraja and Albeda.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">So what is it that pumps Valencia up into the Hulk-like demon that bestrides the Mestalla with such apparent conviction?<br><br>One explanation is the midfield and defence, none of whose components one would like to meet on a dark night. Apart from the slightly deranged look in goalkeeper Santi CaÃ±izares' ice-blue eyes - he looks and behaves unnervingly like Christopher Walken - the defence is enough to terrify even the toughest of forwards, and Ronaldo looked as though he wanted to be somewhere else on Saturday. Mind you, it was his birthday.<br><br>Roberto Ayala didn't play against the side he was rumoured to be joining earlier this summer, perhaps for his own good, but along with Carboni and Marchena, he takes no prisoners.<br><br>These are the scary monsters you face if you happen to have got past the formidable central midfield shield of Baraja and Albelda, both deservedly internationals. </span><br><br>Remember Real Madrid in season 03/04? Beckham's first season? They blew an 8 point lead. Coz they had no defenders and their midfielders were all the offensive types.(Zidane,Figo etc)<br><br>You would do well to read Phil Ball's article "The Emperor's New Clothes" in Soccernet.<br><br><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=294924&amp;root=europe&amp;cc=4716" rel="nofollow">http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=294924&amp;root=europe&amp;cc=4716</a><br><br>You can't have many pianists and no piano carriers.<br><br>The key word is "Balance".<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This quote from the Spanish correspondent Phil Ball in Soccernet sums it all.He was doing a post mortem on Valencia during the triumphant 03/04 season.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">What has effectively happened this season has been a clash between two competing philosophies, one in which the idea of stuffing a side as full of as many famous faces as possible finally came off the rails, defeated in the long run by the opposing policy of building a solid and stable squad over a period of time.<br><br>Valencia seem to have no weaknesses. <strong>Like all the frightening sides of the past, they have based their success on the firm foundations of defence first, midfield next, and last of all, attack.</strong></span></div>
