            <div class='col-md body'>Ghana was very very impressive against the Czechs. Appiah should be the man-of-the match. The Czechs keep attacking and were leaving behind many gaps in their defence which the Ghanians exploited skilfully.<br><br>I actually anticipated a draw, but did'nt know Ghana went straight for the Czech's jugular.<br><br>Overall, the match of the tournament so far.

And it does indeed look as though the African teams seem to be tossing everything at the goal mouth without considering tactical positioning.<br><br>But then again, you also have to consider Peter Cech's excellent performance that thwarted several sure Ghanaian goals. The scoreline would have read something like 4-0 if an average 'keeper had been in Cech's place.</div>
