            <div class='col-md body'>The agent of Cesc Fabregas insists the teenager is tempted by a move to Real Madrid, but admits the Spanish giants will have their work cut out agreeing a deal with Arsenal.<br><br>New Real president Ramon Calderon promised to bring Fabregas to the Santiago Bernabeu as part of his pre-election manifesto and is still confident of landing the talented midfielder.<br><br>The player's agent Joseba Diaz held talks with Calderon's director of sport Predrag Mijatovic prior to the election win and thrashed out terms for a transfer.<br><br>Diaz is adamant Fabregas would like the chance to return to Spain, but - with the youngster on a long-term deal at Highbury - it seems highly unlikely that Arsenal will entertain the notion of letting him go.<br><br>Diaz concedes Arsenal will fight hard to keep their man, but still believes the transfer could materialise.<br><br>"We had meetings before the elections and there would be no problems on our side, but now they have to speak to Arsenal and see what they say," Diaz told Marca.<br><br>"We have always said we are very thankful to Arsenal. We would never try a dirty trick on Arsenal and whatever has to happen will happen.<br><br>"I don't think Arsenal would want to let the player go for all the gold in the world and we'll have to wait and see now.<br><br>"If the player wants to go to Real Madrid I don't think the negotiations will take very long. The situation is not easy, but in life nothing is impossible."<br><br>Thus far Fabregas has indicated that he would be happy to stay at Arsenal, but - while careful not to speak on his behalf - Diaz feels the youngster would be interested in a switch to Real.<br><br>"I can't answer for Cesc because imagine if I say he wants to play for Real Madrid and he then has to stay at Arsenal or if I say he doesn't want to play for Real Madrid and then he signs tomorrow," he continued.<br><br>"You have to be intelligent.<br><br>"It's very difficult when the best team in the world comes knocking to say no.<br><br>"What's obvious is that Real Madrid have come knocking at Cesc's door and that Cesc obviously thinks Real Madrid are a great team.<br><br>"He has always said that he would like to return to Spain, but whether that will be this year, next year or in two years' time, I don't know."<br><br>Real, meanwhile, remain supremely confident they will land their man with Mijatovic insistent that Fabregas has made clear his desire to join.<br><br>"The most important thing is the desire of the players and about that we have no doubts," Mijatovic told Antena 3.<br><br>"They (Fabregas, Kaka and Arjen Robben) all want to come and play at Real Madrid."</div>

Its for the clubs Arsenal &amp; Chelsea to reject their offer only, nothing more... If the players mentioned are keen to leave, then they will ask for a transfer and if the club don't allow, its up to them. They can end up having a unhappy player that may not be keen to put in 100% of their effort every game and run out their contract or they can collect the millions and go get another player that is willing to fight for the team.<br><br>In Chelsea's case, they have the money to keep the player until his contract runs out like Gallas but it still doesn't make sense, but with arsenal, they need every player that is willing and they can't afford to pay a player for doing nothing whereas chelsea can.<br><br>Anyway, Chelsea losing Robben is a big setback, Cos Robben is their best winger among the 4 they have... Duff, Cole &amp; SWP. I guess he see Real is bigger than Chelsea perhaps.<br><br>But whatever, if a player wants to leave, just let them go i say. No point trying to keep such players. They will only disrupt the team spirit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CESC FABREGAS has dismissed ArsenalÂ’s fears that he wants to quit for Real Madrid.<br><br>Real president Ramon Calderon claimed he had a 70 per cent chance of signing the Gunners star.<br><br>But Fabregas, 19, has given boss Arsene Wenger a boost by declaring there is ZERO chance of him leaving this summer.<br><br>The Spanish midfield ace insisted: Â“For now, IÂ’m an Arsenal player and thatÂ’s all I can say.<br><br>Â“If I wasnÂ’t then everyone would know about it by now.<br><br>Â“Every Spanish player would like to play in La Liga.

I want to have another successful season.Â”<br><br>Fabregas has decided he must continue his development under Wenger.<br><br>The French coach snapped up Fabregas when he was an unknown youth player at Barcelona.<br><br><strong>Looks like another ungrateful youngster in the making... </strong></div>
