            <div class='col-md body'>effectively, MUFC has surrendered the title to chelsea before season starts.<br><br>with a make shift MF of Scholes, Giggs &amp; OShea, last season 2nd place was the best achievement and qualification into europe a grand prize.<br><br>imagine putting the money for Smith to regain striker roles, a with 1 goals in four matches but letting a striker RVN 3 goals in 4 matches go to our main europe rivals.. And putting the ageing fleet of baby-face, Giggs and Scholes as our new saviours. We are in deep S8it.<br><br>with 50m, I am wondering whether this is made up, or used for glaciers' family to fund their US football team. Imagine, we can't buy PV, we need to loan. that already speaks volume of MUFC's finance.<br><br>with supposedly, 2nd richest club in europe, I wonder how the stupid accountants do their maths. We have the biggest debts. Or they can't do the "minus" portion.<br><br>for those true red fans, I believe most will start to realise that we aren't doing well in our transfer market. We can't do a veron anymore.<br><br>If we were to get Lippi, I suggest we do it soon. Fergie smells like expired yogurt.<br><br></div>
