            <div class='col-md body'>Feyenoord striker Dirk Kuyt has expressed a desire to join Newcastle United.<br><br>The Holland international is among Magpies manager Glenn Roeder's top transfer targets as he prepares for his first full season in charge.<br><br>Roeder revealed his admiration for the 25-year-old in April and confirmed he was having the prolific hit-man scouted.<br><br>The Newcastle boss has now been given the incentive to pursue his interest after Kuyt confirmed a wish to move to St James' Park.<br><br>"I would love to play in the North East," stated Kuyt.<br><br>"When I was young, I loved Italian football, but only because van Basten, Rijkaard and Gullit were playing for AC Milan.<br><br>"Now, I'd rather play in England. I love English football. I also think my style of play is completely right for The Premiership.<br><br>"A club like Newcastle would be my dream."<br><br>Kuyt would arrive in The Premiership with cast-iron credentials after hitting at least 20 goals in each of the past four seasons.<br><br>He is unlikely to come cheap, however, and Roeder is likely to have to persuade Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd to spend in excess of Â£10 million to bring Kuyt to Tyneside.</div>
