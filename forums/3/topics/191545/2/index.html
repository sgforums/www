            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson has had another name added to his World Cup watch - Argentina's <strong>Esteban Cambiasso</strong>. The Inter Milan midfielder's name has emerged as part of a potential swap plus cash that would send Ruud van Nistelrooy to the San Siro. The Serie A club are understood to be keen on taking United's out-of-favour Dutch striker to Italy but haven't enough cash to afford a probable asking fee of around Â£12m. Inter owner Massimo Morati is reluctant to let Cambiasso go and was initially believed to have rejected the idea but if United insist that it is the only way a deal couild be brokered then the Italians may well relent.<br></div>
