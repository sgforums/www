Becos at saints, the midfielders do not provide excellent balls for Crouch to get onto and score. But it's an entire different story at Liverpool. Their midfielders are world-class(But United ones are better la.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) and yet he finds difficulty scoring.<br>I think they should get Sell him and get Kuyt.<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>
