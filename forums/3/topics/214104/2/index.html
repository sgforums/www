            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Saltiga:</div><div class="quote_body">wasn't it a fact that Alonso talk bad abt his entire team when he lost?  </div></blockquote>Renault bollixed it completely at Shanghai and they know it - hell they came out and said it themselves.  What was Alonso supposed to say, "Great, lads - you're doing a bang-up job"?  He pointed out the obvious and there's nothing wrong with that at all.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Saltiga:</div><div class="quote_body">7 WCs are manufactured result? as if Alonso's and the rest of the drivers' wasn't! back that claim what hard facts please? </div></blockquote>For starters, when another team besides Ferrari starts showing an advantage, they get investigated and penalised by the FIA.  Classic case in point: Renault's mass dampers.  Charlie Whiting knew about those dampers for a year and a half, and it was fine by him all that time.  Why the sudden change of heart once Ferrari started bleating about it?<br><br>Let's not forget the Michelin sidewall-flex investigation.  You HAVE been watching closely enough to remember that one, haven't you?<br><br>To date, nobody can justify why Alonso got the blocking penalty at Monza, but gee, it worked, didn't it?  After all, it allowed your hero to catch up in the points.<br><br>I'll get to the murder that Scum's been allowed to get away with later in this post.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Saltiga:</div><div class="quote_body">team orders? try recalling what Alonso said abt what Fisichella supposed to do after losing at Shanghai!  </div></blockquote>Fisichella's always sucked as a team mate.  Think about the pairings in past years: Mansell-Piquet, Prost-Senna, Scum and his fanboys - has there ever been consistently such a wide gap between drivers in the same championship-leading team?  Fisichella sucks, and that's a fact - in the same car he doesn't do anything resembling what Alonso does.<br><br>I've got no problems with one driver supporting the other at a point at which one clearly has more of a chance at the championship than the other.  Having your team mate pull over and let you through in only the sixth race of the season, on the other hand, is plain stupid.<br><br>Or do you think the 30,000 people jeering and giving the thumbs-down at Austria had no concept of team orders?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Saltiga:</div><div class="quote_body">feeling insulted? i wasn't before but sure is now, i'm talking abt the F1 and my belief but you're down right getting personal, of course i should feel insulted by your posts. </div></blockquote>Well, if you want to start off calling another driver crybaby, don't be a crybaby yourself.  If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen and, even better, don't start anything you can't finish.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Saltiga:</div><div class="quote_body">Jackie Stewart? Lauda? have you actually seen them raced before to make such a statment?  </div></blockquote>Stewart, no, Lauda, yes - I've got plenty of fellow F1 nuts who are more than happy to show me their old footage.  In Lauda's case, think Japan 1976 - how much balls would it take to get back in a car after you've been deep-fried in one a few short weeks before, and how much balls would it take to defy Il Commendatore himself by pointing out what a deathtrap that race was?  Now there's a real champion.  In Stewart's case, it's not only his racing, but his drive to make F1 safer - he was from a time when you expected to lose three or four drivers in a season.  Quite the opposite to Scum who doesn't care if his kamikaze tactics kill anybody.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Saltiga:</div><div class="quote_body">Damon Hill? there are supposed ot be lots of former WCs that are alot better them him that you can quote so why him? </div></blockquote>If there's anybody who knows how desperate Scum can get when he's under pressure, it's Hill (and Villeveuve as well).  There's nobody more qualified to talk about Scum's lack of sportsmanship.  He's up there with Lauda and Stewart (and THE man Stirling Moss) who knows what a sport F1's supposed to be.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Saltiga:</div><div class="quote_body">opps forgotten abt the last part, "thoroughly scripted opera"??? if F1 is indeed an thoroughly scripted opera why did Alonso, Villeneuve, Mika, Hill win in that pcs of scripted opera? and why was the decision in engine change, tyre groves and many other changes to prevent F1 becoming a Farrari dominated event??? </div></blockquote>Oh.  My.  God.  You can't possibly be serious.<br><br>You think grooved tyres and engine changes are to prevent Ferrari domination?  I think you've been watching the wrong channel there, tiger.<br><br>Think this one through slowly and carefully.  Do grooved tyres affect only Ferrari?  Are there any other teams that use the same tyres?  Given that Scum's just experienced his first engine failure in five years, how was the engine change rule suppose to disadvantage him?<br><br>Scum got away with punting Hill off the track at Adelaide, despite the video evidence showing that he clearly checked his mirrors and saw Hill coming before he decided to make an otherwise unexplainable swerve across the track.  The FIA didn't offer a peep of protest when Rubens blatantly pulled over for him twice at Austria.  Hell, Rubens was less happy with it than Max was.<br><br>Yet, when Alonso was a full 100 metres ahead of Massa at Monza, they got their knickers in a twist and took away his best qualifying times.<br><br>Put it together for yourself.  It's not rocket science to see whose favour the imbalance swings towards.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Saltiga:</div><div class="quote_body">try to remain objective and not getting personnal if you would likes to keep this as a discussion... </div></blockquote>I'm not getting personal.  You're the one getting all weepy.  To use your own word, crybaby. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
