            <div class='col-md body'>leaving to join another team is not the type of commitment that i'm refering to and if i do i bet no driver can be label commited in todays F1, however, what Alonso did was something that Michael wouldn't and thats talking bad abt team mates and question/suggest that team is not trying their best to make him this year's champion so that he wouldn't go to a new team being a world champion is totally ungentleman/ungrateful of him.<br><br>anyway you have your take on it while i'm entitle to me own opinion so just lets just wait and see if anyone can match what Schumi achieved in years to come.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

He's almost always had a lapdog as number 2, be it Eddie Irvine, Rubens Barrichello or Felipe Massa.  It's gone so far as Rubens pulling over for Scum and letting him through in Austria.

The 7 WDCs are a manufactured result, more easily attributable to legal wrangling, skulduggery and plain backstabbing than anything else.  Just read what Rubens has had to say since he stopped depending on Ferrari for his paychecks, and check up on Herbert's Benetton experience for yourself.  Maybe look at that ridiculous blocking penalty for Alonso at Monza.  Have a look at the replays of Austria when Rubens had to pull over twice for the so-called best driver around.  It's all on record for anybody who cares to think for himself and get the facts.<br><br>If I were you, I'd be feeling insulted by now.  That cheating Kraut scumbag's just pulled the wool over your eyes made a damn fool out of you.<br><br>For God's sake, I hope nobody tries to match his record for cheating.  I'd like to see real racing return after he slinks off.  And apparently, so do the likes of Jackie Stewart, Niki Lauda and Damon Hill amongst other people who remember when it was a sport instead of a thoroughly scripted opera.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>opps forgotten abt the last part, "thoroughly scripted opera"??? if F1 is indeed an thoroughly scripted opera why did Alonso, Villeneuve, Mika, Hill win in that pcs of scripted opera? and why was the decision in engine change, tyre groves and many other changes to prevent F1 becoming a Farrari dominated event???<br><br>try to remain objective and not getting personnal if you would likes to keep this as a discussion...<br><br>Cheers<br></div>
