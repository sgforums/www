"It's great to have him back in the squad. He's a player who is capable of changing games.<br><br>"It's been a while since he was available but I'm delighted to have him back."<br><br>McClaren would not confirm that Cole would be in his starting line-up for Friday's friendly but it looks certain he will pick him on the left of his midfield, with David Beckham on the right and Chelsea's Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard in the centre.<br><br>An alternative for McClaren would be using Tottenham's Ledley King in a holding midfield role but the defender failed to come to grips with the position when he played there for England against Argentina in Geneva in pitch-related injury so close to next week's European Championship qualifier against Estonia.<br><br>McClaren said: "With the rain we've had recently and the amount of matches which have been played on the pitch, we have to look at it very closely. I would say that the condition of the pitch is a concern."<br><br>McClaren denied he had recalled Beckham to appease the fans and take pressure off himself.<br><br>"The only thing that will help me to get the support of the fans is to win football matches," he said. "That's why I brought David back. Not for the fans, not for the media, not for anybody but the England team."<br><br>The England coach was at pains to point out that Beckham's return may not be long-term.<br><br>"You have to be pragmatic about international football," he said. "I have picked a squad for just these two games and nothing more." </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's hard to have both Gerrard and Lampard both in the same side, as they both play best in the central midfield role.<br><br>At Chelsea, it has shown that Lampard can't excel in a tight diamond four midfield (with Ballack) and tends to have better games when the team plays using wingers and has more width.<br><br>Gerrard has played quite a few times on the right for both Liverpool and England, but his best games have always been in the centre.<br><br>Another way to fit in would be for one to sit back more defensively whereas the other plays a more attacking role. Gerrard would be more well-suited among the two in the more defensive position, but either way, it comprises the attacking abilities of either player.<br><br>The above is based on 4-4-2. It might actually be possible for both Gerrard and Lampard to play the attacking role along side each other by playing 4-5-1. With Crouch as the lone striker.</div>
