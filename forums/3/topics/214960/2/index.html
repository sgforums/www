But Barcelona and Reading will be like chalk and cheese.<br><br>"I don't want to comment on Hunt's challenge. I just hope one or both of our keepers will be back soon. It was a strange, strange game.<br><br>"When Petr came off I said I'd have to go in goal if Carlo also got injured. But I don't think they were too keen to put me between the sticks.<br><br>"I've messed about in goal in training but JT is much better than me.<br><br>"I didn't think they'd want to put a central defender in goal for the last two minutes."<br><br>Jose Mourinho added: "I knew that of the outfield players JT is the best keeper.<br><br>"But it was a difficult decision to put him in goal.<br><br>"I was thinking about Joe Cole because he's not bad in goal but only if you're playing five-a-side with small posts.<br><br>"In the end I had no choice. JT had to go in goal and I brought Didier Drogba into the middle of the defence for the last few minutes. They all did a brilliant job." </span></div>

"I thought maybe he was suffering from some kind of concussion, but after speaking to his wife [Martina], we were told that his injuries were getting worse."<br><br>Cechova - like JosÃ­ÂŸourinho, the Chelsea manager - claimed that the collision was not an accident. "When I saw it on TV, Hunt looked like he wanted to kill Petr," Cechova said. "It was terrible to see." </span></div>
