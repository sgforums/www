            <div class='col-md body'>GP, yes, I think most of us agree Lampard is good, but for him to get 2nd in world footballer, he has to be special. And for most of us, he is not special.<br><br>compare his work rate and excitement he brings compared to StevieG, who is more dymanic?? StevieG can bring the whole soccer world on their foot when he get ready to shoot. He single-handed brought pool back two times, to win European League and FA Cup. And then you see Lampard, he is effective but not exciting. Under Mourniho, all players becomes mechanical. No excitement just effective.<br><br>then you understand, you can't compare him to those around EPL, you have to compare him with the best and then you will see that he is not that special.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i dont understand why he insist on taking free kicks when he is totally out of form.  and he shoots too frequently.<br><br>he is getting 80k per week.  on top of that selling him could bring in tens of millions of pounds, why keep him?<br><br>chelsea can use the money to buy another better midfielder.<br><br></div>
