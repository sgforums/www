Because I run more and more so the shoes like wearing out faster.<br><br>Also more important for runners is the foot type. you need to know what food type for you at get the proper "fit" and "type" of shoes. I think that is the MOST important rather then thinking what model to get.<br><br>Also not all models will suit you. For example I have "wide" feet, so I need a wider width models. I think not all brands/models/shops stock wide width shoes.<br></div></blockquote>pegasus cost 104(after discount in most shops in queensway...retail price is 156 bucks).....how i noe?...i been owning 3 versions of it for the past 6 years and i used to do sales in a sports shop.... so dont think...<br>next time confirm first........<br><br>and please dont compare the peg with the 1090(the 1090 is a low end stability trainer)...if u wanna compare...compare the peg with the gel cumulus....and if u noe the price of the cumulus(the cumulus is up to par with the peg's cushionability)...u'd probably get a peg instead...<br><br>anywaes...u shouldnt compare stability shoes with cushioned shoes...2 different things...choose a shoe based on how ure previous ones worn out...not by how ure foot type is...nowadays ppl with their own foot types dont seem to run they way their foot types are supposed to run...like for me...i have a low arch but i underpronate....so basically...some ppl's foot type work differently than they should...<br><br>if u run for quite some time and take the time to try out new shoes.......u'd noe wat models to look out for...<br><br>i suggest ppl do a search in the forums abt running shoes as there are 2 previous ones and have been discussed et nauseum.....</div>
