            <div class='col-md body'>*shrug*<br><br>Sometimes, i really wonder. Do those chinese fans fools really wanna start a WW3 wif Jap again? It is patriotic to support their home team in e Olympics, but it is ungentlemanly to bring in a grudges frm past year smelly cakes into the picture. The dignity of Chinese around the world is at stake when China is hosting the Olympics.<br><br>But the resent is just enuff towards the Japs. Consider the dmg they done to China during WW2 and the NanJin massacre. It amazing how a few powerful ppl of the country can set in place an eternal feud for future generations wif other countries.<br><br>Yeah... those were wartimes. But it's peacetime now. Seriously, i tink it's really abt time Jap admit the mistakes made during WW2 now and apologise to the rest of e world. Juz wonder abt e repercussion of doing so though... Only way out of this is to wait for all survivals of WW2 to be dead for 3-4 generations already, b4 this matter can come to rest. While there's no war again in e next 200 years, all feuds should end. But of cos... USA and Iraq... Taiwan and China... Sigh... Oops! Sry! I digressed.<br><br>Err... I tink the Olympics can still b held at China though. It's more on China government's own responsibility to ensure e correct value of thoughts be rooted into the citizens instead. History are meant to be learnt from, not to remind of some grudges to hold. The bomb drop at Hiroshima and Nagasaki already gave them a fair share of the pain anyway. In war, any1 dead are mostly innocents anyway. Juz selfish power play of politics figures.</div>

Even England a country that has so many violent soccer hooligans can still be allowed to host a big tournament like Euro 96 so why not China...<br><br>Anyway Sepp Blatter the FIFA President has even backed China to host a future World Cup.<br><br></div>

We dun have large land areas for their activities. We are so minature in size in terms of everything. We dun even have much of our own talent to boost abt. Even those who rep Singapore, are mostly non-Singaporeans. We should be very grateful tt they are willing to help Singapore, instead of their own country.<br><br>To survive in sg, u nid talents. If u got talents but are useless, ur starve. Taking up sports and arts as a career are meant for e richer ppl who dun nid to worry abt life expenses as much. Unless ur lucky enuff tt some stranger or e country recognise yr talent, and is going to sponsor u for yr everyday expenses in order to let u concentrate on yr pursue in sports, else i dun tink we'll have much of our own ppl in e subsequent Olympics.<br><br>Btw, cheers to those who rep SG in e current Olympics, esp da guy who beat China's LinDan for badminton.

            <div class='col-md body'>An international committee of seven participating countries has been set up to lobby for the inclusion of a number of Asian sports into the Olympics.<br><br>The committee has called itself the "International Committee Of Asian Olympic Games Inclusion (ICAOGI)".<br><br>The participating countries consists of India, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore.<br><br>Elected Chairman of the Committee, Singaporean Mr Wang Too Play, said, "We are tired of the fact that so many of the Olympics sports are of Western origins. We think ah, sports with a more Asian flavour should be included. lor. Otherwise, not fair leh."<br><br>Mr Wang revealed that a list of Asian sports has already been submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for consideration. He hopes that the IOC will accept their proposals to include the sports by the next Olympics in Beijing in year 2008.<br><br>Organising Member Ms Saya binte Main commented further, "There are an abundance of Asian sports that are worthy of inclusion into the Olympics. We are merely calling for the IOC to recognise this fact."<br><br>The list of Asian sports includes the following:<br><br>1) Kopitiam Navigation: The sport of navigation where navigators plough through a crowded kopitiam (or coffeeshop) with a tray of various drinks such as teh peng, milo peng, or even scaldingly hot kopi. Judges and audiences will sit around at tables with the liberty to move about to increase the difficulty level of the sport. Navigator with the least<br>amount of spilled liquid wins a gold medal, and future job opportunities in prestigious kopitiams in his/ her home country.<br><br>2) Sale: A tray of clothes will be piled high in front of every player. At the whistle, all players must dig frantically for the piece of clothing the judges specify. Fastest player wins a gold medal and a lifelong opportunity to serve as a salesperson in his/ her home country.<br><br>3) Bus Marathon: This sport will take place in a stadium. Runners run after a single bus at the sound of a whistle. First runner to board the bus wins a gold medal and will never have to worry about taking a bus in his/ her home country again.<br><br>4) Sardine Train: This is a very difficult sport to master and has its roots in India, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. Judges stand by a non-moving train and squeeze players into the train. Most comfortable player wins a gold medal and free train rides in his/ her home country for life.<br><br>5) Noodle Maker: This sport originated from China and requires an enormous amount of technique and physical strength. Contestants must wear white and knead dough till it becomes thin noodles. Contestant with the thinnest noodle wins a gold medal and free noodles in his/ her home country for life.<br><br>by talkingcock.com  Hennie Rogers<br><br>haha take a look quite funny..</div>

Political problems shd be solved by politicians. </div></blockquote>there is a simple way to end this hatred. 1st, an Japan should say it is sorry and promise not to do it again............<br><br>after which we walk into their country and slay (plus torture, rape etc) 300 thousand of their civilians, after that, we wait for a while, like say for a century to pass. and then tell them we are sorry and promise not to do it again. and then chinese and japs can finally shake hands and be friends and live happily ever after.<br><br>younger generation japs know fully well what happened, even though history text-books have been white-washed. jap authorities altered textbooks not to hide the truth from their youngsters but to lead the rest of asia to believe that their youngsters don't know the truth simply because they didn't learn in school. but just like us, jap youngsters learn many things not just from text-books but from other sources like from their parents who in turn learned from their parents. in japan, war criminals are honored and their war crimes, glorified. their old soldiers have never stopped boasting to their grand-children about how many chinese civilians (not soldiers) they slaughtered or raped. and this is the kind of example they are being taught to follow, to pass on this legacy. the main reason why younger generation japs never had any intention of apologizing is because they fully approve and applaud their ancestors' war crimes and will not hesitate to repeat it at the next opportunity.<br><br>and one more VERY important thing we must be very clear about. we should not make jap politicians the scape-goats and bear the full guilt of war crimes. make no mistake, all of the jap people in general are fully responsible. why? because they all supported their military propaganda. jap soldiers were not forced to join the army but they volunteered. the 300 thousand nanjing CIVILIANS (not soldiers) were slaughtered by whom? no, not by their politicians or emperor, not by General Yamashiita, not even by ONE jap pilot who flew ONE bomber over china and dropped one atomic bomb. but by thousands of individual jap soldiers who were simply encouraged to kill as they please.<br><br>so there you have it. this isn't war. this is mass murder.<br><br>especially since a sincere apology from japs can take this much time and consideration, (compared to germany) it has become completely inconsequential whether japs apologize or not. the bottom-line is at least 300 thousand jap civilians must die. 300 thousand is just a conservative round figure (assuming japs only killed civilians in that one single operation!!!???) and japs should be grateful for this discount. if we were to be as calculative as to charge interest of one jap life for everyday's delay in payment, there won't be enough japs to kill. the only problem is, most old soldiers are dead. and all those remaining may not make up the whole figure. so which other japs should die? but wait! the chinese civilians who died during the massacre weren't old soldiers either. they were mostly youth in their prime who were deemed a threat or young ladies whose bodies japs used satisfy their lust. and don't forget babies. they threw innocent young babies and caught them in mid-air using bayonets! (if you just take some time to imagine this scene of carnage and demonstration of extreme cruelty, you won't take long to conclude every jap that walks this planet is actually existing into over-time. there isn't a single one of them that deserves to live a day longer.) that baby-bayonetting game is sport to them just like you and i play soccer everyday. this ain't no boogyman tale your gramps made up to scare you. it's real as hell. and this reality didn't happen in the dark ages where babarians go berserk and raid villages everyday. japan at that time was a developed civilization. their mums taught them it was wrong to kill and this was what they did. with that in mind, it makes absolutely no sense to kill their old soldiers as punishment right? we should be slaying their younger generation instead. and to argue that we shouldn't because they are innocent would be utterly ridiculous. because the chinese civilians who died were innocent as well. so why should innocent chinese die and innocent japs spared. wouldn't that imply chinese lives have less value then jap? surely nothing could be further from the truth.<br><br>anyway, there is no end to this shiit if one wants to elaborate.....<br><br>those who forgive japs. i admire your charitable spirit. because you have given forgiveness when japs never asked for it in the 1st place. just remember not to be so charitable when people owe you money.<br><br>the whole point of this, is that japs must understand that they cannot do something like this and expect to run away scot-free. there is a price to pay. the debts of the dead must be paid by their offspring because they represent one and the same thing. when you delay in paying your debts, you got to pay additional interest and people lose faith in your sincerity</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's a slight chance that Japan might apologise to China someday. China is now the third or fourth largest importing nation in the world.
