            <div class='col-md body'>1."<span style="color: red;">Some people believe football is a matter of life and death, I am very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it is much, much more important than that." </span>Bill Shankly<br><br>2 "If Everton were playing at the bottom of the garden, I'd pull the curtains." Bill Shankly<br><br>3 "The trouble with referees is that they know the rules, but they don't know the game." Bill Shankly<br><br>4 "A lot of football success is in the mind. You must believe that you are the best and then make sure that you are. In my time at Liverpool we always said we had the best two teams in Merseyside, Liverpool and Liverpool reserves." Bill Shankly<br><br>5 "<span style="color: red;">If you're in the penalty area and don't know what to do with the ball, put it in the net and we'll discuss the options later."</span> Bob Paisley<br><br>6 "Liverpool was made for me and I was made for Liverpool." Bill Shankly<br><br>7 "<span style="color: red;">Liverpool without European football is like a banquet without wine.</span>" Roy Evans<br><br>8 "Mind you, I've been here during the bad times too - one year we came second." Bob Paisley<br><br>9 "I hate talking about football. I just do it, you know?" Robbie Fowler<br><br>10 "Sometimes I feel I'm hardly wanted in this Liverpool team. If I get two or three saves to make, I've had a busy day." Ray Clemence<br><br>11 "Anyone who doesn't learn from Ian Rush needs shooting." Robbie Fowler<br><br>12 "Liverpool are magic, Everton are tragic." Emlyn Hughes<br><br>13 "I'd kick my own brother if necessary... it's what being a professional footballer is all about." Steve McMahon<br><br>14 "It was like playing in a foreign country." Ian Rush on his time with Juventus in Italy<br><br>15 "I said to Kevin (Keegan), 'I'll go near post' and he replied, 'No, just go for the ball.'" Tommy Smith<br><br>16 "Anybody who plays for me should be a bad loser." Graeme Souness.<br><br>17 "It's best being a striker. If you miss five then score the winner, you're a hero. The goalkeeper can play a blinder, then let one inÂ… and he's a villain." Ian Rush<br><br>18 "Of course I didn't take my wife to see Rochdale as an anniversary present, it was her birthday. Would I have got married in the football season? Anyway, it was Rochdale reserves." Bill Shankly<br><br>19 "They compare Steve McManaman to Steve Heighway and he's nothing like him, but I can see why - it's because he's a bit different." Kevin Keegan<br><br>20 "Bruce Grobbelaar will play on until he is 40 - and at the top level." Bruce Grobbelaar<br><br></div>

Roy Evans on Ian Rush's 600th appearance for Liverpool<br><br>22 "Should the aggregate score be level after 90 minutes, extra time will be played." Fulham's matchday programme for the second leg of the Littlewoods Cup tie in 1986-87. Liverpool were 10-0 up from the first leg<br><br>23 "There are those who say maybe I should forget about football. Maybe I should forget about breathing." Gerard Houllier<br><br>24 "Nobody likes being criticised, particularly by players who will be in Disneyland this summer on their holidays rather than the World Cup in Japan." Phil Thompson responding to criticism from Frank de Boer of Barcelona who said Liverpool were boring<br><br>25 "Son, you'll do well here as long as you remember two things. Don't over-eat and don't lose your accent." Bill Shankly to Ian St John<br><br>26 "If you are first you are first. If you are second you are nothing." Bill Shankly<br><br>27 "Don't worry Alan. At least you'll be able to play close to a great team!" Bill Shankly to Alan Ball after he signed for Everton<br><br>28 "Shanks was the father figure but Roger Hunt was something special. It might sound daft but just picking up his sweaty kit gave me satisfaction.Â” Phil Thompson<br><br>29 "As Arnold Schwarzenegger said, 'I'll be back." Gerard Houllier<br><br>30 "There is no way the second half can be as entertaining as the first." Alan Hansen during the UEFA Cup Final v Alaves with Liverpool leading 3-1 at half time<br><br>31 "We don't have any splits here. The players country is Liverpool Football Club and their language is football." Gerard Houllier<br><br>32 "It's there to remind our lads who they're playing for, and to remind the opposition who they're playing against." Bill Shankly about the 'This is Anfield' plaque<br><br>33 "Just go out and drop a few hand grenades all over the place son." Bill Shankly to Kevin Keegan<br><br>34 "It broke my heart to leave Liverpool." Kenny Dalglish<br><br>35 "Ay, here we are with problems at the top of the league." Bill Shankly suggesting to a journalist that Liverpool were in difficulties<br><br>36 "Where are you from?" "I'm a Liverpool fan from London." "Well laddie, what's it like to be in heaven?" Bill Shankly to a Liverpool fan<br><br>37 "Yes Roger Hunt misses a few, but he gets in the right place to miss them." Bill Shankly to a reporter<br><br>38 "With him in defence, we could play Arthur Askey in goal." Bill Shankly after signing Ron Yeats<br><br>39 "Steve Nicol never gives more than 120 per cent." Kevin Keegan<br><br>40 "At Liverpool we never accept second best." Kenny Dalglish<br><br>41 "Bill was so strong it was unbelievable. You couldn't shake him off the ball. It didn't matter where he was playing, though I suppose his best position was outside-left. He could go round you, or past you, or even straight through you sometimes!" Bob Paisley on Billy Liddell<br><br>42 "We will beat them one day, I can promise you that!" Gerard Houllier on Manchester United<br><br>43 "If anybody thinks either myself or my team are afraid of Liverpool, they can think again. I believe I've got a team that can go out and do the business against them." Coventry manager John Sillett before a match with Liverpool in 1987. Liverpool won 4-1 with Sillett declaring them champions elect in August.<br><br>44 "For me Liverpool can have Everton's title right now! Everton are good but Liverpool are better. They are the best in England Â– the side we can all learn from." Coventry boss John Sillett on Liverpool's title chances after Kenny Dalglish's new look team's second match of the season. Sillett was to be proved right as the 1987-88 Reds side of course went on to win the league<br><br>45 "You can't build a cathedral in a day. A look at the club's history tells you these things take time." Gerard Houllier<br><br>46. Barnes did what we expected him to do. He made a goal, scored one, and entertained. You remember that." Kenny Dalglish after John Barnes Anfield debut for Liverpool in a 2-0 win over Oxford in 1987<br><br>46 "He couldn't play anyway. I only wanted him for the reserve team!" Bill Shankly upon hearing Celtic's Lou Macari had snubbed Liverpool in favour of a move to Manchester United."<br><br>47 "Laddie, I never drop players, I only make changes." Bill Shankly to a journalist who criticised his team selection<br><br>48 "I don't believe everything Bill tells me about his players. Had they been that good, they'd not only have won the European Cup but the Ryder Cup, the Boat Race and even the Grand National!" Celtic manager Jock Stein on Bill Shankly<br><br>49 "WeÂ’ve got a lot of Cockneys in the team, but really, it doesnÂ’t matter where theyÂ’re from Â– weÂ’re all playing for Liverpool.Â” Robbie Fowler<br><br>50 "It's great grass at Anfield, professional grass!"

            <div class='col-md body'>51 "I owe Bob more than I owe anybody else in the game. There will never be another like him." Kenny Dalglish on Bob Paisley<br><br>52 "I go by records and Bob Paisley is the No 1 manager ever!" Alan Hansen.<br><br>53 "Liverpool wouldn't be the club it is today without Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley and the players who played there. When I first went there it was a typical Second Division ground and look at it now!" Ian Callaghan<br><br>54 "If Shankly was the Anfield foreman, Paisley was the brickie, ready to build an empire with his own hands." Tommy Smith<br><br>55 "I was Bob's first signing. He changed my life, as he did so many others. He gave us great memories and you can't put a price on that. He made me an adopted scouser." Phil Neal<br><br>56 "Bob's knowledge of players and the game in general is unsurpassed. Football has known no equal in management or prize-winning, but his modesty and dignity were overwhelming as he led this club from one triumph to another. His name will always be synonymous with Liverpool." Liverpool chairman David Moores on Bob Paisley<br><br>57 "Hold on a minute, John Wayne hasn't arrived yet." Bill Shankly to the awaiting TV crews and journalists for the press conference to announce he was retiring from football<br><br>58 "Liverpool had such a marvellous group of players. It was no surprise the trophies kept coming." Kenny Dalglish<br><br>59 "I may have left Liverpool but the city and club will always be part of me." Kenny Dalglish<br><br>60 "If Liverpool had waited until the summer, and then asked me to go back as manager, I would have gone back." Kenny Dalglish, having had time to reflect on standing down as Liverpool manager in 199<br><br>61 "He was the greatest person I know." Ron Yeats on Bill Shankly<br><br>62 "I always carry a picture of him, he comes into my conversation a lot; I learned a lot from him and owe the man a great deal." Kevin Keegan on Shankly<br><br>63 "The difference between Everton and the Queen Mary is that Everton carry more passengers!" Bill Shankly<br><br>64 On awaiting Everton's arrival for a derby game at Anfield, Bill Shankly gave a box of toilet rolls to the doorman and said: "Give them these when they arrive Â– they'll need them!"<br><br>65 "If Shankly had been paid overtime, he'd have been a millionaire." Tommy Docherty on Bill Shankly<br><br>66 "He's better than Platini, certainly better than Rumminegge and Maradona. For me he is the greatest footballer in the world." Graeme Souness on Kenny Dalglish<br><br>67 "I used to stand on the Kop when I was here in 1969. The atmosphere and passion on the pitch as well as the terraces was intoxicating and Liverpool became part of me from that day on." Gerard Houllier<br><br>68 "Our job is to make the fans happy. When we win, 45,000 people go home happy. When we lose, it not only affects them, it affects their cats." Gerard Houllier<br><br>69 "We don't destroy our heroes today when we worshipped them yesterday." Gerard Houllier.<br><br>70 'The only pleasure I take is that the fans are happy with the team. But I donÂ’t believe in anything other than my team." Gerard Houllier.<br><br>71 "I notice a former captain of ours said recently that this squad is so good that we donÂ’t need a manager. I took this as a great compliment. He must have changed his mind since leaving as he said at the time that Phil Thompson and I would drag the club down. On that point I suppose he was right - we dragged the club down to Cardiff three times in the last 10 months." Gerard Houllier referring to comments made by Paul Ince<br><br>72 Â“We scored 127 goals - the third highest total in the club's history. Although, if you believe everything you read in the papers, 126 probably came from a breakaway from the edge of our penalty area. The other one was probably an own goal.Â” Gerard Houllier<br><br>73 "Liverpool players must play like a lion, give his all. There must be determination, commitment and resolve to be a Liverpool player." Gerard Houllier<br><br>74 "These players are my true heroes." Gerard Houllier<br><br>75 "Players have responsibilities, because, whether they like it or not, they are public figures. They have to be aware that the people who come to the ground spend fortunes in relation to what they earn." Gerard Houllier<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>76 "When I see the Bill Shankly statue, I look at the sentiment on the base. It says: 'He made the people happyÂ’. Well now the modern Liverpool is making the fans and the city happy. And that makes me so proud." Gerard Houllier<br><br>77 "To me, the team is more important than any individual member of the squad, and the players have to realise that and accept that my priority is to pick a side with the best possible chance of winning each match." Gerard Houllier<br><br>78 "I want to keep an English heart to the team. I believe in that. Michael Owen is that. Never think Michael is afraid of anything." Gerard Houllier<br><br>79 "At a football club, there's a holy trinity - the players, the manager and the supporters. Directors don't come into it. They are only there to sign the cheques". Bill Shankly on boardroom meetings<br><br>80 "I'm just one of the people who stands on the kop. They think the same as I do, and I think the same as they do. It's a kind of marriage of people who like each other." Bill Shankly on the fans<br><br>81 "If he isn't named Footballer of the Year, football should be stopped and the men who picked any other player should be sent to the Kremlin" Bill Shankly on Tommy Smith<br><br>82 "It was the most difficult thing in the world, when I went to tell the chairman. It was like walking to the electric chair. That's the way it felt." Bill Shankly on the leaving of Liverpool<br><br>84 "The only thing I fear is missing an open goal in front of the Kop. I would die if that were to happen. When they start singing 'You'll Never Walk Alone' my eyes start to water. There have been times when I've actually been crying while I've been playing". Kevin Keegan<br><br>85 The goal looked as big as the Mersey Tunnel." Ian St John after his winning goal in the 1965 FA Cup Final against Leeds.<br><br>86 "If a player is not interfering with play or seeking to gain an advantage, then he should be." Bill Shankly on the off-side rule<br><br>87 "Take that bandage off. And what do you mean about YOUR knee? It's Liverpool's knee!" Bill Shankly to Tommy Smith, who had a bandage on his injured knee<br><br>88 Â“Ladies and Gentlemen, yesterday at Wembley we might have lost the Cup but you the Liverpool people have won everything. You have won the admiration of the policemen in London and you have won the admiration of the public in London." Bill Shankly after losing the FA Cup in 1971 to Arsenal<br><br>89 "Chairman Mao has never seen a greater show of red strength." Bill Shankly<br><br>90 "It is our fifth trophy in just a matter of months and that shows what can be achieved when you have a united team who have great trust in each other." Gerard Houllier after Liverpool won the Super Cup in Monaco<br><br>91 "This was a special atmosphere only Anfield can produce. This was St Etienne part two and the fans cheered every tackle and it's one of the greatest nights in this football club's history." Phil Thompson after Liverpool's 2-0 victory over Roma in the Champions League 2002<br><br>92 "I will never forget today and I want to thank all the fans who gave me such a great ovation. They were immense. I thought I would get a decent reception but that surpassed all my wildest dreams. That sort of ovation is normally reserved for players who have won European Cups for a club. It was a brilliant day and it was nice to hear the Kop's humour at its best again when they were telling me to go back to Coventry." Gary McAllister after his last game for Liverpool at Anfield<br><br>93 "Playing Roma in Rome in the European Cup final and scoring a penalty in the shoot out to help us win it. That was my very last kick for Liverpool and it doesn't really get any better than that." Graeme Souness<br><br>94 "We are the real people's club." Sammy Lee<br><br>95 "He has not changed his religion." Gerard Houllier to a reporter when asked if Nick Barmby would become a recluse following his move from Everton to Liverpool<br><br>96 "I used to hate Ian Rush when I was young, because I was a devout Evertonian in those days, and he seemed to score every time Liverpool played against us. It's strange to think he used to support Everton too when he was a kid. He was brilliant to me at Anfield always giving me good advice." Robbie Fowler<br><br>97 "I was once offered Eric Cantona at Liverpool." Graeme Souness admitting he turned down the chance to sign the Frenchman during his reign as Liverpool manager<br><br>98 "You may have found me mean and thirsty in my search for trophies, but the bad news is the man who is taking my place is hungrier than me. Fagan's the name and I don't think he'll need any help from the Artful Dodger!" Bob Paisley on Joe Fagan<br><br>99 "If you can't make decisions in life, you're a bloody menace. You'd be better becoming an MP!" Bill Shankly<br><br>100 "I just hoped that after the trials and tribulations of my early years in management, someone up high would smile on me and guide my hand. My plea was answered when we got Kenny Dalglish. What a player, what a great professional!" Bob Paisley<br><br></div>
