              <p>Why Singaporeans can't be bothered about Youth Olympics?</p>
              <p>What are some of the reasons?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: 15.8333px;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Singapore unmoved by throws of youth</strong></span><br>By Stanislaus Jude Chan <br><br>SINGAPORE - Just a month after the buzz from the vuvuzelas ended at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, Singapore is busy preparing to host the next major event in the world sports calendar - the Youth Olympic Games. But few seem to know, or care, about the inaugural youth version of the venerable Olympic Games. </span></p>
              <p>An online survey by state-controlled media Channel News Asia found that 88% of 6,430 respondent said they were "not interested at all" in watching any of the action at the International Olympic <span style="font-size: 15.8333px;">Committee event for athletes between 14 and 18 years old. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;">"It's obvious that the Singapore government knows very little about what the sports world wants, and even less about its marketing," says opposition politician Dr Chee Soon Juan. "The public wants to watch top athletes in their prime in action, not when they are still in the process of getting there." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;">The Games are "a waste of time", says Malcolm Hoe, a 26-year-old undergraduate. "I'd rather stay at home and watch the English Premier League on television." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;">Some 5,000 athletes and officials from more than 200 countries are expected in this city state of 5 million people for the Games that start on Saturday and run to August 26. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;">"The Singapore government is spending all this money on an experimental event that has turned out to be one that few care about," says Chee. "In contrast we spend about 100 million [Singapore] dollars [US$74.2 million] on the needy in Singapore." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;">The initial $75 million budget for the Youth Olympic Games - one of the reasons Singapore held the edge over Moscow in the race to host them - has been blown out of the water. The organizing committee announced in July that projected government spending for the 13-day Games will now be approximately $287 million. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;">Niam Chiang Meng, permanent secretary of the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS), admitted to being "a bit naive with our initial estimates". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;">With the MCYS also in charge of welfare and social schemes, critics like Leong Sze Hian question if the government "could have spent the money to help Singapore's pathetic - almost non-existent - social welfare system" instead. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;">"Only 3,000 people are on the Public Assistance scheme, which pays a paltry $360 a month," says Leong, past president of the Society of Financial Service Professionals. It was "last disclosed in parliament that, in a year, 50% of applicants were rejected," he adds. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;">"As to how much of the benefits [reaped from the Youth Olympic Games] will trickle down to citizens, we don't know because whatever cost-benefit analysis, if one was done, is not made public," says Leong. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;">Youth Olympic Games organizers also received flak from the public over the inconvenience to be expected from the designation of lanes along seven expressways and 15 arterial roads for the Games. Motorists who fail to give way to Olympic vehicles will be fined $97. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;">Even accommodation for youth athletes at the Games has been the subject of outcry. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;">"I used to have hostel accommodation, but was forced to move out to let the athletes take my room," posts one undergraduate, 'Darren', on an Internet website. To accommodate the Games, he claims he now has to travel some two-and-a-half hours each day to get to his university campus located at the western end of Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;">Still, some believe that the "prospective prestige of this global event" will prevail. "It's also an excellent platform to showcase our up-and-coming athletes as well as our organizational capabilities," says Aaron Wong, a 27-year-old teacher. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;">Adrian Heng, a senior public relations consultant, says he does not envy the Games' organizing committee, which has to achieve the "expectations of a nation that has become used to high standards of everything". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;">Despite big-money efforts to market Singapore as a regional sporting hub - with the establishment of the Singapore Sports School, the hosting of the world's first Formula 1 night race, and now the Youth Olympic Games - it is seeing one of the worst slumps in local support for sports. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;">For some fans, Singapore's decision to pull out from the Malaysia Cup football competition in 1994 marked the start of the demise in Singaporeans' interest in local sports. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The problem, some say, is compounded by the government's policy of offering citizenship to foreign athletes to don national colors. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Citizens called it a "hollow victory" when the Singapore's women's table tennis team trounced China to win the republic's first world crown in the sport. All three members of the Singaporean team - Feng Tianwei, Wang Yuegu and Sun Beibei - were born in China. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Half of Singapore's football team are naturalized citizens, originally from countries including Brazil, Croatia, China and Nigeria. In 2009, nearly half of the players in the national rugby team went on strike to protest management's preferential treatment toward expatriate players. Interestingly, the 30-man squad consisted of only 13 local players. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;">"I think Singapore is being typically pragmatic in bringing in foreign talent, but this is really a microcosm of a wider social issue. You have to bring in the talent, but still give opportunities to locals," says Wong. "And this is part of a wider issue - the overriding importance of education in Singapore as opposed to alternative careers in sports." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.8333px;">Hoe says he has fond memories of watching Singapore's teams play against countries like Malaysia at the National Stadium, but<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> "what's there to support now, when our national teams are not even made up of Singaporeans?" </span></strong></span></p>

              <p>Other than that, these youth are not that rich, eat and live at village sponsored by Singapore taxpayers, they also live and travel by buses sponsored by Singapore taxpayers too, so they actually can come here empty handed and still can survive and eat well. No wonder they need another hundreds of millions to help them. People olympic and international events make money, only singapore lose money.</p>

              <p>I am working in SAFTI MI and i can say that the organising of the YOG (they running from SAFTI to NTU today as i am writing now) is horrendous.</p>
              <p>Typical of many government organisations, there a LOT of last-minute changes and too many 'heads' making decisions thus messing things up when in fact the overall planning should be finalised long ago. A well-organised event is one which will have minimal changes and that too due to unforeseen circumstances. There should also be only one person who they contractor should report to.</p>
              <p>I should know as i am involved.</p>
              <p>Thus, i am not suprised that the YOG budget go way beyond the initial assessment and i do not think we will ever see a change in the way most of our civil service sector plan things in the near future. So what to do, bite the bullet and hope the people sitting in ivory towers wake up form their dreamworld.</p>
