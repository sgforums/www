            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO, Lampard is a very effective midfielder and will usually delivers what the manager ask him to do, hardly disappoint you if you have good players backing him up like what is happening in Chelsea.. with Essien and Makelele doing most of the defending work he is able to push up field without worrying and when he drops back to help in defending.. being the so call third "DM" when he falls back, it'll looked as if his is good in defending<br><br>Ballack IMO is probably better then Lampard, his link up play, his attacking, his defences spliting passes, his late run into the box..etc will probably put Lampard to shame but the problem is he is not doing it in Chelsea now, however all along he is one of those talented players that will do wonder this min but fade away almost instantly at some point in time, sometime even within the game itself, but between him and Lampard, Lampard as what i've mentioned above, is at max an effective player whom deliver what was told when things are laid nicely for him but hardly gives more and will usually not surprise you kinda player whereas Ballack is considered as a gifted player and will at time gives you something so spectacular that you'll be leave breathless..<br><br>Barcelona has too many creative players and would probably needs players who are effective and will dig in and rough it out for the team, however without the other backup for Lampard, i seriously dun think he'll be as effective as he is in Chelsea...<br><br>Just in my humble opinion..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
