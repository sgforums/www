            <div class='col-md body'>Jose Mourinho has called for referees to be held more accountable for their actions, after a string of curious decisions by Graham Poll in Chelsea's 2-1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.<br><br>Aaron Lennon and Michael Dawson scored for Spurs as they recorded their first win against The Blues in 32 league meetings.<br><br>Claude Makelele had given Mourinho's side the lead on 15 minutes, but a spirited fightback from the North Londoners dented the champions' title ambitions, and Mourinho was less than impressed with the official's display.<br><br>"I just feel sorry for my players and my supporters but at the same time I can say to Tottenham people to carry on their celebrations because this is a big moment for them and they have to enjoy their moment," Mourinho told Sky Sports 1.<br><br>"We didn't deserve this result because for long periods of the game we were the best team. But Tottenham fought a lot, they fought with their hearts to try to have a special day and they got it so I have to congratulate them.<br><br>"But in such an emotional game of football with good quality I don't understand why Mr Poll wants to be part of the show.<br><br>"The show is Chelsea players and Tottenham players, they gave a great game of football, I don't know why Mr Poll wanted to be such an important person in the game."<br><br>There were a number of curious decisions by the official, including a harsh dismissal for two yellow cards for club captain John Terry.<br><br>But Mourinho was also disappointed with Hossam Ghaly's clear elbow on Michael Essien and Didier Drogba's goal which was ruled out just moments after Chelsea's opener.<br><br>"The disallowed goal for Drogba, only he can explain, it's 2-0 in the moment where Chelsea were playing great football," Mourinho continued.<br><br>"And to show a red card to a player for contact in the box when he was the attacking one I felt is also a bit ridiculous.<br><br>"The yellow card to Ghaly is a clear red because he elbowed Essien, so every decision was against us."<br><br>The Portuguese tactician also suggested a novel approach for the future, as to how the officials should conduct themselves.<br><br>"I think instead of managers complaining and speaking against the referee's decision I think they should come for an interview," he added.<br><br>"Instead of managers criticising decisions because it looks like I lost the game so I complain about the referee, I think you should come and you should show the images to ask them the reason why the goal was disallowed, the reason why John Terry saw a second yellow card, the reason why Ghaly only saw a yellow card. They have to explain their decisions.<br><br>"It's very easy to be a referee and after go home and not have to show their faces and they don't have to give explanations.<br><br>"I lose a game and five minutes after I have to be here to give an interview.<br><br>"But I prefer to explain it in the easiest way. Tottenham scored two goals, we scored one and congratulations to them. Wednesday is another day and another game."<br><br>Next up for The Blues is the visit of Martin O' Neill's resurgent Aston Villa side in the Carling Cup, and Mourinho will be anxious to see a response from his team.</div>
