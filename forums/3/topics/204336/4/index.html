            <div class='col-md body'>The difference is Liverpool played with a system while Chelsea played their  Best 11.<br><br>Rafa played with the 4-5-1. Whichever player that comes in, plays in the system. Be it Zenden or Stevie G..Mourinho opted to unleash his best 11. When I saw the starting lineup for Chelsea, it was indeed shocking..they've got some of the best players in the world. Ballack, Lampard, Essien, Robben, Schevchenko, Drogba, Terry...But as a result of trying to play everyone, he went for the 4-3-3 instead of the highly successful 4-5-1 they used to play.....and it backfired...<br><br>Good to see that Rafa's preseason training has yielded more results than Mourinho..Reds were clearly fitter on the night...Lucky for us, money alone  can't buy you fitness. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal should grab Gallas from chelsea... All along i always said Gallas is there best defender, not only can he play well in centre, he can also do equally good at left and right back... very seldom see in a player but most people said Terry is better. This match really shows the shortcomings of Terry as Carvalho is not the type to run back and cover... At international, he have Rio to depend on and at chelsea there is always Gallas there.<br><br>Anyone who don't agree can go and watch the repeat... the first goal Terry backed off and allowed Riise space to shoot instead of blocking him. Second goal, don't know where he was standing, he didn't even know where crouch was...<br><br>If he was wearing an England shirt and did those mistakes, he is going to get a lot of criticism from the press and other coaches. I think McClaren made a wrong choice... cos captain always have to play want...Can drop a new captain or not?  Now how to drop him for Carragher?<br><br>I think after that game, Chelsea will pay Arsenal what they want now... $25m this week. But arsenal should ask for Gallas in exchange so that gunners gets weaker in one area but stronger in another and Chelsea get stronger in left back but weaker in the centre...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Maybe Gallas + another $15m should be a good deal for the gunners.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agreed with what WWW said.<br><br>anyone who said that Chelsea is not at their 1st team should look at Liverpool. Zenden is their starting MF...Enough said.<br><br>As a MUFC fan, I was really in shock when Liverpool was able to do a sub of Gerrard and Xavi and later Bellamy. I always think Liverpool without Gerrard is gone team, but they proved me wrong. And with now pace, they are really hungry...<br><br>Yes, Chelsea, is better with Makele, but Essien was suppose to be a younger version of him, so no excuse. I think Mourinho was trying to play more attacking, but with Robben muffled, Chelsea loses its edge.<br><br>If Liverpool can become consistent, then Chelsea will be severly challenged.<br>From a defensive sound team, they have now added pace. I am really really in awe.<br><br>Even with Cole from Gooners, if all saw the WC, cole has really went south since his injury. Now, he seldom attack as much, and seems to lose his confidence.<br><br>Gunners and MUFC will need time to gel. With MUFC, they got a new MF, and really need to gel. For Gunners, they have a young core so they could or could not perform.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>asking mourinho to sell portugese, is like asking Wenger to sell henry (french), and asking Fergurson to sell fletcher (Scott), never happen.<br><br></div>

I always think Liverpool without Gerrard is gone team, but they proved me wrong. And with now pace, they are really hungry...<br><br></div></blockquote>Nothing to really be surprise about tho... after all its almost like a friendly game in a way. If you were to ask both managers if this was more important or a premiership game, their answers would very much be obvious... Premiership league is more important wat...<br><br>Anyway, They will meet again very soon on Sep 17 at the Bridge. If you want to be surprise or shock, then you see if Liverpool will start with the same 2 or the 2nd pair.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the credit given to the victory is like a friendly match, but i doubt both managers/players treat the game that way.<br><br>how many times do u see yellow cards being dish out in the early minutes of a friendly? this symbolises the desire of the players wanting to win this competition.<br><br>the reluctance of both managers wanting to shake hands show u how much they loathe to lose to the other party, be it the scale of competition.<br><br>it is the fact that winning a sore loser that makes it so meaningful, so nothing can take this fun away even if the outcome at the end of the season turns out otherwise.<br><br>ben has frustrated and kicked mourinho's ass in champ league, fa cup and community shield. now let's hope for the best in EPL.</div>
