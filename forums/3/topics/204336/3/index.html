            <div class='col-md body'>chelsea needs a better midfielder.  i doubt ballack can do the job.  the reason why crespo and sheva can score so freely in milan is because of their ample supply of piercing passes.<br><br></div>

But cech wasn't playing today, that was a big difference already.</div>

Essien ? He cannot la .<br><br>Also that Kalou and Diarra , they must play for reserves first la . Cannot throw them straight into First Team , can be quite ruining for their confidence .<br><br>I think Chelsea will have big problem if they kept tinker among the players .<br><br>Also , Chelsea without the free-scoring Lampard , problem la .<br><br>Lucky u never watch , if u saw Drogba played , vomit blood .<br><br>Chelsea best player ? Has to be Shevchenko ! But his second half - like Crespo at the 2005 UCL Final - MIA for 45 minutes  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> .</div>
