              <br> <br> <span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;">Singapore decides no one worthy of top sportsman</span></span> <br> <br> SINGAPORE (Reuters) - <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">The
              sorry state of men's sport in Singapore was thrown into sharp focus
              when organisers failed to honour a Sportsman of the Year for the first
              time since the nation's annual awards began more than 40 years ago.</span></span> <br> <br> The judging panel considered its list of nominees but chose not to
              bestow the honour for the first time since 1967 because none of the
              shortlisted athletes was deemed worthy.
              <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">"We felt
              that the performance of the men could have been better and decided not
              to make an award this year," said Singapore National Olympic Council
              (SNOC) President Teo Chee Hean.</span></span> <br> <br> "The standard of Singapore sports has gone up ... we do expect more from our athletes now," he told local media.
              <br> <br> SNOC Secretary-General Chris Chan agreed it had been a disappointing year.
              <br> <br> "Unfortunately, it was a bad year; none of them really achieved
              anything noteworthy of the standard to be Sportsman of the Year," he
              said.
              <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">The
              controversy continued when the panel also failed to name a Coach of the
              Year due to internal politics and wrangling within the city-state's
              sporting structure.</span> <br> </span> <br> Former table tennis national head coach Liu Guodong would have been
              all-but guaranteed to walk away with the illustrious award having
              helped break Singapore's 48-year Olympic medal drought at the 2008
              Games.
              <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">RESPECT</span> <br> <br>However, during those Beijing Olympics Liu was accused of
              neglecting one of the male table tennis players and even though the
              matter was later resolved, the coach decided not to renew his contract
              with the Singapore Table Tennis Association and went to work in
              Indonesia instead.
              <br> <br> The sports award panel was unable to consider him for the award as the Singapore Table Tennis Association had not nominated him.
              <br> <br> "We do have to take into consideration the views of the sports associations when it comes to these nominations," Teo said.
              <br> <br> "Eventually, whether a person is nominated or not nominated, the sports association has to take responsibility."
              <br> <br> The Singapore Table Tennis Association said the decision not to nominate Liu had been made by an in-house committee.
              <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">"The
              committee felt that result was one thing, but for Coach of the Year
              award, we expect much more. Coach of the Year must naturally be well
              respected by all the players of the team," president of the association
              Lee Bee Wah said.</span></span> <br> <br> Ten-pin bowler Jasmine Yeong-Nathan was named Sportswoman of the Year,
              pipping two former multiple winners -- swimmer Tao Li and national
              table tennis player Li Jiawei.
              <br> <br>Li did not go unrecognised, though, and together with Wang Yuegu,
              Feng Tianwei and Sun Beibei was crowned Team of the Year having won
              Olympic silver at the Beijing Games.
