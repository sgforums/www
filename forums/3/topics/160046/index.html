Money ALONE does not buy you success, unless you consider Mourinho is a good buy, but money TOGETHER with a good board of directors, well run management and a brilliant manager does bring success. Maybe you can say with money you can buy the managers and the director of soccer, coachs etc, not entirely true, look at valencia, depor, they are well run clubs evnthough they dont have the financial power of Chelsea, they did employed wonderful managers like Benitez, Cuper before and did well, money does make life easier, but it is by no means with money ALONE you can win things.<br><br>Soccer consists of many elements, you guys have underestimated the game by saying money ALONE is enough. Real Madrid is one fine example, if you look at the players one by one, no team in the WORLD not even CHELSEA can compete with the galaticos, but still they havent won any trophies for two seasons already. There are alot of things going on behind a club and how the way it is run or managed.<br><br>Money + lousy manager (lousy club management) = A bunch of World Class players (galaticos) running around like headless chickens. Clubs: Real Madrid CF, Inter Milan (no offense real and inter fans, i am not looking to insult). Chelsea under Claudio Ranieri, yes ranieri is a good guy, but being a good guy and winning things is a completely different thing. Finishing second or coming close to winning trohies under ranieri is just not good enough consider the fact that a sugar daddy is supporting the club and that so many people expected them to buy the title etc...<br><br>No Money + World Class manager = The team can exceed expectations, maybe win a cup or two, but their progress will be limited when it comes to competing with the giants of european football.<br><br>Money + World Class manager = Success. Sometimes even money + world class managers may not gurantee success.<br><br>Chelsea no doubt have a filthy rich sugar daddy who can let you buy any players you want, but without a sound behind the back management and a ARROGANT but good manager like Mourinho, success does not comes so easily. Give credit when its due, you people may hate Mourinho for his arrogance, or may envy Chelsea for thier sugar daddy, or be jealous of their recent dominance and success, but i am sure deep inside all of you, you guys knows that its more than just MONEY ALONE that is making Chelsea so strong nowadays. You guys just dont want to admit it openly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
