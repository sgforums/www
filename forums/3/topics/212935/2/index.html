But i can see in the last match, his skills had not deserted him, as he smash a shot against the bar from a tight angle. JM better groom him well now or else SWP will never fufill his potential.</div>

The problem with him now is that he lacks self confident.

The problem with him now is that he lacks self confident. They shall allow him to play few games in a row n if he really does not fit in the chelsea team just transfer list him. its gd for him n the team.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>ppl know his style too well liao. when ronaldo first came, he's stepovers made every defender marking him look like a fool, but now alot of defenders seems to find out the way to tackle him already. isn't it the same?</div>

Yes rooney sux now but dun forget hes nv a natural goalscorer, he is more of a young paul scholes who likes to play in the  'hole'.<br><br>Its even more funny u say yakubu is a 1 season wonder, look at his goal scoring record ! He was portsmouth top scorer everyseason if i m not wrong.</div>
