            <div class='col-md body'>i won't exactly say who will win as it's pretty much open at the moment. however, i do think of all the big clubs, chelsea's players are quite pro. no off-field crap like visiting old prostitutes, holding out signing new contracts, approaching other clubs, throw tantrums want to go then don't want to go. i'm not sure why mourhino is picked but fergie is no saint. i doubt anyone in the right mind would kick his player in the face. wenger is a good one to nurture talent but i doubt his tactical ability of late. they play fancy but when it comes to the crunch, they seem to falter against the 'thinking' clubs of europe. chelsea problems continue to be drogba, for a striker who gets into very good positions in almost every game, the goal posts just don't seem wide enough for him..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>With the ridiculous amount of quality at its disposal, Chelsea has got to be favorites.</strong><br><br>Viera's sale will affect Arsenal's title credentials. Fabregas is gold at his age but I'm not sure if he can be relied upon 38 games a season to deliver. Hleb is promising but he is'nt quite the same player as Viera was for Arsenal. <strong>Arsenal will continue to dominate against most teams at home but against the bigger teams, they might struggle.</strong> 2 matches against Chelsea, 2 defeats.<br><br>Liverpool will try as always, but the lack of quality will tell at the end.They still rely too much on their skipper and the lack of service on the flanks to the strikers needs to be addressed. Defensively, there is'nt enough cover for the 2 central defenders. <strong>Liverpool will continue to struggle away from home against the lesser teams.</strong><br><br>Now, good old <strong>Manchester United.</strong> I feel <strong>they'll pose the biggest threat to Chelsea winning the title.</strong> Fergie has bought well this pre season. Ed Van der Sar and Park Ji Sung could turn out to be the best buys of the season. They've managed to grind out very good results so far.<br><br>As in every season, they'll be the outsiders, dark horses, whatever you call it. Last season we saw Everton and Bolton pushing hard. This year, <strong>Spurs</strong> seem to be a different team altogether.Under the management of Martin Jol, they have become a better team. Edgar Davids was a shrewd buy and  the "Buy English" policy is starting to pay dividends.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I putting my bet on Chelsea and Man U... They still gt some strength to fight for tis title... Tottenham not to be look down at, they gt a chance if they fight hard... Well... Arsenal tink is out of the game. Their power midfield is gone... so are their defense, especially if any defender gt injured. Sendoros definitely nt the best sub... Haiz...</div>

Arsenal Racist? How can you say that? Their captians all FRENCHMAN( not franceman) probably because they are more capable to lead. U can't deny that Henry and viera can lead well!Too much mind games? i Believe man u is responsible for a fair share of mind games too! The liverpool part is the most outrageous! you think this three guys very "heavenly" isit? Give some RESPECT for liverpool and their fans!<br><br>Manchester United has never been a consistant team since a yr after the treble, you can't deny that. However their form this season looks considerably better. They might pose a threat to chelsea if they are able to pull themselves together. BTW , losing a single match( ARENAL AND CHELSEA) does not determine everything........The ball is round, anything can happen.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Here's how i feel about season 2005/06.<br><br>Championship contenders:<br><br>No.1 contender is definitely... Chelsea. They have so many talents available that they have at least 2 internationals playing in the same position. In fact the amount of talent in the squad could work against Mourinho at the same time as he need to keep all his stars happy by giving them adequate playing time. That would mean rotating the squad, which is not Mourinho's speciality. In fact when he first came to Chelsea, it was revealed that his preferred squad size is around 18. The season has just kicked off and alraedy 2 of his stars, Carvalho and Robben, have expressed unhappiness. I foresee Crespo would be next if he continues to warm the bench.<br>This yr Chelsea kicked off the season just as they did last term, with cautious 4-5-1 approach, grinding out 1-0 wins and keeping clean sheets along the way. If nothing goes wrong, they should be challenging on all fronts again this time round.<br><br>Manchester united is the dark horse to the championship this year. Having not won it for 2 yrs in a row, they would be hungrier than ever, and they have shown that attitude on the field in the opening games so far. In fact they have matched Chelsea's result with a 100% record and 0 goals conceded. The team looks very balanced, with a dangerous 3-pronged attacking trio of RVN, Rooney and Ronaldo. Plenty of experience in midfield in Giggs, Scholes and Keane. Fletcher should be very involved this season and ready to make the big stage on a regular basis. Park JS is a useful addition. Defence has improved tremendously over the past 2 yrs, with the addition of world's most expensive centre half Ferdinand. Van der Sar is the goalie just what Fergie's looking for. Experienced, steady, and consistent. They could nick it from Chelsea if they can improve on consistency in the league, which they sorely lack last term.<br><br>Arsenal? Sadly, end of an era for them. The power has shifted...<br><br>Champions League hopefuls:<br><br>Liverpool. A distrastrous run of league results last term and they still managed to get into the CL. Speaks alot about the quality of compeition in the EPL, outside the top 3 that is. Pool has got a big squad, solid central midfielders and hard tackling defenders, led by Jamie Carragher. However their biggest weaknesses are<br>- lack of creative players (Luis Garcia is their best player in that aspect; Kewell seemed dead and uninterested since his move from Leeds, a pale shadow of his glory Leeds days; Smicer is at best a fringe squad player)<br>- over reliance on Gerard; If he moves to join the galaticos at Real or Chelsea, Pool is dead, simple as that<br>- lack of consistent goalscorer since Owen left; A number of top quality strikers with big reputations at previous clubs has come and failed to impress, Cisse, Morientes, El Hadji Djiouf, Baros, (Crouch?)... the list goes on.<br><br>Middlesboro. Steve mcClaren has a quality squad at his disposal. Despite the poor start, they should have quite a good chance to make it to top five or six this year. Main rival for Liverpool to take 4th place.<br><br>UEFA cup hopefuls:<br><br>Tottenham. Lets see how far Martin Jol can lead Spurs in terms of league finish. If my memory serves me correctly, Spurs' best league finish over the last decade is 7th during jurgen klinnsmann's first spell at the club, during which they qualified for the uefa cup.<br><br>Newcastle. Heads will roll if they dont make it.<br><br>Bolton. Has been consistently close for the past few seasons.<br><br>Charlton. Can Curbishly survive the usual late season slump this time round to make it to Europe finally?<br><br>Man City. Narrowly missed out last term due to Robbie fowler's last day penalty miss against Boro. With 'Psycho' Stuart Pearce in charge, City have a good chance of improving on last term's finishing.<br><br>Relegation:<br>The most interesting region of competition, in my opinion, for this season  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>So many likely candidates for 3 places... Sunderland, portsmouth, wigan, Blackburn, Everton (yes, last season's CL qualifier Everton!), West Brom, and Fulham. All of them are equally poor!<br></div>
