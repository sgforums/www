Wes Brown has been guilty of ball-watching.<br><br>On top of that, Fergie doesn't seem to have a replacement. He could try John O'Shea or Gabriel Heinze but neither is the best solution.<br><br>At Fratton Park, the Red Devils rested Ryan Giggs ahead of the Roma clash but the plan backfired when his stand-in Kieran Richardson gave away a needless opening goal to Pompey.<br><br>In contrast, Roma rested seven regulars in anticipation of their visit to Old Trafford.<br><br>When they played Catania away over the weekend, Luciano Spalletti could afford to rest Francesco Totti, Daniele De Rossi, Taddei, Mancini, Doni, Christian Panucci and Christian Chivu to keep them fresh.<br><br>Despite that, Roma still managed to win 2-0. Their confidence is sky-high and they will travel to England with no fears.<br><br>That should convince Fergie to give up on the Champions League in order to save his Premiership season.<br><br>Man U still has Chelsea to play in May and their squad can barely cope with fighting in three competitions. That's how thin his squad is now.<br><br>The Red Devils have depended too much on a few key players and with Paul Scholes suspended, Vidic and Gary Neville injured, they will look to Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo to deliver.<br><br>At least, Ferguson should state what is his priority - and I suspect it's the Premiership - and focus entirely on it.<br><br>That's better than ending up empty-handed if he stretches his players too far. If he gives up on Europe, at least he can fully concentrate on beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge next month.<br><br>UPHILL TASK<br><br>Until then, Man U have an uphill task against Roma.<br><br>In Totti, the Serie A side have a coach on the pitch. The skipper has a great working relationship with Spalletti.<br><br>The coach convinced his playmaker that he should take a break from the national team. As a result, Totti is having a tremendous season so far.<br><br>If Fergie is to stand a chance, he will have to look for the 12th Man.<br><br>Old Trafford has a capacity of 76,000 and it is time for the fans to stand up and be counted.<br><br>But I still have my doubts on Man U's chances against Roma.<br><br>They should just forget about the Treble and just gun for the Premiership instead. The FA Cup would be a bonus.<br><br>If Fergie is sensible about his squad's lack of depth, he would know he has to give the Champions League up. His days in Europe are numbered.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Paijan punditry can be absolute rubbish at times. It is so much rubbish that I'm wondering if he's been misquoted for the sensationalism of his comments. Sure, at times he does give rare flashes of brilliance in his insight, but it is so rare that when I see his views, I take it with a ton of salt.<br><br>This is not the first time that he's gone critizing some manager, player or club and then praised them the next day, or vice versa. Seriously though, if those were his raw, actual views, won't TNP be better off just asking the man on the street?</div>
