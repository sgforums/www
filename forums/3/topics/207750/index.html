            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Lee rejects Roma to stay at Spurs. Even S Korean player don't want to play in Italian League... What is happening to Serial A?</strong><br><br>Tottenham defender Lee Young-Pyo's move to AS Roma is off after he opted to stay with Spurs.<br><br>Roma have been long-time admirers of the 29-year-old and Lee's agents claimed a deal was near to completion.<br><br>Any move to Rome for the South Korean international is now unlikely to happen before Thursday's transfer deadline.<br><br>Lee's agents said:"We held negotiations with AS Roma and neared the final stages of a deal but the signing was called off for personal reasons."<br><br>Earlier, the Global Sports and Entertainment Network had claimed: "Tottenham and AS Roma have agreed in principle to the transfer of Lee Young-Pyo.<br><br>"The deal as almost sealed, as the only remaining procedure is the player's decision."<br><br>Lee joined from PSV Eindhoven last August for an undisclosed fee and has made 34 appearances for Spurs.<br><br>He played at the 2002 and 2006 World Cups and spent three years at PSV where he followed his former national team manager Guus Hiddink.<br><br>Roma are looking for a left-back as a replacement for Argentina international Leandro Cufre, who joined Monaco on Tuesday.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nothing is wrong.<br><br>Probably fallout from Ahn Jung Hwang's previous incident with Perugia has prompted all Koreans to steer clear of filthy italians.<br><br>Then again, maybe spurs is really better...can't say i blame Lee for turning down the chance to move to one of the continent's most racist and demanding fanclub.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But the thing is Spurs don't really want him anymore and were willing to let him go. They already have a replacement for him so he will probably be spending more time on the bench than if he had gone to AS Roma.<br><br>Moreover, he will be a first team player at AS Roma and they are also in the champions League this year. Seems like he will have to get use to the bench but Spurs will be stuck with him for another 2, 3 yrs before his contract runs out.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I thought he did pretty well for spurs, being a natural left-footer but having to play on the right wing. It's a pity Spurs just wants to milk him for his marketing worth and then dump him after... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
