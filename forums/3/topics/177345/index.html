            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Barca cry foul over Chelsea's rough pitch</strong><br><br>Spaniards suspect a ploy by Mourinho to sabotage ground play in next week's<br><br>Feb 15, 2006<br>The Straits Times<br><br>LONDON - A WEEK ahead of their mouth-watering Champions League clash, Barcelona are said to have already accused Chelsea of 'dirty tricks'.<br><br>The Spanish champions are convinced that Chelsea have deliberately let the condition of their pitch deteriorate to hinder Barca's terrestrial game, The Guardian reported. Last season, Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho did seem to use every trick in the book to mastermind a memorable 5-4 (on aggregate) victory over the Spanish side in the European competition.<br><br>First he questioned the managerial credentials of his Barcelona counterpart Frank Rijkaard, before the first leg. And then he accused the former Holland international of trying to influence Swedish referee Anders Frisk during the game.<br><br>Now Barcelona fear that the supreme strategist may be at it again.<br><br>'We know what Chelsea have done and why,' a Barcelona source told The Times. 'It's because they know we like to play the ball on the floor and they are just an aerial side.'<br><br>Chelsea deny any wrongdoing. They acknowledge that their turf is not in the best of condition, but insist it has nothing to do with Barcelona.<br><br>A Chelsea spokesman told Soccernet.com: 'We are looking at the long term and want to give next season's pitch every chance.<br><br>'We have always had problems with the pitch.<br><br>'In the past, we generally re-lay once during the season and then reseed in the summer.<br><br>'But that creates a vicious circle as it makes it harder for the pitch to bed down in the summer.'<br><br>However, it is the first time in four years that they have opted not to lay fresh turf in mid-season, a decision that has been noted in Catalonia.<br><br>Barcelona defender Silvinho, who used to play for Arsenal, confirmed that Chelsea's poor pitch was the talk of the Barcelona dressing-room.<br><br>He said: 'I played two years in England and got used to this. But I've heard that the conditions of their pitch are even worse than they used to be.<br><br>'It doesn't surprise me because it's always cold in England and they don't stop at Christmas.<br><br>'I'm not going to say they've done it because they're playing us, but that is the culture in English football.<br><br>'We have to accept the situation and go out and play there whatever the pitch is like.'<br><br>Mourinho is adamant that the surface is the same for both teams, while John Terry, his captain, insists that the pitch does not inhibit passing football.<br><br>Said Terry: 'The pitch isn't actually that bad.<br><br>'You've got to be a bit more careful with your touch as the bounce is sometimes uneven, but it doesn't stop us playing our football.<br><br>'With the quality we've got in the side, that's our strength, getting the ball down and playing.'<br><br>Barcelona's complaints are likely to herald three weeks of sniping before the argument is finally settled on the new Nou Camp pitch on March 7, the date of the second leg.<br><br>Barcelona, though, will not be happy with reports coming out of England that say Chelsea are interested in signing their forward Samuel Eto'o.<br><br>A scout was sent to the African Nations Cup to observe the Cameroon striker, a two-time African Footballer of the Year.<br><br>Chelsea are reportedly prepared to pay Â£30 million (S$85 million) to lure the striker to Stamford Bridge.<br><br>His Camp Nou salary of 87,000 euros (S$168,000) a week is less than half what teammate Ronaldinho earns, so he may be tempted if Chelsea offer more.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Barca man Motta expects Chelsea tricks<br><br>MADRID, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Barcelona midfielder Thiago Motta expects Chelsea to have some tricks up their sleeves in the first leg of the Champions League knockout tie on Wednesday.<br><br>The Brazilian says calmness under pressure will be of crucial importance if Barca are to avenge their 5-4 aggregate defeat of last year and make it into the quarter-finals.<br><br>'We have to keep cool because with such an evenly balanced tie the team that have their heads clear will have an advantage,' Motta was quoted as saying in Spanish daily Sport on Thursday.<br><br>'There are bound to be some tricks in store for us but we have to stay cooler than them. The team that remains the calmest will win though and I hope that it is us.'<br><br>Last season Chelsea were charged with bringing the game into disrepute after alleging that Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard had visited the Swedish referee Andres Frisk at halftime during the first leg of their tie at the Nou Camp.<br><br>UEFA accused Chelsea of making false declarations and 'deliberately creating a poisoned and negative ambience' after they refused to attend a post-match news conference and submitted a report detailing their allegations.<br><br>Chelsea were fined 75,000 Swiss francs ($57,080) and coach Jose Mourinho 20,000 Swiss francs as well as being handed a two-match touchline ban.<br><br>Motta, who has returned from a cartilage injury, said he was unworried by reports in the Spanish media that Chelsea had deliberately allowed their Stamford Bridge pitch to deteriorate to hinder Barca's fluent passing game.<br><br>'That's their choice,' he said. 'We have taken a totally different option (Barca have re-turfed the Nou Camp ready for the return leg) and they could complain about that.<br><br>'It will affect us because it is a difficult ground to play at because the crowd are so close and the grass is in bad shape, but in a tie like this each team will do whatever's best for them. We just have to adapt.'<br></div>

Chelsea believe the newspaper's reference to "the incidents of last year" is an attempt to manipulate the European governing body's thinking.<br><br>"Such reports are a cause for concern," said a Chelsea spokesman. "We are confident that the referee's selection will be unaffected by the events of last year."<br><br>The article refers to the retirement of Anders Frisk following alleged death threats after he sent off Didier Drogba in the first leg. It also claimed that Pierluigi Collina's selection for the return leg had favoured Chelsea. Collina has also retired<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kezman backs Mourinho to plot Barca's downfall<br><br>MADRID, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Former Chelsea striker Mateja Kezman expects Jose Mourinho's mind games and meticulous planning to give them the edge over Barcelona in their Champions League last 16 tie next week.<br><br>'Mourinho is the greatest coach I've ever met,' Kezman told Reuters. 'He's a very strong tactician. He has a team of seven people who work with him and he prepares for games so well it's incredible.<br><br>'I think Chelsea will win because they play a different kind of game to Barcelona, more varied, which makes them very difficult to beat.'<br><br>The Serbia &amp; Montenegro international, who left Stamford Bridge to join Primera Liga club Atletico Madrid, praised his former boss despite not having had the most comfortable of relationships with him in his year in England.<br><br>'With the media he is like an actor sometimes, from a good film not a poor one, but he's also a very difficult character,' Kezman continued.<br><br>'We had a tough relationship. Our characters are similar and I was unhappy about being on the bench, but I learned a lot from him tactically and mentally. I really respect him.'<br><br>Of his former team mates Kezman singled out captain John Terry as the principal character in Chelsea's dressing room.<br><br>'Terry is a great leader and a fantastic person on and off the pitch. He talks to everyone and pushes the whole side,' he said.'<br><br>Atletico's offer to take him to Spain last June, however, provided the former PSV Eindhoven player with the perfect chance to get his career back on track.<br><br>'English football is unique. It is more about fighting spirit and kick and rush. In Spain and Holland they like to play more, hold possession and play a tactical game which suits me better.<br><br>'I didn't like living in London, either. The city is so big and crowded, and it is always raining. After about three months there I decided I wanted to leave. My family was also very unhappy and my wife spent most of the time in Serbia.<br><br>'But it was a fantastic experience in England with the biggest club in the world at present.<br><br>'Now my family and I are very happy in Spain. We love the people, the city, the weather, and the way of life here. Unlike England and Holland everyone is very open and friendly here, more like my home country.'<br><br>Although pleased with his change to the Spanish capital he admits it has been a rough ride in his first season.<br><br>Reserve team coach Pepe Murcia stepped up to replace Carlos Bianchi last month after a run of poor results and the change has galvanised a side that was struggling.<br><br>They have now won four Primera Liga games on the trot to move up to ninth in the table, six points off the European places.<br><br>'The new coach is very ambitious and works more on the tactics. He makes everything a lot more fun and talks to us a lot more. Bianchi didn't do that. Maybe football is different in Argentina,' Kezman said.<br><br>'I have scored seven goals in about 17 games so am pleased with my work so far. I would like to stay here to the end of my football career and play in Europe with Atletico. The club and the people deserve it.'<br><br>SPANISH BECKHAM<br><br>Hailed as one of Atletico's star signings last summer he was never likely to challenge Spain striker Fernando Torres in the popularity stakes at the Vicente Calderon.<br><br>The 21-year-old former youth teamer has been the club's leading scorer for the last three seasons.<br><br>'Torres is a great guy and a great talent. He's still very young but everyone is talking about him and he's very expensive,' Kezman said.<br><br>'He's great to play with, very quick and very strong, which gives me space. We play well together and are good friends off the pitch as well.'<br><br>With Chelsea reportedly one of a number of clubs interested in Torres, Kezman had words of warning for his colleague if he considered swapping the Calderon for Stamford Bridge.<br><br>'He would have to be prepared to sit on the bench sometimes, and to play in a rotation system,' he said. 'Mourinho treats everyone the same.<br><br>'You have to be a bit special but without an ego. In Spain Torres is a big star like David Beckham is in England. So maybe it would be difficult for him.<br><br>'He always asks me about English football, the different clubs and so on, but if a big offer came in from Chelsea then he would have to bare this in mind.'<br></div>

No skilful players? Just players who kick the ball and run?<br><br>"Because we have no technical players we need a potato field, so we play on a potato field."<br><br>Mourinho said that Chelsea had done all they could to keep the pitch in good condition.<br><br>"Our pitch is not good," he added. "You don't need to tell us the pitch is not good.<br><br>"London does not have Mediterranean weather. Stamford Bridge is not an open pitch. It doesn't see the sun often.<br><br>"But it's not possible to improve. The only thing we can do is take care of it the best we can.<br><br>"This season we have not had one single training session at Stamford Bridge apart from one for photos and an open day for supporters.<br><br>"We were afraid to change the pitch because last season when we did it we had some problems, especially the Scott Parker problem, where there was a very clear relationship between the injury and the pitch."<br><br>And Mourinho hinted that Barcelona were not in a position to talk about the condition of other team's pitches.<br><br>"Maybe you should ask Barcelona why they have so many injuries," he said.<br><br>"They have a lot of knee problems. Maybe their pitch is too good."<br></div>

That remains to be seen ah. And barcelona is quite reliant on ronaldinho if you've been watching la liga recently you'd have realized that.<br><br>But i do believe one player who can make a difference will be Leo Messi.
