            <div class='col-md body'>Soccernet : Mourinho offers Barca chance to escape Bridge pitch<br><br>Jose Mourinho has offered Barcelona the use of Chelsea's training pitches if they don't like the surface at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Barcelona are expected in London today ahead of Wednesday's European showdown with the Premiership champions.<br><br>The Catalans have been grumbling about the state of Chelsea's pitch and fear it could hinder their flowing football.<br><br>But the Blues boss invited them to give up their option of training at Stamford Bridge on the day before the game and use Chelsea's training base in Surrey instead.<br><br>Mourinho said: 'If Barcelona want to train at our training centre on Tuesday to give us more time to work on the pitch, the offer is there.<br><br>'The training the day before a game is nothing. It's just to get used to the ball.<br><br>'If they want to train at our training centre we'd be very pleased for them to go there.'<br><br>The Stamford Bridge pitch took a battering from heavy rain yesterday, as Chelsea beat Colchester in the FA Cup, but Mourinho insisted the surface was not as bad as it looked.<br><br>He said: 'Sometimes you see beautiful people with no brains. Sometimes you have ugly people who are intelligent, like scientists.<br><br>'Our pitch is a bit like that. From the top it's a disgrace but the ball rolls at normal speed.'<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Fair N Square Competition !</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mourinho is Chelsea's best player, claims Deco<br><br>MADRID, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Coach Jose Mourinho is Chelsea's best player and has imprinted his personality on every member of his squad, according to Barcelona midfielder Deco.<br><br>'Every team is a reflection of their coach and Chelsea have taken on board Mourinho's mentality, a winning mentality of working hard and fighting for everything,' the Portugal international told the Barcelona website on Monday.<br><br>Chelsea host Barcelona, whom they beat at the same stage in last season's competition, in the first leg of their Champions League knockout tie at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.<br><br>'They have got some great players, but Chelsea's strength lies in their team, the way they work together and in their winning mentality,' added Deco.<br><br>'I think Chelsea's best player is Mourinho because he has known how to ensure that his team fights to the death. Mourinho has given Chelsea and its players, victories and trophies that they hadn't experienced before he arrived.'<br><br>Deco, who was a key member of Mourinho's Porto side when they won the UEFA Cup and the Champions League in 2003 and 2004, said that Barca were capable of getting one over his former mentor this time round.<br><br>'I think we are in very good form and we are a more mature side than last year.<br><br>'Last time we were better than Chelsea but that didn't do us any good because we lost, but since then we have won the Spanish championship and have the same core of players and so we should have the right attitude.<br><br>'We now want to win the Champions League and to do that we have to beat Chelsea. If we can win there we will settle the tie.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ronaldinho on revenge mission against Chelsea<br><br>Barcelona striker Ronaldinho is still tormented by the Champions League defeat by Chelsea a year ago and is determined to get his revenge when the big guns meet this week.<br><br>'I still have images in my head of when the game finished in London and we were out. I do not want this to happen again this year,' said the Brazilian.<br><br>He also admitted that victory in the match on Wednesday was a matter of Spanish national pride.<br><br>'I know everyone is talking about this match, it is the kind of event which stirs a country. We represent Spain so we aim to do well and we are only thinking about victory,' he said.<br><br>'The game in London will be vital and the objective will be to get a good result so we do not suffer in the Nou Camp.'<br><br>Chelsea defender John Terry has claimed he plans to give Ronaldinho some rough treatment but the Brazilian is unconcerned.<br><br>'This does not bother me. I am training as much as I can so I can escape any markers. The only thing that interests me is to play at my best and help the team,' said the 25-year-old.<br><br>'I respect the Chelsea defence but I am not worried or scared,' he added. 'We have to try to forget the past - we committed errors and we will aim not to repeat them.<br><br>'One of the key things is to play our own football and to play how we know. On top of this to have the second game at the Nou Camp is an advantage we have to make the most of.'<br><br>The FIFA World Player of the Year also played down the poor quality of the Stamford Bridge pitch:<br><br>'We know it is bad but it will be the same for both teams. It does not worry me.'<br></div>
