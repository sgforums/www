Because, well, if the salary is controlled, clubs may just offer alternative arrangement to provide a monetarily more viable option for the players. This can be done, by giving the players playing bonuses, more signing on fees and various other means. hence the salary cap would just lead to exploitations of loopholes, which may be impossible to policve, especially, since..even if the bonuses and signing on fees  are curbed, nothing can be done to stop a club to pay a player's uncle lots of money for consulation fee or any other frivolous costs which may replace the player payment.<br><br>Hence, it would not really work for the footballers ah.but i have to agree these guys are waaaay overpaid!</div>
