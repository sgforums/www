Even if Materrazzi insulted his mother and sister (if he really did cos Materazzi denied he said anything abt his mother), on the football field, it is common. You can make a complaint later but to take matters into your own hand, you think people will let you off just becos you are a supposed saviour of France?<br><br>I feel Materazzi has done nothing wrong as his insult did not border on discrimination of any kind although he needs to be warned that on his part, he needs to keep his mouth shut some times.</div>

Even if Materrazzi insulted his mother and sister (if he really did cos Materazzi denied he said anything abt his mother), on the football field, it is common. You can make a complaint later but to take matters into your own hand, you think people will let you off just becos you are a supposed saviour of France?<br><br></div></blockquote>This is a tad biased, ain't it? No disrespect, but what business is it of yours to tell him how he should react <strong>so long as he is prepared to live with the consequences of his action</strong>? It might not be serious to you, what makes you think those comments aren't serious to him? I mean, you could be an Atheist and make religions the butt of all your jokes and find it inoffensive, but what makes you think people who had a religion wouldn't find it blasphemous? While I do not condone his behaviour and certainly do not think his sending off was unjustified(I'd think it unjustified <strong>if and only if</strong> the sending off had come about because the fourth official had the benefit of a video replay in that particular instance, which would have compromised the integrity of the game and the consistency of how justice is applied in the game), I certainly don't find it hard to understand even the most gifted footballer on the planet is entitled to possess the same emotions as any other mortal.<br><br>At the end of the day, you've got to remember he ain't a high-ranking comrade in a Communist regime who could dish out death penalties to dissidents at will or some corrupt Fascists who has the power of a politicised Judiciary to sue everyone who crosses them for their personal interests. Either way, he has already paid the price IMO - be it not winning the World Cup, getting the red card or simply seeing his career end in such unglamorous fashion - and ultimately, it's only his conscience which he has to live with. Judging by a transcript of the interview with Canal Plus, I certainly don't think he has too many regrets about what he did to Materazzi even 3 days after the incident...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
