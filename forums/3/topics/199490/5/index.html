There are many times where Materazzi keep pulling Zidane's shirt. Of course this is normal in football. But in  such a stressful 2 hour, and you keep getting a joker to disturb you, I don't blame Zidane at all for saying "If you like my jersey so much, I can give it to you after the match."<br>However, theres no excuse for Materazzi to allow the conversation to lead to rasicm insults <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
