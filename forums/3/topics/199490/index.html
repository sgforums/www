            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly, Zidane would not have made much of a difference anyway in the penalty shootout. Treziguet would still have been one of the penalty takers.<br><br>However, who's to say that he might not have scored or set up another goal in the remaining minutes of extra time? He did, after all, nearly scored with a great header which would have beaten almost any 'keeper whose name isn't Buffon.<br><br>I think it's sad that his last memory of being in the World Cup is to be instantly sent off for headbutting an opponent. Sadly, he totally deserved that red card - heck, if this was the first round, chances are that he would have been banned for several matches.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even if Materazzi had taunted him, it by no means excuses Zidane's behaviour. If Zidane had wanted to get pissed, then he should have just glared at him and walked away. He can always complain to FIFA's disciplinary board after that.

            <div class='col-md body'>Zidane's Penchant For The Ridiculous Red<br><br>In the light of Zidane's head-butt, Goal.com recalls some of the previous occasions when the legend saw red along similar lines.<br><br>A true footballing legend, it seems Zidane has always had a penchant for red cards, particularly over incidents off the ball.<br><br>Here are a few which immediately spring to mind.<br><br>World Cup 1998 (vs. Saudi Arabia)<br>(Stamping)<br><br>What better place to start than the competition that made him!<br><br>It was a first round match against minnows Saudi Arabia, which could be why it faded from memory sooner than this one will. Besides, he was hardly the icon that he is now.<br><br>The act itself was an incident which took place off the ball, as he retaliated in anger by stamping on Saudi skipper Fuad Amin.<br><br>He was immediately sent of by the referee, with twenty minutes left on the clock, and subsequently handed a two match suspension.<br><br>However, unlike this time, that was a match France won at a canter. Also unlike this time, he would get a chance to redeem himself.<br><br>And the redemption couldn't have been better, with some fabulous displays to guide France to their first World Cup, including a brace in the 3-0 win over Brazil in the final.<br><br>However, not all in the Saudi Arabia camp were happy with the regulation two match suspension that he had received, for the very deliberate stamp.<br><br>Champions League 2000-01 (vs. Deportivo and vs. Hamburg)<br>(Head-butting)<br><br>He had just won the European Championships with France that summer, and was one of the favourites to win the World Player of the Year award again, after 1998. Indeed, one of the toasts of world football!<br><br>However, September and October saw him pick up consecutive red cards for Juventus in the Champions League, either side of the suspension. The second one, against Hamburg in October, becomes particularly relevant now.<br><br>Zidane got a direct red, for another incident which had little to do with the ball. His offence? A head-butt on Jochen Keintz!<br><br>So outrageously violent was the head-butt, that he was immediately handed a five match ban by Uefa. Incidentally, it was also his tenth career red card.<br><br>That, after he had only just returned from suspension following his ninth, picked up against Deportivo la Coruna, in the same competition a month earlier<br><br>He went on to win the World Player of the Year award just a couple of month later, while still suspended from Champions League action for his club, in what received heavy criticism from certain quarters.<br><br>Copa del Rey 2003-04 (vs. Sevilla)<br>(Slapping)<br><br>In February 2004, Sevilla came to El Bernabeu for the second leg of the 'Cup' semi-final, with Real Madrid favourites thanks to a 2-0 win in the first leg.<br><br>However, Zidane lost his head following a challenge and slapped Sevilla defender Pablo Alfaro smack in the face. He was duly sent off, and Real Madrid seemed to be all at sea, as Sevilla had already scored once.<br><br>But the visitors also had Javi Navarro sent off, and Real somehow managed to restrict them to a 1-0 win, thereby qualifying for the final on aggregate.<br><br>Primera Liga 2003-04 (vs. Deportivo)<br>(Kicking)<br><br>Deportivo certainly seem to know how to get the worst out of Zidane. It was May, with the League title on the line. Valencia had just pushed Real Madrid into second place by a solitary point, and with four matches left, there was everything to play for. A win was absolutely crucial to keep the pressure on Valencia, who were to play Real Betis the next day.<br><br>Real had only recently lost the Copa del Rey final to Zaragoza, and the Champions League semi-final to Juventus, as Carlos Quieroz's dreams of a treble had come crashing down. The League was their only chance to save face, as they headed to the Riazor.<br><br>Deportivo took the lead much against the run of play through a precise Diego Tristan strike, from their first real attack in thirty minutes. Zidane was growing particularly flustered with some of his tussles with Djalminha, and picked up an unnecessary yellow before the break.<br><br>He seemed to come out fired up for the second half. Unfortunately, it was all misdirected into a merciless chop on Djalminha, with no chance at the ball, barely four minutes into the half.<br><br>Real were left to make do with ten men, in one of their most crucial games of the season, and were sent home with a 2-0 mauling.<br><br>Valencia won the next day to get a four point lead, while Real Madrid collapsed under the defeat, eventually finishing fourth, after failing to pick up even a single point from the final three games.<br><br>Verdict<br><br>There is no doubting that 'Zizou' has been one of the best players to ever step onto the pitch. World Cup, European Championship, Champions League, domestic titles in Spain and Italy, and individual accolades say it all.<br><br>But all that said, he has let his temper run away from him a little too often, with around 20 career red cards, and quite a few very ugly ones. Two direct red cards in World Cups, not due to rash tackles, or unintentional elbows, but cynical retaliatory gestures, tell their own story.<br><br>His performances with the ball have helped push those moments of indiscretion into oblivion ever so often. Which is why this one could linger for a while!<br><br>And football is most defenitely worse for it, no matter whom you support!<br><br>Abhishek Thakur (Goal.com Correspondent)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All in all, Zidane still remains as the greatest footballer of the modern era. And goes to proves that for all his shyness, super proffesionalism, a family man, a great sportsman, he is still a human afterall.<br><br>No matter how rasict or foul mouthed Materazzi was, reaction like this should never be allowed to appear on TV. Millions of people were watching and that includes children, juveniles, kids.<br><br>It was indeed a sad sad way to bow out of the WC as well as from football. But his great service to the football world must not only be remembered for this moment of madness but also his great abilities on the pitch.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe it was simply your everyday opponents' conversation that went wrong?<br><br>Z: Stop grabbing my chest, Spaghetti-O, and gimme a break. It's my last World Cup. At least let me try to score another goal and be remembered in football history as an all time great who retired with a glorious bang.<br><br>M: I'd like to help you, Baguette, esp since my goal was quite a glorious header and yours was just a penalty earned by what looked like Malouda tripping over his own feet. But even if I leave you totally unmarked, it's unlikely you're going to be scoring another goal. If you could, you'd have done it way before extra time.<br><br>Z:  Let me show you what a real glorious full-blooded header should be like, you Italian Mafioso! ... whack ...<br><br>The rest ... football history made ...</div>
