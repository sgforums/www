              <p>With only two months to go to Singapore’s first ever Youth Olympic
              Games, the response from the ground remains lacklustre so far.</p>
              <p>As such, the PAP is spending taxpayers’ monies to promote YOG in the
              HDB heartlands. YOG banners have been put up across all estates in
              Singapore. Students are encouraged or coerced to attend the YOG matches.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, Hwi Yoh Community Centre at Serangoon North organized a
              basketball tournament and Olympic stalls to whip up a YOG frenzy for
              the residents, the Straits Times reported.</p>
              <p>The event was graced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong who exhorted
              Singaporeans to do their “part” to make the Games a success by “making
              the athletes feel welcome and giving them a memorable experience.”</p>
              <p>His latest call followed that of Minister of Youth, Community
              Development and Sports Dr Vivian Balakrishnan who urged Singaporeans to
              “rally” behind the YOG.</p>
              <p><em>“We need every Singaporean to understand that this is not just
              about sports or young people – it’s for all Singaporeans…..’All the
              effort that we invest in this will be wasted if every Singaporean
              doesn’t feel that this is a once-in-a-lifetime (event), that the
              Olympic flame is going to come to Singapore in such a close way and
              isn’t touched by it or affected by the Olympic spirit one way or
              another,”</em> he was quoted as saying in the Straits Times.</p>
              <p>Despite the massive efforts put in by the PAP, state media and other
              government agencies to promote the YOG, Singaporeans are lukewarm to it
              with many netizens viewing it as another PAP propaganda to promote
              itself.</p>

              <p>the stupid gahmen only know how to increase their pay but are not willing to use the money to help the poor , jobless , sick and broadcast world cup for free or subsidise 80% of it so as to allow everyone to enjoy watching  world class sporting events and not some low class YOG . What is the point of calling yourself a sports hub when it costs $90 to watch world cup?</p>
              <p>For the YOG part, I think teachers will be at the stadium to ''inspect'' the students and anyone caught playng PSP will have to attend detention class .Anyway ,this is nothing new as the SAF has always been making use of NSFs to show support for SAFFC in S. league games. It is all about WAYANG .</p>
