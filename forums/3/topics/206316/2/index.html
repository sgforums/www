            <div class='col-md body'>MADRID, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Arsenal forward Jose Antonio Reyes has said he is desperate to return to Spain and insists he will never play in England again.<br><br>The 22-year-old Spain international has been linked with moves to Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid, but Arsenal dismissed bids from the two Primera Liga clubs as too low.<br><br>'I've heard lots of rumours, but the one thing that is clear is that I want to leave London,' Reyes told Spanish sports daily Marca on Sunday.<br><br>'I want to come back to Spain. I will not play again in England.'<br><br>Real Madrid's interest faded when coach Fabio Capello said his number one priority was the recruitment of Mali midfielder Mahamadou Diarra, who signed last week.<br><br>City rivals Atletico made an estimated 12 million-euro ($15.33 million) bid for the former Sevilla player earlier this week, but Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger dismissed the offer as an 'insult'.<br><br>Reyes joined Arsenal from Sevilla for a club record fee of up to 17 million pounds ($32.15 million) in January 2004.<br><br>'There has been some talk about Atletico and they are constructing a strong team,' said Reyes. 'I just want to return. I would say yes to Atletico, yes to Real Madrid and yes to Sevilla.'<br><br>Reyes arrived in Seville yesterday ready to hook up with the rest of the Spain squad for their upcoming Euro 2008 qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Northern Ireland.<br><br>What an ungrateful player.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>JOSE REYES ended his Arsenal nightmare by trading places with Real MadridÂ’s Julio Â‘The BeastÂ’ Baptista last night.<br><br>The clubs agreed a season-long swap deal.<br><br>Reyes, 23, said: Â“The last few months have been f****d. Every player in the world would want to play for Real if given the chance and I feel the happiest man in the world.Â”<br><br>Gunners boss Arsene Wenger is hoping Brazil midfielder Baptista can settle in London better than Spanish winger Reyes. Arsenal will pick up BaptistaÂ’s Â£40,000-a-week wages, while Real will pay Reyes Â£35,000 a week.<br><br>Baptista, 24, passed a medical in London yesterday and now needs a work permit. He said: Â“They first started calling me The Beast in Seville because of my power and my strength.<br><br><strong>Its a loan deal and one year from now, they will have to settle it all over again. But Arsenal got the bad end of the deal it seems. Reyes costed $16.5m, Baptista $13.5m salary also more by $5,000 per week.<br><br>Another is A Cole and Gallas... Arsenal should have taken $20m instead of $5m with Gallas cos Gallas contract have only 9 months to go and they could have got him free instead of paying $15m for him and a high salary of $80,000 per week. Only Henry in the Arsenal team is making that kind of money after long years of service. What will the others think now?</strong></div>
