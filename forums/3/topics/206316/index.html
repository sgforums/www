            <div class='col-md body'>JOSE REYES has begged Real Madrid not to leave him stranded at Arsenal.<br><br>The wantaway winger, 23, is desperate for the Spaniards to up their Â£10million bid and make the Gunners sell.<br><br>His agent Jesus Rodriguez de Moya held talks with Bernabeu chiefs yesterday and pushed them to revive the deal. He said: Â“If all goes well, Reyes will move.<br><br>Â“Since he was 12 he always wanted to play for Real. But thereÂ’s never been an agreement. It was a love that stayed undeclared.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most of them demand high pay which Arsenal can't affort, not like Chelsea and Man U finance support is strong. Those who stay behind are not that greedy.<br>Many in the past who left Arsenal don't really made that far as they were in Arsenal. That's why Henry think best to stay same goes to Fabregas. And why Walcott choose Arsenal over Chelsea? Not everybody are looking on money alone. If you see the team they have now, most of them don't have a big name.<br><br>Infact, Arsenal make their money counts. It is Wenger vision that make the different on every players, and the belief they have to push them all the way to the UCL final. Now that they have the new stadium to boost their income, I can only see them improving.<br><br>If Reyes decide to go it is his personal problem, as for Cole he is making alot of stores which he didn't think back who made him famous?<br>How many players in chelsea can stay more than 2 season? And they are mostly condemn by Jose.<br><br>As for Man U, the king is still Alex. If the players don't listen to him out he goes</div>

So if they were to sell at $8m, they take that money and pay sevilla, they left nothing... and what happen to their first $10m?<br><br>Who would want this kind of stupid deal?<br><br>Reyes also lah, so shameful begging real to take him. He don't need to do this what, he is a rather good player. If Real really want him, they would have paid for him liao lah, They don't value him enough might as well forget them.<br><br></div></blockquote>i feel what 4 keep a unhappy player at the club? 1st he may not wish to play for gunners anymore. 2nd if he does not play, arsenal will lose out more due to his wages. price of him will drop even more if he does not play.<br><br>btw i feel the 8million offered is also too low, shall sell him if RM can offer a couple of millions more.</div>
