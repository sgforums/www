            <div class='col-md body'>I think their poor performance at the start of the 2nd half of the season was due to Rafa's Retarded Rotation. Have you seen a manager change so many players between 2 games? I believe the changes caused confusion among the players and caused the poor performance...<br>But even now, even after the rotation has 'slowed down', the performance is still as bad! I'm a Liverpool fan, and like many others, I am seriously getting irritated with Liverpool already! They can win teams like Besiktas 8-0 and draw 1-1 with Middlesborough...<br>The problem with them lies with the finishing. They just don't have the finishing touch. Soo many chances in a game and can end up only scoring 1... Haix... Hope they wake up soon...<br><br>YNWA</div>

With the type of players we have, and the horrendous amt of money we spent on transfers, there's no reason why we should be doing as badly as we do now. Granted, Liverpool has no god-damn right to have a top 4 finish because of that reasons alone, but given the calibre of the squad, to finish behind Man City and Everton would be considered a disgrace.<br><br>The Liverpool fans that stand behind Rafa in his feud with the owners should realise 1 thing. We are further off winning the league than ever before. 2 CL final in 3 years means nothing, because that's all in the past. What counts is the present, and if 2008-2009 EPL Champions are not Liverpool, then Rafa should resign. His rotation policy notwithstanding, his transfer policies have been bad as well. He doesn't have the eye for talent like Arsene Wenger has, and somehow he doesn't seem to be the tactician Ferguson is. He spends half his time whining how the owners did not give him money to spend, and when they opened up their purse, he signs dud players. Only Torres and Mascherano(and Babel to a certain extent) has been his worthwhile investments. Remember Paletta, Josemi, Mark Gonzalez?<br><br>True, Liverpool can still go on to win the league this season, or maybe either the FA Cup or CL. But if Liverpool ends the season empty-handed, can Rafa really look himself in the mirror and say this has not been a failure season? We can all blame the Rafa-Owners feud as the reason for the club's showing on the pitch, but when we fail to win it again next season, what excuse are we gonna give?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool hasn't been doing much justice to the talents they had for years, after the all conquering years of the 80's the only side worthy of being crown champion IMHO are days when McManaman, John Barnes, Ian Rush, Fowler and Redknapp rules the field but in Evans they lost their best chances due to his inferior tactical knowledge as compare to many before and after his time (less Souness)... i kind of remember a match when Liverpool needs to win at Anfield against ManU but Evans field a 4-5-1 team instead with only Fowler upfront receiving not much support initially idea was to cut the wingers of Giggs and the russian guy but back fired and i think they lost that match.. since then its always been worthy players with not worthy manager or the other way round.. kinda sad to say this but personally i just feels that Liverpool this season up to present had sort of drop pretty far away from the top teams, something like slightly better then the 2nd rungs in the league but can't match up with the top rungs..</div>
