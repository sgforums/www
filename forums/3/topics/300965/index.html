            <div class='col-md body'>the thing is Liverpool can't seems to attract world class players, without Rafa i bet the is not way Torres would consider Liverpool given the other choices that he'll have if he so decide to leave his former club.. during Liverpool's hey days everyone dream of donning the reds of Liverpool but these days its the reds of London or the Reds of Manchester whom players are more interested in so it'll takes alot more effort to win the league with the not so world beating players they'll have unless they have scouts who can spot talents from the lesser known leagues ard the world</div>
