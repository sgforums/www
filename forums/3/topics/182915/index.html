Malaysia has not yet been extended in any of its matches, and with its versatile line up it doesnÂ’t appear to be changing anytime soon.<br><br>Australian Stuart Brehaut faces the ultimate test in the singles, where he will play world number 2 in Chong Wei Lee. Tania Luiz will test herself against Mew Chew Wong, and Ashley Brehaut and Travis Denney will try to upset Kien Keat Koo and Chong Ming Chan.<br><br>The task ahead of the Mixed and WomenÂ’s Doubles Pairs are equally daunting.<br><br><strong>Singapore, which has yet to drop a rubber, will play an India smarting from its defeat by England. India went very close in two of its matches with the number two side, but will have to take another step up to really challenge in this tie.</strong><br><br><strong>The Mixed Doubles will be first on Court 2, where Singapore pair Hendri Saputra and Lu Yujia face IndiaÂ’s Vallyaveetil Diju and Jwala Gutta. This will be a real tough challenge for the India.</strong><br><br>England and Canada also start with the Mixed Doubles and will play on Court 3. Canada thrive on confidence and they will need all itÂ’s resilience in the face of the English team. England has experience throughout its line up, with eight players returning after the Manchester games to represent the country again at Melbourne 2006 commonwealth Games.<br><br>Simon Archer, in his last games campaign will play the MenÂ’s Singles, with Robert Milroy his opponent.<br><br>On Court 4, New Zealand and Sri Lanka should produce a close encounter, with New Zealand the marginal favourites after its demolition of Australia.<br><br><strong>Winners of the Quarter Final matches will go into the Semi Finals this evening. The winner of the Malaysia Â– Australia match will face New Zealand or Sri Lanka, and Singapore or India will play against either England or Canada.</strong></div>

We shouldn't have lost. We probably underestimated our opponents and that's why we lost. We've tried our best. We'll have to go back and see where the flaws are and try to improve for next time."<br><br>Can you take that reason??<br><br>Try telling your parents:<br>"We did not do well in the exam, we thought the paper going to be easy but we failed".<br><br>I believe same as carrot, there must be stick. if they expect to do well, come back and earn $$$, then if they don't perform, we should shrink their fundings.<br><br>or else look @ Agu. what a giant mistake.<br><br>Do you agree??</div>
