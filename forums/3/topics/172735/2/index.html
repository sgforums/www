            <div class='col-md body'>Bolton, despite their budget, always somehow manages to attract top players like Hierro, Jay Jay Okacha and Borgetti to the team. Sam has done a good job at BOlton, but i think the manager of Charlton deserves almost the same credit as Sam Allyardace, the fact that both Bolton and Charlton have survived in the premiership for quite a while now is due to the tactical ability of these 2 managers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Big Sam is as good as a wheeler dealer as Harry Redknapp..<br><br>Knowing who to snap up for minimum fees..<br><br>But as a person, i certainly don't rate Sam Allarydce...<br><br>Some of his players are just plain and simple cheats.. i.e. Diouf and Stelios..<br><br>Diouf is a serial spitter and dives whenever someone lays a finger.. mouthing off anyone who threatens to get near him.. while Stelios is one of a kind.. diving to earn freekicks.. goes to the ground when no one touches him..<br><br>Big Sam certainly never berates them.. but the one thing i really hate Allarydce for is his "low-class" way of getting away with defeats or victories..<br><br>i.e. when Bolton beats Arsenal.. Big Sam would comment that his team has come a long way from being a minnow to a big team... Able to take on Arsenal now..<br><br>but when Bolton loses to Chelski or Man Utd.. he would retaliate by saying that it is for certain that a "small" club liked Bolton would lose to a big club liked Man Utd or Chelski..<br><br>Contradicting .. and certainly lacked of class...<br><br>To say the truth.. i would rate Mourinho higher than Big Sam.. Mourinho might talked big but at least he got the results to back him up..<br><br>Sam Allarydce for England ? haha.. what a joke.. Imagine seeing England pumping up long balls for Kevin Davies to hold up..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

As a matter of fact, some section of football fans felt that LFC's win involve some luck too.<br><br>But at the end of the day, a few years down the road, people will remember that FC Porto won the CL in 2004 and Liverpool won the CL in 2005 and not that they won the trophy with a bit of luck or not.<br><br>Virtually every football fan hoped that the teams that they support wins trophies and care less about how they win it because a win is always a win.
