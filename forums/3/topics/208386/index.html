            <div class='col-md body'>HALF-TIME: Brazil 1-0 Argentina<br>Brazil are well on top so far in the battle of the South American superpowers. They lead thanks to Elano's early goal and have outshone Argentina in every area of the pitch.<br><br>"Brazil have got back what they lacked during the World Cup - balance. They still have the good players but now they can win the ball back too."<br>Leonardo, BBC Sport<br><br><span style="color: indigo;">45 mins: Another fluid Brazilian move ends with Cicinho bending in an enticing cross that only just evades Fred in the middle.<br><br>44 mins: The crowd at the Emirates Stadium are certainly making some noise - but it is the Brazilians who have the most to shout about. Argentina have not got going yet - most of their moves are breaking down as soon as they enter Brazil's half.<br><br>40 mins: A fantastic breakaway by Brazil almost ends with a second goal. Cicinho covers the length of the pitch after Gonzalez is caught in possession and the move ends with Elano collecting the ball on the overlap and firing wide.<br><br>37 mins: Referee Steve Bennett makes his first booking of the game - surprisingly though it is a Brazilian who is shown a yellow card, Lucio paying the price for a mis-timed tackle on Juan Roman Riquelme.<br><br>35 mins: Argentina may be struggling in terms of possession but they are at least making their presence felt. Another crunching challenge comes in - this time it is Pablo Zabaleta on Robinho.<br><br>31 mins: We have not seen much of West Ham's new signings yet. Carlos Tevez has had some neat touches but Javier Mascherano has barely touched the ball with Brazil dominating in midfield.<br><br>29 mins: Some sublime footwork by Robinho creates an opening and Roberto Abbondanzieri does well to divert his shot wide.<br><br>23 mins: Brazil are still spraying the ball around with confidence in the middle of the park but Argentina have tightened up defensively since the early stages.<br><br>17 mins: One for the West Ham fans watching. Carlos Tevez cleverly holds off Lucio and allows the ball to run on towards goal. He attempts to recover it himself but Brazil keeper Gomes is alert to the danger.<br><br>12 mins: Elano is certainly the main man so far. He seems to be everywhere at the moment and his latest contribution is a shot from the edge of the area that deflects off Javier Mascherano but does not pose any problems for Argentina goalkeeper Roberto Abbondanzieri.<br><br>10 mins: The tackles are flying in already with goalscorer Elano holding nothing back as he sends Carlos Tevez flying.<br><br>3 mins: GOAL Brazil 1-0 Argentina<br>It's the perfect start for Brazil. Robinho's ball splits the Argentina defence and Elano runs through to slot home. </span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Brazil 2-0 Argentina<br><br>Brazil: Gomes, Cicinho, Lucio, Juan, Edmilson, Gilberto, Elano, Silva, Fred, Robinho, Daniel Carvalho.<br>Subs: Fabio, Maicon, Luisao, Alex, Marcelo, Cearense, Julio Baptista, Kaka, Rafael Sobis, Vagner Love.<br><br>Argentina: Abbondanzieri, Coloccini, Rodriguez, Zabaleta, Mascherano, Riquelme, Bilos, Tevez, Milito, Gonzalez, Messi.<br>Subs: Samuel, Saviola, Franco, Ponzio, Aguero, Somoza, Insua, Fuentes.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;">FULL-TIME: Brazil 3-0 Argentina<br>It has certainly been an eventful afternoon at the Emirates Stadium and it is Brazil who take the honours from an entertaining - and very competitive - friendly.<br><br>Some great skill by Elano and Kaka brought Brazil their goals but both sides showed they are willing to put the boot in where it hurts too, even if they are both thousands of miles from home.<br><br>91 mins: Another nasty tackle, with Sergio Aguero raking his studs down Lucio's shin. It looked like it hurt and Aguero deserves his yellow card.<br><br>90 mins: GOAL Brazil 3-0 Argentina<br>Kaka has the final word with a touch of pure class. He wins the ball off Lionel Messi on the half-way line and keeps running, rounding Clemente Rodriguez and slotting neatly home for a brilliant goal.<br><br>88 mins: There are flare-ups going on all over the pitch - Messi is clattered in the corner as Brazil get in their retribution.<br><br>A few fans are on the pitch too which never really helps matters, but goes down well with the crowd.<br><br>86 mins: The challenges are still flying in, and not all of them are fair either. Vagner Love is the latest victim - Walter Samuel appearing to walk all over him as he tries to clear the ball.<br><br>83 mins: There is a tangle in the Argentina area after some good work by Vagner Love - who has added blue highlights to his hair, a nice touch. He works some space on the edge of the area but then tries to run through Clemente Rodriguez - and finds him an immovable object.<br><br>82 mins: Robinho has been quiet for a while but give him the sight of goal and he is immediately alert. The ball drops kindly for him on the edge of the area and he smashes in a shot that whistles narrowly over.<br><br>81 mins: CSKA Moscow striker Vagner Love is on for Brazil, replacing the lively Fred up front.<br><br>79 mins: Sergio Aguero is the latest Argentina player to try to test Gomes. The teenager cost Atletico Madrid Â£16m this summer from Independient and has a big reputation - but on this occasion he scuffs his shot and it goes well wide. Better luck next time.<br><br>75 mins: Pablo Zabaleta fires in a long-range shot for Argentina that flies high and wide of goal. For all their pressure, they are yet to trouble Brazil goalkeeper Gomes too much so far.<br><br>72 mins: Another change by Argentina. They bring off their Peter Crouch-esque winger Daniel Bilos for Federico Insua.<br><br>Brazil make a substitution too. New Arsenal signing Julio Baptista will get an early taste of life at the Emirates Stadium after replacing goalscorer Elano.<br><br>70 mins: Robinho runs on to a sweeping pass but uses his hand to control the ball - and referee Steve Bennett is well placed to call him back.<br><br>68 mins: GOAL Brazil 2-0 Argentina<br>We have not seen much of Brazil going forward but suddenly they burst into life. First Fred fires in a powerful shot that is well saved - and seconds later Elano finishes off a flowing move by slotting past Roberto Abbondanzieri.<br><br>65 mins: And that is the last we will see of the Hammers man - known to his fans as 'The Apache'. He is replaced by Sergio Aguero, while Brazil bring on Maicon for Cicinho.<br><br>63 mins: Another Argentina attack and Carlos Tevez goes close again. Lionel Messi threads through a precise pass but the West Ham man cannot find the target.<br><br>61 mins: More pressure from Argentina and another close call. Gilberto fails to clear the ball and is almost punished when he blocks Carlos Tevez's resultant shot. It strikes the Brazilian on the hand and he is fortunate that no penalty is awarded.<br><br>59 mins: Brazil make their first substitution and it is crowd favourite Kaka who comes on to replace Daniel Carvalho. Brazil have struggled for possession since the restart - maybe the AC Milan man can get them going again now.<br><br>57 mins: A lovely move by Argentina, with Lionel Messi again involved. His clever pass releases Leandro Somoza who backheels for Pablo Zabaleta fires the ball across the face of goal.<br><br>53 mins: Juan Roman Riquelme's free-kicks were decidedly ineffective before the break - and his first since half time is no improvement, curling straight into the hands of Brazil keeper Gomes.<br><br>50 mins: This is much better from Argentina already. Lionel Messi is seeing more of the ball than he did in the entire first half, but so far Brazil are holding firm.<br><br>47 mins: Juan Roman Riquelme becomes the first Argentine in Steve Bennett's notebook. He gets a yellow card for kicking out at Fred - and can feel a little hard done by because the Brazilian striker lunged wildly at him in the first place.<br><br>46 mins: Lionel Messi almost brings Argentina level with their first attack of the half. He starts the move but cannot finish it, heading over from close range.<br><br>46 mins: Argentina get the second half under way and will be hoping for an improved display after a patchy opening 45 minutes.<br><br>Argentina have made two changes - West Ham's Javier Mascherano is off, replaced by Leandro Somoza, and Walter Samuel is on for Clemente Rodgriguez. </span></div>
