At some point, they are extremely good, beaten Holland 6 times in a row (before end of Euro 04), after that, start going down.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Cristiano@Red_Devils.com:</div><div class="quote_body">2.

Well, I don't want to watch another boring match in World Cup 06 where another team keep attacking, but another team keep defending. Greece strategy sux, they play 11 defenders, boring!

Maybe their players are having too much luxury life, so to win or not to win doesn't make much differences. Unlike Brazil and Argentina, most of their players came from poor background, so, the will to win is strong.</div>

All they need is a win to secure a play-off spot ahead of Romania.<br><br>For both Slovakia and Russia, the play-off is in their hands too. Whoever wins will be fine.<br><br>France should get at least a play-off spot. As for greece, they left it too little too late. Goes to show their Euro 2004 was a fluke, and their team needs more creative players. Defensive-minded teams never make it far.<br><br>Spain i feel is condemned team, always failing at the final hurdle. I wouldn't be feeling sorry if they missed out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Barca players dislike Real players so much?<br><br>To me, I feel that most of the stars in La Liga are foreigners. The likes of Ronaldinho, Zidane, Riquelme, Ronaldo, Aimar, etc.. Sure they have good players. But true players who make a difference in the likes of Real, Barca or Valencia are foreigners. Maybe Spain NT should split into Catalunya, Spain and Basque. Might be better in terms of team unity.</div>
