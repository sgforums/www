Newcastle are a big club.'<br><br>The 39-year-old has been out or work since leaving Juventus in May and yesterday saw his odds of becoming the new Newcastle boss slashed to 2-1.<br><br>Deschamps spent a season in English football with Chelsea in 1999-2000, helping the club win the FA Cup.<br><br>His first job as manager saw him lead Monaco to the 2004 Champions League final before leading Juve to promotion from Serie B after their demotion for match-fixing.<br><br>Former Liverpool and Lyon boss Gerard Houllier is also believed to be in the frame.<br><br>However, the French Football Federation's technical director may be out of the running after his boss said he was confident Houllier would stay in his current job</blockquote></div>

Please take a look at the number of players Big Sam signed for Newcastle. Capaca, Rozenhal, Enrique, Alan Smith, Mark Viduka, Beye, Faye, Barton and Geremi. That's 9 new players, so tell me how he isn't using the budget "hardcorely"? I think its more of a case of  he doesn't know HOW to use the players he had and signed and blend them together as a team. If the results were good, Newcastle wouldn't have sacked him even if his football was not that pretty.<br></div>

Newcastle fans wanted him to be the manager just because he is a local-born and bred, and that as a player, he has scored many goals. But how many trophies did he win for them as a player? And isn't the lack of trophies a sore point with the Newcastle fans? My point is, Newcastle have a bunch of fans(not all) who are romantics, but not really in touch with reality(same problem as we have at Liverpool)<br><br>In the first place, I am not even sure Shearer has got the qualifications required by the EPL to be the manager. If Shearer is smart, he should take up a post at Newcastle now offered by Keagan, and learn as much as he should/could, and pick up the necessary coaching badges, so that he would be ready to take over eventually.</div>
