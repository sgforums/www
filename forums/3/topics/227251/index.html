            <div class='col-md body'>Omg man.. I was about to sleep then I saw Chelsea v Wigan live.. 2-2 I was damn happy and it looks like Wigan had a chance.. But I saw the way Chelsea attacked and attacked as if it is the Champions League Final, and they ACTUALLY GOT ONE IN IN THE EXTRA TIME! My heart sank cos it means wasted Man U couldn't extend their lead but as reluctantly as I was, it was really impressive to see such determination and fighting spirit. It was as if I was seeing Man U of the past.. Somewhere inside I knew they were gonna get a goal or something and they really did with such a nice goal by Robben.. So many times they have did it this season Kudos to Chelsea.. Championship material.. I just hope Man U can play the same way..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

Sure enough i respect Chelsea for their grit to grind out wins , which also reminds me of how Man Utd players play in the 90's.Slack in the 1st 60mins, chiong on full steam in the last 30 mins <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> , which is why i support them back then.Back to goals vs attractiveness, World Cup winner Italy are similiar to Chelsea's case in this season, 2nd highest top scoring team wid 12 goals.But IMO i dont think they played attractive football. They jus stick to their highly efficient tactics.<br>Just my 2 cents worth <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br></div>
