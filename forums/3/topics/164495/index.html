            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal presently Europe's top club  	21/11/2005 00:00:00<br><br>ItÂ’s the line most would have believed would never be written, but Arsenal travel to face FC Thun of Switzerland as this seasonÂ’s Â‘Best Team in EuropeÂ’.<br><br>There arenÂ’t many outside UEFA who really understand quite how the Â‘coefficient points systemÂ’ is worked out. It would appear that roughly 3 Â½  points are awarded for a victory, and it probably fluctuates depending on whether that success is gained on home or away soil, the amount of goals, the stature of the opponent and may even have something to do with Â‘fair playÂ’.<br><br>Olympique Lyon is second to the Gunners, which further confuses the situation. The French Champions have a better goal difference than Arsenal and have faced what would arguably be better opponents (Real Madrid for example).<br><br>Understandably, these would be the top two at present as they are the only teams that still possess a 100% record.<br><br>The UEFA Cup teams are included on the same list, which sees the likes of Middlesbrough and Bolton supposedly doing better than the mighty AC Milan.<br><br>Strangely, considering that UEFA use these tables to rank the teams, Manchester United sits above Lille, but behind their French opponents in Group Â‘DÂ’. The fact they have scored an extra goal may account for this, but should all the remaining fixtures finish as draws, United would be eliminated.<br><br>Obviously there are two further rounds of group matches remaining, and then the Champions League will get down to the real business when the knockout stages begin.<br><br><a href="http://www.victorpredictor.com/visa.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.victorpredictor.com/visa.aspx</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ranking has no real meaning in footballing sense, esp in champion league where the gap between top teams and bottom teams actually are not so great.<br>to say arsenal always get the easier opponents are not true.<br>last season arsenal have got PSV in their group which went all the way to the semifinals. and this season PSV are atop of AC milan. easy?<br>Arsenal draw bayern in the round16 and got beaten. easy?<br>FC Thun beat <strong>Dynamo Kiev and Malmo </strong>to get into the group stages of Champion league. Easy feat?<br>Man utd group are not so tough too, they should have won both games against lille and they wont need to win against Villareal right?<br><br>In fact luck does play a major role. when Porto won the champion league 2 season ago, who would have thought their oponents could be Monaco, and they won the game 3:0. Liverpool who won the battle with chelsea which many still claim did not cross the line.<br><br>arsenal are fast developing into a team that play and adapt to the european style of play with more composure. i hope tomorrow game, arsenal youngster can show what they are made of by beating FC Thun.<br>By the way, i am an arsenal fans.<br><br></div>

Easy feat?<br>Man utd group are not so tough too, they should have won both games against lille and they wont need to win against Villareal right?<br><br>In fact luck does play a major role. when Porto won the champion league 2 season ago, who would have thought their oponents could be Monaco, and they won the game 3:0. Liverpool who won the battle with chelsea which many still claim did not cross the line.<br><br>arsenal are fast developing into a team that play and adapt to the european style of play with more composure. i hope tomorrow game, arsenal youngster can show what they are made of by beating FC Thun.<br>By the way, i am an arsenal fans.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I think PSV is under-rated and that ppl often treat them lyk nth coz they think they are not a glorious or very rich club...mainly because they play in a league that's not very popular among fans...and so is Lyon...</div>
