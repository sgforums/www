            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry Guys.. But I can't force everyone to accept this..<br>But its worth your time to take a look.<br><br>What is Arbitrage Trading?<br><br>Arbitrage is a trading technique used by professionals in financial markets whereby exactly offsetting positions are taken in a market simultaneously but at different prices. The difference in price represents an immediate risk-free profit that is independent of the subsequent movement in price of the instruments traded.<br><br>An example of this would be if IBM traded on the London Stock Exchange for Â£10.00 and on the New York Stock Exchange for Â£9.50. An investor (known as an arbitrageur) could guarantee a profit by buying shares on the New York Stock Exchange (for Â£9.50) and simultaneously selling the same amount of shares on the London Stock Exchange (for Â£10).<br><br>What is Sport's Arbitrage Trading?<br><br>Numerous arbitrage situations, also referred to as Â“sure betsÂ”, Â“scalpsÂ” and Â“risk free betsÂ”, are created every day in sportÂ’s-betting markets amongst the increasing number of bookmakers operating worldwide. These are terms attributed to a minor flaw in the betting system and YOU can take advantage of them! Earning from this flaw is perfectly legal and is tax free in most countries. The difference in the odds determines the amount of risk free profit to be made by the SportÂ’s Arbitrage Trader.<br><br>Arbitrage is not to be confused with gambling, which carries a risk! It is a system where you trade with two different bookies on the same event, but with different outcomes. There is more to arbitrage than this, but all the considerations have been built into our state-of-the-art software, so you don't need to worry!<br><br>If you are new to sport's arbitrage trading, just take a moment to imagine yourself placing a trade that ALWAYS wins, regardless of the outcome of the event. Because you can never lose, you're not betting at all - you are trading.<br><br>There are many systems offered on the Internet for arbitrage trading, some good and some not so good... Most of the services rely upon manual searching for arbs, which is very time consuming and inefficient. Our software eliminates that inefficiency.<br><br>As an Arbitrage Trader, you will:<br><br>- Win regardless of the event you bet on.<br>- Need absolutely NO knowledge of the event that you're betting on!<br><br>How it works.<br><br>Below are bookmakers odds for a tennis event in the Romanian open:<br><br>- Â£500 on Balcells with bookmaker Stan James at odds of 1/1.<br>- Â£400 on Hanescu with bookmaker Bet365 at odds of 6/4.<br><br>The total amount you have traded is Â£900.<br><br>- If Balcells wins you get Â£1000 from bookmaker Stan James.<br>- If Hanescu wins you get Â£1000 from bookmaker Bet365.<br><br>So your profit, no matter who wins, is Â£100 (Â£1000 - Â£900).<br><br>The key, to arbitrage betting, lies in converting a bookmakers odds into a percentage. If after adding up the percentages for each leg of the event your total percentage is less than 100 you have found an ARBITRAGE opportunity.<br><br>In this example:<br><br>- Odds of 1/1 are equivalent to a percentage of 50 %.<br>- Odds of 6/4 are equivalent to a percentage of 40 %.<br><br>The total percentage is 90 (50 + 40). You have landed an Arb because this percentage is less than 100.<br><br>Note:<br><br>The arbitrage percentage is 100 minus the total percentage. In our example this is 10% (100 - 90). The greater this percentage, the larger your profits for the same amount staked.<br><br>Bookmakers from around the globe are competing for our business - each one has their own particular sports in which they specialize and are naturally more in tune with what is taking place in their local area. In competing for global business it is necessary for them to offer a wide range of sports from around the world, some of which will not be within their area of expertise.<br><br>Bookmakers may not have all the pertinent information especially if the sport or participants are unfamiliar to them, or the event takes place overseas.<br><br>The odds may be based upon the anticipated number of bets rather than the likely outcome. E.g. When England is involved in a soccer match, the majority of bets placed with UK bookmakers will support England. Bookmakers like to balance their books so they may offer the opposing team at inflated odds.<br><br>Dealing with a massive global market and so many events, mistakes or miscalculations can be made by the bookmakers in their haste. Arbitrage traders only need two of the bookmakers to have a difference of opinion on an event to create an arbitrage opportunity.<br><br>Now you can see why Sport's Arbitrage Trading is such an phenomenal opportunity.<br><br>NEVER lose a Sports Bet again.<br><br>We have spent many months in research and development of our software application, which has been designed to do ALL the hard work for you. It is simple for you to use and we GUARANTEE that it DOES work! Now you can have full control over your arbitrage trading. The SureBetPro software checks every few seconds for arbitrage to be delivered directly to your desktop. Place your arbitrage and that's it! NO waiting around for emails and NO searching for links to place your trade.<br><br>PM me if you guys need any info.
