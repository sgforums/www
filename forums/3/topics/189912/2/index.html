            <div class='col-md body'>William Gallas has confirmed he will quit Chelsea, and admits Milan want him.<br><br>The Rossoneri are desperate to land the French star - who has never hidden his desire to leave Stamford Bridge this summer.<br><br>Gallas has now reiterated his stance and confirmed he likes the sound of a move to The Giuseppe Meazza.<br><br>"My decision has been taken and is definitive: I want to leave Chelsea," Gallas told L'Equipe.<br><br>"I want to experience another challenge. I've been with Chelsea for five years and I want to experience another league."<br><br>Gallas admitted Milan had been in touch: "The management of Milan are interested in me, and I am interested in the idea of going to play over there. It would be an honour."<br><br>The 28-year-old will now take use of Fifa regulations which allow any player to quit a club after three years of a contract - although compensation would have to be paid to the selling club.<br><br>Gallas admits Chelsea's approach with him this time last year was the reason behind his decision.<br><br>"Chelsea did not regard me as necessary," he said.<br><br>"I was disappointed [by] Chelsea. Why await the end of the Championship to give me what I was worth?<br><br>"From now on, it is not any more a question of money, I do not want any more."<br><br>haiz au revoir gallas..you're one of my favourite defenders..one of the quickest too.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Germany captain Michael Ballack says he has 'no doubts' that he will join Premiership champions Chelsea on a free transfer in the summer.<br><br>The Bayern Munich midfield star has long been expected to sign for Jose Mourinho's side, with The Blues keen to tie up the deal before the start of the World Cup finals.<br><br>Real Madrid and Internazionale also held an interest, but Chelsea's unrivalled spending power saw them move to the front of the queue and Ballack has now confirmed that he expects to move to Stamford Bridge.<br><br>However the former Bayer Leverkusen man also stated that no contract has been signed as yet, although he looks certain to become the first high profile capture of the summer for the Premiership titans.<br><br>"No, no doubts [about moving to Chelsea]." Ballack told Premiere. "Nothing has been signed yet."<br><br>Ballack also hit out at the criticism he has received for his decision to leave the club, from Bayern director Karl-Heinz Rummenigge amongst others, insisting that his decision to leave is the fulfilment of a long-standing plan.<br><br>"I think my decision should be accepted and I shouldn't be kicked around anymore about it," Ballack added. "That has actually been annoying me.<br><br>"I'm glad that Bayern are angry if I go.<br><br>"That shows I did a good job and that I'm an important player. That is also reflected in the offer that they made to keep me.<br><br>"It's simply the chance now to do what I've always wanted to do.<br><br>"I can remember when Uli Hoeness said 'Come here, we're a top club. When you're 29 you can go abroad'. That time has come now."<br><br>With his star asset set to leave the Allianz Arena in the summer, Bayern coach Felix Magath has wished the international midfielder well as he ties up his move to London - whilst also expressing his excitement about leading the German champions in the post-Ballack era.<br><br>"I had two good years with him; wish him much luck with Chelsea," Magath told Bild.<br><br>"But I must also say I look forward to Bayern without Ballack.<br><br>"It is also at times delightful to form a crew without such a personality."</div>
