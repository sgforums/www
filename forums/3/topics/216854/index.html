            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Portsmouth fullback Glen Johnson wants to go back to his old position - as striker!<br><br>The on-loan Chelsea defender revealed to The News: "I signed for West Ham as a centre forward when I was 10 and played there until I was 15. Then I went to centre-half.<br><br>By the time I broke into the first team I had been actually playing right-back for just a year. But I was always a striker and scored quite a few goals. I was strong, quick and powerful and really enjoyed it up there, it was great.<br><br>I actually only started playing football properly when I was 10. I was playing for the school and the teacher told my mum she might like to look to get me into a club. She saw an ad in the paper saying my local Sunday league team, the YMCA, needed players so she sorted it out for me. I went along and that was it. It took off from there.<br><br>I got six goals in my first two games and then a West Ham scout gave my mum a card, so I went for trials and was obviously signed on. I was there from the age of 10 until I was 18. I did well up front for them as well. Then one day our centre-half got injured and the coach asked me to do a job so I did.<br><br>he wasn't our permanent coach either. But after that our coach Dave Knowles kept me there and eventually I made the switch to right-back. Not that I mind playing in defence.<br><br>I actually prefer right-back to centre-half or midfield. Obviously I can defend and get forward and do a bit of both.<br><br>But I was initially a striker and wouldn't mind going up front again. Who wouldn't really? Everyone loves scoring goals.<br><br>"Having said that, though, it would be a completely different level to when I was 10 years old.<br><br>"Still, I would definitely enjoy it."</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">but portsmouth already have LuaLua , Benjani Mwaruwari , Andrew Cole and Nwankwo Kanu..............but if glen johnson have the striker instinct why not try him @ the striker role he might be the a great forward</span></div>
