Tot they always 'live' the any table tennis match in the past for such international titles?? Is it too much disappointment as the team always nvr clinched any title &amp; they gave up and let the big 'catch' swimmed away this time?? Very disappointed indeed that this impt tournament was not shown on TV at all!! What happened despite spending so much nurturing these foreign talents so much &amp; yet we missed the big action?? Isn't that a big irony?? Tot the nation emphasize so much on sports including YOG &amp; yet we can't witness this great glory on national TV?? Hope that we can catch a delay telecast of this tournament afterall...</p></div>

              <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Chinese-born-and-trained Singaporean coach and players helped spread China's national game to another part of the world. Traitors? Don't take that so serious. That is the way to find mighty China a brighter mirror to reflect its weak points. </span>

              <p>Seems like if you just import aliens to win medals and call it a "victory" for your countrymen, other countries also won't respect you or take you seriously as a "power" in that sports.</p>
              <p>I completely feel no pride whatsoever in this win by PAP tactic of importing aliens.</p>

              <p>We are world champ but I sincerly don't feel jubilant at all</p>
              <p>Because the ones who did it are Chinese and not Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>I believe they become S'pore citizens by circumstances and their hearts are always with China.</p>
              <p>Likewise, how many of us can become a citizen of another country and leave our family and friends behind.</p>
              <p>Possibility I can be proud if they become a S'porean when they are very young  and went through primary school and subsequently immersed in our culture so deeply that when they reach adulthood, they only think themself as S'porean and their roots here. But it is difficult as thier parents are still in China unless they themself become S'pore citizens</p>
              <p>So, it is still the true S'porean winner that I will feel jubilant and proud of.</p>

              <p>It's good to hear broadminded enlightened views as such.</p>
              <p>Looks like Singaporeans are really divided 50:50 on this issue. This is saddening.</p>
              <p>The issue is how we Singaporeans see ourselves and the image we want to project to the outside world:</p>
              <p>(1) Generous, warm-hearted, confident, openminded, cosmopolitan/ or</p>
              <p>(2) Xenophobic, petty, &amp; narrow-minded. </p>
              <p>There are many Singaporeans who too will happily migrate to other countries without qualms, so why this extra scrutiny on the loyalty of foreign talents? Why the double standard?  </p>
              <p>Whilst I agree that the policy of importing foreign talents to win us gold medals is somewhat controversial, it is important to make foreign talents coming to our fair shores feel welcome. We should be confident of our country and ourselves enough to believe that this is a good place to live in and people love to join us, i.e. work towards making Singapore a good and vibrant place to live in. Most importantly, we want them to see that we Singaporeans have generous hearts.</p>

Champions coming home? Whose home?</a></h3>
              <div class="post-body entry-content" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.3em;">Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Singapore state owned and controlled newspaper's online edition of My 31, 2010 has the story "Champions coming home". It is the story of 2 ping pong players (Singapore calls them strangely "paddlers") who had represented Singapore in the Moscow games and won medals. <br><br>The story's heading "Champions coming home" would make one ask, whose home. You see, both these sportswomen are not Singaporeans in the true sense at all. They were until recently top sportswomen in China when they were induced to come to Singapore, given instant citizenship, in return for several millions of dollars, donned Singapore's colors and represented Singapore. <br><br>I suppose if the money was right, they would have represented Mali, Sub Saharan Africa except that it would be rather unusual for Mongoloid yellow skinned Chinese women representing a Negroid African country, not to mention that Mali probably does not have the several millions that tiny Singapore has. <br><br>On the whole there is something distasteful about it all. On the one hand, it is shameful for a country such as Singapore which has no sportsmen at all to be pretending to have suddenly sprouted world class sportsmen. I suppose, if you have to live in fear of Lee Kuan Yew as Singaporeans do, it is hard to run fast, jump high or throw far enough.</div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.3em;">Second, it is even more distasteful as the dishonesty becomes even more clearer; since in choosing Chinese women from China, it is plainly an attempt to hoodwink the observer, since one could mistake them for Singaporeans. You see they don't buy African runners to represent Singapore to run the mile. <br><br>In fact there is not even the remotest connection between a Chinese woman from mainland China to any Singaporean; it is as if comparing a Hottentot with an Ang Mo Kio, a district in Singapore's resident. <br><br>Come on guys. You are not fooling anyone. By this you are only reinforcing the fact that Singapore can never produce sportsmen, writers, thinkers, innovators, actors, entertainers, simply nothing. All they can do is to constantly look over the shoulder to see if Lee Kuan Yew is watching and if he is, to wet their pants.</div>
