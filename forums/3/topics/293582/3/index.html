            <div class='col-md body'>Duric is a good 1.. i prefer indra shadan.. at least he is the got brain soccer player.. unlike someone who call himself Alam Shaher lol<br>hence i does not matter whether they Can make it or CMI. they reach this stage is worth our support.. of cos we Hope for a weaker group than a strong group. i tink even Japan hope for tat.. i dun tink anyone team in the world will wan a STRONG group...<br><br>those who tink singapore is CMI and does not matter whether the group is weak anot.... onli support winning team... in his house sure have alot of manu shirt, chelsea, arsenal, and even blackburn rover =X</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How old is Agu? But he has got potential.Duric may be in his prime now but when form starts to wane then how?The problem with Singapore is the small pool of good players to choose from.When one or few main players are suspended or sidelined,the substitutes just couldnt do the job and that was what happened to the under 23.</div>
