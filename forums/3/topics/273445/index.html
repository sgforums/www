            <div class='col-md body'>I got no problem with foreign fans, it's better than people with no ties to a club supporting it from here imo - it is the most commercialised league in the world so it's only natural that it'll be the most accessible, and regardless of the comparitive ability of a number of the premier league teams it's still high quality, and lets face it equating passes in a row to quality of the match is a load of bollocks. nothing's more fun to watch than a close scrapped match between lower teams - and i say that as a man united fan (who actually goes to matches i would like to add before you jump on my back)</div>
