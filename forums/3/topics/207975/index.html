            <div class='col-md body'>ARSENAL last night backed down in their war with Chelsea as Ashley Cole finally moved to Stamford Bridge.<br><br>The Gunners agreed to take William Gallas in part- exchange plus just Â£5million.<br><br>Blues boss Jose Mourinho was understood to be furious at losing the French star. Yet Arsenal had originally demanded Â£25m for England left-back Cole.<br><br>The midnight deadline passed without official confirmation of the deal, which brought an end to 18 months of rowing over the most controversial transfer of all time. Cole, 25, has signed a five-year, Â£90,000-a-week contract.<br><br>After a medical yesterday, he concluded negotiations with Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon at the England team hotel in Manchester.<br><br>Yet the transfer only went ahead after Arsenal had been forced to lower their demands and pay Gallas far more than they planned.<br><br>Gunners boss Arsene Wenger originally offered just Â£5m for Gallas, 29. He even rejected ChelseaÂ’s straight cash offer of Â£20m at the end of last week.<br><br>But with the transfer deadline looming and the prospect of being stuck with a desperately unsettled player, Arsenal reluctantly agreed to accept ChelseaÂ’s compromise deal.<br><br>Even then the move was almost wrecked when Gallas insisted on Arsenal matching the wages he had been offered at Chelsea.<br><br>The champions had promised Gallas Â£80,000 a week and the Frenchman insisted he wanted the same deal.<br><br>Wenger was so desperate to land the experienced centre-half he agreed to GallasÂ’ demands.<br><br>Arsenal also signed Brazilian Under-19 captain Denilson, 18, in a deal with Sao Paolo which could rise to Â£4m for the midfielder.<br><br><strong>It seems like Chelsea got the better deal, only $5m with a player that only had 1 yr to his contract... </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>England full-back Ashley Cole has revealed how Arsenal's favourable treatment of Thierry Henry was one of the reasons why he wanted to leave the club for Premiership champions Chelsea.<br><br>He said: 'The club made Thierry feel wanted and special, wooing him, wining and dining him, speaking in public about how much they want him to stay, going on a deliberate charm offensive.<br><br>'But me? I didn't have one dinner, one meeting or one phone call from anyone. That's not sour grapes, it's just a sad truth. The truth is that the Gunners had done nothing all season to hold on to me.'<br><br>He added: My worst fears were confirmed when, as Thierry and I sat in the centre circle after the final whistle, his name was sung from the rooftops while my contribution was recognised by a deafening silence.<br><br>'As his chants faded away we waited for mine. And we waited. And there was nothing. `They're not bothered about me', I said, resigned to the fact. It was like I was the invisible man.'<br><br><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=378880&amp;cc=4716" rel="nofollow">http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=378880&amp;cc=4716</a></div>
