            <div class='col-md body'>Ronaldo can do nothing for 89 mins of a game but make one or two run where he does a few step overs and people say he had a great game.  They don't remember he did nothing productive all game and at the end of those one or two runs he will either wait too long to cross the ball or shoot from some ridiculous spot and miss.  But Fletcher will put in a solid performance for a solid 90 mins and people do nothing but slate him afterwards.<br><br>Christiano Ronaldo is an overrated idiot. He is a headless chicken with little positional sense and messed-up priorities. Yes, he can run at pace, yes he can shoot (sometimes, nothing like Rooney) and crosses well every game in a while, but he wastes SO MUCH. Watching this 'Ronaldo', as he is called, is painful. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE THE HELL HE IS GOING WHEN HE IS ON THE BALL. I know you will all agree, but it is shocking how MUCH the guy veers off to the side of the pitch when he could easily have stepped inside and played a clever pass into the box. Instead he either tries to dance a while, no longer funny by the way, or falls on his turkey backside or ends up where he started on his little exhibition. Like what does he actually consider important, where do his priorities luy? He has the abilities to be very effective in his position but it is starkly clear that he has no footballing brain whatsoever. The bad decisions he makes week in, week out are actually more appalling than bad. He has been playing in this league for a while now, I don't think it's an experience thing. He is far too overrated for his own health, something that will ensure he never becomes the player he has the capabilities of becoming. He will never become that player on his own either because he clearly doesn't understand his role very well, someone needs to draw him a picture.<br><br>SOME views i got frm manutd forums which i agree...u?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>nah... dun agree... A coach can always teachs a player when to pass a ball, the right time to do all the stepover n when not, the right time to pass the ball and the right time to shoot and to anticipate into the game more. But things like pace n the dribbling skills are hard to to teach to a player. Somemore he is only 20. Lots of time to becum a worldclass player. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
