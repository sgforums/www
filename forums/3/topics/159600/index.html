Almost every match i watched them play.. Liverpool will create bucket loads of chances.. but be it luck or really really poor shooting , they just can't score..<br><br>If you were to be strict.. then you can certainly see that Liverpool's starting 11 can't really match up with Chelski , Man Utd or Arsenal's.. maybe even newcastle has a better 11..<br><br>Reina.. from what i have seen last season in La Liga.. he might be another David James in disguise.. Wonderful shot stopper but nv claim crosses well..<br><br>Steve Finnan often provide adequate attacking threat , but defending was always found wanting..<br>Warnock .. capable left back but doesn't do enough for me..<br>Hyypia's aging &amp; it seems like Benitez doesn't really trust him.. dropping him for Pellegrino last season was a gd example..<br>Carragher is the most consistent performer for them last season.. but not scoring enuff goals is the main problem for Pool..<br><br>Xabi Alonso .. terrific technique player.. but always love those "hollywood" 60 yards passes.. still a good team player thou..<br>Zenden should be their starting left midfield.. hasn't really settle well.. Don't really see him getting to the byeline and putting in crosses..<br>On the right.. Luis Garcia starts... a Desperately Frustrating player.. Does the little flicks and loses the ball easily...<br>Steven Gerrard is the key for everything.. if he dun perform, liverpool are in deep s**t..<br><br>Upfront.. Cisse and Crouch will be the main 2... both dun score.. Strikers should and must score..<br><br>Overall, Liverpool's main problem is their incapability to score..<br>Other than Gerrard , it seems like the rest of the players can't even inspire themselves to perform.. let alone inspire others...<br><br>United We Stand  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
