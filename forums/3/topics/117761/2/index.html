I thought this thread was whether karate is still alive in Singapore or not....so I cited the Shitoryu gym lor. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Besides Shitoryu, there are many other smaller gyms, some headed by Japs also (or some others who claim that they are super high ranking black belts).  Problem is that I've never trained in karate, but you seem to have done so...so I think you'll be more in the karate circle than I ever will be.<br><br>Just out of curiosity...I've seen their training before and know a few people who were instructors or blackbelts there.  I actually felt that they were not too bad leh.  Why don't you like the way they train there?<br><br></div></blockquote>No lah. It's just that I didn't really feel their way of teaching Karate something which I would appreciate.
