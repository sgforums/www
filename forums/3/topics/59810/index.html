            <div class='col-md body'>Followed LFC for 7 years... Been thru ups and downs with them, but this time i really can't stand this anymore.  GH i believe is a good manager, but Liverpool need a great manager instead of only good.  I really can't understand what is going through the manager's mind.  He kept on signing Fuck up player every season, except for Kewell, maybe he is GH's best signing.  Steve Finnan is an average player, i believe even Carragher can play better in defence.  Igor Biscan...sigh~ he always looked nervous, couldnt read the game well, rash at tackles, heads like shit.  LFC needs 1 right back, 1 centre back that is quick n strong, 1 central midfield that is creative to pair with Gerrard, 1 striker that is strong, heads well, and good at holding up ball for attack.<br>I'm really disappointed with LFC and GH, hope that they will start winning, and bring back fortress that they once had achieved.<br><br>~You'll Never Walk Alone~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>something is wrong with the manager's head... maybe its the surgery on the heart....<br><br>dont keep good player... Anelka is in the top scorer's list but he is with Man City.<br><br>Kewell is a left leg player yet he is often found on the right...<br><br>Diouf... hopeless.. serial killer... the only person he killed is himself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">[color=red][size=large]Oh yes ! Nicholas Anelka ! How come I forgotten him !<br><br>GH should sign him at the first place , and play him alongside Owen ! Now looks like Kevin Keegan finally got to see the best of him , soon he will be back to his usual self of the Arsenal's days !<br><br>If Anelka and Owen was paired for the upfront , using their pace to torment the opposition defense.........woh !
