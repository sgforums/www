            <div class='col-md body'>LIAM BRADY continued ArsenalÂ’s feud with champions Chelsea by admitting he hopes they suffer a crisis.<br><br>The Gunners midfield legend expects unrest in the Blues camp as high-profile players cannot get a game.<br><br>Brady said: Â“There could be trouble behind the scenes. I wonder how Arjen Robben is going to feel about the situation if he is not included in the plans.<br><br>Â“I am hoping strongly that they lose a couple of games and there is a crisis because theyÂ’ve really upset a lot of people over the last three years, Jose Mourinho in particular.Â”<br><br>Chelsea are likely to be furious at BradyÂ’s comments, which will fuel the war of words going on between the two London clubs.<br><br>Their relationship is at an all-time low following the tap-up row which eventually led to Ashley ColeÂ’s move to Stamford Bridge earlier this month Â— and the England full-backÂ’s revelations about Arsenal in his autobiography.<br><br>William Gallas moved from Chelsea to Arsenal as part of the deal. But Blues then claimed the French defender threatened to score an own goal if he had played for the club again.<br><br>Brady, 50, a Champions League pundit for Irish TV station RTE, is head of youth development at Arsenal and part of the set-up which produced Cole.<br><br>And like boss Arsene Wenger, he is clearly angry at ChelseaÂ’s behaviour throughout the whole Cole affair.</div>

That is a very passive way of being competitive. Instead of wanting to be the best, it is wanting the other to be not so strong.<br><br>"I'm not waiting for Manchester United to make a mistake at the top - I wait for my team to improve by working."<br><br>Yet Mourinho still expects bitter rivals Arsenal to finish in the top four despite their worst start in Premiership history.<br><br>And he insists they will not be out of the title race even if they lose at Old Trafford tomorrow and drop 13 points behind the Premiership leaders.<br><br>He said: "Last season's top four still have the conditions to finish top four again.<br><br>"But if somebody sleeps and has a really bad Premiership season, like Liverpool two seasons ago or Arsenal the last time, someone else can jump into a Champions League slot.<br><br>"This is just the beginning of the season and points are very important, especially for Liverpool and Arsenal who are coming from behind.<br><br>"If they lose again this weekend they start being in a difficult position. But I don't believe a loser can say on Sunday 'It's over for us'." </span><br><br><span style="color: green;">HahaHaha </span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
