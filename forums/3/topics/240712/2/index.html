            <div class='col-md body'>My favourite is the FA cup finals of West Ham v.s. Liverpool when Gerard equalised with a stunning volleyball from far in injury time and won the FA cup in the penalty shoot-out eventually.<br><br>A recent one is the second leg of CL 06-07, Chelsea v.s. Barca, when Drogba scored a 94minute equaliser with the assist of last-minute striker John Terry to win Barca 4-3 on aggregate during the group stages. I'm a Chelsea fan btw. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Brings back good memories of attacking flair from Barca.. Still rem a few details from the game..<br><br>Chelsea was leading 3-1 from the first leg at stamford bridge, with Luis Figo scoring the elusive away goal for Barca. Then at the start of the 2nd leg at Nou Camp, the fans put up a gigantic human banner that reads '2-0', meaning that Barca will achieve that scoreline to go thru on away goal rules. They took just 45min to achieve that scoreline, leading 2-0 at halftime. At the start of the 2nd half, tore andre flo scored one for chelsea after a defensive mixup from the spanish, to put chelsea back in the lead in aggregate score. Patrick Kluivert scored the 3rd on the night for Barca with less than 10min to go to bring the score to 4-4 on agregate, and still had time to miss a penalty before the game goes to extra time, during which the far superior Barca finished off the blues with 2 additional goals. If i rem correctly, Chelsea also had a player sent off in this game. A game with all the ingredients of a good european game.<br></div>
