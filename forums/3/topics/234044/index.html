            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Fergie tells Platini to leave European Cup alone<br><br>MANCHESTER, England, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson made clear his opposition on Friday to a plan from new UEFA president Michel Platini to cut the number of Champions League places for the bigger countries.<br><br>Platini, who beat incumbent Lennart Johansson in Friday's vote, would like to see the likes of England, Spain and Italy have only three clubs in the money-spinning competition - instead of four.<br><br>Signalling his support for the existing format, Ferguson told a news conference: 'It is a fantastic tournament.<br><br>'You are playing all the best teams. I don't really think there is really a lot needed to be done to it.'<br><br>As from switching from four to three teams, he said: 'The only way they can do that is to reduce the competition or involve other countries having one or two teams in.<br><br>'The way it is at the moment, with the top countries getting the top teams in, is a fantastic prospect every year.<br><br>'You think you can get one of the Italian or Spanish giants and from their perspective they can get one of the English giants. You are playing all the best teams.'<br><br>Ferguson added: 'In fairness, sometimes you can get groups which are not particularly great and therefore it really starts in February. But the way it is at the moment is okay.'<br><br>Opposition to any changes are bound to be voiced by English clubs, who are enjoying a good run in the competition. All four entrants - United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal - are through to this season's last 16, which starts next month.<br><br>A Premier League spokesman would not be drawn on any opposition from the English top-flight, saying: 'The election of a UEFA president is a matter for UEFA.<br><br>'We look forward to continuing to work with them and Mr. Platini on a wide range of issues.'<br><br>Football Association chief executive Brian Barwick congratulated Platini, telling the FA's website: 'His election marks an exciting new era for European football and we look forward to working with him over the coming years.' </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">agree top footballing clubs should deserve 4 places<br><br>especially spain and england </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually i mark for platini's idea! afterall european cup should be based on champion of all champions basis. i dun like to see those runner-up team winning the cup, just look at real madrid who sucking on european cup for glory while they neglected their own league matches.<br><br>if me, i will only give 2 slots for each countries, champion and runner-up. champion of each countries will automatic qualify, while runner-up will fight for qualifying.<br><br>i think they should bring back the cup winner cup back, those who win the FA cup or Carlington Cup matches will go against one another. n this cup winner cup prize money should be 2nd highest comparing to european cup so that every teams will take seriously to win cup competition.<br><br>those 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th placings teams should play for UEFA cups.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'd reckon that his policy of "3 clubs per country" wouldn't go though the UEFA panel simply becos chances are, the revenue will dip immensely and popularity will decrease.<br><br>Yes, although his idea seems fair, but looking from a fan point of view, do u enjoy seeing clubs from weaker countries like Romania, Russia and Greece getting rout by European giants from England, Italy and Spain or would you rather watch a top class match between 2 of the World Class teams?<br><br>In my opinion, appointing Platini is like appointing a younger Blatter. Both full of ideas but without considering the consequences.<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>
