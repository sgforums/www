He's got to do more defensive duties to let Lumpa surge forward and shoot wide. Gerrard can also run at defenders, Lampard can't. Moreover, his goals are a lot of penalties.<br><br>Enough said, now that he can't score and can't stamp authority in midfield, he shd be dropped. I think even Essien is better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>firstly, my comments on the topics.<br><br>Beckham was dropped due to McClaren showing his authority. This is unwritten.  I believe McClaren has done all this and decided. I don't believe he will revert, else, his authority will drop.<br><br>secondly, Lampard vs Gerrard.<br><br>For me, in England team, Lampard should be dropped. He is not performing for country as per in Club. So maybe, it can jolt him into performing. It worked for Rio.<br><br>Gerrard is a better all-rounder, why he was not selected for world no1 or 2, cause of his profile, not because of his ability.<br><br>Comparing Clubs<br>if Lampard is unavailable, I can count up to 5 players who can take his spot in a hurry, Cole, Obi, Ballack, Essien, Geremis.<br>But if Gerrard is out, Liverpool will collapse. Yes, with Alonso and Sissoko, but Gerrard is the soul of Liverpool, same as per John Terry. But we are comparing Frank Lampard.<br><br>To me, it is the international cups/games that count. Not just EPL.<br>That's too easy a yardstick. Nowsdays, players are gauged according to WC, European Cups and etc. Not just EPL, and FA cups.<br><br>So internationally, Frank Lampard doesn't even come close to Stevie.<br>Stevie won the European cup, practically driving liverpool to win from 3-0 down. He scored more goals in WC06 despite his first outing in WC than Frank.<br><br>And lastly, as a fan, who would you chose to be in your team?<br><br>As a MUFC fan, I would pick STEVIE GERRARD but sadly, this is not CM.<br>So all the best to him in his Liverpool team.<br><br></div>
