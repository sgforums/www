If Chelsea wanted a transfer fee, Inter also wouldn't want him cos his salary already very high at 90,000 per week and also his age is not getting any younger.<br><br>Last year AC milan also wanted him but chelsea demanded a transfer fee and AC didn't want to pay a single cent as they were willing to take over his high salary already so said with a transfee was too much to pay.<br><br>Anyway, not everybody is dumb enough like chelsea or real, willing to pay 30m or 12m for a striker over 30 yrs old.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><strong> If you compare,<br><br>Hernan Crespo 31 yrs old / Salary $90,000 per week........Left for Free<br><br>Andriy Shevchenko 31 in Sep / Saraly $120,000 per week,  Cost:  $30M<br>transfer from AC Milan ........<br><br>Doesn't make sense, but what does at Chelsea.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </strong></div>

Theo didn't even played a match before or even after Arsenal paid $m for him... Which one is worst? I would prefer carrick's deal any day. At least this guy is proven Theo dunno can make it or not still not sure.<br><br>Ten years ago when Man u paid then record sum $3.75m for Roy Keane people said it was waste of money... Look how roy has turn out for united. All those jokers that said roy was a waste of money... Sure look like idiots today and i am sure these same jokers that talk about Carrick will look like idiots in time to come.<br><br>Actually, the No.1 most senseless deal i must say have to be the John guy. I am just glad it was Man u at the receiving end of this silly pay off. Just think, Man u didn't even develop him or even spend a cent on him and got $12m for him...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Man u suppost to pay FC Lyn $2m for him instead Chelsea paid double at $4m for them to FC Lyn and give them another $12m to buy Carrick somemore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The best deal of the century!

Just don't really like them that's all. After all, isn't it normal for other club supporters not to like the other team right?<br><br>Anyway, isn't Souness a legend at Liverpool? All Liverpool fans should love him. He was one of their best players during his days wat.<br><br>Btw, who is Salif Diao ?</div>

Look how roy has turn out for united. All those jokers that said roy was a waste of money... Sure look like idiots today and i am sure these same jokers that talk about Carrick will look like idiots in time to come.<br><br>Actually, the No.1 most senseless deal i must say have to be the John guy. I am just glad it was Man u at the receiving end of this silly pay off. Just think, Man u didn't even develop him or even spend a cent on him and got $12m for him...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Man u suppost to pay FC Lyn $2m for him instead Chelsea paid double at $4m for them to FC Lyn and give them another $12m to buy Carrick somemore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The best deal of the century!

Despite buying him for $12m last yr they didn't even use him for one match... And he has just been drop by new England boss even without Owen &amp; Rooney completing for a place.<br><br>He went to the WC by luck and i guess he was found out when the team started training together. That could be the reason why even when they were short of strikers, Sven didn't use him.<br><br>Anyway, i don't think we need players to look unusual... just play well will do.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
