I'm not trying to be sarcastic here, but I'm really curious about what kind of football appeals to you, what kind of players, what kind of tactics you appreciate.<br><br>What is your reason for liking your favourite player/team. Quite honestly, something more than all your blind hate for one club. I'm quite sure there's more to you than that right?<br><br>Why not focus on supporting your favourite club instead? Or just discussing soccer generally. Instead of such fervent efforts to establish conflict with other fans. Why not come together to just enjoy soccer instead?<br><br>Also, just wondering, is someone putting you up to all this? Hope you're not being made use of by someone who sits in the background and takes pot shots at others.<br><br>My point is this, instead of spending your time hating so much, why not do something else? What is it you hope to acheive from all this? To get a response? To show the world how much you hate Man U? Or just to prove that you're willing to go against the crowd for the sake of it?<br><br>I believe as a person, there's more to you than just going on and on about Man U.</div>
