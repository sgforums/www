            <div class='col-md body'>To be frank, Beckham is more marketable based on his looks more than anything else including his skills. He has no skills, but of cos he does possess a good cross and a wonderful freekick taker, but you cannot be considered WORLD CLASS if you only have that. THe reason why he is England captain? Precisely becos of his image and his popularity. He is a determined player i must say and is better than  any average players in football but mind you, there are NO average players in Real Madrid, MAN U needs BEckham, but REAL MADRID basically wants to buy him for the sake of marketability, they DUN NEED him. He cant dribble, he is not damn fast, he is not the most skilful, he is not the tallest, so why else do you think a star studded team like REAL MADRID wants him for? consider that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I partly agree with what Gasband said. David Beckham might be renowned for his ability to take free-kicks and for his accurate long balls into the penalty box, but other than that he isn't much of a player. I still like him though.<br><br>The club will miss out on alot of cash in the long run as David Beckham's image is one of the most marketable in the world. And even if he does move to Real Madrid, they won't really need him when they have the likes of Zidane and Figo in midfield, who both are more than capable at taking the free-kicks.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Beckham is a great player but sometimes he thinks he is really too good for Manchester United.<br>Same thing for Paul Ince in 1995 that is why Sir Alex Ferguson sell him away.<br>Even Beckham left Manchester United, it is not a big deal. Prehaps Manchester United will lost a lot of fans but l am sure those fans are only girls that are crazy about beckham. They have a lot of young players in the squad and the youth squad just won the youth cup since 1995.<br>Beckham moving to Real Madrid might be a good thing for England. Almost all players in England's squad is playing in England. Beckham can have experience overseas and give an extra edge to England in Euro 2004.</div>
