            <div class='col-md body'>Kia Joorabchian says West Ham United can emerge as a bigger club than Chelsea.<br><br>Joorabchian, born in Iran but based in London, is believed to be fronting a ?100million takeover bid for the Hammers.<br><br>Stock exchange rules forbid him from discussing his involvement but his commitment to the club is clear.<br><br>He told the News of the World: "I believe in the very near future West Ham can become bigger than Chelsea and maybe within seven years even challenge Manchester United.<br><br>"And certainly I feel manager Alan Pardew can take West Ham into new territory, to challenge for the Champions League and even the title.<br><br>"Manchester United are obviously an exception. Like Real Madrid they are huge all over the world but there is massive potential at West Ham. Why? Because the club has such passionate supporters and a fantastic history. As far as I'm concerned they have got a much bigger worldwide fan base than Chelsea.<br><br>"That goes back to part of the history of the club - having three World Cup winners in Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters.<br><br>"And what is so impressive is when they have hit bad times the passion and loyalty of the fans has seen them stick by the club.<br><br>"Passion is a vital word in the success of a football club. Sometimes when I look at Chelsea despite their recent success I think it's all a bit cold. They talk more about the brand than the football club."<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Possible?</span>  </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fifa are set to adopt proposals made by Uefa treasurer and president of the Dutch FA Mathieu Sprenger and rule that there must be clarity about exactly who is investing in football clubs.<br><br>"I have heard about the news reports concerning West Ham. Our proposals are that all clubs must show who owns them," Sprenger told the Mail on Sunday.<br><br>"It will not be enough simply for them to show that a company owns them. They will have to show who is behind that company as well.<br><br>"The Fifa congress unanimously supported these proposals in July so there is support from all the confederations for this.<br><br>"The Fifa president (Sepp Blatter) wants them to be written at the Congress next July.<br><br>"It doesn't matter if a takeover happens before the rules are instituted - from next year all clubs would have to show their ownership and who is behind them.<br><br>"If he (Joorabchian) took over at West Ham, he would have to show that.<br><br>"For the integrity of competitions, it has to be made clear who is in control."<br></div>
