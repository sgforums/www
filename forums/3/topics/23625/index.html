            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Boost Your Immune System</strong><br>-----------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Are you prone to getting colds, flu and infections that and zap your energy both mentally and physically?</span><br><br><strong>Go for foods that are rich in antioxidants</strong><br>Foods like eggplant, zucchini, corn, pumpkin, beetroot and carrots are all good sources of vitamins A, C and E which can help boost your immune system and fight cancer-causing free radicals.<br><br><strong>Go for garlic</strong><br>Garlic is a natural antibiotic, anticoagulant and anti-cancer agent. It has been used for many centuries and by many cultures to ward off infection. Whether you eat it raw, or try it in an odourless supplement, there's really nothing like it for your immune system.<br><br><strong>Chocolate in moderation</strong><br>Studies are showing more and more that people who eat chocolate up to three times a month are healthier than those who overindulge or abstain completely. Chocolate contains phenols, which are free radical-fighting chemicals. As well as boosting the immune system, cocoa in chocolate is also thought to restrict formation of a type of cholestrol that damages the heart.<br><br><strong>Exercise !!!</strong><br>While exercising in moderation will help you resist infection, be careful not to overdo it because it can make you more susceptible to colds and flus. If you're training hard then make sure to up your intake of carbohydrates to help your body adjust to energy you're burning.<br><br><strong>Get a good night's sleep</strong><br>Sleep is essential to strengthening your body and helping you ward of ailments. 6 to 8 hours of sleep per night is ideal, but remember that quality counts. If you have bouts of insomnia or tend to toss and turn then cut down on caffeine and practice relaxation techniques.<br><br><strong>Be optimistic</strong><br>Optimism and laughter have been known to have great healing powers. Some research even suggests that an upbeat attitude can strengthen the immune system, and reduce pain, and enhance the effects of many medical treatments.<br><br><strong>Manage your anger</strong><br>Whether you blame stress, overcrowding or public transportation, everyone at some point is bound to loose their tempers and become angry. While it's great to blow off steam once in awhile, our immune system gets considerably weaker when we get heated-up or tend to lose our tempers often. Anger has also been linked to heart disease.<br><br><strong>Get a massage</strong><br>An aromatherapy massage, using a mixture of lavendar, rosemary and geranium oils, helps to relieve tension and can be a powerful way to strengthen the immune system. Accupressure or a shiatsu massage is thought to help stimulate the lymphatic flow.<br><br>[This message has been edited by zzzzland (edited 16 May 2002).]</div>
