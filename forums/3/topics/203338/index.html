            <div class='col-md body'>Villarreal coach Manuel Pellegrini is resigned to losing midfielder Marcos Senna to United.<br><br>The El Madrigal boss says negotiations over the 30-year-old's transfer have not been concluded, but accepts it is an opportunity Senna can not turn down.<br><br>"In the case of Marcos, nothing is 100 percent finalised," explained Pellegrini to Marca, the daily Spanish sports newspaper. "I understand that this is a great opportunity for him but, for us, it is going to be a great footballing loss if he does end up going. If he leaves, I'll be happy for him but I will be sad for the team."<br><br>"I am very happy for him because he deserves it," Pelligrini added. "He is a player who has proved his class and I have always found it very strange that nobody came in for him sooner as he is a great player."<br><br></div>

Strikers normally don't play till very old... Once reach 30, they start to slow down and for strikers, this could mean the team winning or losing. Midfielders &amp; Defenders are different, they can last longer.</div>

Liverpool with their first choice pairing of Gerrard and Alonso or Garcia for the whole of last season still didnÂ’t do as well as Man Utd despite not having their first choice pair of Keane &amp; Scholes for more than half the season.<br><br>Man U were using a makeshift central midfield pair of Giggs &amp; OÂ’shea from as early as last Nov and still manage to win 9 out of their 10 games in a row. I agree Gerrard is good individually but Liverpool canÂ’t expect him to win games for them single handedly all the time right. I canÂ’t recall another Liverpool player that can win games for them by themselves.<br><br>And like I said, games are not won by just having 2 good centre pair and I belief you agree with that too. Liverpool have serious striker problems, Crouch is not a top marksman and to think he is Liverpool 1st choice is frighteningÂ…<br><br>Even Man U minus RVN (which I belief is a good thing) is still stronger than Liverpool in that department. Liverpool still need to go out and get 1 good striker then I think they have a more complete team. Tho they are keen on Dirk Kuyt but i think he is definitely not the right guy, Carlos Tevez or Juve's David Trezeguet would be better choice i think.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>man u will have to seriuosly look into their midfield department which is they are now , and by bringing in senna , that should ends their shopping for this transfer window .. liverpool needs to purchase a couple of strikers , they should get the duo David Trezeguet &amp; Zlatan Ibrahimovic form Juventus or either one and will looks more like a title challenging team</div>

Ten years ago when Man u paid then British record sum $3.75m for Roy Keane people said it was a waste of money... Look how roy has turn out for united.
