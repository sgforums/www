Arsene wenger has already stated that he will only announce once the deal is signed. What's the use of man utd linking with so many players when most of them turn them down. Carrick should stay at Spurs, i can't see him improving at man utd. At least Arsenal signed a quality player unlike man utd.</div>

When Wenger buy players, he normally buy them below the $10m amount and also a salary range between 30 to 60 k per week types and always those below 25, 26 yrs old so there is still a potential for a return in future .<br><br>These Juve players all cost close to $10m or more, age about 30 or more also, salary 70, 80, or 90, 000s a week so what he said is true. It has not been Arsenals' policy to buy old players anyway.<br><br>On your Thuram choice, what will thuram cost? 5 - 8m.. salary about 80, 90, 000 per week, age 34 yrs old. If he were to come over, he would expect at least a 2 yrs contract or maybe 3 but his form may not last more than a yr and also with his age, he may not do well in the fast pace EPL.<br><br>If Wenger is to get a defender from West Brom, i think a davis guy that he is keen on, he will probably cost less than 6m, salary maybe 20 to 30 k per week, has potential to be a good player, good chance of getting a return back from him too or at least can play for them for another 8yrs. On Thuram, whatever you put out, you won't get a cash return for sure, or he may even retire early if he gets injure.<br><br>So thuram won't be a good choice, even a loan tho good but his salary still very high.</div>

When Wenger buy players, he normally buy them below the $10m amount and also a salary range between 30 to 60 k per week types and always those below 25, 26 yrs old so there is still a potential for a return in future .<br><br>These Juve players all cost close to $10m or more, age about 30 or more also, salary 70, 80, or 90, 000s a week so what he said is true. It has not been Arsenals' policy to buy old players anyway.<br><br>On your Thuram choice, what will thuram cost? 5 - 8m.. salary about 80, 90, 000 per week, age 34 yrs old. If he were to come over, he would expect at least a 2 yrs contract or maybe 3 but his form may not last more than a yr and also with his age, he may not do well in the fast pace EPL.<br><br>If Wenger is to get a defender from West Brom, i think a davis guy that he is keen on, he will probably cost less than 6m, salary maybe 20 to 30 k per week, has potential to be a good player, good chance of getting a return back from him too or at least can play for them for another 8yrs. On Thuram, whatever you put out, you won't get a cash return for sure, or he may even retire early if he gets injure.<br><br>So thuram won't be a good choice, even a loan tho good but his salary still very high.</div></blockquote>thuram is expensive on the contract but transfer fee wise he should be cheaper than 4m as his age... for curtis davis everyone wans him now... even pormski.... so his value has sky rocket to 10m... so as a quick fix thuram is better choice...</div>
