Either Reyes or his agent, anyway. </div></blockquote>He can't really do that in the long run cos Arsenal as a club is not exactly loaded with cash... So it will be quite senseless for wenger to do such a thing as reyes came with a high transfer fee and not to mention a high per week salary too.<br><br>It seems that Real knows if reyes continue to show signs that he is not happy and wants to quit arsenal, they can get him at a steal cos in the end, there is really no point paying him tens of thousands per week if he is not keen to play, might as well take the money and pay another guy who is willing to put his heart into your team.<br><br>From how i see it, Arsenal will end up a loser either way from this deal cos of Reyes continue showing of discontent won get them a fair transfer fee.</div>

And to think that Wigan is asking for $5 to $6m for a coming to 28yrs old player they got almost free and not viewed as a top rated player is a bit too much still.<br><br>To say that no one wants to join Wigan is a rather exaggerating statement, thousands of youngsters across England and Europe would be more than happy to get a chance to join a premier league club.<br><br>Btw, your example of Man U is rather strange... You pick players like Yorke, Cole, Forlan, Djemba-Djemba and Bellion.<br><br>Yorke &amp; Cole were rather old already when they were sold (Past 30)... They left cos they knew they were no longer first choice when RVN came in and they won't get to play regularly.<br><br>Dwight joint Man u in 1998 for 12.6m and was sold to Blackburn Rovers for $2m in 2003. He was given a chance to join Celtic in 2001/02 but he decline preferring to stay back at Man U.<br><br>Andy Cole joint Man U in 1995 for a fee of $7m from Newcastle United and since he was not being played as RVN was then first choice, he left at the end of 2001 at the age of 30... also for Blackburn Rovers for a transfer fee of $8m.<br><br>Forlan... well, what can you say. 27 match without a goal for a striker was too much. He just showed that he wasn't able to adapt to the English game thats all.<br><br>For Djemba-Djemba, he couldn't live up to the billing so he had to go, simple as that. And Bellion, well he was a potential... but potentials don't aways live up to expectations right.<br><br>As for your players rejecting United: Berbatov, Zakora, Obi Mikel, Ballack...<br>Berbatov &amp; Zakora joint a club where their best player carrick wants and did joint United and they were guaranteed first team football at spurs where they will not get at united...<br><br>Obi Mikel... what can we say, best deal for united... $12m free money.<br><br>Ballack... you forgot to mention he turned down Real Madrid, Inter Milan &amp; Bayern Munich as well where he was worship like a hero cos no other club could offer him the most money apart from Chelsea.<br><br>And you asked, How many players have they attracted to join United... Well, all i know is definitely more than Liverpool. If you want to say players not wanting to join a club, why don't you mention Liverpool? Mikael Silvestre, Alan Smith, Nemanja Vidic... all were Liverpool's targets, all had offers from Liverpool at that time but they rather joint Man U than Liverpool.</div>

Cos from cole's point of view, there was no need for him to re-sign a new contract if he really wanted to leave. An improvement of additional 20 to 30 thousand a week is nothing compare to what he could get with Real or Chelsea 80 or 90,000 per week with a sign on fee of maybe $10 - $15m all for himself.<br><br>Its not logical, what i can see is he really wanted to stay at that point when he re-signed his contract.

Only it is current boss Rafa Benitez that was after him. Benitez wanted him badly but when he heard Man U were in for him, he didn't considered Liverpool's interest anymore.<br><br>Of course the players you mentioned won't even bat an eyelid when the red birds come calling i have no doubts about that. But how could you even compare Liverpool to clubs like (blackburn) and (everton)?<br><br>No disrespect to them but any half decent player will know which club to choose if you give them the choice of these 3 clubs. But if you change the clubs, it may be a different story altogether...<br><br>Trading players is like a business deal, either you are willing to pay or not, simple as that. If someone else is willing to pay more for them, they get the deal...  Sometimes even if you are willing to match the other club, the player may not even want to come like Silvestre's case.<br><br>What wonderkid are you talking about? I think you must be referring to the john guy right... As you have said, "yet-proven" to be frank, Apart from Chelsea, no other club in the world would be willing to pay $16m for a yet-proven nigerian not even in the national team, currently only a team player in the under-21. Man u got $12m out of it was probably the best transfer deal they have done in decades... I suspect Chelsea also paid that amount partly because they didn't want another tap-up case against them after the A cole problem as this case was being heard by Uefa and not the English FA.<br><br>There is no telling how a player will turn out also. Potential players are only that, "potential"... every few years we can see a few so called potential players disappear. Denielson i think that was his name, was said to be the next Pele when he first came out, and what happen to him after his world record transfer fee to Spain? There are just so many cases of these around.<br><br>Anyway, If you want to pay such an amount, might as well get a good establish player right? $16m for all you know, he won't even be playing much this or next year... or he could turn out to be an average player only. Even Duff, who i thought did quite well ended up on the bench for half his chelsea career. What a waste of time.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon insists the Spanish giants will not be held to ransom by Arsenal over the prospective signing of Jose Antonio Reyes.<br><br>The Spain forward declared last week he was desperate to seal his move to the Santiago Bernabeu "as soon as possible" and was left out of the Gunners' recent Champions League third-round qualifier against Dinamo Zagreb.<br><br>However, no deal has yet been agreed between the two clubs and although Real are still looking to sign Reyes, Calderon declared they will not pay over the odds for the 22-year-old.<br><br>"Reyes will only come if Arsenal agree to our terms," he told Real's official website.<br><br><strong>  "I'm not going to pay one euro (more). I'm sorry for the kid if the deal doesn't go through, but we don't have any agreement to sign Reyes. Arsenal have the last word." </strong><br><br>Calderon threw further doubt on the transfer of Reyes by claiming new Real coach Fabio Capello is concentrating his efforts on securing the signature of Lyon midfielder Mahamadou Diarra.<br><br></div>
