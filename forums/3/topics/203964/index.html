            <div class='col-md body'>JOSE REYES has sparked fury at Arsenal by posing in a Real Madrid shirt.<br><br><strong>Real target Reyes, 22, was happily snapped pulling on the famous white jersey.And former Gunners star Nigel Winterburn rapped: Â“IÂ’d never have done that.Â”<br><br>The winger has been trying to engineer a move to Madrid behind Arsenal boss Arsene WengerÂ’s back. Spaniard Reyes, 22, keeps giving interviews in Spain saying he is unhappy in London and wants a switch to the Bernabeu. When Arsenal pull him up on his remarks he insists he wants to stay.<br>But the damning photos printed in Spanish newspaper Marca yesterday will drive a wedge between himself and Gunners supporters.<br><br></strong><br><br>What an ungrateful player (Look at his smiling face posing in the Real jersey)and to think Wenger paid $20m for him... Now i think even if he goes, wenger won get $20m back as the player is begging to join the other club so Real will take it easy, maybe offer $15m only...<br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/0200636074600.jpg"><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/0200636074500.jpg"></div>

However ArsÃ¨ne Wenger insisted that his decision to drop the winger did not mean a transfer was imminent.<br><br>The noises coming out from Spain Earlier this week Reyes's agent Rodriguez de Moya told Spanish radio station Cadena Cope: "It appears that the clubs have begun talking and we are waiting to see if they reach an agreement.

Wenger tried to sign Baptista from Seville last summer, before being outbid by RealÂ’s Â£13.8m offer.<br><br>But landing the Brazilian in exchange for Reyes would be fraught with work permit complications, as Baptista does not possess a European passport and is not a regular international.<br><br>Gunners stars are urging Reyes to stay in London.<br></strong><br><br>Even if he is sold for $16.5m it will still be a lost for the gunners cos they have spent money developing his talent and now after 2 yrs he leave a better player than when he first arrived at the same price or worst a lesser price.<br><br>Real seems to know this is a steal and sadly the gunners can't do a thing about it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reyes isnt a loyal player at all. I would say his move to Arsenal has helped him develop alot as a player even if he hasnt adapted to life there.<br><br>More players are turning on the clubs that made them better players. Gone were the days where a player remains at a club for years.<br><br>I think this is the money world.<br><br>I think Arsenal shld just sell him and ashley cole away. Get the money.<br><br>Buy some better players like Ribery. Torres and some defenders.</div>
