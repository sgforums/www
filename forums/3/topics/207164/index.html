            <div class='col-md body'>I think arsenal left off from last season, where they lose to away teams.<br>This season first travel already loses to man city, I think the signs are there, arsenal will struggle again in their travels this season, and also partly reyes and cole wanting to leave does not help in their dressing room, and henry not playing well is also a factor 2.<br><br>If they struggle to beat teams at home, will they finish mid table come end of season at their new stadium?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Wenger never realised just how important senior players are. The loss of senior players like Vieira, Pires, Bergkamp have never really been solved. He has place too much faith on the young players. Walcott, Flamini, Eboue, Fabregas, Adebayor, Senderos they just don't have what it takes at the moment to be a Arsenal player.<br><br>And the central defender they should sign? Never come at all. Wenger doesn't seem to be on the look-out for a defender at all. If Toure gets injured who can they call on?They can't depend on Cygan at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Arsene Wenger insists there are plenty of reasons to be cheerful despite Arsenal's atrocious start to the Premiership season.<br><br>One point from their opening two games represents the Gunners' worst opening to a top- flight campaign in 14 years.<br><br>Although they do have a match in hand, Arsenal are already eight points adrift of early pacesetters Manchester United and with continuing uncertainty surrounding the futures of key duo Ashley Cole and Jose Antonio Reyes, there appears to be little immediate cause for optimism at the Emirates Stadium.<br><br>Wenger though can see positive signs. And he has words of reassurance for those Arsenal fans wondering how their club can balance the Â£357million cost of their immaculate new home with maintaining a squad capable of mounting a plausible title threat.<br><br>"We have only played two matches," he said.<br><br>"We will come back into the race, don't worry.<br><br>"We always knew we could suffer a little bit after the World Cup, especially because we had to play the Champions League qualifiers.<br><br>"We have had a disappointing start but there is a lot of hope in the way we play and mentally, we have to be strong enough to push that through."<br><br>Wenger could legitimately point to bad luck at crucial times as a factor in his side's first defeat to City since 1991.<br><br>But that would be to ignore some glaring inadequacies, notably a lack of steel in midfield, new signing Tomas Rosicky's failure to make an impact and, worryingly, City's ability to exploit the weaknesses of Cole's current stand-in Justin Hoyte.<br><br>"When you are not as sharp as you should be, you see it most in the final third," continued Wenger.<br><br>"We have to recognise that physically, we are not ready yet.<br><br>"But I hope this defeat will not affect our belief and confidence. We just need to keep going. We will soon start winning these type of games."<br><br>At least by the time Arsenal turn out again - against Middlesbrough on September 9 - the immediate futures of Cole and Reyes will be resolved.<br><br>It could also be that Wenger has landed Argentina international Javier Mascherano from Corinthians to give some much-needed physical presence in midfield.<br><br>The Gunners were certainly outmanoeuvred by Joey Barton and Ousmane Dabo in that area of the pitch against City as the Blues emerged from their own tortuous week to belatedly put a smile on their own supporters' faces.<br><br></div>
