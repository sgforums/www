            <div class='col-md body'>i think it is more thrilling to be ramming the ball into the net than at the pole, plus the difficulty level is slightly higher to aim at that one pole all the time, not to mention having a last man guarding it.<br><br>and if we replace it with uprights and net, it's not going to be much difference as compared to street soccer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what local soccer cmi? i don't care if local soccer can or cannot make it. anyway, i play soccer not to have dreams of making it to the national team, but to have fun and sweat it out. Furthermore, soccer promotes "racial harmony" when people of all races kicks play soccer together.<br><br>However, this is not the case for Basketball. As we all know people who like to play basketball are inspired from japanese manga like Slamdunk, more than watching real &amp; realistic basketball like NBA. Basketball are only played mostly by teenagers or bengs and they are usually chinese. Btw, i'm a 100% chinese. Do u see any malay, indian or eurasian playing? Yes...but its RARE! its almost like buying Toto! Furthermore, do u see adults playing basktetball or gathering to watch basketball NBA match at pubs or watever? NO!<br><br>Thus, my conclusion is that if local soccer CMI, then Basketball more CMI cos adults do not play it as they find it childish and the local Basketball team is virtually unknown of. Ask any guy on the street to name a local basketball player and chances are that he will say, "What???". Get my point? So...basketball players, grow up and u will dump your basketball balls as fast as u say Cannot Make It!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
