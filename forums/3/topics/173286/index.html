He's been there since ages ago.. and still leading out his team..<br><br>Why can't a player whom score goals, be a captain ? Isn't Lampard scoring a few? Even John Terry gets his fair share of goals.. so maybe those whom can't score make the best captain..

Alan Shearer is the captain becos players and fellow professionals respect him.. If your teammates doesn't respect you, even if you are at the grand age of 40yrs old, it doesn't matter..<br><br>Henry might be a magical player.. but if his gooners teammates respect him.. i can't see why he can't be the captain..<br><br>Rooney like-wise.. might be 20yrs old.. but if the older players respect his ability and his desire to work for the team...
