            <div class='col-md body'>ok guys , i really would like to comment on this , there are many people who play soccer at the basketball court , and the people playing basketball will have to give in , and sometimes those people playing soccer even got the cheek to tell those playing basketball ppl to leave the court. I don't think its right to do that. And they are occupying the whole court for long hours of playing soccer , as there are many ppl at the basketball cour waiting for next team and next team. And we the one playing basketball , sometimes cant play at all , we went to other basketball court , and there is also ppl playing soccer. Sometimes we are very angry. But we really can't do anything , most of them are big size and we have to leave when they cant score and will start to tell us to leave , and some even uses frustrated tone instead of nice way. And sometimes police will come , maybe called by the resident of the HDB flats around there , but when the police come , they will use their soccer ball and act like a basketball and started to play basketball and the police cant do anything also. and sometimes when we playing match at one of the court , they purposely ram the ball towards our court instead of another court , so as to chase us away. This is really frustrating for us basketballer , and sometimes they even threaten to fight , Guys , whats ur view on this? cos i tink its really unfair to the basketballer there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lack of streets soccer courts also dun give them the rights to use basketball court , then what about the basketballer? there are many cases of fighting between basketballer and soccer ppl , and pls dun give lack of streets soccer court as a reason , there is a street soccer court below my house , and there is another basketball court near my house , but i still saw ppl playing soccer at the basketball court. I thought of a way to stop this , make all the basketball court , those poles to become 1 pole instead of 2 poles , so that they wont be able to treat the 2 poles as goal post. basketballer still have the right.</div>
