            <div class='col-md body'>Arhhh Soccer....Reminds me and my friend used to play at basketball court, get caught by police, then shift to void deck. My friend accidentally smash the ceiling light and we shift to the grass patch near the a chinese temple. And we end up hitting the lamps for one in the temple. The guys in the guys temple was so mad that he threaten to confiscate our ball. Those were the days but we still prefer to play soccer on the basketball court. And no, we dun ram at ppl to scare them away, we just pass the ball in a very fast speed <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
