            <div class='col-md body'>Ask yourselves a very honest question, How many times have Liverpool been linked to a player and a few days later Newcastle suddenly gets into the race to land the player? Let me name a few players - Parker, Solano, Duff, Dani Alves, Alonso. The best hijack that Newcastle did was the signing of Boumsong, Thank god they signed the clown for 6.5mil or L'Pool<br>would have made a big loss in that circus entertainer.<br><br>The most famous one would have to be the jacking of Owen, Because Shephard and Souness knows that no way Owen would have gone to the Toons if Liverpool were in bid for him too. Like Wright-Phillips said that he never regretted his move to Chelsea which ruined his chance at getting a WC place in Sven's squad. Owen said he love the Jailbird's fans and stadium to comfort himself<br><br>I'll name players and the offer Liverpool was rumoured to have offered or officially stated<br><br>Parker - L'Pool offered 5,000,000, Newcastle offered 6,500,000<br>Solano - L'Pool rumoured to have offerd 2,000,000, Newcastle offered 3,500,000 or something<br>Duff - L'Pool rumoured to have offered 8,000,00 (rejected), Newcastle rumoured to have offered 11,000,000<br>Dani Alves - Rick Parry confirmed a bid from 6,000,000 to 9,000,000, Newcastle linked to a 12,000,000 to 15,000,000 bid<br>Alonso - L'Pool got him for 10,500,000, A last minute bid from Newcastle which fell-through because Alonso signed for Pool<br>Boumsong - L'Pool offered 5,000,000, Newcastle got for 6,500,000<br>Kuyt - L'Pool rumoured to be interested, Newcastle officially joined the race to land the player<br>Owen - L'Pool's 10,000,000 bid was thought to be a done deal, Newcastle suddenly offered 17,000,000 to make it fall-through<br>Wright-Phillips - Although no info was given, Newcastle was almost linked after Liverpool<br>Kilgallon - Top clubs are currently on the trail of this defender from Leeds, Apparently L'Pool and Jailbirds are interested<br>Milner - At that time both entered about the same time, But Newcastle was considered a safer choice then &lt;=== LOL<br><br>Well well, There are more players but I forgot who they are.. If I'm not wrong Kewell was also involved but he was a Red<br>since he was a young boy. Zenden was snapped by the time Jailbirds were interested<br><br>Now we have already more less settled Gonzalez's transfer and Newcastle would probably not want Bellamy. But Middlesborough<br>may have a good harvest this season because Liverpool have offered 1,500,000 for Viduka, Jailbirds would prolly offer 5,000,000<br><br>One more season or two without CL qualifications would see the club in debts far heavier than what Leeds had amounted,<br>Now that they owe the bank a extravagant 45,000,000<br><br>Maybe Rafa could trick the Newcastle scouts and Shephard into believing we want to keep Diao and Cheyrou then they would make a bid for them<br><br>**Source taken from www.liverpoolzone.com<br><br>Seriously, Not only are they stalking Liverpool's scouts, They are also stalking Manu and Arsenal's scouts.. They can only use money to outbid the clubs but based on status and stability, Newcastle is just as safe as Reading with Roeder in charge.<br><br>Maybe Newcastle would have a better chance at signing players from S-League<br><br>Now let's watch Newcastle bid twice the price of Manu's 12,000,000 bid for Carrick, I hope Shephard enjoys drinking Coca-Cola!</div>
