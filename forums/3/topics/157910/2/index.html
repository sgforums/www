One think i can't understand people mentality is that Chelsea only won one title after 50 years and people are already complaining its bad for the english game and that this second title is already in the bag, and epl become more boring becoz no competition anymore blah blah.<br><br>COME ON, they have only won one title so far and people are already bitching around, WHAT about that time MAN UTD won 4 in a row, well i guess those bitching comes from those glory hunters of man utd, arsenal and liverpool.<br><br>What? you said chelsea will surely win and dominate EPL for the next couple of years or as long as abra is around? WELL WAIT TILL THAT DAY COMES THEN YOU START BITCHING.<br><br>WHAT? you can't stand those ARROGANT CHELSEA FANS? ARE YOU TELLING ME Man Utd 's players and FANS are not arrogant during the glory 1999 ? or when they won 4 titles in a row? ARE you telling me SOME SECTION OF the arsenal fans are not arrogant when they go 49 games unbeaten? ARE you telling me NO , NOT A SINGLE LIVERPOOL  fan is arrogant when they won the champions leauge?<br><br>Come on man, arrogance is always arround, take it or leave it.<br><br>Note: I am no Chelsea fan, but i come in contact with alot of chelsea haters and that is starting to piss me off, give credit when its due people. They may not have a history like Man Utd or Liverpool, but in terms of the current suiation, they are the best in England whether you like it or not. And please dont start with the money crap things. </div></blockquote>liverpool fans are just using the champions league win to cover up their disappointment in not winning the premiership.<br><br></div>

It's fine, thanks for your concern. I do wonder how you can assume their jerseys were bought a few seasons back. You mean you have the statistics of all the United jerseys sold for the past few years? Unless you can back up your claim with real facts and figures, please refrain from even posting anything.<br></blockquote>Lets check, their sales is suxx compare to the pass few years. Their report statement shows that clearly. May be you should change a doctor for your eyes?

Of course at the moment United have no trophies. No one can deny that. Although, I wish to point out to you, overall United have more trophies and more pedigree than Chelsea. It's going to take a long time before Chelsea even goes some way to matching that.<br></blockquote>Yeah, this Man U thropies are pass = HISTORY. You reminding me Nort. Forest, they won quite a lots of throphies also, but now...? Man U will be the next.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by tombadgerlock:<br>The club have bought Edwin van der Sar and Park Ji Sung for this season, both of whom have proved rather useful so far. They may not be great players in the mould of Zidane, Shevchenko or Henry, but then I don't see Frank Lampard superseding Zidane nor do I think Drogba is ever going to be held in as high esteem as a Shevchenko or a Henry.<br><br>Fact is, Chelsea's money has inflated the prices for Drogba, Essien, Wright-Phillips. These players were bought far above their true market value. The price of a player is not the surest way to indicate his greatness.<br><br>While transfer funds for Manchester United will be rather limited for the foreseeable future, there has been word that a certain sum will be available every season for the manager to spend as he sees fit.<br></blockquote>Edwin van der Sar and Park Ji Sung? Cheap papaya. Shows that they are really lack of fund, obviously. Very weak balance sheet,<br></div>
