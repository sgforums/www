            <div class='col-md body'>It isnt very nice for people to laugh at man utd's plight, and it isnt very mature of you people either to laugh at chelsea's draw as well. Teams got their ups and downs, no matter how strong or on form a team is, they are bound to slip some way through the season, but good teams tends to get up on thier feet more quickly after a slip. Man Utd had thier downs, but they responded well and went on to win many trophies, so whats the big deal in Chelsea slipping? Chelsea can be beaten but maybe they dont get beaten that often nowadays, they are humans after all remember?<br><br>HafizulKMS, I think you targetting man utd supporters is not such a good idea. People around the world are labelling chelsea and their fans as arrogant now that they are winning, remember the time when they also labelled Arsenal and thier fans as arrogant during the 49 games unbeaten period? With your comments, I felt you are further justifying their perspective of chelsea fans as being arrogant. Prove them wrong and silence the critics by being humble and have a big heart, don't be narrow minded and respect your opponents, if you can achieve that, you can prove to those bandwagon anti-chelsea faction that in this world, HUMBLE and MATURE chelsea fans DO EXSISTs. But if you can't do that, then you are no better than those bandwagon anti-chelsea faction themselves <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I am a Neutral fan as far as the EPL teams are concern. Prove them wrong HafizulKMS <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
