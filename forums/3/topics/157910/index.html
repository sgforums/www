            <div class='col-md body'>Some low IQ babies may argue, they won because they spent a lot.<br><br>Perhaps you are right, but I say you are wrong!<br><br>Lets see, our dear Liver-poor, you think they spent less?<br><br>How much does Morientes cost? How about Cisse? How about Crouch? Xabi Alonso? then Luis Garcia? How about Sissoko? and Jose Reina (the best Spanish goal, claimed to be)?<br><br>None of them are cheap.<br><br>But I can't believe they struggling to score one goal agaists 10 lousy Blackburn players. Just one lucky goal.<br><br>Though they spent, in total less than Super-Chelsea, but that kind of performance convincing?<br><br>Think about it, money is not the only element for Chelsea success.

In normal situations, he should be shouting scolding the defenders, but he didnt..... cos it's not thier fault, Zola was too incredible!<br>my fav player of all time, but he's old already now....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Then wait until then you come here and talk about it. Now this assumption is still too far to be realistic. VERY FAR INDEED!<br><br>BUT, if you want to worry about which club will have such problem first, like financial problem, or even bankrupt and etc. Then you should be worried for MAN U. They really fuk up this time. The stupid businessman bought over the club, and he is in serious debt, and the crying babies fans DONÂ’T support their own club by not buying their club junks (jersey, and etc).<br><br>PLUS, they are not winning any trophy at the moment! The owner must be jumping in the hot water like sh!t now.<br><br>Man U financial problem is very obvious by looking at the recent transfers, they are really limited by available funds.<br><br>Who fuk up? Man U lah!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yeah, if you are comparing the commercial values, Chelsea will catch up with Man U, or even Real Madrid very soon. Just see the number of sponsor deals they sign recently, they are making money, in fact.<br><br>Think about it, investment is about, you spent, and you generate profits. Chelsea just started, why so worry about bankrupt or dept?<br><br>Abu have the brain too, you think he is really a plain stupid idiot like some of the coconuts here, who only know Chelsea will bankrupt after they spent a lots?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually from the way the season has gone so far, if Abramovic didnt support Chelsea, the title is going back to Man Utd again, Arsenal is stuttering (no vieira no henry), Liverpool still needs time (may be they can win it, but certainly their last few games isnt convincing enough though), newcaslte needs to be more balance and consistent, tottenham may be can surprise a few ppl and can even challedge for top 4, but certaining it would take more to win the title, carlton , wigan and those teams may not last the pace.<br><br>From a neutral point of view, at least we won't get to see either Man Utd or Arsenal win the title again. One think i can't understand people mentality is that Chelsea only won one title after 50 years and people are already complaining its bad for the english game and that this second title is already in the bag, and epl become more boring becoz no competition anymore blah blah.<br><br>COME ON, they have only won one title so far and people are already bitching around, WHAT about that time MAN UTD won 4 in a row, well i guess those bitching comes from those glory hunters of man utd, arsenal and liverpool.<br><br>What? you said chelsea will surely win and dominate EPL for the next couple of years or as long as abra is around? WELL WAIT TILL THAT DAY COMES THEN YOU START BITCHING.<br><br>WHAT? you can't stand those ARROGANT CHELSEA FANS? ARE YOU TELLING ME Man Utd 's players and FANS are not arrogant during the glory 1999 ? or when they won 4 titles in a row? ARE you telling me SOME SECTION OF the arsenal fans are not arrogant when they go 49 games unbeaten? ARE you telling me NO , NOT A SINGLE LIVERPOOL  fan is arrogant when they won the champions leauge?<br><br>Come on man, arrogance is always arround, take it or leave it.<br><br>Note: I am no Chelsea fan, but i come in contact with alot of chelsea haters and that is starting to piss me off, give credit when its due people. They may not have a history like Man Utd or Liverpool, but in terms of the current suiation, they are the best in England whether you like it or not. And please dont start with the money crap things.</div>
