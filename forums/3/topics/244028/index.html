He kicked me.<br><br>"Maybe people don't like me because I'm too good."<br><br>Ferguson raged to MUTV: "It's a clear penalty kick.<br><br>"I don't know what they're going on about. If it had been any other player they wouldn't have bothered. I think it's because it was Ronaldo, it's a shame that. It's putting a stigma on the boy which is not deserved.<br><br>"And I saw the interview he had and he was magnificent. It was a poor interview, a disgraceful interview. Just stretching it out, hoping the boy trips himself up.<br><br>"He (Sky interviewer Geoff Shreeves) doesn't understand how intelligent the boy is. It was a poor interview and I was disgusted with it. Sky should have a good look at themselves."<br><br>He added: "He's a great player, a fantastic player, phenomenal.<br><br>"We've had some great players at this club and I've been proud to say in my 20 years we've had fantastic players. He's up there with the best of them, without question." </span></div>

Is that to say that Ronaldo himself is not a talent player? No dribbling skills? No passing skills? No good shots on goal? I think it's a bit of a sweeping statement to disregard that Ronaldo is a good player whether or not he cheats. His contribution this season in particular goes beyond the penalties he earned and converted.<br><br>Like the two chances he set up for Park Ji-Sung and Rooney against Bolton. If he was just good for earning penalties and free-kicks, then we wouldn't be hearing rumours about other teams like Barca and Real Madrid wanting him.<br><br>I can't say I like Ronaldo's personality, but I can't deny he is a good player either. Man U has greatly benefitted from his runs and passes this season.</div>

He kicked me.<br><br>"Maybe people don't like me because I'm too good."<br><br>Ferguson raged to MUTV: "It's a clear penalty kick.<br><br>"I don't know what they're going on about. If it had been any other player they wouldn't have bothered. I think it's because it was Ronaldo, it's a shame that. It's putting a stigma on the boy which is not deserved.<br><br>"And I saw the interview he had and he was magnificent. It was a poor interview, a disgraceful interview. Just stretching it out, hoping the boy trips himself up.<br><br>"He (Sky interviewer Geoff Shreeves) doesn't understand how intelligent the boy is. It was a poor interview and I was disgusted with it. Sky should have a good look at themselves."<br><br>He added: "He's a great player, a fantastic player, phenomenal.<br><br>"We've had some great players at this club and I've been proud to say in my 20 years we've had fantastic players. He's up there with the best of them, without question." </span></div></blockquote>GP, thanks for posting this...
