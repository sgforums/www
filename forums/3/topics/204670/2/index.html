But he still was a very good player during his time but maybe not as famous as the 4 you mentioned<br><br>Perhaps he can qualify as a 2nd tier legend along with the likes of Gordon Banks, Hristo Stoichkov, Zico, Best, Rivaldo, Michel Platini, Gheorghe Hagi, known as The Maradona of the Carpathians. All very good individual players in their time and player people will continue to remember in years to come.<br><br>Maybe we can squeeze 2 more names in along with pele, maradona, cruyff and backenbeuer.<br><br>How about : EusÃ©bio and Zinedine Zidane?<br><br>I know some people will disagree with Zizu but remember him 6 to 8 yrs ago... The player that brought back France first World Cup, scoring 2 goals against Brazil and also the European Cup. And even at 34, he almost did it again if not for the headbutt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it depends on how you define a legend.<br><br>batigo is definitely a legend to fiorentina and argentina.  maybe not to football as a whole.<br><br>as far as i am concern a player is a legend to his club or country if he performs very well for a long period of time or broke the records.<br><br>alan shearer is a legend at newcastle<br>paulo maldini is a legend at milan<br>ian rush is a legend at liverpool.<br></div>

And as being discussed earlier, he is a legend for Fiorentina and Argentina. Not the world.<br><br>It's the contribution which Zocoss is talking about. If there's a topic titled "Legends of Fiorentina", the name Batistuta definitely pops out. If you think Kevin Campbell has contributed a lot to Arsenal, then yes he is a Arsenal legend to you. It's an opinion. Legend is based on opinions. If a player is remembered by tons of people for his contribution, these people will agree he is a legend. If he is not, then there will be debates coming out.<br><br>If being asked legends of Fiorentina, tons will point out Batistuta. Will you? If you don't, not that you are wrong, just that you are one of the minority who thinks that he is not. Likewise, if being asked legends of Arsenal, if you point Kevin Campbell, then again its not that you are wrong, just that you are again one of the minority that's all.<br><br>Or I say Antonio Bennarivo is a legend of Parma, do you agree with me? Ask the Parma fans, this will be one of the very first few names to be spilled out. No to you, but yes to us. Hope you get what I'm trying to say.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><strong>GABRIEL BATISTUTA IS A FIORENTINA AND ARGENTINA LEGEND.</strong> Do you agree?</div>
