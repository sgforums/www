And as being discussed earlier, he is a legend for Fiorentina and Argentina. Not the world.<br><br>It's the contribution which Zocoss is talking about. If there's a topic titled "Legends of Fiorentina", the name Batistuta definitely pops out. If you think Kevin Campbell has contributed a lot to Arsenal, then yes he is a Arsenal legend to you. It's an opinion. Legend is based on opinions. If a player is remembered by tons of people for his contribution, these people will agree he is a legend. If he is not, then there will be debates coming out.<br><br>If being asked legends of Fiorentina, tons will point out Batistuta. Will you? If you don't, not that you are wrong, just that you are one of the minority who thinks that he is not. Likewise, if being asked legends of Arsenal, if you point Kevin Campbell, then again its not that you are wrong, just that you are again one of the minority that's all.<br><br>Or I say Antonio Bennarivo is a legend of Parma, do you agree with me? Ask the Parma fans, this will be one of the very first few names to be spilled out. No to you, but yes to us.
