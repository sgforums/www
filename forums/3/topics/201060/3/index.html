            <div class='col-md body'>THIERRY HENRY has warned losing Ashley Cole to rivals Chelsea would be a massive blow for Arsenal.<br><br>Gunners skipper Henry fears it will be a similar setback to losing Patrick Vieira to Juventus last season.<br><br>The French hitman said: Â“Let me make it clear Â— I donÂ’t know what is happening with Ashley Cole.<br><br>Â“But the fact remains that if Ashley goes, we would be losing one of the teamÂ’s best assets for the second year running.<br><br>Â“Ashley was tremendous in the World Cup. That is a fact. People can say what they want but he would be very difficult to replace.Â”<br><br>Chelsea hope to secure England star ColeÂ’s move across London for around Â£20million this week.<br><br>Henry, 28, added: Â“The loss of Vieira was massive Â— like it would be if Ashley goes.<br><br>Â“Obviously we want him to stay. He is one of the best left-backs in the world. We would miss him badly.<br><br>Â“We already have injuries to Clichy, Senderos and Adebayor. We have a lot of players out.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t know anything about the situation with Chelsea.<br><br>Â“But if he goes there it will look like we are trying to catch a team at the same time as giving them one of our best assets. It would be difficult to take.Â”</div>

That's in the hands of Peter Kenyon and Roman and the board but they told me 100% no chance.<br><br>'Ashley Cole is Arsenal's player and they have the power in their hands to say yes or no.<br><br>'We have the power in our hands to say how far our offer goes. The offer went to the limit.<br><br>'The club does not move one single pound more and I completely agree with that.<br><br>'Our offer is an excellent offer for an excellent player. It's in their hands. They say no and no is no.'<br><br>Mourinho claims he will now turn his attention to possible alternatives but Arsenal know there is a shortage of left-backs in Cole's class.<br><br>The Chelsea boss said: 'We have been looking all the time at other players.<br><br>'When you try to sign a player, you can't think this is the only player in the world you can get.<br><br>'You have to look at some alternatives. Of course he was an important choice for us but I believe he was also an important choice for them and they probably want to keep him.'<br><br>Arsenal would like to sign Chelsea's William Gallas but Mourinho revealed the unsettled France defender was not part of the Chelsea offer.<br><br>Mourinho said: 'It's a pure-and-simple financial offer. It's a figure Chelsea have offered and Arsenal have said no.'<br><br>Gallas angered Mourinho by failing to report for pre-season training on time after the World Cup.<br><br>He preferred to extend his holiday in Guadeloupe, did not start training until Monday and has not played in any of the club's pre-season games.<br><br>The France international has less than a year remaining on his contract and has said in the past he wants to leave Stamford Bridge for a new challenge.<br><br>Mourinho does not want to lose him but admits he will not play any part in the FA Community Shield against Liverpool on Sunday.<br><br>Asked if Gallas will feature in Cardiff, Mourinho said: 'No, he won't be involved.<br><br>'I make the decisions and it is a decision based on everything. He still has heavy legs from the beach in Guadeloupe.'<br></div>
