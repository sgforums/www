Cole's contract would have ended if he didn't sign a new one last year... and they would have sold him for $8m last year cos his contract only got 1 yr left... or he could have walk away for nothing and straight into chelsea for free. Now cannot, now its 20m or go fly kite to chelsea.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> [/b]</div>

He got rid of one old player for $11m and got a young one at 15m so good business sense. Not like chelsea, sold their left back too early now no left back then desperate, Balls kanna squeezed by arsenal until no choice.<br><br>See chelsea, i listed the players... looks like theirs balls gets squeezed all the time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  and now its Arsenal's turn to squeezed it real hard for all the dough they can get out of it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Way to go gunners, A Cole would have gone for nnothing had he not been so stupid to sign a new contract last year.

            <div class='col-md body'>i think many think tt jus becos chel$ki got the money, they can flaunt it. they r so wrong.<br><br>abro is not stupid (maybe he is). he knows the buck gotta stop sometime sooner or later. he may have billions, but @ the rate they r being flogged by other clubs, the returns they are getting is far less than the sum of its parts.<br><br>jus becos they can afford to bleed the way they do, doesn't mean they should. their corporate governance is ruled by 1 person; a house built on a deck of cards. clearly `doing things right' ruled over `doing the right thing'.<br><br>I think players/clubs knows that the `heydays' may be numbered. So, they will squeeze as hard to the day Chel$ki thinks tt enuf is enuf. And tt, i think it will also the the beginning of the end for chel$ki.<br><br>btw, i wud love ashley cole to go to chel$ski for a high 20+m pnd. the gunners can potentially buy 2 very good players to add to the squad. i actually think the gunners will go very well this coming season, regardless of cole's deal.</div>

A player that couldn't make it to Barce or RM,  His experience at Arsenal have improve him and now he think of going back, how ungrateful...<br><br>Anyway, good player from England stay in England, same as with Spain, Italy and Germany. You see, Gerrard, Rooney, Terry, Rio all these could make it to the RM or Barce but they rather stay in England. Same with Buffon, and the other italian players if not force by circumstances at Juve, they wouldn't leave... and the whole German 1st team play in Germany only one just left to join chelsea cos of money.<br><br>These countries league are big so they don't need to go to another country to play.

Just that day reported that Chelsea lost more money in flop signings for the pass 3 years... and you know what, the amount was not even half of what Arsenal spent to buy new player during the whole of those 3 years.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> How amazing...<br><br>At least at man u, the flops came with low transfer fee but at chelsea, their flops are super huge transfer fee flops. Just one SWP can cover all Man u flops and got extra somemore...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
