Did I say anything about you man utd fans predicting a man utd win all the time ??? I know they are a top club too so your prediction sound perfectly normal to me and I have been predicting man utd to win the last few matches and it all hit but however bolton is high-flying now and their counter-attack style will shake man utd defence thus i am prediction an upset.Nothing wrong with predicting an upset with valid reason<br><br>and even if my prediction are wrong it does not mean that i can't predict chelsea to win and ANYWAY My predictions on chelsea matches have so far been ACCURATE<br><br>And I never predict all loses for others "team".LOOK CAREFULLY PLEASE I just predicted Top Club Like Arsenal to win over EVERTON And other team like Porstmouth to win over Reading.<br><br>And chelsea will not make singapore pools close down as the odds are so low and one upset the person put alot of money then he can say hallelujah gg</span></div>
