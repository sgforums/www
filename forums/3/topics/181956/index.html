            <div class='col-md body'>even tho i'm a Man Utd fan but i personnally feel that it would be a pity that Benitez leaves Liverpool... i always tot Liverpool is a better team under him then they have been under the last couple of managers. look at the way their defence performs under him.. not much has changed since the last manager but all of a sudden they became one of the meanest defence in the league.. however, his choices of strikers to make the current team is pretty strange at times.. might probably be due to the amount of money available to him, but if more transfer funds is given to him, i think Liverpool would probably be alot better then they are right now..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i says buying players is everything.<br><br>if buying players is not everything then what is? butter trade them?? pray to god that he will drop a god send player aka Nike's ads figuring R9? or praying to god that Fowler can turn back the clock and bring along with him speed of Owen, play making skill of John Barns (how do you spell his name) football brains of Ian Rush???<br><br>look, the current thing about football is not only about the love of the game its about money and to have money they will need success in the pitch and need it fast, couldn't afford to breed a young player like the olden days unless the young player so happen to mature well to take over (like what Man Utd managed to during the mid 90's)<br><br>buying right players may not means immdiately success but buying wrong players will sure to pull your team down. so do you agree that buying players means everything now????<br><br>RM policies is different, there, its the pesident that is playing CM game everyday.. the choices of players to be brought into the club doesn't usually belongs to the manager, its always for the benefit of their marketing dept, in Liverpool its the manager's call, but with money enough just to buy a national standard player you dun expect a world class player's club to sell them cheap to you right?<br><br>Veron and Forlan??? they're classic example of buying wrong players, they are good no doubt about it but they just couldn't fit into the English game and when that happens its consider the manager's fault but its also considered as buying players dun you agree?<br><br>so 1 more time... <span class="large"><strong>buying players is everything</strong></span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
