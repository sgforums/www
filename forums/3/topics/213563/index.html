That is a decision which I regret.<br><br>"[Wayne] Rooney dived on that occasion.<br><br>"It was on a day when we did not deserve to lose."<br><br>That match was also followed by the infamous 'Battle of the Buffet' in the players' tunnel.<br><br>Wenger, though, insists his relationship with great rival Sir Alex Ferguson, the Manchester United manager, has now mellowed somewhat.<br><br>He said: "There is less aggression than there was before because we have both calmed down, and our relationship has become in a much more normal way.<br><br>"I hope we can continue at that level." </span><br><br>too bad for wenger or else maybe can get 50 plus more games unbeaten run</div>

Lehmann told German television the note, which has also appeared in a documentary about the World Cup, would be auctioned for charity.<br><br>In translation it reads: 1. Riquelme left high; 2.

The Dutchman, who went on to score a superb second in the 2-1 win, was playing in a withdrawn striker's role on the left hand side. From the manager's perspective, it is a formation that allows the midfielders to flourish.<br><br>"I feel away from home especially it gives more licence to Hleb and Fabregas to go forward," said Wenger. "We look a little bit more balanced and we have got our best results like this.<br><br>"Hleb played very well. He is getting better and better. In the first half when we were in trouble I felt he took the ball and created things.<br><br>"You could see when Rosicky came on as well that there is some class in these players and they can create football that is not only efficient but attractive to watch."</span><br><br>i did not knew hleb was that good.........I only know Cesc is a good player and will be a great playmaker in the future</div>
