            <div class='col-md body'>Boss reflects on an 'awful' afternoon 27/10/2007 19:15<br><span style="color: green;"><br><img src="http://picsrv.mcfc.co.uk/?fif=/mcfc/img_502_9836.jpg&amp;obj=iip,1.0&amp;wid=150&amp;hei=150&amp;rgn=0,0,0,0&amp;cvt=jpeg"><br><br>Sven-Goran Eriksson has reflected on the 6-0 beating at Chelsea and apologised straight away for the performance of his team.<br><br>Afterwards he told us: Â“IÂ’m sorry. IÂ’m sorry for our performance, IÂ’m sorry for the fans who travelled down and hoped to see play good football.<br><br>Â“I think we started ok, but if you are not prepared to defend much, much better than we did today, things like that happen.Â”<br><br>Despite a bright start where City had matched Chelsea, EssienÂ’s goal after 16 minutes gave the home side the impetus, but it could have been so different had Martin PetrovÂ’s fine free-kick gone into the top corner it was flying towards before CechÂ’s intervention.<br><br>Instead the London side doubled their lead on 31 minutes thanks to Didier Drogba and that left SvenÂ’s men with an uphill task heading towards the break.<br><br>He said: Â“Of course itÂ’s very bad being 2-0 down at half time and trying to get it right. Then after three and four, the heads were very much down and we came off even worse, thatÂ’s not good. I hope that we have learnt something.<br><br>Â“You canÂ’t give them the possibility to have so much space and time. Five of the six goals they were alone with Joe Hart and if you allow that in 90 minutes itÂ’s very bad.<br><br>Â“We were taught a lesson today. ItÂ’s good to play good football and to attack, but when you lose the ball you have to do much better than we did today. Nothing has changed, it is just a very good reminder that this is not good enough and that is it.Â”<br><br>Eriksson was evidently uncharacteristically exasperated at his sideÂ’s performance and is keen that they put it behind them sooner, rather than later.<br><br>He added: Â“Tomorrow [Sunday] morning weÂ’ll be talking and working. WeÂ’re lucky to have a game on Wednesday, a difficult game away in The Carling Cup at Bolton. ItÂ’s better to wait two or three days than a whole week for a game.Â”<br></span></div>
