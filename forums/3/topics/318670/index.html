              <p>Chelsea , being Chelsea, are never and will never be gracious in defeat..How old is that Dylan ? Lamenting and whining about dog poo = luck in the game? Eh? Those sore losers of the Chelsea fans are really the fair weathered fans who knows nuts about Chelsea FC's history? Only when Mr Big Bucks come, the influx of Chelsea fans emerged and there began a new chapter in Chelsea's fanbase in Singapore.. Why not if Roman comes to Derby County and spend his bucks if not more on that team, i guarantee, Derby will the be the next most supported team after the big 3 (arsenal, Man Utd, Liverpool)..You will see derby shirts everywhere and yet knows SHIT about Derby FC and the history..</p>
              <p>I was in a pub where there's a mix of Chelsea and Man Utd fans equally spread..For the first half was this really fanatic Chelsea fan waving his scarf all around..and when Ronaldo scored, he literally spat at my face with peanuts et al... You are just lucky la..Just lucky...We will win! We will win (I am of course, decked in Man Utd colours..sitting and drinking) Then i asked him, Chelsea came a long way since Gullit's days...He looked at me and asked me..What jersey number Gullit is wearing..</p>
              <p>-_-"</p>
              <p>I told him Jersey no.5 (which belongs to Essien obviously) and there he went shouting Gullit Gullit when ever Essien touches the ball which is admirably a bold move i made making heads turn to look at him..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Then 2nd half, i made another conversation with an elder Englishman in his 50s who is really a die hard fan of Chelsea..and he intrigued me with his First X11 of all the years from 1990..He knows Furlong, Cascarino, Gavin Peacock, Le Saux, Andy Townsend, Ken Monkou, Erland Johnsen..and he oftens complains to me during the matches that nowadays Chelsea fans are supporting out of blind fame for the club..they see Chelsea like their God Mode fantasy club whereas they do not know jack about their club..Doubt they even know who Ken Bates is..</p>
              <p>You call Manchester United, undeserving? Well, who are the champions yet again? Whose club has the baby captain? Even Vialli did better with Chelsea than Mourinho...Talk is cheap but facts do not lie.. Far superior goal difference ( why didnt chelsea score more then?) Crybaby of a loser captain (give him a pacifier, for goodness sake) Worst tempered player i ever seen in Drogba (he makes Keane look like a pussy but at least Keane is a Champions League medal winner) Mind games that dont work (gotta try harder Mr Next Manager of Chelsea)</p>

              <p>You sure could grow up Mr. Ghimp..You're the type of typical Chelsea "fan" that people loves to hate.. And as much as what a certain Mr. Master was describing earlier, you sure seem to fit the bill as a fair weathered fan during the Mourinho era. What are you trying to prove by posting this same thread in so many forums? A Hate CFCSG campaign? I'm guessing that you're sore over being kicked out of the group, don't even get me started on why you were kicked out. I'm not sure whther you would want your dirty laundry published.</p>
              <p>Well as much as there were a huge influx of Chelsea fans suddenly when Roman arrives, and are graded as everyone else as a bunch of glory hunters or fair weathered fans, i post the same question back to em. Why did you support your current team be it Man Utd, Arsenal, Liverpool.. Supporting your team for more then a decade since the start of the premier league era might make you seem like a diehard supporter, but then again aren't you a glory hunter yourself too?Especially those Man Utd fans in their 20's and late teens now since Man Utd are the most successful team since the introduction of the premier league.What made you support em or subsequently fall in love with em, winning many pieces of silverware sure makes supporting a club easier.</p>
              <p>The likes of Man Utd, Liverpool and Arsenals are the club to support, you guys love em but yet what right do you have to call the Chelsea fans fair weather or glory hunters? If they did continue supporting Chelsea down to the next decade, won't they be in the same shoes as you now? One can start by supporting a club through its successful times, but whether he is a true supporter or a fair weathered one will be seen when the club goes through trouble and whether he sticks to the club through thick and thin.</p>
              <p>Heck, you might even want to applaud a guy for being a Nottingham Forest supporter if you can find one in Singapore now, but then again if he told you that he started supporting em in the late 70's or early 80's during their most successful period including the European Cup, wouldn't he be labelled as a Glory Hunter back then?</p>
              <p>It is difficult for a Singaporean to support a club without status or name when we have no affilations with it, especially with our media only showing the big clubs. This explains the why 99% of football fans in the EPL supports the big 4.</p>
              <p>One can only wonder why most of the supporters are either Liverpool or Man Utd fans.</p>

              in all due respect to Mr Ghimpheng, a Chelsea forum is naturally biased towards Chelsea. Do you expect CFCSG putting "Glory Glory Man Utd"?
                                           
              This match was a great and fair match, but some of the ref's decisions were against Chelsea. 
                                                  
              to Master -_-, while i agree that SOME Chelsea fans are like that, please do not stereotype Chelsea fans, as i know lots of united supporters are like that too. ironic. ABMs came up because of those united supporters and ABCs came up because of those chelsea ones.
                                                 
              You stated "You call Manchester United, undeserving? Well, who are the champions yet again? Whose club has the baby captain? Even Vialli did better with Chelsea than Mourinho...Talk is cheap but facts do not lie.. Far superior goal difference ( why didnt chelsea score more then?) Crybaby of a loser captain (give him a pacifier, for goodness sake) Worst tempered player i ever seen in Drogba (he makes Keane look like a pussy but at least Keane is a Champions League medal winner) Mind games that dont work (gotta try harder Mr Next Manager of Chelsea)"
                                                  
               
              And with all due respect to you Master -_-, John Terry is a man who would put his body on the line for club and country. He is a man who deserves respect. When you miss a critical penalty, how would you feel? Even my friend who's a united supporter thought the same. So, it's either you're inhumane, or you're an asshole. I think both
                                                  
                                                 
               I take it from that statement that you're bias against Chelsea, which makes you a typical Manchester United fan. The kind of person who looks down on everyone except united. The kind of supporter (well, there're some in every club), who everyone hates. The kind of supporter who brags in a win, and whines in a defeat.
                                                  
                                                  
              Dont tell me if united loses, no one would say the defeat is unfair. 
                                
                                
              You stated that Drogba is the worst tempered player you've ever seen. I think you've just supported united only since you didn see mark hughes, or even eric cantona in their personal assults. Keane ended the career of someone. Im sure the next best thing to that would be killing someone personally on the pitch eh? You're not making any sense.
                                                  
                                                  
              Dude, if you're taking this chance to flame Chelsea fans, i'd have nothing to say. 
                                                  
                                                  
              BTW, i supported Chelsea since Zola's time. Given that im still young, dont be too quick to brand me as someone who hopped onto the Roman bandwagon.
                                                  
                                                 
               Dylan didn call united as undeserving. He just pointed out that if the ref gave some critical kicks (like the one when rio brought down joe cole), Chelsea would have won long ago. Do you dare to say it's not true?
                                                  
                                                  
              Anyway it's over, congrats to united.
                                                  
                                                  
              Come on Mister -_-. Im sure you wanna prove me wrong.
                                                  
                                                  
               Please do it soon.

              <p>As you can obviously see from my post count, this is my first sojourn to this forum so to begin, hello everyone!!!</p>
              <p>Let's call a spade a spade: I am a Chelsea fan. Feel free to start hurling insults my way, but I implore you to merely hear me out for just a moment...</p>
              <p>Everyone, let us take a moment to reflect on this matter. Would any among you enjoy having the contents of the conversations on your "Boys'/Girls' Night Out" be made available to the wife/husband or girlfriend/boyfriend? I would think not, as some of the things said between friends would be rather sordid, unrestrained and would cause rather serious consternation, if ever they were to be revealed to the public, no?</p>
              <p>Same logic should apply here. That forum is our sanctuary to speak freely, be it right or otherwise, such as one would confide their own true uninhibited thoughts and feelings to ones' closest friends. It wouldn't be right to intrude into such conversations and to pass judgement upon them, wouldn't you agree?</p>
              <p>Further, the mere act of copying the contents of the posts is in direct contravention of the forum's Terms of Agreement upon registration. Mr GhimPeng has purposefully gone against the rules to stir up ill-will against CFCSG, as he has been doing ever since his expulsion from the group, note for his own mistakes.</p>
              <p>I do hope my comments are not misinterpreted as an insinuation that we at CFCSG feel "holier-than-thou", but rather that we perhaps should all agree to disagree and not violate each others' personal sanctuaries, especially in the hopes of stirring up further unpleasantries and animosity between rival fans.</p>
              <p>May I suggest that we let this matter rest and focus our energies on enjoying the Beautiful Game instead?</p>

              <p>First of all, It's not only Chelsea where there are glory hunters in abundance. When Liverpool won the Champions League, i have seen Ex Arsenal fans and Tottenham fans heralding the Liverpool jersey and emblazoning their "heroes" names on them.. Remember when Blackburn won the league, how often did u see Blackburn jerseys roaming SG compared with now? Every club has fair weathered fans and i've seen Man Utd fans pledging loyalty to other clubs depending on the performance. if i were to be stereotyping Chelsea, i would be hypocritical by not mentioning Man Utd too..</p>
              <p>I mentioned JT being a helluva crybaby. When did that statement becomes a condemning attack on JT as a whole as both club/country captain. When he took the boot to the face, i lauded him. Respect was there.. He lived up to Dennis Wise as the next bravado captain of Chelsea..Do not misconstrue every single word i posted and simply add an extension of your "attacks" on me...I rather he let his performance on his pitch do the talking than his off the pitch actions (crying like a baby, playing mind games)</p>
              <p>Obviously when you meant young, you really meant young as in 12 or 13? Certainly you have heard of the word bad tempered? Since when does bad tempered = violence on the pitch? Show me a dictionary which does, thanks.. Im sure not only me has seen drogba playing on the pitch...Sure enough, he's a great striker but im sure needs to do more in the "human" department.. Whiny and grumpy as he is, surely he could curb his anger at one point during the Champions League finals and not spoil a beautiful final.. Well, he takes after Lehmann as being the 2nd player to be sent off in a Champions league final anyway...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U supported since Zola's time? i supported since Glenn Hoddle's time? Glenn who? Google it...I supported Chelsea back then as much as i supported Man United and certainly, back then..the rivarly between Chelsea and Man United wasnt that huge.. Ever since, Roman came, the support has been subdued and reach the point of "dun care anymore" because he made the club which i supported since young becoming like a business rather than passion...</p>

              <p>I think your football analysis is totally rubbish, saying Roman bought chelsea and becoming a business rather than passion.  Your head is going bonk.  Who would spent 500million pound on a club to run like business and every year making loses? You? Roman is the most passionate owner you can find in the football world. You should thank him for generating the economic of football.
              
              What about Manure?  Malcolm Glazer didnâ€™t spend money?  Yet borrowed money and run like a business and hope to get profit immediately.  And the profit is barely enough to pay for the interest.  Didnâ€™t you fans protested when they took over the club?  Where were you when your club won the treble?  That is why you joined them I believe.  So donâ€™t criticize Roman, You better have a look at your club owner first.
