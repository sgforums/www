                                                  captain. When he took the boot to the face, i lauded him. Respect
                                                  was there.. He lived up to Dennis Wise as the next bravado captain

                                                  <p>Obviously when you meant young, you really meant young as in 12
                                                  or 13? Certainly you have heard of the word bad tempered? Since
                                                  when does bad tempered = violence on the pitch? Show me a

                                                  playing on the pitch...Sure enough, he's a great striker but im
                                                  sure needs to do more in the "human" department.. Whiny and grumpy
                                                  as he is, surely he could curb his anger at one point during the

                                                  <p>U supported since Zola's time? i supported since Glenn Hoddle's
                                                  time? Glenn who? Google it...I supported Chelsea back then as much
                                                  as i supported Man United and certainly, back then..the rivarly
                                                  between Chelsea and Man United wasnt that huge.. Ever since, Roman
                                                  came, the support has been subdued and reach the point of "dun care
                                                  anymore" because he made the club which i supported since young
                                                  becoming like a business rather than passion...</p>

                                haha how funny that you can twist and turn my statement. bad tempered not equal to violent? surely you know why keane ended Alf-Inge HÃ¥land's career as an act of REVENGE. wow surely that's not extreme bad temper!
                                
                                Glenn Hoddle? im sure you're not that into history of the club to even know Peter Bonetti. no? google it too! ;)
                                
                                And im sorry to say too, that united were the ones playing more mind games than chelsea before the game. im not saying that's bad, but im stating facts. so get your facts right before crapping that terry was mind gaming more than a lan gamer before the game.

              <p>no, i side with what i read from both sides. did you know i was actually asked to be the middleman to try and get you back in? i bet you didn't.</p>
              <p>if only you tried to settle things earlier, like returning the money among many other things as well as changing your behaviour, this wouldn't have happened.</p>
              <p>no, i remember that at one time your passion for chelsea shone soo strongly that you were making enemies in many forums, which led them to criticize CFCSG, and when you were told that your way of doing was wrong, you started getting angry and disrespectful towards the management.</p>
              <p>maybe you might want to explain bout the 30 and 50 part after collecting the money.</p>

              <p>Ghimpheng/Stellazio,</p>
              <p>Whether CFCSG is in the wrong or Ghimpheng is in the wrong, I personally feel you two should not be arguing or resolving this dispute here. It is from another private forum and should not be linked to this public forum.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ghimpheng</span>, your choice of action is only drving you further from your stated intentions and are only making them more hostile towards you. It only makes then even less inclined to come out and talk to you. It also does nothing to help your credibility and only damages it even more.</p>
              <p>Rather than draw people to support you, you are alienating everyone else even more, whether it is Chelsea fans or non-Chelsea fans.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Stellazio</span>, I'm repeating myself but I agree with the Bear that this thread should be closed, although our reasoning is slightly different. But once again as both he and I have said it's your call.</p>
              <p>No amount of you guys or anyone else arguing about the dispute here is going to resolve it. It should not be resolved here in the first place.</p>
              <p>Euro Cup is coming, let's look forward to international football.</p>
