              <p>Ghimpheng,</p>
              <p>I do not know you personally and either i know any people from CFCSG.  But what you did here was wrong and to post what mentioned in CFCSG about Man U has nothing to do here.  What are you trying to gain? Sympathy or flame wars between 2 clubs?  So you have now enjoyed your popcorn session?</p>
              <p>I cant advise how you settle your problem, but i know continue to do such things will only make it worse and you would be mosted hated there.  Let the matter rest and enjoy your football.</p>

              <p>Well, there you go again, anything for that agenda of yours as usual. If you want to make a stand against the mocking, there are better ways and more credible people to put your support behind. But trust you to want other people to do the dirty work. Maybe you're trying to protect your relationship with certain people and your p-membership.</p>
              <p>But it's pretty obvious to a lot of people the way you conduct yourself that you are not the honourable person you like to tell people you are.</p>
              <p>Besides, even Stella has come out now to criticise Ghimpheng. Of all that are posting in this topic, I fully agree behind Stella's stand. I will comment on that later.</p>
              <p>You have somehow missed how this is a ghimpheng vs CFCSG issue as well, because you are so focused on your anti-Man U agenda as usual. It's one thing to criticise another person's favourite club in sgforums but it's a different thin altogether to bring in posts from a private forum.</p>
              <p>End of the day, you will just support anything or anyone that is against Man U, especially if it is not posted by you. And you will gladly encourage any other person to do something similar, even if it is bad reputation for CFCSG or any other club besides Arsenal.</p>
              <p>In fact, I am pretty sure you are anti-England too. But you just don't want to say it out because players like Gerrard are from Liverpool, Lampard from Chelsea and your anti Man U agenda takes precedence over everything. And if anything, you still want Liverpool and Chelsea fans to aid you in your agenda.</p>
              <p>I think it's very important that others are advised being made use of by you.</p>
