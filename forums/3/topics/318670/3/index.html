              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>You sure could grow up Mr. Ghimp..You're the type of typical
              Chelsea "fan" that people loves to hate.. And as much as what a
              certain Mr. Master was describing earlier, you sure seem to fit the
              bill as a fair weathered fan during the Mourinho era. What are you
              trying to prove by posting this same thread in so many forums? A
              Hate CFCSG campaign? I'm guessing that you're sore over being
              kicked out of the group, don't even get me started on why you were
              kicked out. I'm not sure whther you would want your dirty laundry
              published.</p>
              <p>Well as much as there were a huge influx of Chelsea fans
              suddenly when Roman arrives, and are graded as everyone else as a
              bunch of glory hunters or fair weathered fans, i post the same
              question back to em. Why did you support your current team be it
              Man Utd, Arsenal, Liverpool.. Supporting your team for more then a
              decade since the start of the premier league era might make you
              seem like a diehard supporter, but then again aren't you a glory
              hunter yourself too?Especially those Man Utd fans in their 20's and
              late teens now since Man Utd are the most successful team since the
              introduction of the premier league.What made you support em or
              subsequently fall in love with em, winning many pieces of
              silverware sure makes supporting a club easier.</p>
              <p>The likes of Man Utd, Liverpool and Arsenals are the club to
              support, you guys love em but yet what right do you have to call
              the Chelsea fans fair weather or glory hunters? If they did
              continue supporting Chelsea down to the next decade, won't they be
              in the same shoes as you now? One can start by supporting a club
              through its successful times, but whether he is a true supporter or
              a fair weathered one will be seen when the club goes through
              trouble and whether he sticks to the club through thick and
              thin.</p>
              <p>Heck, you might even want to applaud a guy for being a
              Nottingham Forest supporter if you can find one in Singapore now,
              but then again if he told you that he started supporting em in the
              late 70's or early 80's during their most successful period
              including the European Cup, wouldn't he be labelled as a Glory
              Hunter back then?</p>
              <p>It is difficult for a Singaporean to support a club without
              status or name when we have no affilations with it, especially with
              our media only showing the big clubs. This explains the why 99% of
              football fans in the EPL supports the big 4.</p>
              <p>One can only wonder why most of the supporters are either
              Liverpool or Man Utd fans.</p>

              <p>Yes, Stella, I fully agree with you that what is at CFCSG should stay there. It really brings to mind whether ghimpheng has the interest of Chelsea and CFCSG at heart when he does things like this.</p>
              <p>End of the day, it's all about him, him and him. Even when other Chelsea fans tell him off, always to him there's something wrong with the world about him. I will not comment on the incident behind his banning, but this is certainly not the way to go about getting redress even if he genuinely has a case.</p>
              <p>It has always been his attitude that people dislike, not so much of him being a Chelsea supporter. To the point that people dislike Chelsea because of him.</p>
              <p>Coming back to the issue of this thread, what is the point really? If you are going to criticise another club why drag others into it? Why make use of what people have said in another forum? It's like a deliberate attempt at starting unnecassry conflict.</p>
              <p>And it seems with his 2nd and 3rd post in this thread, it's more like he is intentionally wanting to cause trouble for CFCSG, something 798 has missed because all cares about is being anti-Man U (sorry, I digress again).</p>
              <p>So ghimpheng what is it? CFCSG should listen to you otherwise you're going to create an online war against CFCSG? Even if you were right regarding your being banned, you think this will help you in future when you go back CFCSG? You're only make a bad situation worse, and creating more enemies for yourself not from the non-Chelsea fans but from the Chelsea fans themselves. Is it worth it?</p>
              <p>A private forum being what it is would be more skewered in a different direction, especially where ranting and bantering is concerned. But is there really a need to openly try and incite conflict? Especially since you are not one of those posting in the original topic in CFCSG anyway.</p>
              <p>The are Chelsea fans and there are people like the threadstarter.</p>

              <p>You can't even remember clearly the things I told you last time, at least I was nice enough to remember the things you tell me about yourself.</p>
              <p>If my level is considered obsession, then yours must be something else altogether if you are willing to overlook other impt issues just to get at your anti Man U agenda. To the point that you try and 'get people on your side'.</p>
              <p>Don't start bringing religion into it because this isn't what it is about.</p>
              <p>Number of times I'm banned you can tell by the number, and I don't mind telling what was behind the being banned. Afterall like I've said before, the bannage thing in sgforums is a farce. I just won't discuss the issue in this topic.</p>
              <p><br>I work up with things? Who's the one trying to 'organise' people to be 'on his side' each time he has an agenda against someone or against something? And you call me a hypocrite? Geez.... get off your high hourse already.</p>

              such serious offence that affect your reputation I don't think
              anyone will keep quiet and get accused for what you never
              done</span></p>

              <p>I think you should explain the situation or at least try to talk to those others you know in CFCSG that you can talk to and not drag unrelated topics out to open forums like this. Find those you know you can approach and work from there. But if there really isn't anyone even among the normal members that you can approach in CFCSG then there's nothing I can say.</p>

              <p>In that previous post to you, all I'm pointing out to you is that those who criticise Ghimpheng are not necessarily because they are Man U fans or they are anti-Chelsea.

              If you feel I'm 'bullying' him that's your opinion, but I know where I stand regarding the things I've said previously. And you keep changing your stand, one moment you say I'm not supporter of any club, now you say differently again. I've already previously shared with you my point and stand regarding my posts.

              Like I've said, you can get your point across without having to use the personal insults. I believe you are aware of that and that you can do it too.

              <p><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hi as I mention I already approach CFCSG but seems like they refuse to resolve this issue and I did approach some of the others other than Allan Chan there and he promise me that he will get this issue resolve which never did</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">and the Sum involve is a mere $50 and that sum of money has been returned</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The reason I got banned is a false one and it is damging my reputation I beileve it is injustice of the CFCSG accusing me of such act as those who know me in real life know that I am determine to be a good person and in no way I did attempt of any acts like this and morever for over a mere sum of $50</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> That why you will see big reaction from me and acts like this from me ! If you are the one getting accuse of stealing in any place or anywhere what will you think ? do you really think a person that stole the money and yet posting in public forum like this telling everyone what he did ? The problem is I am being accuse that why I want a clean name back and most CFCSG members and other rival fans are assuming that I got banned because I stole money from the club which is false I was banned before that for other reasons</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">And I already promise if they resolve this ISSUE and Put the real reason of me getting banned instead of the false one instead you won't see be posting about CFCSG unless they come find trouble with me again</span></p>

              <p><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">We took Power98FM battle of the EPL FANs beach football competition and I was captaining the CFCSG team and was the one who pull players into the team as not many are interested</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">and we had to put a deposit of $50 and namely Gavin one of the CFCSG member place the $50 deposit which can be refunded after the tournament.We wanted to each chip in our own and place the deposit but Gavin decided it was okay that he pay it first then we pay him back as we intially didn't knew it is just deposit until later.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">1 day I don't know the exact date but should be 1 month or so later after the tournament Power98FM call me to collect the deposit as it has been left there for a long time already as Gavin has yet to collect the deposit</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">okay thus I went down to collect with intention of returning to Gavin in the next live game gathering but then after that I got banned from CFCSG for others reasons and things turn sour thus I was unable to attend any CFCSG related events thus not being able to return the money but I was waiting for things to cool down and find one day to go down and return the money.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Allan Chan president of CFCSG call me one day and he started with a very bad tone asking me whether am I going to return the money and if I am not going to do so he even threaten to go the police.I said No intially due as I hate his tone and was a moment of fury but Agreed to return shortly after that then the other arguement came ALLAN CHAN wanted bank transfer but I told him I only do meet up as I don't trust bank transfer and had never done bank transfer before and EVEN if i knew bank transfer I wouldn't do it as who know they say I transfer to the wrong acc or watever crap So i prefer to hand the money directly to Allan Chan himself as the deposit presumebly is donated by Gavin to the club according to Allan.All the above stated happen in an single phone conversation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Then Allan hang up on Me then few days / weeks later call up my parents and accuse me of not returning them the money which I agree to returned to them only in meet up as I don't know bank transfer and I told my parents the full story and they thought that CFCSG is ridiculous and my dad even told me next time don't be so kind and silly help others to do this and that which I prefectly agree with him now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">And Surprisngly enough the Reason I got ban change to "Serious Offence that is even punishable by Law" While intially I got banned because of my posts in CFCSG forum having some problems with a  few CFCSG members and apparently going against the board in some way or other powerstruggle ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So I think Justice need to be done here CFCSG has insulted my character and mislead not only CFCSG matters and all those who read the CFCSG forum and assume that I got ban because I steal money which is not the case </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Me myself contributed so much to CFCSG (just do a survey how much of them know CFCSG through me or my advertisements and what I have done for the club) and yet CFCSG consist of many adults in the committee is accusing a 18 years old Teenager of this and that and changing the reason I got banned for ?!</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I just want justice to be done and I DO NOT WISH TO HAVE ANY CHANCE TO BE BACK IN CFCSG NOR IN ANYWAY RELATED TO THEM</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">But CFCSG also got nice guyz like JohnYeo, Jonathan, Jasperlee, JonWan And many others that do not know the full story and never make any uncessary comments which I respect.For Those who listen to one side of the story and make so many negative and insulting comments on me get your facts right before you abuse others</span></p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">We took Power98FM battle of the EPL FANs beach football competition and I was captaining the CFCSG team and was the one who pull players into the team as not many are interested</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">and we had to put a deposit of $50 and namely Gavin one of the CFCSG member place the $50 deposit which can be refunded after the tournament.We wanted to each chip in our own and place the deposit but Gavin decided it was okay that he pay it first then we pay him back as we intially didn't knew it is just deposit until later.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">1 day I don't know the exact date but should be 1 month or so later after the tournament Power98FM call me to collect the deposit as it has been left there for a long time already as Gavin has yet to collect the deposit</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">okay thus I went down to collect with intention of returning to Gavin in the next live game gathering but then after that I got banned from CFCSG for others reasons and things turn sour thus I was unable to attend any CFCSG related events thus not being able to return the money but I was waiting for things to cool down and find one day to go down and return the money.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Allan Chan president of CFCSG call me one day and he started with a very bad tone asking me whether am I going to return the money and if I am not going to do so he even threaten to go the police.I said No intially due as I hate his tone and was a moment of fury but Agreed to return shortly after that then the other arguement came ALLAN CHAN wanted bank transfer but I told him I only do meet up as I don't trust bank transfer and had never done bank transfer before and EVEN if i knew bank transfer I wouldn't do it as who know they say I transfer to the wrong acc or watever crap So i prefer to hand the money directly to Allan Chan himself as the deposit presumebly is donated by Gavin to the club according to Allan.All the above stated happen in an single phone conversation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Then Allan hang up on Me then few days / weeks later call up my parents and accuse me of not returning them the money which I agree to returned to them only in meet up as I don't know bank transfer and I told my parents the full story and they thought that CFCSG is ridiculous and my dad even told me next time don't be so kind and silly help others to do this and that which I prefectly agree with him now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">And Surprisngly enough the Reason I got ban change to "Serious Offence that is even punishable by Law" While intially I got banned because of my posts in CFCSG forum having some problems with a  few CFCSG members and apparently going against the board in some way or other powerstruggle ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So I think Justice need to be done here CFCSG has insulted my character and mislead not only CFCSG matters and all those who read the CFCSG forum and assume that I got ban because I steal money which is not the case</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Me myself contributed so much to CFCSG (just do a survey how much of them know CFCSG through me or my advertisements and what I have done for the club) and yet CFCSG consist of many adults in the committee is accusing a 18 years old Teenager of this and that and changing the reason I got banned for ?!</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I just want justice to be done and I DO NOT WISH TO HAVE ANY CHANCE TO BE BACK IN CFCSG NOR IN ANYWAY RELATED TO THEM</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">But CFCSG also got nice guyz like JohnYeo, Jonathan, Jasperlee, JonWan And many others that do not know the full story and never make any uncessary comments which I respect.For Those who listen to one side of the story and make so many negative and insulting comments on me get your facts right before you abuse others</span></p>
