            <div class='col-md body'>Let them buy Shevchenko while at it they might as well get Carlos from RM too... cos i suspect it will be a bad move by chelsea. Imagine paying 35 million pounds for a almost 30 yrs old striker... Strikers normally start to go downhill when they reach 30. Remember cantona, shearea, flower, keegan even rvn is loosing it now that he has reach 30. I suspect Milan knows it and wish to cash in on shev before getting nothing in a year or 2 time.<br><br>My guess is RA like shev (since fellow countrymen) for a very long time alrdy and wanted to get him when he first came to chelsea bcos he was a top player and also for their country but the thing is time have passed. 3yrs, maybe even 6,7 yrs since RA started to like shev. Shevchenko is not the same player anymore, maybe he can still do it but it won't be consistent especially in the EPL where it is much more faster than Serie A. He will probably get chop by defenders &amp; midfielders much more than in Italy, so good luck to him. Who knows, they may even gift Dragba &amp; Gallas to Milan for him. That would be an even bigger mistake to do. Losing Dragba &amp; Gallas for Shev...<br><br>Lastly, i hope they get carlos too... lolz<br></div>
