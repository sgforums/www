WHY?<br><br>if RA has bought the team you supported will you be saying the same thing?  will you say that your club do not deserve the title because RA bought it with money?  will you criticise everything about the club that you have loved since the day you know football?  or will be be basking in the glory?<br><br>if you see it from footballing point of view, chelsea are a good team too.  they are deserving champions.  they dont fix matches, bribe officials or win with underhanded means.  juventus is now in trouble.  i dont see anyone criticising them.  that much is obvious right?<br><br>you dont win a premiership by luck.  you dont win a premiership with only money.  the manager, coaches, players, fans and those associated with the club put in a lot of collective effort to win it.<br><br>inter milan and newcastle spent a lot of money too.  but did they win any?<br><br>i am sure chelsea will love to win the title with a humble, english coach, youngsters from their academy, spend little on transfer and build slowing from scratch.  but in real life it dont work that way.<br><br>players now sitting on chelsea's bench have themselves to blame.  why are they there in the first place?  they chose to join knowing they will be on the bench.  a lot of players sit on the bench at RM and other big clubs too but i dont see anyone commenting on it.<br><br>please be fair to chelsea just like what you are doing to other clubs.<br><br>hopefully jealousy is not the root of all these negative comments.  but frankly, only you know.</div>
