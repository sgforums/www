            <div class='col-md body'>okie, Chelsea is good enough to win with 10man, and with Drogba and Lampard regaining their form which is only good for their club &amp; country.<br><br>as for cheating, i am unsure where that came about.</div>

I dun like it too.. when ppl call SAF alex fungerson.. or when we are defending against an attack.. he mocks "wow look! 10 men defence!"<br><br>like any team relys on only the 4 named defenders in the team to defend..<br><br>anyhow.. fair play to chelsea over the weekend.. recovered from an early goal and an early harsh dismissal to rout a seriously under-par west ham.. nicely done.</div>
