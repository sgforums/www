            <div class='col-md body'>No offence to TS but there's a word called "ignore". Since you knew clones' post are from the same person so why bother replying? Opening this thread will encourage more flaming and the cycle will just keep on repeating with "fans" of both clubs taking swipes at each other.<br><br>Yes, sometimes it gets frustrating when you see your favourite club get slammed for no reason but what's the point of getting angry? You never know the poster would be smiling and laughing hard at your replies cos you've fell into his trap. The clones motive is to cause commotion, disharmony and anger among fans. So as fellow fans of soccer, why bother listening to his views?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Ok, i agree the part on taking a step back each. We should have done that long ago.<br><br>And to GP, sometimes your replies are so comical and disrspectful i wonder if you're taught of manners and character development in school. I'm not targeting any club but i'm targeting you. Yes, you, Jackson Ng Ghimpheng. Learn some manners, listen to others before you start shooting off. I'm not always right and neither are you but at least i listen to others, sort out my prioirities before any action(s) is(are) taken.<br><br>As for the rest, I'm sorry that TS is blasting Chelsea fans as a whole. The clone has succeeded this time in driving TS mad along with GP. May i sugest that all true soccer fans ignore replies from innosaint, ronaldog, etc.<br><br>The season hasn't even begun and the war has already started in the forum.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>
