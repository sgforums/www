His injury from the West Ham game was a bad one.<br><br>'It has kept him out for a month and although it was a foul, the player who committed it was not suspended. Essien has recovered well.<br><br>'The comments from the manager of Ghana after his team had gone out of the competition were not fair to a great player who was injured and has been responsible for them going to the World Cup.'<br><br>Ghana failed to make it past the group stages of the African Nations Cup.<br><br>After losing 1-0 to Nigeria in their opening game, they beat Senegal but surprisingly went down to Zimbabwe in their crucial last match.<br><br>Some fans have since called for Dujkovic to be sacked but Essien urged them to be patient and promised to play in any friendlies arranged prior to the World Cup Finals.<br><br>'I know the Ghanaians are frustrated, but he was the first ever coach to guide Ghana to the World Cup Finals,' Essien said. 'There were also three key players who were missing from the Cup of Nations squad.'<br><br>However, former Black Stars player Mohammed Polo has asked the Ghana Football Association to relieve the Serbian of his position.<br><br>'The coach has lost his bearings and the best decision as we prepare for the Germany World Cup is an outright dismissal to save the nation from further humiliation,' he said.<br><br>'There was no game plan until we managed to score the face-saving goal. And to add to that, he made the lone goal scorer in the Senegal match, Matthew Amoah, waste on the bench, why?' Polo added furiously.<br><br>Meanwhile, Dujkovic has told the BBC's Network Africa programme: 'I have to accept criticism because this is part of the job. When we win everyone says nice things about us but people are angry when we lose.<br><br>'I am not worried, we coaches always have our luggage ready to go.'<br>- Wire Services.<br><br></div>
