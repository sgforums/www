            <div class='col-md body'>The Premier League have charged West Ham with breaching rules over the signings of Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano last August.<br><br>The Argentine pair joined The Hammers on transfer deadline day last year, a double deal that was hailed as a major coup at the time.<br><br>However, it has been speculated that West Ham do not actually own the players' registrations, a move that is in breach of league regulations.<br><br>West Ham have yet to respond to the charge and it remains to be seen what punishment, if any, may be forthcoming from the outcome.<br><br>Tevez is yet to score from his 16 league appearances to date, while Mascherano fell out of favour and is spending the remainder of the season at Liverpool.<br><br>"It is the board's complaint that there were agreements in relation to both these transfers that enabled third parties to acquire the ability materially to influence the club's policies and/or the performance of its teams in League matches and/or the competitions set out in Rule E.10," read a Premier League statement.<br><br>"The board's view is this constitutes a breach of rule U.18. Furthermore at the time of the transfer agreements for both Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano, and until 24 January 2007, West Ham United failed to disclose the third party agreements to the Premier League and/or deliberately withheld these agreements from the Premier League.<br><br>"The board's view is this constitutes a breach of rule B.13, which states 'In all matters and transactions relating to the League each club shall behave towards each other club and the League with the utmost good faith'.<br><br>"West Ham United has 14 days within which to respond to these charges."<br>West Ham have unsurprisingly reacted quickly to the charge, by stating they will 'vigorously defend' themselves and provide the Premier League with the necessary paperwork.<br><br>A club statement read: "In light of the legal advice received, the club will vigorously defend itself against the charge and provide a detailed response as requested by the Premier League within the time allowed."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anton Ferdinand has offered an apology after misleading West Ham United over his whereabouts during a recent break.<br><br>With The Hammers not in FA Cup fifth round action in mid-February, Alan Curbishley gave his players four days off.<br><br>Ferdinand used the break for a mini-holiday in the United States, but told the club he was visiting his grandmother on the Isle of Wight.<br><br>The centre-half admits he made a mistake, but insists his actions were not a sign of a lack of commitment to West Ham's battle to stay in the Premiership.<br><br>"I have made a stupid mistake," Ferdinand told the News of the World. "One I will not make again.<br><br>"If I could turn the clock back now, of course I would, but there is only one way I can make amends and that's to do everything I can to help West Ham win the relegation battle we now face.<br><br>"I owe as much to the manager, my team-mates and the fans. I would never do anything to deliberately shame West Ham, and particularly the fans, and I ask people to remember I am still relatively young and learning all the time.<br><br>"I can understand this trip looked like I was turning my back on the club's predicament, but nothing could be further from the truth.<br><br>"Because of the FA Cup, we were given a few days off, which I realise was a privilege. I then decided to book a trip to America, where a good friend of mine was celebrating his birthday. It was mine as well, and I thought there was no harm done by going to see him.<br><br>"The travelling wasn't a problem for me and I came back to the club in good time for training, so I never breached any rules like that. And I genuinely did go and see my gran when I got back.<br><br>"I absolutely did nothing wrong while I was in America. So while I'm not proud of my behaviour, I know, deep down, I haven't lost my sense of duty and loyalty to the club, and I know I didn't misbehave.<br><br>"I also know I shouldn't have gone in the first place and all I can ask is that people judge me now on my future behaviour and performances, and not on this one isolated incident."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They better get promoted immediately should they be relegated at the end of the season. However, i think players like Robert Green,Tevez, Ferdinand, Reo-Coker, Dean Ashton will probably not want to spend a season in the second top flight, similar to the case of Zambrotta, Thruam, Ibrahimovic, Vieria, Cannavaro and Emerson who left Juve after they were relegated. While some of the West Ham players above I mentioned did not play well this season, remember that Ashton, Reo-Coker and Ferdinand were inspirational for them last season, while Green and Tevez were star players at their old clubs. If they leave, West Ham will be left with a bunch of players like Mark Noble, who although are willing to fight for the club, is not experienced enough at all.<br><br>Furthermore, how much is the chairman going 2 put for West Ham next season? Attendance will definitely fall sharpely, merchandise, season tickets and match day ticket sales will drop too, advertisers may not pay as much for a CCC club. And they are going 2 lose tons of money as the EPL clubs are going to get richer next season. Which chairman, who just steps in and has given so much money for the manager to spend during the Janauary transfer window only 2 get relegated at the end, is willing 2 put up even more money to cover the losses that will be incurred? Players will definitely have 2 be sold to cover for the shortfall.<br><br>No matter what, West Ham is a club too good for the CCC, but not good enough for the EPL. That's the sad fact of today</div>
