It was so damn boring and 5hitclass until my brother went up to sleep when it was 80 mins which was when the excitement starts. The two teams do not know how to attack. It was full of running and aggresive play. I guess it's the weather. All the matches played at that time, the teams look tired and hot. And yesterday I guess, Japan couldn't last until the very end and the defence crumbled. I hope Brazil trash these 2 teams.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Aussies accept ref's brave apology</strong><br>Paul Kent<br><br>SHORTLY after blowing the final whistle yesterday, referee Essam Abd El Fatah declared: "God was on my side."<br><br>The Egyptian referee was alluding not to Australia's get-out-of-jail win, but of his own escape after <strong>admitting that he had made a mistake when awarding Japanese superstar Shunsuke Nakamura a goal in the 26th minute.</strong> Abd El Fatah also apologised to Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer for the blunder.<br>Schwarzer was shouldered off the ball and should have been awarded a free kick, but instead Abd El Fatah gave Japan the goal, making the mistake that could have cost Australia its future in the World Cup.<br><br>The controversial goal looked like it was going to be the difference until Australia's dramatic finish, saving Abd El Fatah a public embarrassment and, perhaps worse, eternal condemnation in Australia.<br><br>"About five minutes into the game, after they scored, I went over to him and said, 'It's a clear foul'," Schwarzer said.<br><br>"And he said, 'Yes, I made a mistake'. I think it's very good of him to do that.<br><br>"He has got a lot of courage to come out and say that.<br><br>"At the end of the game he said the same thing to Mark Viduka.<br><br>"He said God was on his side because the result went the way it did and it didn't affect his decision to give them a goal in the first half."<br><br>Schwarzer was moving in to catch a cross floated in by Nakamura when two Japanese players, Naohiro Takahara and Atsushi Yanagisawa, charged across the line of the ball.<br><br>Making no contact with the ball, the pair crashed into Schwarzer and knocked him over. The ball then bounced softly into the net, giving Japan a 1-0 lead, which it held until the 83rd minute, when Australia's dramatic comeback began.<br><br>While clearly upset, Schwarzer said there would have been little benefit to charge at the referee with a complaint, although he said: "I felt like running after him and kicking him.<br><br>"But I'm not going to run after him and abuse him. All it brings is a yellow card.<br><br>"The reaction was that it was a foul, so I don't have to say anything else."<br><br>Abd El Fatah has a troubled history with Australia, enough for the Socceroos to approach the game with a wary eye on his performance.<br><br>At the Athens Olympics two years ago the referee hit the Australians with four yellow cards in a 1-0 loss to Argentina, costing Craig Moore and Tim Cahill appearances in the Olyroos' next game.<br><br>The referee was equally as brutal yesterday, booking Vince Grella and John Aloisi, as well as Moore and Cahill.<br><br><a href="http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5478,19466151%255E2883,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5478,19466151%255E2883,00.html</a></div>
