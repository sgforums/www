            <div class='col-md body'>The team has serious flaws that could be revealed as the season progresses.<br><br>They have no strength in depth in defence and defensive midfield.In central defence,there is Pavon and Helguera.The backups are Ruben and Raul Bravo.Ruben? Who the hell is that,you might ask.Raul Bravo is a left back by vocation and he looks unsteady when he is forced to use his weaker foot.These two guys are not the tallest around either...Beckham and Cambiasso are the two first team holding midfielders.If one of them is out of action,Helguera can step in.What if out of these three players,two of them are unavailable? (Don't forget that Makelele is gone...)The club used to have Celades and Flavio Conceicao as backup anchormen.They are not first tier players,nevertheless they can be relied on give competent performances on the pitch,but now they are plying their trade elsewhere,hence Real Madrid has minimal cover in the crucial area of central midfield.Indeed,central midfield is the area where teams are made or broken.You win the battle for central midfield,you are well on your way to winning games.<br><br>A balanced team is what wins trophies.The Galaticos are top heavy in their offensive capabilities.Sure their mentality is if you score four against us,we will score five against you.But what if the Galaticos have an off day and the other team deploys men behind ball tactics to squeeze out Real's midfield and attack? We see this in Roma vs Modena,Chelsea vs Bolton and Milan vs Brugge.Organization,team spirit and hard work CAN make up for a lack of talent and technical abilities.<br><br>Real Madrid will do well to purchase a decent holding midfielder and a centre back when the transfer window opens soon.What is the point of buying Henry or Van Nistelrooy when you already have Raul,Ronaldo,Portillo? Buy them to sit on the bench? If one of them comes,who will be sacrificed? Raul the darling of Madrid?<br><br>On the other hand,the two Italian teams,Milan and Juventus have what it takes to be world beaters.Defence is incidentally,their forte.They<br>have some extremely talented attacking players too.Nedved,Del Piero,Kaka,Rui Costa...the list goes on.If the Italians adopt a more offensive strategy,they can conquer Europe come May 2004...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>amen!<br><br>real is way over rated. they're a brand more so than a soccer heavy weight... i have the feeling that a lot of teams lose to them not because of being outclassed but becoz they fear the amount of hype that real brings with it... then stressed, they play badly and woohoo, real has another win... bleagh<br><br>the italian teams have their own host of stars, they are in no way inferior to real.  and as juve (my team) have demonstrated, real can be easily outclassed if u go at them with the right mentality to win.<br><br>i respect the other spanish clubs.  most of their players are unheard-of locals who EARN their keep.  good players, but no hype. respect</div>
