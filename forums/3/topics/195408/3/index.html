            <div class='col-md body'>i would say korea got kinda lucky to score 2 goals when 80% of their shots went wide. kader alone has more shots on target than the entire korea team.<br><br>as a matter of fact, park's breakaway didnt stand too big of a chance as he kick the ball too far before he earned the foul.<br><br>still, it is not a wise tackle from the togo captain. like wat dragg said, it is better to concede a goal than to play with -1 man.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i couldnt agree with you guys more. Korea realy struggled against togo and it was only when togo were down to ten men that they managed to score 2m goals. The free kick was misjudged by the keeper who was out of step, the second was off a deflection of a togo defender. All in all, their shots were haywire and their finishing was horrible. They have no ideas in front of goal and depended too much on having too many men up front just to score the second goal. That is the reason why togo scored the forst, they overcommitted themselves at the front and kader punished them with his flair. Kader's long shots really troubled the kepr and were all deadly, i hope he sttracts the attention of some clubs because he is really good. Imagine providing with better service and he might score even more. against the swiss and french, korea really will feel the heat.</div>
