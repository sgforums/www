              <p>So we've all heard about what happened to poor old Gao Ning during the recent Olympics, and the fallout it caused.  In the end though, whos right and whos wrong?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Gao Ning</p>
              <p>Am really not surprised at the way he has hit out.  Which player does not want to be successful? You could say he was a loser anyway for getting thrashed by a lower ranked opponent, but what is certain is that he was made to feel like a loser for the amount of neglection he has gotten.  Imagine coming to Singapore only to act as a sparring partner for the girls?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Liu Guodong</p>
              <p>He did a fantastic job at getting the girls into the final, but unfortunately he had to, or chose to do it at the extent of the men's team.  As a coach he felt he had no choice and I tend to agree with him.  Had he failed with the women, he would have be deemed as not good enough, a waste of taxpayers money and his future would be under threat all the same.  He felt that he had to focus on the best chance for getting that medal for Singapore.  Did Chelsea fans get upset with Jose Mourinho for secuirng results at the expense of entertaining football? They did not.  And so while we can acknowledge that coach liu neglected the men, we can't say he is not a good coach for Singapore just because of that. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Antony Lee</p>
              <p>I am not sure what is expected of him really.  He is a team manager that manages the players and coaches admin affairs, is he not?  He is certainly no expert in table tennis as compared to the Chinese players and coaches.  He was only informed of the lack of a coach at the very last moment.  Is it his job to tell the coaches how to plan their training schedules or which player to focus on? Definitely not.  If he did he would be interfering in team and playing matters.  Yet now he is deemed to be the number 1 culprit and is the first one to lose his job.  The most suay guy in my opinion. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Lee Bee Wah</p>
              <p>Her intentions are well meant.  But while she posseses the typical high handedness of a PAP MP, she certainly lacks the prudence and discretion we have come to expect of our government as well.  It is well and good to launch an investigation, but she jumped the gun and sacked Lee way before she got hold of the facts.  She came out in public and spinned a fancy story about just how bad things are in her organization.  She placed a medal winning coach under the judgement of a coahcing committee whom we do not even know if they are as qualified as he is.  It is unfortunate that she made a mess out of her good intentions and as such a public figure, she is getting the flak she deserves.  (whats the matter with Ang Mo Kio MPs anyway?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So whose fault is it? We Singaporeans love to find the person to blame.  In this case, Antony Lee was an easy scapegoat.  Hes local, not a valuable foreign talent, and the job of a team manager is easily replaced.  He was the perfect fall guy for Lee Bee Wah to show her authority.  Or the coaches? Can we honestly touch our heart and drive away a man like Liu Guodong for a reason like this? Or maybe we should replace Gao Ning and Yang Zi with better mens players who can play on their own without coaches? Or we could kick out Lee Bee Wah as what many people want. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The issue is not whos at fault.  Its really the system.  If we relaly take a few years to build a foundation for success, all these problems would have been addressed in the first place.  There will be proper coaching for both the men's and women's teams, staff who know their roles and a well prepared training programme to build up towards major meets like the Olympics. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Trouble is, as I've always said, we go for the quick fix.  We in Singapore are freaking despo just to get a medal.  Its not just in sports.  Even in schools, teachers focus on how to make the top students better so they can win glory for the school, and neglect those who are slow.  We here only want to focus on what can get us the fastest and best results, and we only recognize those who are able to do so.  And we have done that this Olympics.  At the expense of guys like Gao Ning and Antony Lee unfortunately, that is.  For those of you who watch EPL football, we, Singapore, are no different from Chelsea actually. </p>
