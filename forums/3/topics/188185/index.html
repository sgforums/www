            <div class='col-md body'>Just finished watching the match.<br><br>Chelsea totally dominated us and deservingly winning the title in the process.<br>Chelsea was strong in every department today i guess.<br><br>Our passing and teamwork wasn't up to the standard. The only player worth mentioning was Wayne Rooney as he worked his lungs out. Tough luck to be injured towards the end though.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>But credit to Man Utd for delaying Chelsea till today, even though the title could have been lost much earlier.<br><br>Time for us to secure the 2nd spot over the next 2 games.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>No disrespect to Liverpool fans, may the best team prevail.<br><br>And as for England.. it looks like Terry has got a problem too.. and Rooney's injury looks bad..  doesn't look promising for England if they can't play.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah congrats to Chelsea though I hate to say that. Lol<br><br>Chelsea were the better team. I don't think Man Utd want to play in the match. Cos they know the title is already lost long ago. Nothing to play for except 2nd place.</div>
