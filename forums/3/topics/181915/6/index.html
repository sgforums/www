            <div class='col-md body'>hi,<br>I am sure that SAF do have scouts on each WC games to see who can perform and maybe get the players.<br>One concern, the prices will be inflated.<br><br>To see Gunners &amp; Chelsea getting experienced, key players. And even losing Obi, I am quite worried for MUFC.<br><br>if we lose RVN, then we have taken another step backwards.<br>and now Dr Stone..  it shows SAF doesn't want WR in WC2006.<br><br>let's keep our fingers crossed.</div>

I believe he was taken just in the last 15mins, and with England losing, England needs one extra head over the rest to pressure the defence.<br>Look around the EPL, do we see any other 6-9" players anywhere?<br><br>If you bring strikers not to score but to lay off cross, you are going to be out of WC before you know it. You are just wasting resources.<br><br>For my opinion, England rely on link play between strikers and midfielders like SG, FL, and Rooney. Walcott is like owen, 1st pace so they work off any through-pass.<br>Walcott is young and raw so he will not be afraid so he will CHIONG!!!!<br><br>For SG, FLampard, DBeck, JCole and WRooney, they are the creative ones who can make it happen. All eyes on Jcole this WC..<br><br>Believe it or not, SG, and FLampard, it is their first WC.  So they will do their best to perform.<br><br>hurry, WC...<br><br></div></blockquote>I dun mean every team shall have a 7 footer but every team shall have a 2nd option. For england, what if all the pace fails??  Rem the 2 last friendly england match ?? Crouch came on late in the game n change it, thats what i mean by other option england can use. If u use the same way or tactics to play, sooner or later ur opponent will get used to it a eventually found a way to counter it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Although I'm a United fan, I'm sad to say that fergie sucks at dealing wif transfers.<br><br>He's an idiot. U see, when players are going off cheaply, he doesn't wanna buy. Only until the player's value soar did he realise that he has made a fool ou of himself. Examples? Michael Carrick. A cheap 2.6 million buy from West Ham and he snubbed him only to try and buy him now at 10 million. Wad about Defoe? Riquelme? Joe Cole? and even Rosicky?<br><br>I dun understand why Fergie kenot keep his bloody mouth shut when purchasing new and good players. The more the competition, the better ar? Fool. Dats why players like Robben, Duff, Essien, Rosicky, John Obi Mikel slipped off his hands. Notice that most of the players mentioned have since joined Chelsea? How to match Chelsea financially? U tell me.<br><br>And also, players who does not cost that much n yet Fergie pays a huge sum for them. Recent example? Vidic. His former club only ask for 3 million and Fergie bought him at 7 million. Wat about Forlan? Djemba-Djemba? Kleberson? Veron? Add them together and u can get 3 Henrys and 1 Ronaldinho wif spare change given.<br><br>Did he buy players jus for backups? Cos i dun see any future for Evra. Unless that old, slow and weak Neville retires. Shift Brown to right-back and move Heinze to the middle. Sell Silvestre and Evra gets the left back.<br><br>My United Team would be:<br><br>1 GK van der Sar<br>2 RB Brown<br>5 CD Ferdinand<br>6 CD Heinze<br>3 LB Evra<br>7 RM Ronaldo<br>4 CM Miller<br>8 CM Scholes<br>11 LM Richardson<br>9 ST Saha<br>10 ST Rooney<br><br>Subs<br>13 GK Foster<br>12 RB Pique<br>14 CD Vidic<br>18 CM Jones<br>19 ST Rossi<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>

I think no use la. Spending too much money now is not an option cos United is already in debt. They should nurture their young stars like they did a few years ago. Get Richardson, Rossi and Rique to play more. Sell away players like Silvestre and O'Shea. Force Neville to retire and Giggs to be their coach. Van der sar is a better option for the captain's role.<br><br>I think they should buy Bastian Sweinsteiger of Bayern Munich and Zdnek Grygera of Ajax. Stephen Appiah looks cool in Defensive Midfielder role.<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Riquelme?? after SAF got burnt with Veron.<br>I don't think so.<br><br>in the past, SAF can do what was mentioned and get away with it. but with the debt, I don't think he can do that.<br><br>now is the season where he has a last roll of dice and see that he can do it with what little he has. Wenger did it constantly, turning buys into excellent signings, and I believe SAF now needs to be really sure before buying another "forlan" or missing another "ronaldino".<br><br>so let's see his next buy.<br></div>
