            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Man Utd 4-0 Charlton</strong></span><br><br>Manchester United duly booked their place in next season's Champions League group phase with a 4-0 Old Trafford win over Charlton.<br><br>The odds on Ruud van Nistelrooy being with them by then are long indeed.<br><br>The terse pre-match statement confirming Van Nistelrooy had 'gone home' prior to the annual home stuffing of the Addicks hinted strongly that the end of an era had been reached.<br><br>On this evidence, the new one could be thrillingly joyous as Louis Saha, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kieran Richardson all found the target, as well as unlucky Charlton veteran Jason Euell to see United romp home.<br><br>For once, United did not miss Wayne Rooney. And they certainly did not miss Van Nistelrooy, who now heads to the World Cup with Holland knowing the tournament now offers him the best available shop window to escape his Red Devils hell.<br><br>The list of players who have fallen foul of manager Sir Alex Ferguson's ruthless streak over his 20 years is extensive, including names such as Jim Leighton, Paul Ince, Jaap Stam and David Beckham. The list of those who have lived to tell the tale is non-existent.<br><br>When he climbed into his expensive car at mid-day and drove away from the ground on which he expected to make his 201st Red Devils start, Van Nistelrooy must have known he was effectively ending his United career.<br><br>No official reason was given before kick-off for the Dutchman's departure but the rumour was he had just been told by Ferguson his services were only required for the bench as 19-year-old Giuseppe Rossi had been chosen to partner Saha instead of him.<br><br>In a sense, the selection rendered Van Nistelrooy's response irrelevant. To all intents and purposes, the former PSV Eindhoven striker's time at Old Trafford is over and he will remain on 150 goals for the club, one of only eight players in history to achieve such a feat.<br><br>Whether he watched the game on TV, listened on the radio or was just told about it afterwards, Van Nistelrooy will have learned his soon-to-be old team-mates coped very well without him.<br><br>It was impossible to miss the extra verve Rossi's introduction brought to a United side who had picked up just five points from their last four games.<br><br>Rossi might not have got his name on the scoresheet during a mesmeric opening period but his impact was telling nonetheless.<br><br>The teenager had already carved out a couple of half chances for himself when Richardson let fly with a brutal 30-yard shot which crashed down off the crossbar.<br><br>For one fleeting moment, it looked as though it had crossed the line but TV replays proved it had bounced right on the line and the officials had been correct to wave play on.<br><br>It was not long before Charlton keeper Stephan Andersen was picking the ball out of his net though as Saha, the man who originally ousted Van Nistelrooy from the Red Devils' starting line-up, rose to glance home a Ryan Giggs corner.<br><br>Ronaldo made it two midway through the half, with Giggs again supplying the assist.<br><br>After failing to make any contact with his first attempt to convert the Welshman's low cross, Ronaldo was no doubt grateful for a kind rebound which offered him a second attempt to fire home his 12th goal of another mixed campaign.<br><br>There was also an element of good fortune about United's third, although Ronaldo could argue it was his far post run which harassed Euell into turning Saha's low cross into his own net.<br><br>Had Andersen not shown admirable reflexes to push a flying Rossi header over, even the young Italian would have got his name on the scoresheet.<br><br>Instead, the hosts had to wait for their fourth until Richardson reinforced his late bid for inclusion in the expanded England squad Sven-Goran Eriksson will name tomorrow by thundering home from 25 yards just before the hour.<br><br>The introduction of two old stagers, Paul Scholes and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, either side of Richardson's effort only reinforced the sense of a carnival, although this kind of party was hardly the kind Alan Curbishley would have wished for after 15 years' outstanding service in charge at Charlton.<br><br>Prior to kick-off, Ferguson had presented Curbishley with two return tickets to New Zealand so he could visit his sister, which his impending exile from the game will give him chance to do.<br><br>For all his United future is worth, Van Nistelrooy might as well have got one too. Except his need only be one way.<br><br><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=186137&amp;cc=4716" rel="nofollow">http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=186137&amp;cc=4716</a></div>

I hope as he grows older, these 2 aspects of his game will improve and by then I hope he will still be loyal to Man U because he has an attitude that I can see in future he will be in a contorversy and on his way out of the club. Maybe Man U should get Downing, or Wright Phillips. Gudjohnsen is good too, a Solskjaer kind of player. Maybe go for Morgen Gamst Pederson or maybe Bellamy? Pennant could be a good buy and anyway Birmingham has relegated. Maybe try get Youssi Benayoun. Joaquin. Torres. Tevez. But whatever it is get a solid midfield anchor first le..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tarcki, I think you missing it, so do you mean that all WC teams should now import 7Footers into their team?<br><br>For me, I strongly believe you play to your strength, and for english, it is surely not mr "Beanpole".  I believe he was taken just in the last 15mins, and with England losing, England needs one extra head over the rest to pressure the defence.<br>Look around the EPL, do we see any other 6-9" players anywhere?<br><br>If you bring strikers not to score but to lay off cross, you are going to be out of WC before you know it. You are just wasting resources.<br><br>For my opinion, England rely on link play between strikers and midfielders like SG, FL, and Rooney. Walcott is like owen, 1st pace so they work off any through-pass.<br>Walcott is young and raw so he will not be afraid so he will CHIONG!!!!<br><br>For SG, FLampard, DBeck, JCole and WRooney, they are the creative ones who can make it happen. All eyes on Jcole this WC..<br><br>Believe it or not, SG, and FLampard, it is their first WC.  So they will do their best to perform.<br><br>hurry, WC...<br><br></div>
