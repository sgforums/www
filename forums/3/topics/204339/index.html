            <div class='col-md body'>John Terry has been named the new England Captain beating Gerrard to the post.<br><br>England manager Steve McClaren told the FA website: "Choosing a captain is one of the most important decisions a coach has to make. I'm certain I've got the right man in John Terry. I'm convinced he will prove to be one of the best captains England has ever had.<br><br>"John has all the attributes an international captain needs: leadership, authority, courage, ability, tactical awareness and a total refusal to accept second-best. He has been an inspiration for Chelsea and is at his best in adversity.<br><br>"Over the five years I've been involved with the England coaching set-up I've seen first hand the respect that John has among his fellow players. There are a number of strong leaders in the squad and he will not lack support on and off the pitch."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>terry is captain i'm ok wif dat! as long as not neville or looney can already. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>but i feel gerrard should be better choice since he can lead in attacks, whereas a captain in defence will hold strong solid defend which might be boring.</div>
