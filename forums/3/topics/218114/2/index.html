            <div class='col-md body'>GP, I am keeping sick of your verbal vormit.<br><br>For your information, Chelsea won EPL league title twice, so they are only the best team in English League twice. End of story.<br><br>They are nothing in Europe.. Okie..<br><br>They are only worth mentioning, is because Mourinho won the cup once.<br>And given how he is huring insults at Barca, the team that gave him a chance at mangerial position, it speaks volume of him already.<br><br>So until Chelsea establish themselves, please stop the crap about Chelsea being one of the footballing giants. You are NOT!!!<br><br>And if you can't even detect sacracism in others, and reply with some thought, I recommend stop posting.<br><br>We all know what will come out from you, you only know how to write one thing, Chelsea is top of footballing world, which in truth, you are not and just barrages MUFC.<br><br>I pity you getting shelled, and you just keep using the same old lines about how Chelsea won the league title, and everyone is going on this witchhunt.<br><br>You are so stale.<br></div>
