It is the same as England among others Fav countries like brazil n france.

You watch other leagues also? Hard to believe from your comments.<br><br>I just hope u will repsect and appreciate other teams as well, if not you are no better than the arrogant chelsea fans that you have been hating. Reflect on yourself before you critise others, have u set a good example yourself?<br><br>I am not picking a fight, so if you felt offended i apologise beforehand.<br><br>Cheers man  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>EPL is definitely the most entertaining in terms of soccer "entertainment". But winning world cup with that kind of skills, tactics, or team work? Forget about it.<br><br>England will not even able to make it to the last four.<br><br>Those who said England has a very high chance, they are all frogs under the well. Because the only know EPL, they have a very narrow look at what is about soccer.<br><br>Tell you what, those so-called England STARs sounds bigger than what they actually can perform.<br></div>
