Overhype by the media and not enough exposure of other leagues in the world from Singapore or even most of Asia.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>you think they are good because you watch them play every week.<br><br>there are lots of good players in other countries too.<br><br>but do we follow their league?</blockquote>I say they are good not just because i watch them play week in week out. Even football experts who not only follow the EPL says this is England best chance of winning the world cup. Not many countries has quality player like England. I nv says the cfm win the WC but the chances are there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True, England stand a chance of winning it and indeed have some world class players.<br><br>But please EPL fans and England supporters please repsect other teams and other world class players. Dont say until only England got World Class players or that EPL is the only place where the world class players play. You know why also got people hate England supporters? Same reasons why people hate Chlesea FC. Give credit when its due to other teams also.<br><br>If you think that way then all i can say that your perspective is very narrow and that your football horizon is not broad enough. I can say you are a True EPL and England fan, but i cannot say you are a TRUE soccer fan, coz true fans knows how to RESPECT and APPRECIATE other teams.</div>
