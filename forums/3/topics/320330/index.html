              <h1 class="clr">Nadal crushes Federer for fourth French Open title</h1>
              <p>PARIS (AFP) - - Rafael Nadal won his fourth successive French Open
              title on Sunday with a 6-1, 6-3, 6-0 victory over Roger Federer.</p>
              <p>The Spanish second seed joined Bjorn Borg (1978-1981) as the only man to win four Roland Garros trophies in a row.</p>
              <p>Sunday's
              win was Nadal's 28th win in 28 matches here and was his third
              successive final win over the world number one who is still without the
              French Open title he needs to complete a career Grand Slam.</p>
              <p>The Swiss remains on 12 Grand Slam wins, still two short of Pete Sampras's record of 14.</p>
              <p>Sunday's win was Nadal's 11th in 17 meetings with Federer and his ninth in 10 claycourt clashes.</p>

              <p>Well, Federer got to wait another year for revenge.</p>
              <p>Nadal was simply too overpowering.</p>

              <p>I think his problem is his girlfriend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Agassi was involved with Brooke Shields, his ranking dropped to over a hundred.</p>
              <p>When Hewitt got involved with Clisters and then another girl, what is his ranking now?</p>
              <p>After Srichapon got tackled by a Thai actress, we hardly hear of him now.</p>
              <p>When I got married, my wife wants me to spend more time &amp; play a different ball game with her and my strokes are now different.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like they say, the hole trouble is the whole trouble.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But, Fed have just won his 13th slam and I bet you that he will get his 14th and maybe 15th next year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't like NutDull, especially when he's always scratching his ass during a game.</p>

              <p>Federer has been with his girlfriend for quite sometime already and its only this year that he has not been performing that well..</p>
              <p>but nonetheless, he did great this US open. I hope he keeps up and continue winning the Shanghai Masters and then Australian Open.. etc..</p>

              <p>True, but it could be that his gf have not been a problem in previous years.</p>

              <p>If you observe close enough, you'll see that she has put on a lot of weight this year.</p>

              <p>I would point his loss of form to the grandular fever he suffered early this year coupled with the severe loss in confidence especially after his loss to Nadal in the finals of Wimbledon.</p>
              <p>Anyway, glad he won the US Open and will be looking forward to him winning the Australian Open next year.</p>

              <p>As you said, the fever was early in the year. Why should it affect him almost 3/4 of the year? He was not p;aying his best, even prior to his loss at Wimbledon. I still think it's his gf.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you think Fed would win the US open if he had played Nadal instead of Murray in the finals? He should be thankful to Andy for taking out Rafael.</p>

              <p>If nadal lost to murray</p>
              <p>murray lost to fedder</p>
              <p>a P1 would also say fedder is better mah.</p>
              <p>IMO, he is still the best player in the world and i still regard him as top.......murray says that he is playing against the best player in the world before and after the final but NOT the semis</p>

              <p>Fed is still my favourite. However, he doesn't seem to be able to play his best against Nadal. Two succesive losses to Nadal in 2 Grand slam finals must have a psychological effect on him and if he had to play Nadal in the US open, there would a lot of pressure on him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's wait and see what happens in Shanghai next month. I'm hoping he'll get a chance to play against and beat Nadal then.</p>
