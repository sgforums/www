            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, pardon my few cents....<br><br>Well, a seris of possibilities ran through my mind when I saw your topic, and I thought that the psychological healing process might just be your answer, she might be hurt psychologically after the rape incident and is now on a vengence out to "Rape" Man. This is caused by the unbalanced outlook on life after the rape incident. She have been prim and proper before all that, and after that she was dissapointed that she got nothing but hurt in return for being there. This unbalanced view on life might cause her to want to protect herself, and she might feel that the best way to do it is to "rape" man rather that to let them rape her. She feels in control of her life and body, rather than being forced to do it, she choose to do it willingly. It is more of a psychological unbalance rather than a physical need she is feeling. Thus in view of this, she is rather pitiful, rather than hateful.<br><br>The above psychological barriers is what a rape victim might face, and it takes years or even a life time for them to understand thier own identity once more.<br><br>After all that, I then again thought, hmmm....but then again she might really be a nympo for all we know. *smiles* Just that she realised her identity after the rape? *Shrugs* Anything is possible.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Chong is, as we all know, a true blue S'porean but her mental framework is defintely no S'porean. She is a remarkable lady who has managed a name for herself both in the States and S'pore. Think about it... how many of us are able to achieve such stature at her age albeit in an unique way? It may be an objectionable thing to do here (generally in Asia) to be screwed by so many studs but she may be enjoying every bit of it. Let's not be those "ah soh" and pass unjust remark on this S'pore favorite daughter and give all our blessings to her in whatever she does. Remember folks, it is her life and who are we to pass judgement on what she does.She deserves my respect for resisting the social stigma this society has bestowed upon her. A kickass character! Hooray!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello everyone,<br><br>I am usually a voyeurer but I think I need to voice out my opinion. Forgive me if I offend anybody here.<br><br>I think "Annabel" is really a pitiful sight. Has anyone of you seen her video? I had the opportunity to see it and I cried because I feel that she is soo exploited. I feel that many things are actually in her control and she actually abused it. Deep down, I feel that she is really crying out for attention. She wants to be known...well, by all means but at least be PAID for it!!!<br><br>Do you guys know that she was supposed to get only $10,000USD for that video with 251 men? However, at the end of the day, she didn't even see a single cent of it. She decides then that she doesn't care as she is not doing it for the sake of money..Fine!<br><br>However in the same video, she is seen negotiating for a $1000 dollars for a new porno movie simply because she is Annabel Chong...well, I think it is pure simplicity and an overdose of egoism....all in that pitiful body crying out for attention...<br><br>I don't think she was too affected by that rape as she intended to have intercourse with the first guy who 'rape' her. Had she ot been so easy, she would not have invited all these in the first place.<br><br>Please do not be mistaken, I am a girl with pretty liberal ideas as well...However, after watching that movie, my heart goes out to her poor mother and ailing dad. I think she is simply irresponsible and I cannot image anyone here calling her daughter of Singaopore.<br>I am currently working overseas and I hate it when all people know of Singapore is Annabel. I frankly hate it...with all respect to Grace.<br><br></div>
