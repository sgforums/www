It would be fun to have a big group to play 2 sides on the field with big goal poles. I am trying to get another keeper down this Sun so that both sides have a regular keeper. It would be good if you could let us know how many of your guys are coming down this Sun so that we can work on the numbers. We will try to even out the 2 teams. See ya on Sun @ 0930hrs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Khai, sad to know that the game is off on 3 Nov.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  Not sure if I can still "salvage" the 4 Nov game as I had rejected it earlier already.  Will try though and get back to you guys.  In the meantime, let's see if there are other teams avaliable like Hong Wei's brother's team, Alfred's team on 3 Nov.
