            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Well, since I did a season review at the end of last season of the EPL, I decided to do a season preview before this SaturdayÂ’s kick-off.  To keep this preview short, I will just focus on the title favourites and errÂ…one not so favourite  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> :<br><br><strong>Arsenal (Last season - Defending champions)</strong><br><br>They had a tremendous season last year, achieving the League and FA Cup double.  Few will argue (apart from Spurs fans) that they didnÂ’t deserve it.  With FranceÂ’s Â“dismalÂ” (I decided to refrain from using harsher words) performance in the World Cup, its French stars will be out to prove a point this season.  However, with the departure of Richard Wright and Alex Manninger, one wonders if theyÂ’ve got enough depth in the goalkeeping department.  Considering David SeamanÂ’s age (can someone pease tell him to lose the ponytail?!), loaning Fabian Carini from Juventus might not be enough.  With the additional retirements of Lee Dixon and Tony Adams, new signing Pascal Cygan has to settle into the team or ArsenalÂ’s defence might face problems through the season.  Having already achieved the Double twice with Arsenal, Wenger will try to improve on ArsenalÂ’s performance in the ChampionsÂ’ League from previous seasons.  This might cause the manager and his players to lose focus on the league and cost the Gunners the league title.  Prediction Â– 2nd placing.<br><br><strong>Liverpool (Last season - 2nd placing)</strong><br><br>The Reds.  The club I have been supporting for 18 years.  IÂ’ll try not to be too biased  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> .  One must admit that Gerard Houllier has done an impressive job since his arrival at Liverpool.  He has successfully transformed Liverpool from an under-achieving, flashy team of Spice Boys  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  to a hardworking and occasionally boring team  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  (see, I can be partial) that can once again grind out results.  Every Liverpool fan will tell you that having finished 4th, 3rd and then 2nd last season, the title is destined to return to Anfield after 12 years.  The main problem with Liverpool last season was the lack of creativity in their attack when they face defensive teams.  Although Steven Gerrard is capable of spraying some brilliant passes, he is still not the playmaker that Liverpool so badly needs.  With the arrival of El Hadji Diouf and Bruno Cheyrou, Houllier might have just found the creativity needed in the squad.  The faster they find their feet in the English game, the higher LiverpoolÂ’s chances of premiership glory will be.  Although Liverpool will want to do well in Europe this season, the manager and players have all declared that the premiership is their target this season.  Prediction - Champions! (I tried  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br><strong>Manchester United (Last season Â– 3rd placing  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  )</strong><br><br>I must first declare that I have nothing against Man U and even liked them during the days of Bryan Robson.  I just donÂ’t like the attitude of some of their players and the manager as well  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  .  After a trophy-less season, everybody is expecting Man U to bounce back with fire.  The purchase of Rio Ferdinand for 30 million pounds (talk about over-priced!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  ) only adds to that belief.  I personally feel that the defence will still be the Achilles heel of this team, especially with the departure of Dennis Irwin and Ronnie Johnsen.  How well they do will very much depend on how soon Veron starts playing the way heÂ’s capable of, how Van Nistlerooy copes with his 2nd season (always the toughest for a striker) and how Ferguson juggles his midfield.  With an immense wealth of talent in midfield, Ferguson will have a big headache squeezing Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Roy Keane, Juan Veron, Paul Scholes and now Nicky Butt into 4 midfield slots.  Having said all that, the Red Devils are still a very good team and are favourites for the title.  However, with the recent furore surrounding Roy KeaneÂ’s book, you can expect the press to blow everything little issue out of proportion.  With this distraction in addition to FergusonÂ’s dream of winning the ChampionsÂ’ League at Old Trafford, crucial points might be squandered during the course of the season.  Prediction - 3rd placing.<br><br><strong>Tottenham Hotspur (Last season Â– 9th placing)</strong><br><br>Glenn Hoddle.  White Hart Lane legend as a player and now prophesised messiah as a manager.  After continuous seasons in mid-table mediocrity, the fans are expecting big things from him (reincarnation and faith-healing aside  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  ).  As a club manager, he does have a proven track record with relatively successful spells at Chelsea and Southampton, so expect him to turn things around if he gets the necessary financial support from the board.  Spurs have strengthened their squad by getting midfielders Jamie Redknapp from Liverpool and Milenko Acimovic (Aci-who?) from Red Star Belgrade.  While they are good players (they really are), what the club REALLY needs is an established striker to take on the goal-scoring responsibilities.  While theyÂ’ve been linked to the likes of Robbie Keane, Rivaldo (yeah right!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  ) and Fernando Morientes, the lack of that badly needed striker will prevent them from achieving much this season.  Prediction - 7th placing.<br><br>Well, thatÂ’s it...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  My forecast for the EPL this season.  While I have predicted the usual suspects for the top 3 positions, there is every possibility that Leeds, Newcastle, Chelsea or even Man City manage to squeeze their way in.  Of course, these are just my personal views and any similarities to what actually happens during the season are purely coincidental!  Last but not least, in answer to the thought going through your heads now; yes, IÂ’m too freeÂ…  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

The fact is, not every team is capable of playing the way Arsenal does.  Going by last season's performance, not even Man U.  Hopefully with Diouf and Cheyrou, we will all see a more exciting Liverpool team.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>
