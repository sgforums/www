            <div class='col-md body'>I was considering switching to ADSL but I have made up my mind to stick with cable after reading this series of messages from another forum.<br><br>____________________________<br>a. Can Singtel ADSL share with 4 computers in my house with a SMC Internet router? I am using it now for SCV.<br>if your router has 4 ports then should be okay.<br><br>b. Do I need Microfilter for each port for each my phone extension to avoid interference? I have 5 extensions in my house.<br>You need microfilters for all extensions. Even tho you have done that, you will still experienced disconenctions sometimes, that's y adsl su*cks.<br><br>b. Is Singtel ADSL 256 K speed similar to SCV or better or worst?<br>ADSL 256K download speed su*cks when compared to cablem modem, now my friend regret of subscribing to adsl, because when he download a movie, my cable dl it at half the time he has. It really suc*ks, if can get 512K or singtel magix, dun get cheapo 256K.<br><br>I am still using cable after almost 1 1/2 yrs, still works great.<br>_____________________________<br><br>Â 	18602.3 in reply to 18602.1Â <br>I am using Singnet Broadband 256k for more than 6 months. I have hell of a problem initially but was rectified after 3 weeks. The main problem is always got kick out when you dial in. I regretted subscribing for it havung to sign a 18 months contract which cannot be cancelled. Formally I am using SCV which is slightly faster but more reliable than SINGNET.<br><br>Yes, you need micro filters for all your extentions you are using. Don't forget your computer must also not too far from the phone plug.<br><br>Other than all these I have to recall. Can't remember, but will let you know if I can. Anyway you still encouter a lot of problems when first started.<br>______________________________<br><br>Another thing, Singnet Tech. personnel will blame your computer having too many programmes. After transfering to CDs or deleting all these problems still exist. They make a fool out of you at their mercy even almost every single programme taken out, still being disconnected. No choice, just to bear with it because of 'contract signed'. At the end I have to delete Micosoft 98 and buy another one of Millenium Edition. This one actually do the 'trick'.<br><br>Because I know 'nut' about PCs etc.etc...I have to get help from friends and members of my family.<br><br>So before you sign up prepare for all these unneccesary encounter.<br><br>For your info, one micofilter cost $15 to $16 at that time. Got it from Sim Lim at $11.00 only.<br><br>Can try...it is much cheaper....512K may not have problem.<br>_____________________________<br><br>I have used SCV and now using Singnet's ADSL 256K.<br><br>SCV is so much faster. Regretted signing up with Singnet. I'm stuck with Singnet for 2 years.<br>_____________________________<br><br>my SCV speed is around 750K to 1100K compared to the fixed 512K singnet ADSL. pui pui pui. still must sign contract. if u're the one who like to save money but get lots of cock-up, singnet adsl is for Ãœ.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes! Finally managed to get verified!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Anyway, just wanted to highlight that if the people with the comments were not staying in high-rised apartments (couldn't tell from the quotes), then obviously the cable would have been much faster.<br><br>But it's still good to be aware of such comments.
