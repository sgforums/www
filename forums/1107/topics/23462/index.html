They're both useless in Europe.<br><br>Q.What's the difference between a hedgehog and the Man U team bus?<br><br>A. The Man U bus has more pricks!<br><br>Q. How many Manchester United fans does it take to change a light bulb?<br><br>A. (I) Three. One to change the light bulb, one to buy the "1999 light bulb changing" commemorative t-shirt and video, and one to drive the other two back to Torquay.<br><br>A. (II) Who cares, so long as it comes out in 4 different versions (Â£49.99 each), and changes twice every season?<br><br>Top tip for Manchester United fans: don't waste money on expensive new kits every season. Simply strap a large inflatable penis to your forehead, and everyone will immediately know which team you support.<br><br></div>

The following week he accosted Hesky once more and got his autograph, and after the next game he tried to get it yet again.<br><br>"Look here," said Hesky, "this is the third time you've asked for my autograph.

The son asked, "Is he worth it dad?"<br><br>To which the father, surprised at his son's interest in fine art, replied "I suppose so, son.

It's your whole life. You never take me out. You never buy me presents. You're either at a match or watching one on the box. I bet you can't even remember when our wedding anniversary is."<br><br>"Yes, I can," her husband retorted, "it's the same date that Real Madrid beat Manchester United in the Cup-Winners' Cup."<br><br>It's all your fault<br><br>At the height of Eric Cantona's fame with Manchester United, the manager buys a Bosnian striker for their second team. Although he plays well, he goes virtually unnoticed until Eric Cantona decides to return to France, leaving a terrible gap in the side.<br><br>The manager decides to try the Bosnian out in one first team game and is delighted when he plays brilliant football and gets three goals. After the game everyone congratulates the Bosnian and the manager offers him a full contract and a huge salary.<br><br>The Bosnian is thrilled and says, "I must phone my mother to tell her the. good news."<br><br>When he gets through to his mother she says; "Well, son, I have bad news for you - your father was out foraging for food and was shot dead. Your brother went out after him to try to find out what happened and to seek some recompense - he was badly beaten and had both his legs broken, and this is ALL YOUR FAULT!"<br><br>The Bosnian is shocked and says, "How is this my fault? I had nothing to do with it!" But his mother replies, "If it weren't for you, we wouldn't be in Manchester in the first place!"<br></div>
