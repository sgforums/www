            <div class='col-md body'>It was a special sunday for Kachangpool FC....We finally clinged a well-deserved win away from home in<br>the "ulu" part of Yishun,next to a longkang,which happens to be a grave for footballs.<br><br>Weather condition was fine but the state of the field was far from that,with patches of bumpy hard soil scattered all around.But that failed to deter the high morale Reds from playing their new found style of football.An amazing 17 players turned up for this match,all ready to rotate<br>among their respective positions throughout the game.<br><br>The match started with us doing most of the attacking down the flanks and through the centre, managing<br>to feed the strikers with several through passes.Referee was strict with his calls for offside and we were caught on several occasions.The<br>strikers did have some decent chances but missed narrowly.<br><br>The opening came when Russell stole the ball from the keeper and tapped it home.He claimed the keeper<br>was holding on to his leg,but never the less it was an opportunist goal,or a gift if you wanna put it that way.<br><br>The opponents tried retaliating from the restart,but most of their passes were cut out before they could come near our penalty box.They had one or two corners but they weren't much of a threat.It wasn't long before we went two up with a brilliant long range lobbing kind of shot from manager Robin that caught the keeper off his line.The score was Kachangpool 2 Liverpool 0  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>We have to give the opponents credit coz they still tried to fight back and eventually got one back just b4 half time.The defence failed to clear a loose ball at the edge of<br>the box and the striker finished the cross with a top corner shot.<br><br>The second half started with our team having a new strikeforce and midfield.We continued our fine attacking play,had a few shots towards goal and even more calls for<br>offside as well.There were times when i felt that the referee wasn't very accurate with his decisions,but<br>we can't say much can we?<br><br>As the second half ticked by,the opponents became more frustrated with their defence who failed to clear the ball and often kicked it out of play.They started playing hard and dirty,more concerned on hacking our players than on the game itself.Robin,Derrick,Ian,Kelvin and Jeremy were some of the players at the end of some ruthless tackles,but<br>luckily no serious injuries.<br><br>The opponents beacame quite dis-orientated while our defence continued to be rocksteady and tight like a virgin,and i can safely say that our keeper Colin saw little of the ball,and was rather bored.<br><br>The score remained 2-1 right up to the final whistle and victory was sweet for the red boys who played their hearts out.<br><br>Hopefully this is the start of more wins to come....and honestly looking at the 20 players donning the splendid red jerseys and super short and sexy shorts,i wouldn't bet against it.<br><br>WELL DONE BOYS!!!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[b]Excellent play from Forlan scoring 2 goals to take out Liverpool at Anfield........Ooohhhh.........we are not talking about the game that Liverpool lost to Man-U......ooopppss <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>First of all, "Jem" Edwin Yeo, no Kachangpool please <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> .  I think we deserve a better name than that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Personally, I am very happy that we had our first win but felt that we could have done so much more during the game.  Field was quite bad but at least, it only cost $70/-......reasonable lah. Our opponents was quite weak compared to the last few teams whom we have played with.  Did not see any potential danger player in the opponent's team.  As Shadow has pointed out, the scoreline did not reflect the game.<br><br>Basically, the opponents totally "pun chek" in the 2nd half, allowing us many chances which we did not capitalise.  Defensively, we were sound but must learn not to play the ball in the centre or in the penalty box.......ver dangerous. Our defence is more or less settled, need more improvement in the midfield and striking areas.  Have to work on the style of play for our team and the positions of our players as well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>
