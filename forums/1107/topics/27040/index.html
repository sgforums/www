Anyway, Khairul's injury resembles what I had in JC. I had shin splints and the best treatment is to stop running and jumping until it heals itself. Being a student, I was also refered to the SSC physiotherapist. However, I do not think Khairul's is as serious.<br><br>By the way, you can try out the shin pads.</div>

Those young guys had more stamina and pace.  We still need to do more off-the-ball running into open spaces as well.  So when's the next game?  If there isn't one this Sunday, we can go down to the field and have a training-cum-kick around session.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun think there is going to be any training but more of kicking around. Probably, play 2 sides with small goal-poles if possible. With Marcus out, we have to look for more players.<br><br>Khai, I feel that you may be right about the formation. Maybe we should play 4-4-2.  More straight forward and simple.....I think more suitable for our players. From the last few games, I feel that we are not sufficiently holding/cutting the ball in the midfield area.  The ball keeps going back to our defence so quickly, making everybody tired.<br><br>With 4-4-2:<br>Defensively, we can play Charles as last man, Jeremy as stopper, Chester as right back and Alfred as left back (must source for 2 reserve defenders, Ben? Jae?).<br>In midfield, we will have Russ playing left mid, Damien as defensive center mid and Khai as attacking centre mid, I will play right mid (reserves can be Patrick, Mun Yeong, Michael and maybe Jason?)<br>Striking will still be Alvin and Jimmy. Alternatively, Jeremy.<br><br>I hope that Jae and Jason can join us.<br><br>In the meantime, pls keep those feedback coming in.</div>
