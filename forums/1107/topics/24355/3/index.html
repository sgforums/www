The rabbit looks at her and says, "Giraffe, my friend, why do you do this? Come with me running through the forest. YouÂ’ll see, youÂ’ll feel so much better!"  The giraffe looks at him, looks at the joint, tosses it and goes off running with the rabbit.<br><br>Then they come across an elephant doing coke. So the rabbit again says, "Elephant, my friend, why do you do this? Think about your health! Come running with us through the pretty forest. YouÂ’ll see, youÂ’ll feel so good!"  The elephant looks at them, looks at his razor, mirror and all, then tosses them and starts running with the rabbit and giraffe.<br><br>The three animals then come across a lion about to shoot up.  "Lion, my friend, why do you do this? Think about your health!  Come running with us through the sunny forest. You will feel so good!"  The lion looks at him, puts down his needle and starts to beat the shit out of the little rabbit.<br><br>As the giraffe and elephant watch in horror, they look at him and ask, "Lion, why did you do this? He was merely trying to help us all!"<br><br>The lion answers, "That little shit makes me run around the forest like an idiot for hours every time heÂ’s on ecstasy!"<br></div>

In one easy flip, the beast tossed him and his boat high into the air.  Then it opened its mouth to swallow both. As the man sailed head over heels, he cried out, "Oh, my God! Help me!"<br><br>At once, the ferocious attack scene froze in place, and as the atheist hung in mid-air, a booming voice came down from the clouds, "I thought you didn't believe in Me!"<br><br>"Come on God, give me a break!," the man pleaded. "Two minutes ago I didn't believe in the Loch Ness monster either."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A 'Husband Shopping Centre' was opened where a woman could go to choose from among many men, to be her husband.  It was laid out in five floors, with the men increasing in positive attributes as you ascended up the floors.  The only rule was, once you opened the door to any floor,you must choose a man from that floor, and if you went up a floor, you couldn't go back down except to leave the place.<br><br>So, a couple of girlfriends go to the place to find men.  First floor, the door had a sign saying: <strong>'These men have jobs and love kids.'  </strong>The women read the sign and say: "Well that's better than not having jobs, or not loving kids, but I wonder what's further up?"  So up they go.<br><br>Second floor says: <strong>'These men have high paying jobs, love kids, and are extremely good looking'</strong>.  "Hmmm", say the girls, "But, I wonder what's further up?"<br><br>Third floor: <strong>'These men have high paying jobs, are extremely good looking, love kids and help with the housework.' </strong>"Wow!" say the women. "Very tempting, BUT, there's more further up!" And so again, they go up.<br><br>Fourth floor: <strong>'These men have high paying jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking, help with the housework, and have a strong romantic streak.' </strong>"Oh, mercy me. But just think!?!?! What must be awaiting us further on!"<br><br>So up to the fifth floor they go. The sign on that door said: <strong>'This floor is just to prove that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping and have a nice day!!'</strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Poor Johnson had spent his life making wrong decisions. If he bet on a horse, it would lose; if he chose one elevator rather than another, it was the one he chose that stalled between floors; the line he picked before the bank tellerÂ’s cage never moved; the lane he chose in traffic crawled; the day he picked the picnic was the day of a cloudburst; and so it went, day after day, year after year.<br><br>Then, once, it became necessary for Johnson to travel to some city a thousand miles away and do it quickly. A plane was the only possible conveyance that would get him there in time, and it turned out that only one company supplied only one flight that would do. His heart bounded. There was no choice to make! And if he made no choice, surely he could come to no grief.<br><br>He took the plane.<br><br>Imagine his horror when, midway in the flight, the planeÂ’s engines caught fire and it became obvious the plane would crash in moments.<br><br>Johnson broke into fervent prayer to his favorite saint, Saint Francis. He pleaded, "I have never in my life made the right choice. Why this should be, I donÂ’t know, but I have borne my cross and have not complained. On this occasion, however, I did not make a choice; this was the only plane I could take and I had to take it. Why, then, am I being punished?"<br><br>He had no sooner finished when a giant hand swooped down out of the clouds and somehow snatched him from the plane. There he was, miraculously suspended two miles above the earthÂ’s surface, while the plane spiraled downward far below.<br><br>A heavenly voice came down from the clouds. "My son, I can save you, if you have in truth called upon me."<br><br>"Yes, I called on you," cried Johnson. "I called on you, Saint Francis!"<br><br>"Ah," said the heavenly voice, "Saint Francis Xavier or Saint Francis of Assisi. Which?"<br></div>
