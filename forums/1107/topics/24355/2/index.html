Because the store charged $50 for such cleanings, he told him he might be better off reading the printer's manual and trying the job himself.<br><br>Pleasantly surprised by his candor, he asked, "Does your boss know that you discourage business?"<br><br>"Actually, it is my boss's idea," the employee replied sheepishly.<br><br>"We usually make more money on repairs if we let people try to fix things themselves first."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was a stifling hot day and a man fainted in the middle of a busy intersection.  Traffic quickly piled up in all directions, and a woman rushed to help him.  When she knelt down to loosen his collar, a man emerged from the crowd, pushed her aside and said, "It's all right honey, I've had a course in first aid."<br><br>The woman stood up and watched as he took the ill man's pulse and prepared to administer artificial respiration.  At this point she tapped him on the shoulder and said, "When you get to the part about calling a doctor, I'm already here."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Be on the lookout! Police warn all male clubbers, partygoers, and unsuspecting pub regulars to be alert and stay cautious when offered a drink from any woman. A date rape drug on the market, called "beer", is used by females to target unsuspecting men. The drug is found in liquid form, and is now available almost anywhere.<br><br>"Beer" is used by female sexual predators at parties and bars to persuade their male victims to go home and have sex with them. Typically, a woman needs only to persuade a guy to consume a few units of "beer" and then simply ask him home for no-strings-attached sex. Men are rendered helpless against this approach.<br><br>After several "beers" men will often succumb to desires to perform sexual acts on horrific looking women to whom they would never normally be attracted. After drinking "beer", men often awaken with only hazy memories of exactly what happened the night before...usually with a vague feeling that something bad occurred.<br><br>At other times these unfortunate men are swindled out of their life savings in a familiar scam known as "a relationship". Apparently men are much more susceptible to this scam after "beer" is administered and sex is offered by the predatory female. Please! Forward this warning to every male you know.<br>However, if you fall victim to this insidious "beer" and the predatory women administering it, there are male support groups with venues in every town where you can discuss the details of your shocking encounter in an open and frank manner with similarly affected, like-minded guys. For the support group nearest you, just look up "golf courses" in the yellow pages.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know you are a singaporean when<br><br>1. You've lost your sense of irony, sarcasm and cynicism.<br>2. You think there's nothing wrong with putting chilli sauce on everything you eat.<br>3. You wait for instructions from people in authority before doing anything.<br>4. You join queues without knowing or caring what the queue is for.<br>5. You can type an SMS on your phone as quickly as you would if you had a regular keyboard.<br>6. Your idea of a good night out consists of having dinner at a hawker centre, drinking beer, and then going to another hawker centre and eating again.<br>7. You've lost your ability to criticize people in higher positions than you, even if they're wrong.<br>8. You would buy a $20 product you don't need if it's on sale for $10 just to save the money.<br>9. You forget to say the last consonant in words like "faCT", "aTE", etc.<br>10. Every task you take on and every group you form is incomplete without a mission statement and a cheesy slogan.<br>11. "Crossing the country" means taking the MRT to the end of the line.<br>12. You don't just know what "kiasu" means, you have become it!<br>13. You would cross the entire country all day to find the places that make the perfect fried noodles, roti prata, ice kacang or chilli crab. And none of these places would be close to each other.<br>14. You have a high tolerance for nagging.<br>15. You know most or all of these acronyms and they make sense to you: NUS;NTU; ERP; SDU; PAP; MRT; LKY; GST; PRC; TIBS; SBS; SMS; JB; JBJ; AMK;AYE;PIE; ECP; BKE; ISD; ISA; SIA, 5C's; NSTB; PWD; HDB; SGH; NUH; CPF; SGX;MAS; CHIJMES; SPG; CWO...<br>16. You think that $100,000 is a reasonable price for a Toyota Corolla and $1,000,000 is a bloody cheap for a bungalow, BUT $5 for a plate of fried noodles is a barbarous outrage.<br>17. You believe that not being able to get decent roti prata outside Singapore is enough to keep the best and the brightest people from leaving.<br>18. You see nothing wrong with forming committees of select elite people to deliberate and study ways to stimulate creativity and spontaneity.<br>19. You justify every argument with the phrase "in order for us to be competitive in the 21st century".<br>20. You think everything should be "topped up".<br>21. You see nothing unusual about Trade Unions spending more time owning and operating supermarkets, drugstores, amusement parks, nightclubs, and financial services outlets rather than planning for its members who are laid off or the next strike.<br>22. You wear winter clothes indoors and summer clothes outdoors.<br>23. You're not confused by a street naming system that locates streets like Clementi Road, Clementi Street, Clementi Crescent, Clementi Lane, Clementi Drive, Clementi Way, and Clementi Avenues 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and all within walking distance of each other.<br>24. You get irritated if you don't see a sign telling you how long your wait is going to be for a bus, a train, or the expressway to take you where you want to go.<br>25. You believe shopping, shopping and shopping is the best hobby you can ever have.<br>26. When you cross the border into Malaysia, you automatically and deeply fear for your life and your wallet. Especially your wallet!!<br>27. You don't have a problem with four different direct payment systems spread out over seven different cards in your wallet.<br>28. You forgot what chewing gum tastes like.<br>29. You say "handphone", not "mobile", and you think there's no such<br>thing as a handphone that's too thin.<br>30. You have discussion and bitching sessions amongst your friends and<br>fellow citizens on the important issues concerning your livelihood and welfare but do not say anything to the correct authorities.<br>31. You believe you're the first to implement anything which you haven't<br>heard of before and you are the best in anything just because you're better<br>than Malaysia, Thailand or Indonesia.<br>32. You think you almost have it all in life when you own a car, a condo<br>&amp; a few credit cards.<br>33. You laugh at people being so singaporean and then quickly hang the<br>national flag in August before National Day in case you get fined.<br>34. Eating nasi lemak, mee pok ta, mee soup, carrot cake or fishball<br>soup for breakfast is regular. Opps, you don't understand regular! You only<br>know what is 'normal'.<br>35. You criticised the government all day long but at the end of the day,<br>you only vote for one party!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Old joke but very funny<br><br>One Of A Kind<br>Mahathir was so disappointed with his cabinet for being inefficient and corrupt that he decided to call on Goh Chok Tong and ask him how he managed to have such an efficient and uncorruptable cabinet.<br>On hearing Mahathir's woes, PM Goh said, 'Simple, Mahathir, I choose able men for my cabinet. ' Mahathir asked, 'Yes, but how do you know that they are able?' PM Goh replied, Just ask them simple questions to test their intelligence. They don't need to be too difficult. Let me illustrate to you.'<br>Just then, Tony Tan was walking by, PM Goh called out to him, 'Hey Tony, come over here.' Tony obediently walked briskly over. PM Goh asked, 'Tell me, Tony, who is your father's son ?'<br>Tony Tan immediately replied, 'Me! Of course.' PM Goh turned to Mahathir and said, 'See, all my ministers can answer this question. Why don't you go back and try.' Mahathir thank PM Goh and left.<br>Once he was back, he immediately summoned Anwar, his deputy, and shot the question at him, 'Tell me, Anwar, who is your father's son ?' Anwar was shocked beyond words and did not know the answer<br>After a while, he recovered and said, 'Boss, let me find out and I'll tell you tomorrow.' Mahathir, a bit disappointed, agreed, hoping that Anwar will give a good answer tomorrow.<br>Meanwhile, Anwar was panicking that his boss was testing him. He tried desperately to find out the answer from his staff, but none of them knew the answer. The next morning, he decided to call Bill Clinton for help.<br>Surely the most powerful person in the world must know the answer. When Bill picked up the phone, Anwar said, 'Hello, Bill, can I ask you a question?' Clinton, very busy, replied, 'Alright, but it better be good!' Anwar quickly asked, Tell me, who is your father's son ?'<br>Clinton was fuming, 'Of course its me, you stupid!' and he slammed the phone down<br>Satisfied that he got the answer, he confidently walked into Mahathir's office and said, 'Boss, I've got the answer to your question.'<br>Mahathir, happy that his deputy wasn't that dumb, said, 'So tell me quick, who is your father's son, Anwar?' Anwar confidently replied, 'It''s BILL CLINTON!'<br>Mahathir slapped his own forehead in disgust and said, No you stupid! It's TONY TAN!'<br><br></div>

Suddenly a mobile phone on one of the benches rings.  One of the men picks it up, (M - Man, W - Woman)<br><br>M - "Hello?"<br><br>W  - "Honey, it's me. Are you at the club?"<br><br>M - "Yes."<br><br>W - "Great! I am at the mall two blocks from where you are. I just saw a beautiful leather coat. It's absolutely gorgeous!!

It's for sale!! Remember?

OK?"<br><br>W - "OK, sweetie...Thanks! I'll see you later!! I love you!!!"<br><br>M - "Bye...I love you too..."<br><br>The man hangs up &amp; closes the phone's flap.

            <div class='col-md body'>My friend lives in Hougang Ave 8. One evening he went to town for a movie<br>with his friends. He was having a lot fun before he realized it was getting<br>very late.<br>He quickly made his way home. It was unusually dark and creepy that nite. As he was walking, he was astonished to find an old, creepy-looking street peddlar selling some books along the road. It gave him the shivers when he noticed this pale old guy staring at him. The old guy said, "Son, why don't you get a book ... it will keep you company". My friend acted brave and thought why not. He had a look at the old man's collection ... his hair began to rise up on end when he noticed all the books were related to the supernatural. Nonetheless, he found one that was very interesting so he asked the old man, "How much is this, Uncle?" The old guy replied, "Well son ... that's an interesting book ...it's $25." My f! riend was shocked and said "But ... but ... that's so expensive..."<br>The old man said nothing but glared at my friend which freaked him out. He<br>quickly rummaged through his pockets and found $20. "T-t-this's all I have"<br>he said. The old guy replied, "It's okay, son .... you can've the book for<br>that price." As my friend hastily paid for it and made a dash for home, the<br>old man called out to him and said, "Son ... whatever happens, don't you<br>ever flip the book to it's last page ... remember these words ...or you<br>will regret it!!!!!!!!!!!!!"<br>Reaching home, he quickly asked his parents, "Dad ... mom ... are there<br>any new booksellers nearby?"<br>"Not that we know of ... but we've heard of a creepy old man that appears<br>only at nite during a full moon and then disappears just as<br>mysteriously. Nobody knows who he is, or where he comes from but many have become victims in his wake..! . why son?"<br>"N-nothing ... just asking", said my friend and ran straight to his<br>room.<br>Nervously, he opened the book and began reading, all the time remembering the warning the old man had given him. But after a while, he grew tired and fell asleep. At midnite, as he was sound asleep in bed, a cold gush of wind blew in through his bedroom window which startled him and sent chills down his spine. He looked at his table and noticed the wind had blown the pages of the book to its last page!!!!! For awhile, he laid in bed - frozen in fear, but soon curiosity got the better of him. He had to know what was on the last page.Slowly he got out of bed and carefully picked up the book. As he glimpsed at the last page, he let out a blood-curling scream and fainted ........<br>This is what he read on the last page:<br>..<br>..<br>..<br>Retail Price : $ 10.99<br>Promotional Price : $ 5</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One day while walking down the street a highly successful Human Resources Director was hit by a bus and she died. Her soul was met at the Pearly gates by St. Peter himself. "Welcome to Heaven," said St. Peter. "Before you get settled in, it seems we have a problem. You see, we've never had a Human Resources Director make it this far and we're not really sure what to do with you." "No problem, just let me in," said the woman.<br>"Well, I'd like to, but I have higher orders. What we are going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in."<br>"Actually, I think I've made up my mind, I prefer to stay in Heaven," said the woman. "Sorry,we have rules... " And with that St. Peter put the executive in an elevator and it went down to hell. The doors opened and she found herself stepping out onto the putting green of a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club and standing in front of her were all her friends - fellow executives that she had worked with and they were all cheering for her.<br>They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks and talked about old times. They played an excellent round of golf and at night went to the country club where she enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil who was actually a really nice guy (kinda cute) and she had a great time telling jokes and dancing. Everybody shook her hand and waved good-bye as she got in the elevator. The elevator opened at the Pearly gates and she found St. Peter waiting for her. She spent the next 24 hours lounging around on the clouds and playing the harp and singing.<br>She had a great time and before she knew it her 24 hours were up and St. Peter came and got her. "So you have spent a day in hell, and a day in Heaven. Now choose your eternity," he said. The woman replied: "Well I never thought I would say this, I mean, Heaven has been really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell."<br>So St. Peter escorted her to the elevator and again she went back to Hell. When the doors opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks. The Devil came up to her and put his arm around her. "I don't understand," stammered the woman, "yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and we danced and had a great time. Now all there is are wastelands and garbage and all my friends look miserable."<br>The Devil looked at her and smiled. "Yesterday we were recruiting you. Today, you're staff....."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A woman takes a lover during the day, while her husband is at work. One day, her 9-year-old son hides in the closet during one of her romps. Her husband comes home unexpectedly, so she hides the lover in the closet.<br><br>The little boy says, "It's dark in here."<br>The man whispers, "Yes, it is."<br>Boy - "I have a baseball."<br>Man - "That's nice."<br>Boy - "Want to buy it?"<br>Man - "No, thanks."<br>Boy - "My dad's outside."<br>Man - "OK, how much?"<br>Boy - "$250."<br><br>In the next few weeks, it happens again that the boy and the mom's lover end up in the closet together.<br><br>Boy - "It's dark in here."<br>Man - "Yes, it is."<br>Boy - "I have a baseball glove."<br>Man - Remembering last time, asks, "How much?"<br>Boy - "$750."<br>Man - "Fine."<br><br>A few days later, the father says to the boy, "Grab your ball and glove.  Let's go outside and toss the baseball."<br>The boy says, "I can't. I sold them."<br>The father asks, "How much did you sell them for?"<br>The son says "$1,000."<br>The father says, "It's terrible to overcharge your friends like that. That's way more than those two things cost. I'm going to take you to church and make you confess."<br><br>They go to the church and the father makes the little boy sit in the confession booth and he closes the door.<br><br>The boy says, "It's dark in here."<br>The priest says, "Don't start that shit again!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Did you hear about the teacher who was helping one of her kindergarten students put on his boots? He was really struggling, so she began pulling and him pushing. The boots still didn't want to go on. Finally, after several minutes the first boot was on. When the second boot was on, she had worked up a sweat.<br><br>She almost whimpered when the little boy said, "Teacher, they're on the wrong feet."<br><br>She looked and sure enough, they were. It wasn't any easier pulling the boots off than it was putting them on. She managed to keep her cool as together they worked to get the boots back on -- this time on the right feet.<br><br>He then announced, "These aren't my boots."<br><br>She bit her tongue rather than get right in his face and scream, "Why didn't you say so?" like she wanted to. Once again she struggled to help him pull the ill-fitting boots off.<br><br>He then said, "They're my brother's boots. My Mom made me wear them."<br><br>She didn't know if she should laugh or cry. She mustered what grace and courage she had left to wrestle the boots on his feet again.<br><br>"Now," she said sweating profusely, "where are your mittens?"<br><br>He said, "I stuffed them in the toes of my boots. . ."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Life Explained...<br><br>On the first day God created the cow. God said, "You must go to field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer. I will give you a life span of sixty years."<br><br>The cow said, "That's a kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. Let me have twenty years and I'll give back the other forty."<br><br>And God agreed.<br><br>On the second day, God created the dog. God said, "Sit all day by the door of your house and bark at anyone who comes in or walks past. I will give you a life span of twenty years."<br><br>The dog said, "That's too long to be barking. Give me ten years and I'll give back the other ten."<br><br>So God agreed (sigh).<br><br>On the third day God created the monkey. God said, "Entertain people, do monkey tricks, make them laugh. I'll give you a twenty year life span."<br><br>Monkey said, "How boring, monkey tricks for twenty years? I don't think so. Dog gave you back ten, so that's what I'll do too, okay?"<br><br>And God agreed again.<br><br>On the fourth day God created man. God said, "Eat, sleep, play, have sex, enjoy. Do nothing, just enjoy, enjoy. I'll give you twenty years."<br><br>Man said, "What? Only twenty years? No way man. Tell you what, I'll take my twenty, and the forty cow gave back, and the ten dog gave back and the ten monkey gave back. That<br>makes eighty, okay?"<br><br>"Okay," said God. "You've got a deal."<br><br>So that is why for the first twenty years we eat, sleep, play, have sex, enjoy, and do nothing; for the next forty years we slave in the sun to support our family; for the next ten years we do monkey tricks to entertain our grandchildren; and for the last ten years we sit in front of the house and bark at everybody.<br></div>
