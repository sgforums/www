            <div class='col-md body'>Match report for 1st December 2002<br><br>It was a special sunday for Reds FC....We finally clinged a well-deserved win away from home in<br>the "ulu" part of Yishun,next to a longkang,which happens to be a grave for footballs.<br><br>Weather condition was fine but the state of the field was far from that,with patches of bumpy hard soil scattered all around.But that failed to deter the high morale Reds from playing their new found style of football.An amazing 17 players turned up for this match,all ready to rotate<br>among their respective positions throughout the game.<br><br>The match started with us doing most of the attacking down the flanks and through the centre, managing<br>to feed the strikers with several through passes.Referee was strict with his calls for offside and we were caught on several occasions.The<br>strikers did have some decent chances but missed narrowly.<br><br>The opening came when Russell stole the ball from the keeper and tapped it home.He claimed the keeper<br>was holding on to his leg,but never the less it was an opportunist goal,or a gift if you wanna put it that way.<br><br>The opponents tried retaliating from the restart,but most of their passes were cut out before they could come near our penalty box.They had one or two corners but they weren't much of a threat.It wasn't long before we went two up with a brilliant long range lobbing kind of shot from manager Robin that caught the keeper off his line.The score was Reds FC 2 Liverpool 0  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>We have to give the opponents credit coz they still tried to fight back and eventually got one back just b4 half time.The defence failed to clear a loose ball at the edge of<br>the box and the striker finished the cross with a top corner shot.<br><br>The second half started with our team having a new strikeforce and midfield.We continued our fine attacking play,had a few shots towards goal and even more calls for<br>offside as well.There were times when i felt that the referee wasn't very accurate with his decisions,but<br>we can't say much can we?<br><br>As the second half ticked by,the opponents became more frustrated with their defence who failed to clear the ball and often kicked it out of play.They started playing hard and dirty,more concerned on hacking our players than on the game itself.Robin,Derrick,Ian,Kelvin and Jeremy were some of the players at the end of some ruthless tackles,but<br>luckily no serious injuries.<br><br>The opponents beacame quite dis-orientated while our defence continued to be rocksteady and tight like a virgin,and i can safely say that our keeper Colin saw little of the ball,and was rather bored.<br><br>The score remained 2-1 right up to the final whistle and victory was sweet for the red boys who played their hearts out.<br><br>Hopefully this is the start of more wins to come....and honestly looking at the 20 players donning the splendid red jerseys and super short and sexy shorts,i wouldn't bet against it.<br><br>WELL DONE BOYS!!!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Match report for 22nd December 2002<br><br>After an inspiring performance by the Reds last week which ended with a<br>7-0 victory over their opponents,the morale and confidence back at the  Spottiswoode camp was right up there.The Reds gathered for the match in high spirits,and i can safely say that they were all fired up for yet another expected trouncing of their opponents but this time it wasn't just a walk in the park......<br><br>White Musk F.C were made up of younger players,who were exuberant and fit.Reds F.C were without striker<br>Robin who managed to get two brilliant goals in the last match,and also Alfred in defence.However,the team was happy with the timely return of Ian,Kelvin,Damien,Alvin and Jimmy.<br><br>Field condition was horrendous,especially in the centre<br>but there was no rain,in fact it was<br>a rather hot day.<br><br>Match started with both sides very weary of each other,playing safely,neither team wanting to concede too early.The Reds had plenty of possession but didn't make the best use of it.However,their pressure gradually began to tell,and midway into the first half,Khairul displayed his impeccable vision when he released a well time pass for on form striker Russell to burst pass White Musk's last line of defence and effortlessly tap it pass the keeper to put the Reds into the lead.<br><br>It wasn't all one sided,as the Whites replied with waves of attacks<br>down the flanks,but Ian and Pat did<br>well to prevent the crosses from coming in and most balls thru the centre were cut out by dynamic duo Charles and JeM,who have really seem to gel as more matches are played.<br><br>Pat,the Reds on-form right-back, was taken out after he lost his lens and Kelvin took over.The flow of the game was constantly hindered by the muddy conditions which made passing and control difficult.The Reds came close to a second goal when Robin's lobbing shot was well saved by the defiant keeper.At the other end,the Whites best chance came when<br>they snatched the ball from a defender and was through on goal,only to shoot over the bar.The teams went into the break with the score remaining at 1-0.<br><br>Second half started on a different note,the opponents brought the game to the Reds,adamantly searching for that much needed equaliser,and at times the Reds looked unsure of their game plan,leaving gaps here and there in midfield,but managed to regroup later on only.White Musk F.C continued to attack down the left flank,spearheaded by their burly midfielder and pacy left winger,but Pat who found his lens,returned into the game to do an excellent job chasing<br>and marking the winger and not letting him do much damage.<br><br>Their lucky break came soon enough when the Reds defence were caught sleeping,which is uncommon these days,allowing Banjo Bob,the Whites striker,to run through and shoot at goal from inside the box,Colin got a hand to it but the goal nevertheless managed to roll in.<br><br>The Reds were dumbfounded while the opponents were pumped with adrenaline and really went all out to try seal the match with a second goal.They became somewhat arrogant and complacent,and some players became quite emotional.<br>With around ten minutes to go, both sides knew that one goal was all it needed to put all 3 points into the bag.<br><br>You could hear the fans chanting for Russ to be fielded again,and when he came on again,he made an immediate impact,by taking the ball from the right side all by himself,he had thought of passing at first but finished it by himself with another calmly placed shot into the back of the lobster's net.That sort of put the last nail into the coffin for White Musk F.C<br><br>The Reds were ecstatic,while the faces of the opponents just sunk,because they knew it was all over by then.Alvin Lancer Boy came close to increasing the lead with a shot that went wide.<br><br>The Reds defence made sure the team hung on to the lead,with Charles and gang making sure the whites didn't make anymore attempts at goal.<br><br>The ref blew for full time and the<br>boys in<br>Red once again walked triumpiantly towards the dressing room with a well deserved victory against a somewhat worthy opponent.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Match report for 29 December 2002<br><br>Reds F.C enters this match with an unbeaten record of five games.Except for Chester,they had a full squad with Jem just recovering from a sprained ankle but still played nevertheless.Their opponents for the day was Italia.<br><br>The pitch was as usual not in very good shape and the sun was blazing mercilessly down on Spottiswoode Park,the home of the Reds.<br><br>The match started with Reds F.C taking a different approach this time,keeping defending midfielder  Robin and top scorer Russell on the bench.Was this part of their strategy,well it certainly looked so ,because the plan was for them to come in after the opponents exhausted themselves and ran out of steam.<br><br>The first fifteen minutes of the match proved to be a challenge for the Reds,as Italia gave everything they had to try take the lead.They had a few long range shots at goal but were not on target.Italia's playmaker Mr Botak was the centre of their attack,although not the fastest but had good vision.Only problem was that he was in the strikers position and had nobody to feed his passes to.The best chance Reds F.C had was a shot from Alvin that went wide.<br><br>The game was abrubtly turned around after Robin,Russ and Lawrence<br>was introduced into the team.Reds F.C earned a free kick in midfield after Lawrence got fouled.Robin took<br>the kick which found Russ who finished it easily to put the Reds ahead.<br><br>The goal seemed to have boosted the morale of the team and it was the Reds turn to pressure Italia with countless attacks down the flanks.It wasn't long before Reds F.C were two up.It was Robin again who assisted,passing the ball across the opponents goalmouth and Alvin Ang,who had a great game,was at the end of it.<br><br>Things just didn't turn out well for Italia,who just somehow couldn't find the net.Most of their through balls were cut out by Ian and Charles on the left and Pat did well to shadow their wingers on the right,giving them little chance to cross in,and when they did manage to swing in a cross or two,it was cleared away by JeM, with his spectacular flying headers :p<br><br>Just at the stroke of half-time,Reds F.C made it 3-0 when JeM blasted a long range clearance and found Ah Boon who punished Italia's defence for depending too much on the offside trap.<br><br>Although Reds F.C was leading quite comfortably,goalkeeper Colin was furious at the break and pointed out that the midfielders were not pushing up fast enough and were sticking too closly and not opening up and finding spaces for themselves.<br><br>In the second half,Italia's nightmare continued when Reds F.C put in another goal,Alvin made amends for his wasted effort earlier on by placing his shot to the left hand corner,all thanks to a neat pass from Russ.<br><br>For those who put their money on four goals at Singapore pools,they can start tearing their tickets,because quite expectedly,the fifth goal came when striker Robin who came into the game late,fired a shot which stopped awkwardly in front of goal due to a horrid mud patch,but Derrick was delighted to claim the<br>goal by ramming the ball pass the helpless keeper.<br><br>Reds made more changes by taking last man Charles out.JeM was pushed to last man position and Pat came in<br>as stopper.<br><br>With all due respects to Italia,they still fought on bravely and managed to pull one back.Gucci Tan swung a high cross to the far post and Mr Botak got a head to it.The ball bounced pass the face of goal,and Robert Toh finished it after Pat failed to clear.<br><br>The mighty Reds replied almost immediately through the left flank,when Derrick freed Ah Boon who added a second goal to his tally,making sure the ball ended at the back of the net.<br><br>After that sixth goal,Reds F.C started switching off,players started getting slack and the team often lost possession of the ball and let Italia run at the defence.<br><br>Italia earned a direct free kick just outside the box.The shot was well taken,Colin got a hand to it but failed to tip it over the bar,as the curling shot went to the top corner.<br><br>The last goal of the match came from a corner for Italia.Their striker got a head to the cross which hit the post and went in.There was some mix up of who should be taking which posts,which resulted in an easy goal for Italia.<br><br>It was a little too late for Italia to catch up and the game finished at 6-3.Although there were some lapse of concentration in the final moments of the game,the Reds still came out tops once again to stretch their unbeaten record to six games.A job well done!!!!!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Match report for 12 January 2003<br><br>The first match for the new year was REDS FC against Rugby Union Of China(RUOC) at the former's homeground,Spottiswoode Park.Both sides were looking pleased with the cool weather but were horrified as their boots sunk deep into patches of intimidating mud during the warm-up.<br><br>With the exception of Chester and Alfred,REDS FC had a full squad ready to play after a week's break.The only change to the starting line-up was Robin starting in goal.<br><br>The first quarter saw RUOC taking the game to the Reds.REDS FC were finding difficulty getting the ball out of their own half.The goalkicks from Robin were not being met or won by the midfielders who really lost out in terms of size.RUOC were huge and aggressive,and the majority of goalkicks and clearances from the Reds were being intercepted and turned into fast-paced attacks down the flanks,forcing the Reds left and<br>right backs to commit before swinging the crosses to the centre.<br><br>Pat and Kelvin were having a tough<br>time matching up to the wingers,but managed to keep their composure nonetheless.At times,RUOC looked extremely dangerous when their strikers broke through the centre and took shots after shots at goal,but there wasn't really any attempt that troubled the Reds keeper.<br><br>REDS FC trailed for first time in a long while when one of the crosses was failed to be cleared<br>by the usually steady centre-backs,and landed nicely for RUOC's Chow Yuen Fat who couldn't have missed from that distance.<br><br>Several subtitutions were made after the goal.Colin took his place behind goal and wonder boy Russell came in search for the equaliser.<br><br>RUOC did not stop piling up the pressure though,they continued winning balls in the air and outplayed the midfielders with their<br>size.Khai,Bara and Lawrence were not feeding the strikeforce enough and often lost out physically.Manager had to come out due to a weak ankle.<br><br>The defence on the other hand were<br>determined not to let in another goal and did well to frustrate RUOC's forwards with their no nonsense defending.<br><br>It wasn't a totally one sided game<br>because there was some action at the<br>other end too as Alvin Ang had a scoring chance but shot it wide.Striker Alvin had a few chances as well but lost out physically,and then the much needed equaliser came<br>at the stroke of half-time when Jimmy played quicksilver Russ through,who side-stepped the keeper before slotting the ball home.The boys went into the dressing room with one a piece.<br><br>In the second half,with the inclusion of Damien,REDS FC began brightly but it was the opponents who took the lead again.The cross came in from the other side this time and due to some bad marking,RUOC's skipper managed to put them deservingly ahead once again.The Reds led their nerves get to them and RUOC subjected the Red's defence to a jittery second half.<br><br>Manager Robin sensed the disheartening lack of morale in the team and tried to get them fired up.<br>They were rewarded,when defender right-back Kelvin netted his first goal for the team after Alvin got tackled outside the box and Kel kept admirably cool and  floated a strange but effective looking shot over the keeper into  the goal to put REDS FC level again.<br><br>Maybe they let the celebrations get to their head and RUOC capitalised on that and<br>went ahead.Jem and Alvin Ang failed to execute a routine clearance and<br>lady luck was on their RUOC's side beacause it fell once again nicely for Chin Chung Cheng to shoot it past the flustered Colin.<br><br>RUOC put REDS FC's six-match unbeaten run in severe jeopardy when they  extended their lead five minutes later from a direct free kick.Big Moose's shot curled sweetly to the top corner.Colin had no chance and Ian failed to get a head to it.<br><br>The Reds of the past would have hung their heads and give up but the<br>Reds team that we saw were totally different and continued to push on with their heads held high.Their fighting spirit was truelly commendable.Ian began spearheading the attack with his rejuvenated spurts upfront.<br><br>They managed to pull one back with ten minutes remaining.Damien given too much space and time played Russ<br>through on goal.There were calls for off-side ironically from the only defender who was playing Russ onside.The score was 4-3 with very little time remaining.Manager R made some tactical changes,and the Reds gave all they had or wat little they had left to get the equaliser.<br><br>Russ on another occasion was not able to beat the keeper who threw his body at the oncoming ball.The final chance probably was when Alvin<br>Ang flicked the ball past goalmouth<br>but Derrick was abit slow to get to the ball.<br><br>RUOC rendered REDS FC their first defeat after so long,but i guess it was about time they lost,but the spirits of the players remained high<br>because they knew it was a match well fought and worthy of praise.<br><br>Team motto: Heads up always,never say die!!!!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Match report for 19 January 2003<br><br>Although it was raining rather heavily on this gloomy sunday morning,the entire Reds FC excluding those who were injured braved the rain and made a bee-line down to Pasir Ris Cresent School only to find out that the ref had cancelled the match due to a water-logged pitch.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>This little action justs goes to show<br>the TREMENDOUS dedication given by the players to the team and i would like to take this opportunity on behalf of Manager Rob to commend each and everyone in Reds FC for their efforts. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The match turned into the first outing that the team had.They ended up at a coffee shop around the corner just in time for breakfast and a few chats.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Match report for 26 January 2003<br><br>It was matchday once again for Reds FC after a weeks break and many players were looking forward to another exciting 90 mins of kicking,heading,tackling and teamwork<br>in a game they call soccer.<br><br>In contrast to the week before,the weather was fine,in fact it was a little hot and dry.Apart from a few patches of bumpy ground,the field was<br>fit to be played on.<br><br>The visitors were Bluebird FC,made up of rather young players,and hence most of them had good stamina and several of them had<br>individual flair and terrific ballskills.Referee for the match was<br>none other than Mr Magoo.<br><br>Reds FC started the match with several positional changes.Alvin Ang<br>was pushed up as a striker and Boon dropped back into right midfield.Lawrence and Damien were absent due to injury and work commitments respectively.<br><br>The first half saw the Blues tormenting the Reds with their possession and fast wingplay down the left.Their star player was without a doubt their Thai left winger,Tom Yam.The nifty winger<br>on numerous occassions got past Kelvin using his speed and tricky turns to cross the ball into the box.The Reds were given a warning when one of the dangerous crosses was met by the head of their striker<br>and just went narrowly wide,forcing the first dive of the match from Colin.<br><br>Manager Rob came out early in the first half due to a torn boot and Superfly Jimmy came on in place of him.The Reds were sluggish and were simply not playing hard enough compared to the Blues who were putting their body into every challenge.<br><br>The Reds were in for another scare when the Blues had a striker played through on goal but the man in green blew for offside.<br><br>It was a gruelling battle between the two sides which saw many fouls being committed.The chance for the Blues came when Alf hacked a player outside the box.Reds FC were always a suspect when it came to set pieces<br>and true enough,the Blues took the lead when the free kick was floated to the far post and the striker who was left unmarked headed the ball home with ease.<br><br>Reds FC looked second best for most of the first half,with only Khairul creating most of the chances.Jimmy had problems planning his runs and Bara was often in his own world,and when interviewed after the match he said,"i was running with the ball and later forgot what i wanted to do<br>and also Man U suxxxxx". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>The Reds had several chances mainly created by Khai for Jimmy and Alvin but the finishing just wasn't up to mark.<br><br>As the clock ticked by,the game became more and more aggresive and intense.Players were falling like flies,and fouls were being given like pamphlets.Ian who moved up to left midfield,was sprinting up and down the flanks,trying to create chances but had no support,and on one occassion,was tackled ruthlessly which resulted in a yellow card for the Bluebird's right-back.<br><br>The Blues at the other end continued their onslaught,but credit must be given to the defenders ,for doing well in containing the strikers and apart from a shot or two,the Blues never really troubled the keeper Colin.<br><br>The best attempt from the Reds had to be the left-legged shot from Robin which flew at top speed just over the bar.<br><br>The half-time score remained at 1-0.<br><br>Early in the second half,the Blues once again obtained a free kick outside the box.This time a shot was<br>taken and Colin got a hand to it but<br>the ball had already crossed the line.There were calls for an infringement on Colin,claiming that he was pushed,but the ref was steadfast in his decision and was nonchalent towards the cries for foul from the Reds.<br><br>Things were not looking good for the Reds and unless they came up with a new gameplan in the next fifteen minutes or so,they were surely headed towards their second defeat in a row.<br><br>Top scorer Russ was included into the Reds side and the team hoped for some magic from the star striker.The formation of the Reds changed with Khai pushing up to partner Russ and Alvin.The new formation seemed to be very effective!!!!<br><br>The game started turning around after the second goal,and Reds FC lived up to their name of "never say die" attitude.They began challenging for every ball and the workrate of the midfielders improved immensely.Jimmy who had a quiet first half,atoned for his mediocre first half performance,by chasing for every ball.He could be found all over the pitch,often running back to help out in defence and created some chances upfront as well.Manager Rob was exceptionally fired up and fought hard to win the balls in midfield.And also not forgetting Boon who was fitting quite comfortably in his new role.In short,Reds FC were winning most of the balls in midfield,and any stray balls that got passed the midfield were professionally cut out by the defence.<br><br>Reds FC kept up the incessant pressure,in search for a much needed goal.Russ came close to scoring when Khai passed the ball into the centre but the keeper covered the angle well and the shot was saved.On another instance,Khai crossed a high one to Bara who almost got a head to it but miss time his jump.<br><br>The much awaited moment came when Jimmy played Khai through on goal.Khai made up for his previous attempt when he shot straight at the keeper, by cheekily chipping the ball<br>over the keeper and into the net, throwing the Reds a genuine lifeline.Brilliant goal indeed!!!<br><br>The Reds were fired up more than ever and for the first time in the game felt that they could take this game.The Blues retaliated by trying to pump the ball down the flanks but Pat and Alfred released some fearsome sliding tackles to make sure nothing went past them.Arial balls were cut out by Jem,the lanky stopper and last man Charles was alert and cleared all the loose balls that came his way.The blues were being frustrated.Their players were being man-marked out of the game,even star player Tom Yam.<br><br>Amidst all the enthusiasm and excitment,Manager Rob picked up a yellow card after reprimanding the ref,who was sick and tired of being shouted at all day long.<br><br>A free kick taken by Jem from defence put<br>Khai and Russ through to goal but neither was able to finish it.The Reds knew the equaliser had to come ,but just didn't know when or how.<br><br>Late into the second half,the Reds were given a corner.Manager Rob stepped up to take it.Stopper Jem ran up to add some firpower upfront.<br>Strangely enough,there were defenders surrounding him but nobody<br>actually marked him tight.Rob floated a beautiful ball across the goalmouth and Jem got behind a defender and finished it superbly with a diving header,which was totally unstoppable from that distance.Reds FC drew level finally.<br><br>After coming back from 2-0 down,the morale of the team was sky rocketed and it stung the Bluebirds into a late flurry.<br><br>Midfield maestro Khairul who had a wonderful outing came close to snatching the winner when his shot went narrowly wide.Ref awarded a goal kick even though it seemed an obvious corner.Bara also had a chance to seal the game.Khai swung a pass across goal,but Bara was hesistant to finish it,which epitomised his shyness in front of goal!!!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>In the dying seconds of the game,Bluebird FC once again were lining up for a free kick in a dangerous position just outside the box.They envisaged this chance as the best to win the match,since both their goals came from similar set pieces.A curling cross was aimed towards the far post but this time,stopper Jem confidently headed the ball out of danger,right after which the full time whistle was blown.<br><br>The two sides shook hands and any hostility that loomed during the match had evaporated into thin air and i guess both sides were happy to share the points,although if you open your ears wide,you could overhear whispers from the stands that the Reds should have taken the game,but nevertheless,it was a great effort and the entire team played very well in the second half.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Match report for 9th February 2003<br><br>After the one week Chinese New Year break,Reds FC return to Spottiswoode Park to face Boca Juniors.<br><br>Boca Juniors is a relatively young side made up of Malay boys known for their skillful footwork and flamboyance on the field.They possess a Geylang U-21 youth player who is undoubtedly their star.<br><br>The pitch showed vast improvement in condition with less sandy patches and the weather was fair.<br><br>Reds FC were without veterans Jimmy and Alfred.The latter was rumoured to have fallen down a flight of stairs in his drunken stupor.Chester and Lawrence are also missing in action due to long term injuries.<br><br>The first few moments of the first half can be described as dull and really sloppy.Most of the play was concentrated in the midfield area with the ball often going out of play.Neither team created any chances or got near the penalty area.                                 The first chance for the Reds came when Alvin Chia headed the ball<br>to Alvin Ang who fire straight into the keeper and Chia subsequently headed it out on the rebound.<br><br>The match suddenly sprung to life when the opening goal came.Derrick took a throw-in,an unfortunate defender attempted to clear but inadvertently headed the ball directly into his own net,leaving his entire team totally flabbergasted.<br><br>Boca Juniors were undaunted by the goal and fought back strongly from the restart.They stunned the Reds with two great chances.The first was<br>when Khairul Junior,the younger brother of Red's midfielder Khai,skipped past a sliding tackle from JeM and fired a powerful shot which ricochetted off the bar but alert Reds keeper Colin got a finger to it.The second instance was when another forward got passed last man Charles and shot just wide,but that was enough to give the Reds a wake up call.<br><br>Boca Junior's star player was excellent in his central role.He displayed impeccable vision and dazzling footwork.His accurate passes was always aimed at spreading<br>the ball to his wingers and forwards.The Reds defence on the other hand were vigilant and clamped<br>down swift and hard on the strikers,preventing any possible danger in the penalty box.<br><br>At the other end,Derrick had several<br>shots at goal but lacked real accuracy.Khai<br>on one instance executed his signature "nutmeg" on a defender but went on to balloon the ball way over the bar.Striker Robin showed great improvement in his confidence and managed to hold on to the ball more<br>often and made several decent passes.<br><br>The first half came to an end with just the solitary own goal seperating the two sides.<br><br>Reds FC began the second half more purposefully with the inclusion of Boon who displayed his true potential in this match.In the early<br>moments of the second half,Alvin Ang had a good chance but blasted it over the bar.<br><br>The second goal soon came when Boon expertly cut pass a player and delivered a cross which reached striker Robin who half-volleyed the ball home,to put the Reds two-nil up.Boon once again created another scoring opportunity for one of his team mate but the chance was fluffed.<br><br>As the game flowed from end to end, every attack looked capable of producing something,but Reds FC's passing and movement was marginally<br>the more penetrating.<br><br>Reds FC's more incisve pressure eventually told when Derrick produced a glorius pass through the centre for Russ and Khai to run on to.Both of them had beaten the offside trap,but Khai got to it first and finished it as cool as ice.<br><br>The goal was a signal for further intense Reds pressure as they threatened to increase their lead with each attack.Damien made an immediate impact when he came on,and was instrumental in the build up play of<br>Reds FC.He was involved in most of their attacks,and controlled the midfield with his defensive nature.<br><br>Boca Juniors best chance came when Colin ran out late for a fifty-fifty<br>ball which allowed the forward to get to it first<br>and strike it over Colin.The ball looked certain to enter the goal but right-back Pat saved it from entering by diving to head it out for a corner.Pat was once again the hero when he headed a cross off the line to safety.<br><br>Boca Junior's nightmare continued when Derrick unleashed Russ with a brilliant through ball that Russ took in stride and deposited in the back of the net,raising his goal tally to nine and remaining the leading marksman in Reds FC.<br><br>Boca Juniors lost heart after the fourth goal and almost all their balls were intercepted in midfield and any loose balls that got through<br>were cleared to safety by the solid defence.Kelvin was in superb form,stopping the attacks from his side and pushing the balls forward to Ian,who never stopped running the whole game and his workrate was definitely one of the highest in the team,alongside Manager Rob who was very much the ballwinner for the team.<br><br>The score would have been much more humilating for Boca Juniors if Reds FC had not missed the countless chances they had.<br><br>Dead ball specialist Alvin Chia took<br>a direct free-kick that curled towards the top corner but was saved online by a defender.Damien had a shot that took a nasty bounce off the bumpy ground that almost embarassed the keeper.Russ failed to finish a ball that was two metres out,and sky rocketed it instead.A corner taken by Alvin Chia<br>was dummied by Russ and stopper Jem took a swing from inside the box  with his left leg which forced a rare reflex save from the Boca keeper.<br><br>Boca Juniors on the counter,managed to finally get the ball inside the Red's penalty box but the shot was well saved by Colin.<br><br>In the dying seconds of the game,Alvin Chia was at the end of a long pass from Charles.He produced a brilliant piece of individual skill to get pass a defender and then added insult to injury by shooting between the legs of the keeper to make the score 5-0 right at the ninety minute mark.<br><br>Boca Juniors had talented players but they were simply outplayed<br>due to their relatively small size and that led to their downfall.<br><br>This victory was sweet for Reds FC not only because of the unbelievable<br>scoreline but also because this marks the first win for the Reds in the year 2003<br><br>If they are able to maintain their fine form,Reds<br>FC would be a formidable team to beat.<br><br>Till next week,this is Jem Ong signing off,goodbye.<img

            <div class='col-md body'>Match Report for 16 February 2003<br><br>Once again two teams gathered at Spottiswoode Park for a nice game of waterpolo...ermm..sorry, i meant soccer.<br><br>Reds FC and Tampines Dovers went head to head in what seemingly was the Red's toughest match so far.<br><br>Reds FC were without striker Robin and midfielder Damien.Tampines Dovers<br>were star-studded with five former Tampines players included in their side.<br><br>Match was delayed due to torrential<br>rain which caused the pitch to be waterlogged.The game commenced after<br>Mr Magoo the Ref gave the green light to play.<br><br>The first ten minutes of the game saw both teams trying their best to adapt to the extremely wet ground.It was simply too difficult to string passes together and players from both teams looked somewhat like penguins,stumbling over puddles of water planted all over the field.If one were to watch the match with expectations of beautiful flowing football,they would most likely go home disappointed.<br><br>It was unfortunate for Reds FC because their worthy opponents soon<br>became accustomed to the watery surface.Tampines Dovers started playing exquisite one touch football<br>which enabled them to penetrate through the midfield and defence.The team seemed oblivious to the ground conditions and managed to float their passes over the puddles of water.<br><br>Dovers bombarded the Reds with waves of attacks down their left side,initiated by a midfielder in green shorts.He gave Pat a run for his money by constantly taking him on and getting past him on numerous occasions.His passes were aimed mainly at Hobbit their nifty striker,but it was Andre the Giant who got his name on the scoresheet.<br><br>Although not the fastest player in his team,he was blessed with size and he made no mistake in using his<br>gift.After recieving a pass from midfield,he took on the defence by himself.With sheer power,he evaded a<br>sliding tackle from stopper Jem and<br>drove a low but venomous shot to the<br>far post.Colin performed a dive but<br>the ball went under him much to the dismay of the whole team.<br><br>Reds FC were down but not out,right from the restart,they tried their utmost to get the equaliser but to no avail really.Nothing seemed to go right for them on this faithful day as their mobility was hindered by the water.They just couldn't find the touches they needed to get past their opponents.<br><br>Tampines Dovers capitalised on the Red's handicap by increasing their lead moments later.It was Jem once again who was the culprit when he failed to cut out a through pass which slipped under his legs.It reached Andre who always looked dangerous in front of goal.He did well to expertly chip a shot over Colin into the top corner of goal,despite having Pat hot on his heels.<br><br>Despite being two goals down,Reds FC<br>continued their pursuit for that much needed goal.They had a few shots at goal from Khai, who had a quiet game and Alvin Chua who was more involved in this match.Their best chance came when Alvin Ang was   put through on goal.His shot beat the keeper but not the puddle of water in front of goal,which goes to show that Lady Luck just wasn't on their side.<br><br>Tampines kept up their strong built-up play and posed a threat everytime the ball got to Hobbit and<br>Andre,but the defence made an effort<br>to keep the score at 2-0 till the break.<br><br>It was the same old situation for the Reds in the second half.Even with the inclusion of Jimmy,Russ and Boon,they failed to turn the match around.The boys in red showed their frustration by cluttering their opponents at every chance they had.They were lucky not to recieve any yellow cards for all the harsh tackles.<br><br>Tampines increased their lead after Jem failed to clear a loose ball,and<br>gave it away to a Dover player who ran all the way to tap it pass the helpless goalkeeper to put them three up.To date,this is arguably the worst performance the red haired<br>stopper has shown.<br><br>The goal sunk the Reds side and from then on it was just defending all the way to keep the score at a respectable margin.Tampines had many chances to score more goals but were<br>prevented from doing so by the defence who never stopped working,with Charles probably putting up the best performance.<br><br>Credit must be given to the Reds keeper who made several nice saves and on one instance,picking up a slight injury after a double legged lunging tackle on Andre.Ian,Jem and Alfred all picked up injuries in their line of duty.<br><br>The final blow to the delicate heart of the Reds came from a corner.The ball fell in front of goal and Dovers finished it easily after Alfred had failed to clear it to safety.<br><br>It must be pointed out that the Reds strikeforce who managed to beat the offside trap in previous matches were not too lucky this time round as almost every through ball was ruled offside.They never really troubled the defence who were calm and experienced.<br><br>The score remained 4-0 right to the final whistle.<br><br>It is evident that they lost to a much more experienced and skillful side.The defeat was a humbling one for the Reds but had the weather been more favorable,the outcome of the match might have started and finshed to a different tune.<br><br>If it is any consolation at all,every team has their share of off days and today was without a shadow of a doubt,one of the worst days for Reds FC.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Match Report for 2nd March 2003<br><br>The much eagerly anticipated match between Reds FC and Liverpool took place at Spottiswoode Park,the humble abode of the Reds.<br><br>These two are by no means strangers,because if you were to consult the history books,you will realise that they have met before.The<br>Reds were visitors to the Graveyard and managed to edge Liverpool by 2-1.That match holds a special place in every Red's heart because it was their very first win,which sparked off many more from then onwards.             A feeling of nostalgia sweeps through my body even as i talk about that faithful day,because i was present on that day and its true....<br><br>The stage was set for the rematch between this old rivals.The weather reflected the mood of the players,bright and sunny.Field condition was good with just a small<br>percentage of hard bumpy ground around the centre and goalmouth areas.<br><br>Reds FC had a full squad for Rob to choose from,with only Lawrence,Alfred and Damien not available.<br><br>Liverpool retained the same squad with several new Navy signings to boost the strength in their midfield and strike department.Red Boy was a tall and tough player,his size surely an asset to the team,and Yellow Boy was known for his speed and likes to dart past defenders.They had set their sights on revenge.<br>Reds FC opted to experiment with a new formation;the 4-3-3.Manager Rob<br>was pleased with the old 4-4-2 formation but felt that new ideas and strategies<br>were always refreshing for the team.<br><br>The match kicked off with Reds FC trying to adapt to their new system of play.Most people would tell you that the 4-3-3 formation is by no means a simple one to play by.The Reds did indeed face problems and left gaps in midfield,although there was no real harm done.<br><br>The opening goal came from Reds FC.Rob managed to head down a bouncing ball to free Khai on the left.With pinpoint accuracy,the striker chose his spot at the far post and drove it low past the keeper.<br><br>Liverpool was not to be ousted by the Reds and replied with Red Boy unleashing a deadly shot at the other end which hit the upright before it was hastily cleared by the defence.<br><br>Halfway into the first,Derrick picked up an ankle injury and Boon took his place.His presence added a new dimemsion to the Reds midfield.Boon performed remarkably well,helping to switch plays and trouble the Liverpool defence with his sharp and clever through balls.<br><br>Liverpool's chance to equalise came from a corner.The cross came into the box and due to some sloppy defending from the Reds,Red Boy,who was unmarked,tapped the ball<br>past the hapless keeper.Reds FC must improve on their set pieces,because its noticable that they conceed goals easily when it comes to corners and freekicks.<br><br>Reds FC who are better known for their fighting spirit came back strong with Boon displaying his good vision and supplying the strikers with his crafty passes.Khai had a great first half,and always looked dangerous going down the left flank,and managed to swing in a few crosses.Bara on the right was involved in some nice passing play,together with Rob and Alvin.<br><br>The Reds restored their lead when Colin's long dropkick found Robin and Russ.The Liverpool keeper ran out to challenge but Robin got a head to it and Russ made sure the ball found it's final resting place at the back of the net.<br><br>The new formation at times saw the Reds leaving gaps in midfield but Livepool were not much of a threat when they came face to face with the rocksteady Reds defence.Reds FC could have increased their lead before the interval.Manager Rob took a direct free-kick which just went narrowly wide and on another instance,his long shot beat the keeper but not the woodwork.<br><br>In the second half,Reds FC switched back to their old 4-4-2 style of play.It was evident from the team's second half performance that they were more suited to this formation.From the restart,the Reds gave Liverpool another scare,with Alvin<br>Ang shooting narrowly wide.<br><br>The Reds seemed comfortable in the second half and won most of the midfield battles.Jimmy who worked hard and won many a challenge,opened his account with a thunderous long shot from far out which had wicked curl to it.The ball dipped in time to fall sweetly behind the keeper,to put Reds FC 3-1 up.<br><br>Central defender Jem came close to scoring for the Reds from a corner.Rob swung in his trademark cross,Jem rose above the defenders and headed it goalwards but it was saved on line by a defender.<br><br>Russ was guilty of the worst miss of the match when he steered the ball over the bar right in front of goal after Alvin Chia had crossed one into the box.The consistent striker had admitted after the match that he got a hand to it and so didn't feel right putting it in.That is sportsmanship for all to learn and follow suit.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Colin had his fair share of opportunities to display his agility;<br>acrobatically saving several shots at goal from Liverpool.<br><br>Kelvin,the Reds left-back,once again<br>impressed,cutting out many passes on his side and freeing Ian on the left.Kelvin has matured into a versatile defender who can switch from left to right when the need arises.<br>Khai came into the match for the second time late into the second half and was somewhat rejuvenated and scored his second and Reds FC's fourth goal.<br><br>The play started from defence.Jem intercepted a loose ball and did a one-touch with Rob.There was so much space and time for him to look up and spot Khai making the run forward.He delicately chipped the ball over the defence,with Khai narrowly beating the offside trap to<br>go one on one with the keeper and calmly slotting the ball home.<br><br>Five minutes before the final whistle,Colin fell akwardly and twisted his knee,but hung on right to the end.He might miss the next match depending on his recovery period which is worrying for the Reds,as they have a huge game coming up next.<br><br>Final score:4-1 to the Reds,and yet another emphatic victory which they so duly deserved.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Match Report for 9th March 2003<br><br>Reds FC entered this match as the underdogs no doubt about it,and were up against Diadora FC,and also the blazing heat which panfried the players to a crisp.<br><br>Reds FC welcomed Lawrence back into the side from injury and Damien,their<br>central midfielder was available.First choice keeper Colin was unable to pass a late fitness test and Robin took over in goal.<br><br>Diadora FC was very disciplined,skillful,composed, always stressing on on the importance of one-touch football and close passing.They proved to be a formidable force and too much for the lacklustre Reds to handle,evidently in the first half.<br><br>Diadora FC were on the attack from the start and laid siege to the Reds<br>goal.They had several playmakers who<br>spearheaded the attacks and exuding quality in their touches and passing.<br><br>Diadora FC displayed fluid movement<br>using neat one touches.Their wingers were speedy and managed to get pass the boys in red without much effort in midfield.<br><br>The opening goal came from a corner for Diadora FC.The ball was crossed to the near post.A striker was swift<br>in rising to the cross and heading it to the top corner,but it did rebound off Damien in the process.<br><br>Diadora FC were not about to sit back and just<br>defend their lead,instead they raised the tempo and came on even stronger hungry for a second goal.<br><br>Reds FC for some reason were giving their opponents too much breathing space,which facilitated Diadora's style of play.It wasn't much later before Diadora FC were two up.Diadora's midfielder released a through ball which sent his winger running at the defence down the inside left channel.Right-back Pat was hot on his heels but failed to dispossess him.The winger evaded a tackle fron Jem in the penalty box before passing it back for an unmarked striker to prod it into the net.<br><br>Diadora shaded the first half in terms of possession,confidently stroking the ball to each other from defence to midfield and then spraying to the flanks.On the other hand,the Red's strikers were starved<br>of service and the midfielders found<br>themselves with little support and options whenever they got the ball,which resulted in a tepid performance from them.<br><br>Diadora FC destroyed any hope left for the Reds when they netted the third just before half time.Their striker weaved his magic to get past Jem,Charles and Pat with his robustness and drove the ball past Robin.It was very sluggish defending<br>by the Reds who showed no conviction in their tackles.<br><br>Ah Boon was brandished the yellow card in the first half which he really would beg to differ.Early in the first half,Mr Magoo had flashed his yellow card at a Diadora FC player already.<br><br>Reds FC went into the break with Manager Rob switching the formation to 4-5-1 to add more firepower in the struggling midfield department.Alvin Ang saw the demoralised players and spoke some words of encouragement.They were told to enjoy the game and take it as a learning experience from Damien.<br><br>The second half commenced in much the same fashion with Diadora FC overhauling their opponents.The Reds<br>defence were kept on their toes and had to put in everything they had to<br>withstand the overwhelming presssure<br>from Diadora FC.<br><br>Reds keeper,Robin has to be given credit for saving the Reds from further humilation,and was forced to<br>make several reflex saves on the line on several occassions.On one instance,Robin parried a rasping shot from the left side and the ball went over the bar for a corner.<br><br>Diadora FC had a shot that was denied by the post and also a goal was disallowed after Robin had been impeded in the box.<br><br>The icing on the cake came for Diadora FC when Ang inexplicably released a suicide pass to an oncoming striker who left the defence for dead,and went on to finish it with the sure touch of a seasoned striker.<br><br>Diadora FC's keeper had one of very few chances to show his true capabilities from a Reds corner.Rob's cross found Jem who headed it goalbound towards the top left corner but the keeper amazingly kept it out.<br><br>The corner that followed resulted in a consolation goal for Reds FC.Alvin<br>Chia,who was commended for his performance by the manager,took the cross which Ang headed downwards to Jem who laid it back for Jimmy to blast it home.<br><br>The goal brought back just a little sense of belief in themselves and the team but it was a little too late to catch up and were left to rue their poor display in the first half.Final score remained at 4-1.<br><br>The Reds are in the stage of experimenting with new formations and switching players into different roles,and until they get it right,they should expect more disappointments to come.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Match Report for 15th March 2003<br><br>Reds FC travelled away to St.Wilfred for a match against GreySkull Utd.<br><br>The artificial grass surface is flat<br>and well-maintained.Other than the rough surface which makes sliding difficult and excruciating for that matter,the pitch is simply a joy to play on.The field is much bigger compared to Reds FC's homeground and it was interesting to see how the Reds would fare on a larger pitch.Drainage is superb so you won't ever have to play on a waterlogged pitch at St.Wilfred.<br><br>Both teams did not have to bother about the drainage though,because the sky was clear and the sun showed little signs of compassion to the players.<br><br>Reds FC were still deprived of the services of keeper Colin,who injured<br>himself two weeks ago.Robin took his place once again.Damien,Lawrence and Pat were all unavailable as well.<br><br>The Reds started the first half with a 4-3-3 formation.There had been numerous debates prior to this match on which formation best suits the team,and their questions were answered more or less after the match.<br><br>It was a tense and nervy affair for the Reds in the first half as they struggled to get their act together, wand were duly punished.<br><br>The midfielders showed no signs of creativity,composure or discipline whatsoever and lost the ball easily the moment they got it.The Reds were facing difficulty stringing passes together and players were not sticking to their positions.<br><br>GreySkull Utd played simple but effective football and controlled the midfield very well.They won most of the fifty-fifty balls and attacked through the centre and mostly on the right flank.<br><br>GreySkull Utd were indubitably the better side in the first half and went ahead early in the match.They were intent on attacking with direct<br>and clever play and their speedy striker,Michael Ho Wen was sent flying through on goal after he was put onside by stopper Jem.His clinical finishing gave Robin no chance.<br><br>Reds FC's defence was very disorganised and were getting themselves into hot soup everytime they put a player onside.Jem performed below expectations,his positioning was way off and seemed extremely sluggish and in his own world.<br><br>GreySkull Utd increased their lead moments later after some brilliant build-up.Their winger broke down the right flank,and crossed a ball low into the penalty box.Jem failed to cut out the pass and the striker finished it effortlessly,even though Kelvin was closing down on him<br><br>It certainly wasn't the kind of dream start the Reds had hoped for.The team was running out of steam and ideas as well,and gave the opposition's defence little pressure<br>and their goalkeeper wasn't even tested.<br><br>GreySkull Utd stamped their authority and superiority in the first half by adding another goal before the break.It was 3-0 at half-time much to the disbelief of the dispirited players.<br><br>The Reds made some much needed tactical changes and reverted back to their old 4-4-2 formation.Boon was introduced to play in the centre of midfield.<br><br>Reds FC's nightmare was prolonged when their defence were once again beaten and the Reds conceeded a fourth goal after some decent play from the opponents.<br><br>Reds FC seemed headed for the biggest trashing of their lives but then,the match took a sudden turn of events.<br><br>Out of the blue,Reds FC pulled one back from a Rob free-kick.It was a rather freaky goal because the shot had hit the crossbar and rebounded off the back of the keepers head into the goal.He acknowledged the stupidity of the goal by smiling after that.<br><br>The Reds revival started from that moment on.Lo and behold,the Reds were injected with a new dose of life which resulted in a resurgence in their performance.<br><br>The fluidity of their attack improved and the Reds were challenging much harder for the ball.The inclusion of Boon in the centre provided the main creative impertus for the Reds in tandem with Jimmy whose workrate was impeccable.<br><br>GreySkull Utd's play became a little ragged in the second half,because they didn't have the priviledge of space and time which was showered upon them in the first half.<br><br>Khai who had been enjoying a purple patch of form as a striker,was unhappy when the manager had pulled him back to midfield,but now that he<br>was back to his favourite position,he made it count by scoring the second goal for Reds FC.Russell headed a high ball down to him who then curled the shot into the right corner to make the score 4-2.<br><br>Reds FC deserved the goal for their enterprising response but GreySkull Utd continued to threaten when they broke free.Robin made several important saves when one-on-one with the striker to keep the score at a respectable margin.<br><br>Reds FC recieved a corner in the closing moments of the match.Jimmy swung a cross in,the ball bounced over several players before it was cleared softly and landed nicely for Khai to unleash a screamer of a half-volley to the corner which left the keeper frozen in his tracks.<br><br>Just as the ball had gone in,so was the final whistle blown by the ref.There was some confusion as to whether the goal stood and later on,the ref confirmed the final score....GreySkull Utd 4 Reds FC 3<br><br>The two goals scored by Khai raised not only the morale of the team but also his goal tally to seven...just three behind top scorer Russ for the<br>Reds with ten goals to date.<br><br>It was a great comeback which left the players feeling pleased despite the defeat,certain players had to reflect on their mistakes in the first half but it was all good.The team manager Rob and the team had come to a conclusion that the 4-3-3 formation can be used only at their homeground where the area was smaller but in bigger size fields like this one,a 4-4-2 formation was safer and more functional.<br><br>After two defeats in a row,the Reds side look towards their next match which will be back at Spottiswoode Park and hope to get back to winning ways.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Match report for 23th March 2003<br><br>The much awaited day finally came for<br>these two teams to challenge once again.Reds FC versus SIM FC at Spottiswoode Park always promises lots of thrills and spills.<br><br>A little history lesson for those who<br>have already forgotten.These two met long before Reds FC was truly established as a team.Reds FC were without seven of their current SIM players in that match,all of whom they have cleverly recruited since then,with veteran member Khai being the only player from SIM in the Reds<br>team that day,the match ended 1-1.<br><br>The line-up for the rematch was a totally different story,with Colin,Robin,Ian,Jem,Kelvin,Boon and Alvin Chia all donning the Red's jersey.<br><br>It was unbelievable but the teams were greeted rudely with a field without goalposts,but that wasn't about to hinder them from playing,and so the match carried on with makeshift posts anyway and Mr Magoo the Ref was sent home as well.The teams had a representative to be the ref one half each.If it was any consolation at all,the weather was fine.<br><br>Lets not get carried away with all the rubbish and grandmother stories and get down to the nitty gritty.<br><br>Reds FC were without Derrick,Lawrence,Alfred and Chester;who was present in the stands alongside Alvin's wife Jannie,both of whom were rendering their undying support.<br><br>The match went underway with both teams just stroking the ball around,without much urgency in their play,as both teams were just testing the standard and style of play of each other.I would say the possession was shared equally between the two and it was certainly not a one sided affair.<br><br>SIM FC's midfield engine,Eugene,was<br>undoubtedly their most dangerous player.His stamina was phenomenonal,allowing him to ghost around the field with ease.His touches and passing were simple but effective.His passes often found strikers Dawei and William,but they didn't pose any serious threat to the resilient and disciplined Reds defence.<br><br>There were shots attempted at goal on both sides,but either lacked conviction or ballooned over the imaginary crossbar.<br><br>The Reds attack was led by midfielders Damien and Boon.The former troubled the defence with his<br>exqusite chips over the defence to strikers Khai and Alvin Chia.The latter showed great skill and vision,and it was his through pass that resulted in the inevitable opening goal for Reds FC.It reached striker Khai who exploited the hesistancy of the defence,and managed to stay onside,before firing it pass the keeper.<br><br>The goal boosted the morale of the team and they started playing with more confidence and gusto.<br><br>SIM FC had a tough time carving out any clear-cut chances as the Reds rearguard stood firm.Their build-up was good though,with Eugene,Jim and William exchanging passes in midfield and running at the defence as well,but was short of that defence splitting through balls and finishing touches.<br><br>Reds FC stuck to their game plan and moments later,they found themselves 2-0 up.Khai managed to keep a high ball in play,turned pass a defender and delivered a cross which Alvin Chia placed nicely where he wanted it,in the goal that is!!!<br><br>The half-time score remained at 2-0.Manager Rob passed on the whistle to the opponents.He was impartial and decisive in doing his part as a ref.<br><br>SIM FC went in search for a goal from the restart.Eric,Hongwei and Jason all joined the attck for them.<br>They managed to pull one back early in the second half.Eugene spotted Dawei cutting into the box and put him through on goal with a brilliant<br>pass.Dawei did well to shrug off pressure from Charles before placing it to the left of Colin.<br><br>SIM FC looked the more convincing side in the second half.They kept the Reds penned in their own half most of the time.They were adamant in getting the equaliser,and their wingers had great runs down the flanks and served up equally good crosses.<br>The reds gave away far too many fouls but some of the decisions made<br>by the ref were rather dubious and far from convincing,causing tempers to flare.<br>SIM FC exploited the deep spaces left by the Reds and often caught them stranded on the left side.They had a few attempts at goal but none gave Colin any problems.<br>Chances came and went at both ends as the game settled into a pattern of greater SIM possession but composed defending by the Reds.<br>The Reds survived a flurry of action at their end and against the run of play,scored their third goal courtesy of Russell.Robin's pass freed Russ on the left,putting him one on one with the keeper,which he<br>made no mistake in finishing.<br><br>The enormity of the task proved too much for the SIM boys and the final whistle was blown just seconds after the goal.<br><br>It was a fulfilling win for the Reds and the 3-1 victory also marked the final game that the Reds will ever play at Spottiswoode Park.The ground will be excavated to make way for a new school,leaving the Reds in search for a new beginning and a ground in which they can call their own.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Match Report for 30th March 2003<br><br>The rematch between Tampines Dovers and Reds FC was played at the Singapore Chinese Recreational Club.<br><br>It had rained the night before and thus the field was a little soft and muddy but you could see that the field was being maintained.<br><br>Reds FC had only fourteen players for this match.Damien,Alvin Chia,Kelvin,Lawrence,Alfred were all unavailable.<br><br>Tampines stunned the Reds in the opening seconds of the game.The left-winger darted down their offensive half of the field,beating the Red's right-back Pat with his lightning pace.When he reached the outside of the penalty area,he drove<br>the ball pass Colin,into the corner of the net.<br><br>Its moments like these when you expect more goals in quick succession,but that wasn't going to be the case in the first half.<br><br>Reds FC put the foot on the gas and raised the tempo of the game,going in search for a reply.They had many chances to equalise but the opportunities were sadly frittered away.<br><br>Reds FC had a direct free kick outside the box when a defender was adjudged to have fouled Khai.It was a nasty challenge which left him with swollen lips and gums but could<br>carry on nonetheless.Alvin Ang's free-kick was blasted over the bar.<br><br>Another great chance came when the keeper had unknowingly handled a back-pass and the Reds recieved an indirect free-kick inside the penalty area.Jimmy touched the ball slightly before Derrick shot the ball wide of the post.<br><br>At the other end,Tampines had two open chances falling to the same striker but he scuffed the first and<br>ballooned the other.Both opportunities were gifted to the striker after Jem was a step slower in clearing the ball to safety.<br><br>Other than those two clear chances,Tampines never looked like scoring the second goal,with the Reds defence winning most of the arial challenges and played the strikers off-side several times.Left-back Ian had a great<br>game and refrained from straying too far from his position.<br><br>There were even more chances for the<br>Reds throughout the first half.Russ served up a good cross from the left which fell to Khai but he failed to keep his shot low.On another occassion,Khai had done well to beat the keeper,but due to the acute angle,decided against a shot and crossed it instead but there was nobody at the end of it.<br><br>Reds FC lined-up for yet another direct-freekick outside the box but it was Russell's turn to put it over the bar.<br><br>The Reds failed to get a goal in the first half but did well to keep the score at 1-0.<br><br>In the second half,Tampines made a few tactical changes and swaps in their line-up.If i am not wrong,they<br>switched their keeper and pushed a taller,more skillful and hairy striker upfront.<br><br>Their gameplan and attacking play was more effective in the second half as they managed to create more chances.They also dictated the tempo of the match throughout.<br><br>Tampines Dover's second goal came early in the second half.A cross came in from the left looking for their tall striker.Ian tried to cut out the pass but inadvertantly put the ball into his own net.He wasn't to blame if you ask me because it happens to the best of us.<br><br>The Reds seemed to have lost their momentum which they possess in the first half and let their opponents take the game to them.<br><br>Andre the Giant scored Dover's third<br>after great work in midfield.He sent the ball through the legs of Rob and<br>went on the shoot the ball to the top corner.Stopper Jem had tried to cover the angle but to no avail.<br><br>After Charles had to be subtituted due to an injury,the Reds became even more wobbly in defence,and Manager Rob had to fall back into the stopper role which he is less comfortable in.<br><br>Tampines Dovers played delightful football and pressured the Reds defence as they push forward<br>en masse.Several individuals displayed great control and ballskills,and managed to get past their adversery quite easily.<br><br>The fourth goal was due to a mis-communication between Jem and keeper Colin.A pass was released through the centre,with Jem and the striker chasing it.He should have cleared the ball to safety but expected Colin to claim the ball which resulted in the striker creeping in between the them from behind and scoring from close range.<br><br>Tampines Dovers knew that they had taken the game and some players started sprouting some arrogant words and Khai had heard what they said and took umbrage in their words<br>but there was no conflict or confrontation.<br><br>The fifth goal was brilliantly crafted by Tampines and they made it look easy.A clever throughball was released into the box and a striker was on hand to finish it even with pressure from right-back Pat.<br><br>The Reds did have their fair share of chances but they just lacked the finishing touches.Khai missed a great chance when he found himself one on one with the keeper but he covered the angle well and kept the ball out.<br><br>It was Reds striker Robin who got the consolation goal for the Reds.He<br>headed in a corner from Alvin Ang at the stroke of full-time.Final score:Tampines 5 Reds FC 1<br><br>The issue on whether to participate in a competitive league was made moot after the match and the final descision was to put the idea on hold for the moment as the team felt<br>that the team hasn't matured to really participate at a competitive level,bearing in mind that they are only 5 months old.Reds FC has therefore decided to recruit more players to strengthen the team and will choose them from a pool of invited players in the upcoming matches.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Match Report for 6th April 2003<br><br>The venue for the match was pitch 2 of Marina South,and Reds FC take on England in what was one of the more enjoyable games for the Reds.The weather was sunny and the field was of exceptable standards.<br><br>Reds FC were without the services of defenders Kelvin,Alfred and Chester. Midfielders Lawrence and Alvin Chua were unavailable too,but the team welcomed new member Bernard to the team.<br><br>At the outset of the match,the Reds started on a shaky note,and were under pressure from the England side.England's Elmo and Bee were the main players initiating the attacks.England's best chance came when a cross found Jeran in front of goal but he failed to convert .<br><br>The Reds got their act together after the inclusion of Khai,Damien and newcomer Bernard.Boon and Bernard were given specific instructions to take out the dangermen in midfield,and the strategy left England with fewer attacking options.<br><br>Reds FC's chance for the opening goal came when Russ sent Khai through on goal but the striker missed by inches.The match was pretty well-balanced until the Reds finally found the net.Damien chipped a through ball to Russ who in turn lobbed the ball over the onrushing keeper.<br><br>The Reds defence performed much better in comparison to their last match.The disciplined defence worked well together and the stoppers were on hand to cut out most if not all of England's passes.<br><br>The second half saw the Reds in control of the match,and they continued to torment the England's defence with their direct play,and many a times they looked to be in trouble if not for the calls for offside from the young referee.<br><br>Reds FC were awarded a penalty after Alvin Chia was brought down in the box.England's captain Elmo was enraged by the decision because he felt that it was an apparently innocuous challenge.Khai stepped up to take it but his attempt was denied however.<br><br>The score remained at 1-0 but not for long as Rob increased the lead after some brilliant work in midfield.Jimmy sent a clever through ball down the centre which split the defence in half.Alvin Chia found himself with only the keeper to beat but the latter got to it first but his anaemic clearance fell to Rob, who made no mistake in sending the ball over the keeper who was way off his line.<br><br>The Reds could have sealed the match if not for several missed chances.Alvin Ang's free-kick missed the target by abit when it curled pass the post.Khai could have atoned for his missed penalty,but his high shot beat the keeper but was thwarted by the crossbar.<br><br>Reds keeper Colin had his chance to contribute when he tackled Adrian in the box but there there was no penalty because it was well timed.Moments later,Robin had to take his place as the first choice was seen abruptly sprinting off the field due to an upset stomach.<br><br>Red's stopper Jem picked up a yellow card after a lunging tackle on Elmo just outside the box.The tackle wasn't two-legged and it was obvious he was going for the ball and got it but new rules implemented recently states that dangerous play would not be tolerated and the safety of players is top priority.<br><br>England's best chance in the second half came when a striker headed the ball to the far post which looked totally out of Robin's reach but the keeper somehow elicited a fine save to keep it out.<br><br>The Reds cruised through the final moments of the match and the ref finally blew for full-time to give the Reds a 2-0 victory.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Match report for 13th April 2003<br><br>Reds FC and White Sox FC locked horns at Braddell-Westlake Secondary on a very muddy field which left little options for grounders.<br><br>Reds FC were without Kelvin,Alfred,Boon and Chester.Reds FC went ahead with their recruitment plan by bringing Bernard into the team in the last match and another probable new member to join would be defender Colin who made his debut in this match.<br><br>At the outset,both teams were struggling to get the flow going,probably due to the terrible surface which did not facilitate passing at all.<br><br>It was White Sox FC that struck first and in the early moments too. From midfield,a long ball was pumped directly thru the centre into the six yard box.Reds stopper Jem could not reach it and it landed to a striker who managed to evade Charles and shot at goal.It wasn't the meanest of shots but Colin let it slip pass him after he got a hand to it.<br><br>The early goal sent shockwaves thru the Reds players and they progressed from there.The first half saw the Reds doing something which is seldom seen in their play which is making use of the wingers.Derrick and Alvin Chua were fully utilised to give the Reds more options in attack down the flanks.Damien and Bernard were the providers in midfield.<br><br>The equaliser soon came when Bernard fed the ball to striker Russ upfront who in turned crossed it to Khai.The on-form striker found some space which led him face to face with the keeper.He applied the finish,prodding the ball pass the helpless keeper.<br><br>The highlight of the first half had to be the reflex saves from Reds keeper Colin to keep the score level at 1-1.His agility and quick reflexes showed the reason he was selected as a combined schools keeper at one point.<br><br>The referee awarded White Sox FC a penalty after Ian was adjudged to have handled the ball but there was some air of controversy in that decision if you ask me!!!!!!<br><br>Tattoo Boy stepped up to take it.He placed his shot at the right hand corner but Colin read it well and elicited a fine save to keep it out for a corner.Colin was once again at the top of his game when he kept out a header from a tall opposing defender who was surprised at the amount of space and time given to him.<br><br>Before the end of the first half,both teams had chances to score but could not convert them.White Sox's striker who already scored a goal sidestepped Colin and came face to face with an open goal but left-back Ian gave him no chance to shoot with a well-timed tackle.At the other end.it was almost the same scenerio for Reds striker Russ who got pass the keeper but found no angle to finish the move.<br><br>In the second half,many chances fell for both sides but just lacked the finishing touches.Reds diminutive midfielder Bernard dazzled the crowd and baffled the opponents with his graceful touches and brilliant passes.Striker Robin has shown vast improvement in his game with great off the ball running and committed efforts to win the ball.Jimmy,Derrick,Ang and Khai all had attempts at goal but did not trouble the keeper.Alvin Chua was surprised to find the ball falling nicely for him in the penalty box on one occassion after a weak shot from Jem but he failed to make anything out of it as well.<br><br>Reds left back Ian who displayed prodiguous stamina with his relentless hassling of the strikers and non-stop running was unfortunate to have recieved a yellow card after his second handball.The referee made some very dubious decisions in the match,and some were really uncalled for,that much i can tell you.<br><br>White Sox's tattoo boy always looked dangerous when he ran with the ball but was starved of support in the second half which left him fuming with everyone...his teamates,the referee,with God and himself!!!!!The goalscorer had only the keeper to beat on numerous occassions but his efforts were not up to mark.<br><br>Injuries for the Reds include keeper Colin getting a knock on the back of his skull and Damien who had to cut short his part in the game with "blood" in the eye.Newcomer Colin showed great composure and experience in defence and had a great performance alongside Jem in the heart of defence after Charles had to leave after the first half.<br><br>Both sides tried to snatch that second goal which would definitely decide the game but the chances just eluded them.The Reds continued to pump down the centre but the ball was just too far for the strikers to chase and the Whites failed to capitalise on their direct free-kicks and chances and right to the final whistle,the score remained levelled at 1-1.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Match report for 18th April 2003<br><br>Reds FC took on Sunkist Rovers at Marina South Pitch 2 in an evening match instead of the usual Sunday morning schedule that the Reds normally follow.<br><br>Reds FC were without several players such as Kelvin,Damien,Alvin Chua and Robin.The match started after a torrential downpour which didn't last for long.The condition of the pitch in Marina is famous for being muddy and the rain didn't hlep one bit.The rain took its toll on the pitch with the ball often being bogged down into the mud.<br><br>Sunkist Rovers began the match brightly and were the more attacking minded side.They gave everything they had in the first fifteen minutes of the match and it paid dividends as they took an early lead which is not uncommon when playing against a side that is always a step slower in warming up.<br><br>The Rovers goal came from a corner,which was aimed at the far post.One of the strikers was left unmarked to head it down towards goal.The ball was out of reach for keeper Colin and defender Colin failed to clear the ball off the line as well.<br><br>Sunkist Rovers continued to exploit the deep spaces left by the Reds on the left and directed their attack on their right flank.The Reds soon took note of this and filled up the empty spaces giving the Rovers less options.<br><br>Reds FC always threatened to score on the counter with Khairul having many chances to run through on goal.The Rovers played the offside trap well and very high up too,which caught the Reds strikers napping on many instances.But when the Reds did manage to beat the offside trap,the chances were not taken well.Ang,Russell,Alvin Chia and Khai all had opportunities to equalise but somehow or other spurned their chances.<br><br>Rovers had a chance to go two up when a striker saw Colin way off his line and went for the cheeky chip but Colin did magnificently to punch the ball over the bar for a corner.<br><br>Rovers were made up of older players and their high workrate in the early moments of the match was counter-productive as they sort of burned themselves out.<br><br>The Reds finally even out the score after much pressure from the strikers.Rob's pass sent Russ through on goal.His shot was well saved but Khai slid in to connect with the rebound to put the Reds levelled at 1-1.<br><br>The Reds didn't allow Rovers to settle back to their early rhythm,with the defence apart from the first goal,looking well organised and solid.The midfield played some decent passes to each other and soon another goal was crafted out.<br><br>The Reds took the lead before the end of the first half through striker Russ.Khai's pass had played him onside and through on goal.Russ cleverly turn pass a defender before slotting it into the back of the net.<br><br>In the second half,the Reds were in control of most of the match as the Rovers ran out of ideas and steam as well.The Rover's central midfielder was the playmaker and the team depended on him to lead the attack but the ball was often lost once it reached the Red's defensive area.<br><br>Pat recieved a yellow card after a lunging tackle on his opponent.Defender Colin had to limp off the pitch after twisting his knee slightly after an awkward fall after rising to head the ball.<br><br>The frustration of the orange side grew with every failed attack and their evening was summed up when a defender was sent off after a professional foul on Russ who was clear on goal.Alvin Chia stepped up to take the penalty and finished it cleanly with a low but well placed shot to the left.<br><br>Despite being at a disadvantage,Sunkist Rovers fought back bravely like Scottish warriors and had several chances to pull one back late into the match.Charles was an inch away from scoring an own goal when his back pass beat the keeper but was kept out by the post.<br><br>Rovers also missed from close range when a shot was kept out by keeper Colin and the ball just rolled past the line.But it was the Reds who had the last chance of the match when they had a goal disallowed after stopper Jem had connencted with a corner from Rob.The ref had pointed to the middle of the field after the goal but after being pressurised by the already furious players,had his decision swayed and awarded a free-kick for handball.<br><br>The final score remained at 3-1 right til the final whistle which ended a scintillating match between the two sides.</div>
