            <div class='col-md body'>The first match for the new year was REDS FC against Rugby Union Of China(RUOC) at the former's homeground,Spottiswoode Park.Both sides were looking pleased with the cool weather but were horrified as their boots sunk deep into patches of intimidating mud during the warm-up.<br><br>With the exception of Chester and Alfred,REDS FC had a full squad ready to play after a week's break.The only change to the starting line-up was Robin starting in goal.<br><br>The first quarter saw RUOC taking the game to the Reds.REDS FC were finding difficulty getting the ball out of their own half.The goalkicks from Robin were not being met or won by the midfielders who really lost out in terms of size.RUOC were huge and aggressive,and the majority of goalkicks and clearances from the Reds were being intercepted and turned into fast-paced attacks down the flanks,forcing the Reds left and<br>right backs to commit before swinging the crosses to the centre.<br><br>Pat and Kelvin were having a tough<br>time matching up to the wingers,but managed to keep their composure nonetheless.At times,RUOC looked extremely dangerous when their strikers broke through the centre and took shots after shots at goal,but there wasn't really any attempt that troubled the Reds keeper.<br><br>REDS FC trailed for first time in a long while when one of the crosses was failed to be cleared<br>by the usually steady centre-backs,and landed nicely for RUOC's Chow Yuen Fat who couldn't have missed from that distance.<br><br>Several subtitutions were made after the goal.Colin took his place behind goal and wonder boy Russell came in search for the equaliser.<br><br>RUOC did not stop piling up the pressure though,they continued winning balls in the air and outplayed the midfielders with their<br>size.Khai,Bara and Lawrence were not feeding the strikeforce enough and often lost out physically.Manager had to come out due to a weak ankle.<br><br>The defence on the other hand were<br>determined not to let in another goal and did well to frustrate RUOC's forwards with their no nonsense defending.<br><br>It wasn't a totally one sided game<br>because there was some action at the<br>other end too as Alvin Ang had a scoring chance but shot it wide.Striker Alvin had a few chances as well but lost out physically,and then the much needed equaliser came<br>at the stroke of half-time when Jimmy played quicksilver Russ through,who side-stepped the keeper before slotting the ball home.The boys went into the dressing room with one a piece.<br><br>In the second half,with the inclusion of Damien,REDS FC began brightly but it was the opponents who took the lead again.The cross came in from the other side this time and due to some bad marking,RUOC's skipper managed to put them deservingly ahead once again.The Reds led their nerves get to them and RUOC subjected the Red's defence to a jittery second half.<br><br>Manager Robin sensed the disheartening lack of morale in the team and tried to get them fired up.<br>They were rewarded,when defender right-back Kelvin netted his first goal for the team after Alvin got tackled outside the box and Kel kept admirably cool and  floated a strange but effective looking shot over the keeper into  the goal to put REDS FC level again.<br><br>Maybe they let the celebrations get to their head and RUOC capitalised on that and<br>went ahead.Jem and Alvin Ang failed to execute a routine clearance and<br>lady luck was on their RUOC's side beacause it fell once again nicely for Chin Chung Cheng to shoot it past the flustered Colin.<br><br>RUOC put REDS FC's six-match unbeaten run in severe jeopardy when they  extended their lead five minutes later from a direct free kick.Big Moose's shot curled sweetly to the top corner.Colin had no chance and Ian failed to get a head to it.<br><br>The Reds of the past would have hung their heads and give up but the<br>Reds team that we saw were totally different and continued to push on with their heads held high.Their fighting spirit was truelly commendable.Ian began spearheading the attack with his rejuvenated spurts upfront.<br><br>They managed to pull one back with ten minutes remaining.Damien given too much space and time played Russ<br>through on goal.There were calls for off-side ironically from the only defender who was playing Russ onside.The score was 4-3 with very little time remaining.Manager R made some tactical changes,and the Reds gave all they had or wat little they had left to get the equaliser.<br><br>Russ on another occasion was not able to beat the keeper who threw his body at the oncoming ball.The final chance probably was when Alvin<br>Ang flicked the ball past goalmouth<br>but Derrick was abit slow to get to the ball.<br><br>RUOC rendered REDS FC their first defeat after so long,but i guess it was about time they lost,but the spirits of the players remained high<br>because they knew it was a match well fought and worthy of praise.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually i'd like to see our wingbacks get more involved in our attacks...since we dun have natural pacy wingers, might be useful to get people like ian and pat to do overlapping runs down the flanks...no point keeping our back 4 static at the back..need more options/variations in our attacks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>juz a suggestion, wat u guys think?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
