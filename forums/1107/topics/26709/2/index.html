            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Well, actually typed out a list of things yesterday about the match but guess what?!! Some problems with the computer and everything was gone before me!@# Shall try to recall everything now.<br>Yup, it's 6-0 but not to comfort anyone, it was a much better match....a worthy defeat if you asked me.  Could tell that the opponents were united, "gelled" with each other and fit of course.    We had a couple of good chances (at least 3 or 4) but the goals just didn't come.<br>My observations and views:<br>1.  Good to have Ian as the left wing back but not sure if he can commit to the team.  For the 1st time playing with us, I felt that he fitted nicely.  However, hope to see more crosses from him.<br>2.  Small Robin informed that he will be playing in the keeper position and not outfield  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">. Next game, Saw Roon and Small Robin will rotate to play one half each.<br>3.  Saw Roon played well.  If possible, encourage him as he is one of those who will play well if you have confidence and faith in him.<br>4.  Defensively, there will be some reshuffling.  Alfred and Chester will rotate to play one half each in the the central defence position.  For the 1st half of the next game, Jeremy will play in central defence. I will play right wing back and rotate with Marcus accordingly.  For second half, may move Jeremy up if situation permits.  We will then adjust accordingly.<br>5.  Russ and Damien make a good combination in the central midfield area.  Next game, Khairul will play the free role between the strikers and midfielders, supplying balls to strikers. Cross the ball in if possible, bringing in the ball too much is very tiring. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>6.  Many 1-2s and one touch soccer.  Excellent play!! Keep up the good work. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>7.  Strikers should try to take more shots at goal if possible. Must also move themselves to positions where the ball can be supplied to them more easily, off the ball running etc.<br>8.  Jeremy can play in the striking position, able to hold the ball well.<br><br>With that, we shall have a better game this coming week.<br><br>I am also in view to assign different tasks to our core members:<br><br>Alfred - In charge of employing referree (include collecting money and paying referree)<br><br>Khairul - In charge of sourcing for opponents (come up with a list of opponents and contact persons if possible). Can get help from Chester and Alfred if necessary. If you are able to, can start sourcing for opponents in the weeks ahead.  Early planning is good.<br><br>Alvin - Assist me to maintain the school facilties (inform opponents when they come) during our usage as well as keep watch for trespassers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Russ - Assist me in suggesting game strategies and assigning right players for positions.<br><br>Myself - Overall management.  Supplying bibs and balls. Already started to look out for permanent alternative field for next season in year 2003.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </strong></div>
