If not, can switch side with me, no problem.<br><br>If you guys are agreeable to 5-3-2.  There will be some changes.  As suggested by Khairul, Chester will play centre back with Jeremy and Charles.

            <div class='col-md body'>Although we somehow managed to achieve the same scoreline as the previous match, I think we actually played better this time.  Personal observations as follows:<br><br>a.  Shouldn't play the offside trap too far up front.  None of us really has the pace to recover.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>b.  Need to play more balls behind the opponents' defence.  We should get them back-peddling and make our strikers work more!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>c.  Should try on shin guards before purchase.  Enough said.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I'm personally beginning to understand everybody's style of play better.  Can see that we're also beginning to string more passes together and getting more possession of the ball.</div>
