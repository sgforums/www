But like I said earlier, definitely must find more left-sided players!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I also bought a eye guard for myself from Peninsula today <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> . It is not the one which the South Korean is wearing (guy from shop informed that it cannot be found in SIngapore).<br><br>The one I bought is sort of like a transparent slim goggle with thick elastic strap behind. Looks ok. Different from the one we saw at Queensway which is bigger. Suppose to be for racket games and all sports...shatterproof. This is the best I have seen so far. Bought it for $20/- only.<br><br>Looks like we have 5 reserves this Sun (including myself). I have to make it clear that I won't really be going in for high balls.  The thought of headers already kinda of make me paronoid.  I apolgise. Something which I have to get over slowly. I can only say that it was a extremely bad experience, something which I am sure will freak any of you out.  The other thing is that I will be playing in the striker position for a change so please bear with me. I can only say that I will do plenty of "off-the-ball" running and try my best to score. I won't be in the first eleven. Probably play mid of second half.<br><br>That's all folks. See ya on SUnday.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Robin.G:<br><strong>[b]I have arranged for the referree and got the nicer RED set of bibs.  I also bought a eye guard for myself from Peninsula today <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> . It is not the one which the South Korean is wearing (guy from shop informed that it cannot be found in SIngapore).<br><br>The one I bought is sort of like a transparent slim goggle with thick elastic strap behind. Looks ok. Different from the one we saw at Queensway which is bigger. Suppose to be for racket games and all sports...shatterproof. This is the best I have seen so far. Bought it for $20/- only.<br><br>Looks like we have 5 reserves this Sun (including myself). I have to make it clear that I won't really be going in for high balls.  The thought of headers already kinda of make me paronoid.  I apolgise. Something which I have to get over slowly. I can only say that it was a extremely bad experience, something which I am sure will freak any of you out.  The other thing is that I will be playing in the striker position for a change so please bear with me. I can only say that I will do plenty of "off-the-ball" running and try my best to score. I won't be in the first eleven. Probably play mid of second half.<br><br>That's all folks. See ya on SUnday. Cheers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </strong>[/b]</blockquote>Robin, taking your injury into consideration, I personally think it will be better for you to play in central midfield... That's where you can do a lot of running and need not really go for high balls... Just a suggestion...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Russ, your suggestion is noted but I dun think I am up to it.  My rational is that we lose the midfield, we lose the game totally.  Thus I have always stressed the importance on the midfield.  Every ball is more or less competed in the midfield area which includes high balls. I am just glad that I get to play this Sun.  Looking forward to it.  Just went to check on my boots and stuff this morning, making sure everything is ready this Sun. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </strong></div>
