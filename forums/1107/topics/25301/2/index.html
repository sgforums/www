            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Chester, you played well.  I am more glad to see that both you and Jay maintained your pace in the second half, hanging on and playing the whole game.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Remember that maintaining your pace is very important. No point running everywhere for the first 20 minutes and walking in the remaining 70 minutes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Like what I told the defenders during half time, don't waste your energy committing too early, follow your player, watch him make that mistake then move in. If not, unless you are 90% confident getting the ball, then go in. Once you follow a player, he is shadowed from performing and opportunities.<br><br>Honestly speaking, I was shagged after playing 15 minutes into the second half. Laid off for too long (about 2 to 3 months?).  My body is aching quite terribly now. After I started feeling tired, I dropped back more in the central position and did not move up unneccessarily. Must say that central mid in the 5-3-2 formation is quite xiong....quite lost too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> !! Nevertheless, the feeling was FANTASTIC being back in action!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> When I first reached the field with Alvin, the feeling of putting on the boots and playing the ball on the field was indescribable....... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </strong></div>

A couple of players, including myself, are playing out of our "childhood" positions and we certainly need all the guidance we can get. I personally will, and is trying hard to improve on my fitness and off-ball running. Hopefully, I can get into the Striker mode fast enough to avoid being the dead weight in the team. I would not mind playing in other positions if the manager so desires.<br><br>Most importantly, I, like so many of you had highlighted, have enjoyed playing for this team.</div>

As the games keep coming, we'll see improvements in our fitness, understanding, positioning, etc...<br><br>It might take some time, but I'm sure we'll get there and have fun along the way...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
