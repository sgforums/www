            <div class='col-md body'>After an inspiring performance by the Reds last week which ended with a<br>7-0 victory over their opponents,the morale and confidence back at the  Spottiwood camp was right up there.The Reds gathered for the match in high spirits,and i can safely say that they were all fired up for yet another expected trouncing of their opponents but this time it wasn't just a walk in the park......<br><br>White Musk F.C were made up of younger players,who were exuberant and fit.Reds F.C were without striker<br>Robin who managed to get two brilliant goals in the last match,and also Alfred in defence.However,the team was happy with the timely return of Ian,Kelvin,Damien,Alvin and Jimmy.<br><br>Field condition was horrendous,especially in the centre<br>but there was no rain,in fact it was<br>a rather hot day.<br><br>Match started with both sides very weary of each other,playing safely,neither team wanting to concede too early.The Reds had plenty of possession but didn't make the best use of it.However,their pressure gradually began to tell,and midway into the first half,Khairul displayed his impeccable vision when he released a well time pass for on form striker Russell to burst pass White Musk's last line of defence and effortlessly tap it pass the keeper to put the Reds into the lead.<br><br>It wasn't all one sided,as the Whites replied with waves of attacks<br>down the flanks,but Ian and Pat did<br>well to prevent the crosses from coming in and most balls thru the centre were cut out by dynamic duo Charles and JeM,who have really seem to gel as more matches are played.<br><br>Pat,the Reds on-form right-back, was taken out after he lost his lens and Kelvin took over.The flow of the game was constantly hindered by the muddy conditions which made passing and control difficult.The Reds came close to a second goal when Robin's lobbing shot was well saved by the defiant keeper.At the other end,the Whites best chance came when<br>they snatched the ball from a defender and was through on goal,only to shoot over the bar.The teams went into the break with the score remaining at 1-0.<br><br>Second half started on a different note,the opponents brought the game to the Reds,adamantly searching for that much needed equaliser,and at times the Reds looked unsure of their game plan,leaving gaps here and there in midfield,but managed to regroup later on only.White Musk F.C continued to attack down the left flank,spearheaded by their burly midfielder and pacy left winger,but Pat who found his lens,returned into the game to do an excellent job chasing<br>and marking the winger and not letting him do much damage.<br><br>Their lucky break came soon enough when the Reds defence were caught sleeping,which is uncommon these days,allowing Banjo Bob,the Whites striker,to run through and shoot at goal from inside the box,Colin got a hand to it but the goal nevertheless managed to roll in.<br><br>The Reds were dumbfounded while the opponents were pumped with adrenaline and really went all out to try seal the match with a second goal.They became somewhat arrogant and complacent,and some players became quite emotional.<br>With around ten minutes to go, both sides knew that one goal was all it needed to put all 3 points into the bag.<br><br>You could hear the fans chanting for Russ to be fielded again,and when he came on again,he made an immediate impact,by taking the ball from the right side all by himself,he had thought of passing at first but finished it by himself with another calmly placed shot into the back of the lobster's net.That sort of put the last nail into the coffin for White Musk F.C<br><br>The Reds were ecstatic,while the faces of the opponents just sunk,because they knew it was all over by then.Alvin Lancer Boy came close to increasing the lead with a shot that went wide.<br><br>The Reds defence made sure the team hung on to the lead,with Charles and gang making sure the whites didn't make anymore attempts at goal.<br><br>The ref blew for full time and the<br>boys in<br>Red once again walked triumpiantly towards the dressing room with a well deserved victory against a somewhat worthy opponent.<br><br></div>
