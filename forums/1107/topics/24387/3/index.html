            <div class='col-md body'>A businessman flew to Vegas for the weekend to gamble. He lost the shirt off his back, and had nothing left but a quarter and the second half of his round-trip ticket. If he could just get<br>to the airport he could get himself home.<br><br>So he went out to the front of the casino where there was a cab waiting. He got in and explained his situation to the cabbie. He promised to send the driver money from home, he offered him his credit card numbers, his drivers license number, his address, all to no avail.<br><br>The cabbie said, "If you don't have fifteen dollars, get the hell out of my cab!" So the businessman was forced to hitch-hike to the airport and was barely in time to catch his flight.<br><br>One year later the businessman, having worked long and hard to regain his financial success, returned to Vegas and this time he won big. Feeling pretty good about himself, he went out to<br>the front of the casino to get a cab ride back to the airport.<br><br>Well who should he see out there, at the end of a long line of cabs but his old buddy who had refused to give him a ride when he was down on his luck. The businessman thought for a moment about how he could make the guy pay for his lack of charity, and he hit on a plan.<br><br>The businessman got in the first cab in the line, "How much for a ride to the airport," he asked?<br><br>"Fifteen bucks," came the reply.<br><br>"And how much for you to give me oral sex on the way?"<br><br>"What? Get the hell out of my cab!"<br><br>The businessman got into the back of each cab in the long line and asked the same questions, with the same result. When he got to his old friend at the back of the line, he got in and asked "How much for a ride to the airport?"<br><br>The cabbie replied "fifteen bucks."<br><br>The businessman said "OK," and off they went.<br><br>Then, as they drove slowly past the long line of cabs the businessman gave a big smile and thumbs up sign to each driver.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The professor announced to his class, "Today we will experiment with a new form called the tandem story.  The process is simple: each person will pair off with the person sitting to his or her immediate right.  One of you will then write the first paragraph of a short story.  The partner will read the first paragraph and then add another paragraph to the story.  The first person will then add a third paragraph, and so on back and forth.  Remember to re-read what has been written each time in order to keep the story coherent.  There is to be absolutely NO talking and anything you wish to say must be written on the paper.  The story is over when both agree a conclusion has been reached."<br><br>The following was turned in by two English students, Rebecca and Gary.<br><br>First paragraph by Rebecca:<br>At first, Laurie couldn't decide which kind of tea she wanted.  The chamomile, which used to be her favourite for lazy evenings at home, now reminded her too much of Carl, who once said, in happier times, that he liked chamomile.  But she felt she must now, at all costs, keep her mind off Carl.  His possessiveness was suffocating, and if she thought about him too much her asthma started acting up again.  So chamomile was out of the question.<br><br>Second paragraph by Gary:<br>Meanwhile, Advance Sergeant Carl Harris, leader of the attack squadron now in orbit over Skylon 4, had more important things to think about than the neuroses of an air-headed asthmatic bimbo named Laurie with whom he had spent one sweaty night over a year ago.  "A.S. Harris to Geostation17," he said into his transgalactic communicator, "Polar orbit established.  No sign of resistance so far..."  But before he could sign off a bluish particle beam flashed out of nowhere and blasted a hole through his ship's cargo bay.  The jolt from the direct hit sent him flying out of his seat and across the cockpit.<br><br>Rebecca:<br>He bumped his head and died almost immediately but not before he felt one last pang of regret for psychically brutalizing the one woman who had ever had feelings for him.  Soon afterwards, Earth stopped its pointless hostilities towards the peaceful farmers of Skylon 4.  "Congress Passes Law Permanently Abolishing War and Space Travel," Laurie read in her newspaper one morning.  The news simultaneously excited her and bored her.  She stared out the window, dreaming of her youth, when the days had passed unhurriedly and carefree, with no newspapers to read, no television to distract her from her sense of innocent wonder at all the beautiful things around her. "Why must one lose one's innocence to become a woman?" she pondered wistfully...<br><br>Gary:<br>Little did she know, but she had less than 10 seconds to live.  Thousands of miles above the city, the Anu'udrian mothership launched the first of its lithium fusion missiles.  The dim-witted wimpy peaceniks who pushed the Unilateral Aerospace Disarmament Treaty through the Congress had left Earth a defenceless target for the hostile alien empires who were determined to destroy the human race.  Within two hours after the passage of the treaty the Anu'udrian ships were on course for Earth, carrying enough firepower to pulverize the entire planet.   With no one to stop them, they swiftly initiated their diabolical plan.  The lithium fusion missile entered the atmosphere unimpeded.  The President, in his top-secret mobile submarine headquarters on the ocean floor off the coast of Guam, felt the inconceivably massive explosion, which vaporized poor, stupid, Laurie and 85 million other Americans.  The President slammed his fist on the conference table. "We can't allow this!  I'm going to veto that treaty!  Let's blow 'em out of the sky!"<br><br>Rebecca:<br>This is absurd. I refuse to continue this mockery of literature.  My writing partner is a violent, chauvinistic semi-literate adolescent.<br><br>Gary:<br>Yeah?  Well, you're a self-centered tedious neurotic whose attempts at writing are the literary equivalent of Valium.  "Oh shall I have chamomile tea?  Or shall I have some other sort of F#$%@# TEA???  Oh no, I'm such an air headed bimbo who reads too many Danielle Steele novels."<br><br>Rebecca:<br>Asshole.<br><br>Gary:<br>Bitch.<br><br>Rebecca:<br>DICK!<br><br>Gary:<br>Slut.<br><br>Rebecca:<br>Get F%$%#$d.<br><br>Gary:<br>You wish; eat shit.<br><br>Rebecca:<br>F&amp;*% YOU - YOU NEANDERTHAL!!!<br><br>Gary:<br>Go drink some tea - whore.<br><br>TEACHER:<br>A+ - I really liked this one.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A guy works at a new job on Thursday and Friday. On Monday he calls in and says, "I can't come in today. I'm sick."<br><br>He worked the rest of the week, but the following Monday he calls in and says, "I can't come in today. I'm sick."<br><br>The boss asks the foreman about him, and the foreman says, "He's great. He does the work of two men. We need him."<br><br>So the boss calls the guy into his office, and says, "You seem to have a problem getting to work on Mondays. You're a good worker and I'd hate to fire you. What's the problem? Anything we can help you with? Drugs? Alcohol?"<br><br>The guy says, "No, I don't drink or do drugs. But my brother-in-law drinks every weekend, and then beats on my sister. So every Monday morning, I go over to make sure she's all right. She puts her head on my shoulder and cries, one thing leads to another, and the next thing you know, I'm screwing her."<br><br>The boss says, "You screw your sister?"<br><br>The guy says, "Hey, I told you I was sick."<br></div>
