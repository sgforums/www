The young man is worried that he might not do it right so his uncle comes up with a plan.<br><br>The young man will get a hooker, wine her and dine her, then take her back to his apartment for a night of pleasure.

When they get back to the apartment the hooker gets into bed while the young man goes to the bathroom to put on a condom. The hooker suddenly gets a cramp and must go to the bathroom now!

One morning, the first friend says, "You know, we're starting to get on each other's nerves. Why don't we split up today. I'll hike north and spend the day looking around, you hike south and spend the day. Then tonight, we'll have dinner and share our experiences over the campfire." The second friend agrees and hikes south. The first man hikes north.<br><br>That night over dinner, the first man tells his story.<br><br>"Today I hiked into a beautiful valley. I followed a stream up into a canyon and ate lunch. Then I swam in a crystal clear mountain lake. As I sat out and dried, I watched deer come and drink from the stream. The wildflowers were filled with butterflies and hawks floated all day overhead. How was your day?"<br><br>The second friend says, "I went south and ran across a set of railroad tracks. I followed them until I came across a beautiful young woman tied to the tracks. I cut the ropes off, gently lifted her off the tracks, and we had sex in every imaginable way all afternoon. Finally, when I was so tired I could barely move, I came back to camp."<br><br>"Wow!!" the first guy exclaimed, "Your day was MUCH better than mine. Did you get a blow job, too?"<br><br>"Nah," says the second friend over his meal, "I couldn't find her head."</div>

After many years even that stopped.<br><br>He was always preparing for the day when he would be saved.

She will start to take off her clothes and she will be wearing red satin panties, and I will rub them.<br><br>With this, he starts to get an erection; he slips his hand into his shorts, grabs his pecker and yells, "Ha, Ha, Ha - I LIED ABOUT THE SHIP."</div>

So she wanders into the family room and sees her son sitting in front of the TV with his finger in the glass.<br><br>"Why on earth do you have your finger in that glass?" asks the boy's mother.<br><br>"Well Mom, I heard Sis on the phone say that whenever she had a prick in her hand, she couldn't wait to get it in cider."<br><br>One day, after striking gold in Alaska, a lonesome miner came down from the mountains and walked into a saloon in the nearest town.<br><br>"I'm lookin' for the meanest, roughest and toughest whore in the Yukon!" he said to the bartender.<br><br>"We got her!" replied the barkeep. "She's upstairs in the second room on the right."<br><br>The miner handed the bartender a gold nugget to pay for the whore and two beers. He grabbed the bottles, stomped up the stairs, kicked open the second door on the right and yelled, "I'm lookin' for the meanest, roughest and toughest whore in the Yukon!"<br><br>The woman inside the room looked at the miner and said, "You found her!"<br><br>Then she stripped naked, bent over and grabbed her ankles.<br><br>"How do you know I want to do it in that position?" asked the miner.<br><br>"I don't," replied the whore, "I just thought you might like to open those beers first."<br><br>A young man was shipwrecked on a remote island. There was nothing for him to do except play with himself. After many years even that stopped.<br><br>He was always preparing for the day when he would be saved. One morning he saw a ship turn into the cove and he quickly ran to the woodpile and started it afire. He then threw wet seaweed on top and the smoke was bellowing high in the air. All of a sudden the ship starts to come his way.<br><br>He gets all excited and thinks I am finally going to be saved. The first thing I want is to take a hot shower - then they are going to give me some clothes and I am going to go upstairs and have a nice dinner. I will find a nice lady to dance with then I will take to her cabin and we can kiss and I can fondle her body. She will start to take off her clothes and she will be wearing red satin panties, and I will rub them.<br><br>With this, he starts to get an erection; he slips his hand into his shorts, grabs his pecker and yells, "Ha, Ha, Ha - I LIED ABOUT THE SHIP."<br><br>Little Red Riding Hood was getting ready to go and visit her grandmother in the forest and her mother said, "You'd better not go out tonight Little Red Riding Hood because the big bad wolf's out and you know what he'll do; he'll lift up your little red dress, pull down your little red panties and fuck your little red socks off."<br><br>But Little Red Riding Hood pulled out a shotgun and said, "Don't worry Mum, I've got it covered."<br><br>So she was walking through the forest when she came across the three little pigs. One of them ran out of the brick house and said "You shouldn't be out tonight Little Red Riding Hood! The big bad wolf's out and you know what he'll do if he catches you. He'll lift up your little red dress, pull down your little red panties and fuck your little red socks off."<br><br>So she pulled out the shotgun and said, "Don't worry boys. Got it covered!"<br><br>As she continued through the forest she came across the big bad wolf and he said, "You shouldn't have come out tonight Little Red Riding Hood because you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to lift up your little red dress, pull down your little red panties and fuck your little red socks off."<br><br>So she lifted up her little red dress, pulled down her little red panties, lay down on her back with her legs apart, pointed the shotgun at him and said...<br><br>"NO! You're going to eat me like the book says."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An Undertaker rings the wife of a dead man he is to bury...<br><br>u/t.. "Mrs Smith, this is the manager of the burial service and we have a bit of a problem with your husband."<br><br>wife.. "What's wrong?"<br><br>u/t.. "As you know, he was rather a 'well built' man. When Rigor Mortise sets in to a male corpse, he ends up with an erection and, basically, we can't close the lid of your husband's coffin."<br><br>wife.. "Well, what can you do?"<br><br>u/t.. "We can get a special coffin made that is about 3" taller than standard but it will cost you an extra $500."<br><br>wife.. "I can't afford that. Can't you do something to solve the problem which is a little less expensive?"<br><br>The undertaker thinks for a second, then makes a suggestion.<br><br>u/t.. "We could remove his penis."<br><br>wife.. "Hang on, I want him all there, together in his coffin when we bury him. I don't want bits of him lying around."<br><br>u/t.. "No worries, we can remove his penis and insert it in his rectum."<br><br>wife.. "OK, but only on 2 conditions. It can't cost any extra and I want to see the body immediately before the funeral."<br><br>u/t.. "OK, see you before the funeral."<br><br>Scene shifts to the Chapel just before the funeral. The undertaker shows the wife into the back room where they have the guy laid out in the coffin, wearing his best suit, with the make-up on to make him look presentable. The undertaker closes the door of the room behind him as he leaves the wife alone with her dearly departed husband for the last time.<br><br>She goes up to her husband's body and silently says her last, private goodbyes. As she is doing this she notices a small tear has trickled out of the corner of his eye and spoiled the make-up. She looks around to see if anyone else is in the room. When she knows she is there by herself, she bends down and whispers in her husband's ear, "Bloody hurts, doesn't it?"</div>

He goes home to tell his wife and after they both had a long cry over it, he asked her if she would have sex with him since he only had 24 hours to live.<br><br>"Of course Darling," she replied.<br><br>And so they have sex.<br><br>Four hours later they are lying in bed and he turns to her again and says, "you know I only have 20 hours to live, do you think we could do it again?"<br><br>Again she responds very sympathetically and agrees to have sex.<br><br>Another 8 hours pass, and she had fallen asleep from exhaustion. He taps her on the shoulder, and asks her again, "You know dear, I only have 12 more hours left, how about again for old times sake?"<br><br>By this time she is getting a little annoyed, but reluctantly agrees.<br><br>After they finish she goes back to sleep and 4 hours later, he taps her on the shoulder again and says, "Dear, I hate to keep bothering you but you know I only have 8 hours left before I die, can we do it one more time?"<br><br>She turns to him with a sour look on her face and says, "You know....... you don't have to get up in the morning. I do!!!"</div>
