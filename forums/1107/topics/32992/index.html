            <div class='col-md body'>At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated, "If GM had kept up with the technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving $25.00 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon."<br><br>In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating, "If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics:<br><br>1. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.<br><br>2. Every time they painted new lines on the road, you would have to buy a new car.<br><br>3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You would have to pull ove r to the side of the road, close all of the windows, shut off the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue.<br><br>For some reason you would simply accept this.<br><br>4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine.<br><br>5. Only one person at a time could use the car unless you bought "CarNT," but then you would have to buy more seats.<br><br>6. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five times as fast and twice as easy to drive -- but it would only run on five percent of the roads.<br><br>7. The oil, water temperature and alternator warning lights would all be replaced by a single "general protect ion fault" warning light.<br><br>8. The airbag system would ask, "Are you sure?" before deploying.<br><br>9. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key and grabbed hold of the antenna.<br><br>10. GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand McNally Road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even though they neither need nor want them. Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause the car's performance to diminish by 50 percent or more. Moreover, GM would become a target for investigation by the Justice Department.<br><br>11. Every time GM introduced a new car, car buyers would have to learn to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car.<br><br>12. You'd have to press the "start" button to turn the engine off.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Over the years, people have often asked to explain the various concepts of Marketing Communications.  The following analogies might help clarify the "tools of the trade":<br><br>You see a handsome guy at a party.  You go up to him and say, "I'm fantastic in bed." -- That's Direct Marketing.<br><br>You're at a party with a bunch of friends and see a handsome guy.  One of your friends goes up to him and pointing at you says, "She's fantastic in bed." -- That's Advertising.<br><br>You see a handsome guy at a party.  You go up to him and get his telephone number.  The next day you call and say, "Hi, I'm fantastic in bed." -- That's Telemarketing.<br><br>You're at a party and see a handsome guy.  You get up and straighten your dress.  You walk up to him and pour him a drink.  You say, "May I," and reach up to straighten his tie brushing your breast lightly against his arm, and then say, "By the way, I'm fantastic in bed." -- That's Public Relations.<br><br>You're at a party and see a handsome guy.  He walks up to you and says, "I hear you're fantastic in bed." -- That's Brand Recognition.<br><br>You're at a party and see a handsome guy.  You talk him into going home with your friend. -- That's a Sales Rep.<br><br>Your friend can't satisfy him so he calls you. -- That's Tech Support.<br><br>You're on your way to a party when you realize that there could be handsome men in all these houses you're passing.  So you climb onto the roof of one situated toward the center and shout at the top of your lungs, "I'm fantastic in bed!" -- That's Spam<br></div>
