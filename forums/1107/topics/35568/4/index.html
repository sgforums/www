            <div class='col-md body'>When yesterday's final whistle sounded, it ended our "likely" last match (unless the tampines rovers match is still on) and began our 2 months break. Its been a wonderful time playing wif u all guys. Lots of joy shared between thro the love of this game. Lots of tactical and strategy changes has taken place since we started out. Lots of improvement as well, as witnessed by Chester. (i asked him for comments)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> . However, frustrations, confusion and disagreements were exisistant as well. Jem's diplomatic match reports has always left out the mistakes and lack of discipline by the Reds. (other than himself, wat a modest chap.)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>In this posting, i would like to get some opinions regarding how my game should be played. I believe i've been rather ill-discipline. off the pitch: When i first join the team, i had a bad habit of coming late for matches. Reprimanded several times by the manager, i had changed by ways . (thanks to Lancer for picking me) On the pitch, i believe i muz haf been rather ill-disciplined as until today, i 've been signalled out as running out of position. Well in fact, the last thing i wanted to do to any team i played for ... is as a disruptive influence to it. I dun believe in being a notti boy and not playing according to team instructions, playing a prima donna. (i definitely dun poccess the skills to do dat as well) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  However due to rather conflicting instructions off and on the pitch ( maybe my understand power lousy la...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) i am committing the same "mistakes" again and again which the other 2 wings-back doesnt ... or doesnt commit as much. Here, i would like to explain mysf abit in 3 key pts in attempt to get wat is preferred for me to do in future games. Firstly, in supporting the attack: When we have poccession n in attempt to attack, isnt the whole team supposed to move up? Often, after a corner by opposition, colin shouts move up, so i did. (i watched EPL, its like dat too ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ) but izzit preferred i move up bt behind the mid-field?  Often the distance between the mid-field n strikers is rather far. hence i try to fill in the gaps (since my legs and carry me there) or draw some defenders away, (since i cant really cross or shoot) and link up the play. i believe in playing football in the opposition half instead of our own to win. There are times where i ended in great positions where boon and khai could put my thro for goal. ( on offense to any1, maybe u guys din c me.) Manager Robin had stopped me from joining 1 of the attacks in the last match while Colin and sometimes Charles urge me to move fwd.<br>My question here is, am i supposed to join an attack? our players does not prefer defenders to join an attack ( Russell does let me run on to thro balls pretty often though) becos its likely we will waste the chance? (juz be frank, i'm very opened to criticisms, i only wanna improve, not create confilcts. juz wanna get things clear). I knw the simple solutions here is to tell some1 to cover for me, but changes on the field takes place to quickly, there may not time to turn around and c whose available and then ask for cover rite? My second pt is .... Drifting to the centre. I'm not unaware of where i'm standing and does not stand there becos i enjoy being asked by teammates to get back to my position. Its for the simple reason dat the opp in the centre is free without any1 near him. and i can anticipate a pass is goin to reach him. If it happens, he got afew damaging options to us like playing a 1-2 wif his strikers and run on to shoot or juz shoot. hence i place mysf near dat fella to intercept if i can, or remove him as a passing option for his teammate. If the pass reach some1 else on my flank... i wld then run to dat fella during the flight of the ball, and chase him. the most dat other guy can do on the flank is cross, or at most a short pass back to the centre. by the time, our men wld haf got back to defend. i dun beleaf in shouting for markers too much also as i it will create too many "indian chiefs". Besides...i seldom see cases where i clashes wif my own mid-fielders for ball. So my question here is .... should i juz let them come thro the more impt centre ( i feel dat la... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ) The third and last pt is abt covering. Covering is needed becos some1 else is out of position or becos there's an extra attacker. i've reprimanded for leaving my defensive position and mid-fielders have to cover for me. In the last 2 matches (including the tampines rovers match), the oppositions attacks in 5-7s. Which means, opp mid-fielders, usually more skillful and running more than their strikers (i duno y... juz noticed dat) had joined in the attack. Giving a scenario on sunday's game, hongwei approach my flank 1st, i took him on, bt william ran behind me and took the ball from the former. In another: Jimson, william, hongwei and dawei were in front of me and patrick several times too. we needed cover. when taking on 1 attacker, the other will run behind me... when i turned around, its either no one on him ( then i haf to give up my marker and chase the fella behind), or patrick or charles will be follow him and i will drop back into the centre back. Here, covers by the midfielders for me is needed. which took place several times. (thank you mid-fielders) but isnt this part of the game or it shouldnt happen? Furthermore, its often said dat our defense shld let Charles (yestersday, patrick for awhile) be free.... but we're always short of markers. I suggest dat the our midfielder's be assigned to man marking particular key opp mid-fielders which has been creating chaos in our defence for the last few matches. Or shld i juz stick to my position, flat beside Charles and see if things are betta dat way?  I prefer cutting out the opp early (thus moving up) instead of inviting opp into our half so our team wldnt haf to fall back so much and allowing them to settle on our half ... making it diff for us to clear the ball, and build up an attack. The whole team will lose more energy in moving back and then up to attack. I understand the concern for me in diz case is dat i will be punctured... bt when certain situation applies, it may be inevitable. i seldom got problems handling 1 attacker. When i'm encountered wif 2 attackers, having to restrict their advance, i will be shagged and haf difficulty in catching the 2 whether or not i move up alot. i do pace mysf too, whn i knw i cant take it, i will request for sub or juz stay back. i seldom see cases where i walk ard in defense not marking any1, However centre-backs and mid-field covers is needed, i believe. I can gladly sit in my own position... that will really make my job very easy... Juz clearing balls and marking attackers. It will also save my lots of energy too. Bt i have doubts if i will be contributiing to the team with the best of my abilty. Maybe i watched too match EPLs... Egs: Even Alan Shearer goin to the left-back pos to clear ball whn Andy Griffin was away. Silvestre, Gary Neville, Stephen Carr, Danny Mills and even Jamie Carragher (least skillful of these wing-backs) all moved up to support all and others had to cover for them. I may be sounding dat im trying to defend mysf. Pls dun get me wrong, my purpose here is juz trying let u guys understand wat i've been trying to do and not intending to disrupt the team's play or defying mgt instructions. I chooses to do the things i c as most pragmatic on the pitch only. My views on playing the game is rather flexible. Hence I need the views of fellow teammates to help enlighten me and improve my game so as to contribute to the team betta. On offense to any1. We all may haf diiferent views on how the game shld be played to suit our team. On a different note, i like to say dat i'm really overjoyed to see our team win in our last match!

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow! Ian, you have just broken a record. Your post was so long that it can't be displayed normally!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Ian, the following are strictly my own opinions and views. I enjoy watching you on the field and often with lots of admiration. Your fitness is something I can only dream about. On top of that, you are a very enterprising and hardworking player.<br><br>Regarding your forays to the front, the game is dynamic and you are definitely free to explore free spaces offensively or plug these spaces defensively even if they are not part of your coverage/role. If you ask me, you have been doing very well in this aspect. However, one in his eagerness may well forget about his primary role. This problem is not found in you, though, as somehow, because of your attributes, you almost always get yourself back in time to cover your own position.<br><br>To put it bluntly, if a goal results from your actions, you are a hero but if the worst happens, then be prepared to be blamed. This is a fact of life. The choice is yours bearing in mind a 4-3-3 formation will be less tolerant compared to 4-4-2. And of course, like I was telling you on sunday, you should explore more passing options. It is only logical to pass to the relatively empty center after drawing so many opponents to the left flanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ian, paragraphing lehh....read untill the eyes look up down left right, read the same sentence again &amp; again, skip one line, two lines etc....... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>You are one of the few that has very good work rate, no doubts about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> To win the game, it takes the other 10 players in the team to gel and work together.  My feel for the last game (only the 2nd half) is that you were trying very hard to do too many things for a good cause. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  I understand your concerns in the midfield area but let the midfielders/strikers perform their roles. When we fail, let us do our reflection  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> and change things that we are weak in rather than having the other players do that and compromising their own positions.  Let us pinpoint the weakest link in the midfield and striking areas.  If we are not certain about the problem, how to remedy?? Give the midfield a chance. We are trying our best to play to the best of our abilities and strength.<br><br>Ian, every position has got a Primary role......No 1 priority.......other than that, anything else is of secondary importance. For your case, ur primary role will be defending the left side of our defence line.   I have been very happy with our defence which I felt is the only department in our team that is stable.<br><br>You are right in saying that we should play in the opponent's half rather than our own half. Whenever we attack, we move up but defenders should not be caught losing sight of the opponents behind them.  That would mean that the defender has failed to perform his primary role which is to defend. At the same time, it also compromise the positions of other players. In that sense, we will not be playing effectively and it becomes very messy.<br><br>Playing effectively could mean that if you have the ball near the keeper's box and you see that Derrick is free in the left midfield area. It's more effective and efficient to pass the ball to him from where you are rather than running with the ball towards him, tiring yourself in the process.<br><br>There is an existing problem in our midfield area which I am targetting to improve.  If there is also a lapse in our stable defence line, I will have more worries.  I am still narrowing down the specific players that are more suited as defenders, strikers or midfielders (still observing)<br><br>Guys, can all of us REMIND ourselves that we are only about 5 months old!! I am not saying this to comfort ourselves but to be realistic in meeting certain expectations that we may be setting too high for ourselves too quickly. Adapting to changes in style of play, positions, understanding each other takes time. As the manager, I am starting to feel the intense stress/pressure in our team.  I juz hope it is not affecting us from enjoying this beautiful game.<br><br>Ian, I hope you did not misunderstand that I was saying that you are a prima donna. You are not!! This is just something that I wanted to say to the team after talking about your issue.<br><br>At our level and as the manager of the team, my focus have always been on a few basic things:<br><br>1) Having some basic discipline in the team (on &amp; off the field) such as turning up punctually for games, no ill discipline on/off the field etc<br><br>2) NOBODY is better than anyone in OUR team (yesterday, I juz happen to use Russ as an example as he was standing next to me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ). To me, all of us are of about the same level.  If anyone thinks otherwise, you should then ponder on why you are not in some club team at this stage of your life <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>3) Everyone in this team will get a fair share of the game no matter how good you are.  Other than Charles, Jeremy and Colin/Robin keeper, everyone has been given an equally fair share of the game unless there were insufficient players in certain areas. Currently, there are plans to rotate Charles and Jeremy as well but it's still in the pipeline.  Unless, we have 22 players, there bound to be some players in the team playing a longer time.<br><br>4) Players should enjoy playing the game and be committed to the team with the right attitude.<br><br>At this point of time, my apologies to those whom I may have been too critical/harsh with <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  (especially Lancer boy - make sure you study hard and pass your 6 papers if not you are barred from playing in the team!!).Nothing personal.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I also hope that there are no lines drawn just because I am the manager.  If I am not playing well, do let me know what I am not doing right. I hope that I can improve in holding the ball longer and spreading play to the flanks, not forgetting my defensive role (something that I hope to achieve in the long run).<br><br>See ya guys this weekend. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My eyes are permanently squinted after reading Ian's post!!!!<br><br>In response to what Ian has brought up,i would like to say just a few things.<br><br>Firstly,my reports are just meant for<br>information sake and hence i try to windowdress it and leave all the pin-pointing of mistakes to the teamtalk section.Its solely in the name of fun.<br><br>Secondly,regardless of whether you are playing in the left/right back role,i personally feel that its alright for you to join the attack,in fact it gives the team more options.But,being a defender,you should always bear in mind yr primary role,as THE ROCK would tell you:"KNOW YR ROLE".If you decide to bring the ball up,its essential that you know exactly what you are going to do and not attack blindly.You must be confident that you can add to the<br>firepower upfront with moments of brilliance,if not its better to trust our midfielders and leave the attacking to them.Its better to release the ball from a distance the moment you see a man is free,rather than running up to him and passing when you are a metre away,or worst still,dribble pass yr midfielder,without getting him involved.<br><br>Just take for instance,Roberto Carlos,Lilian Thuram or youngster O'Shea.....these guys when you do find them moving upwards,they make sure that they get a pass or cross in from the byline,or for Carlos,you know he is going to unleash his fearsome shot.Other than that,they look out for their teamates upfront,and make that decisive pass or clearance and leave the job to the midfield/forward department,thats what they are there<br>for isn't it?<br><br>What i'm implying is,as defenders,its not our duty to attack,and we should only do so if at that point of time,we are almost sure of how we are going to contribute by pushing upwards.We must have a rough picture of how the play is going to be,and teamates must also know of yr pattern of play when you push up,be it overlapping play or whatever.You have to know what your next move will be,in short,play smart and dun waste unnecessary energy.Its a must to release that pass or cross or shot at goal for that matter,because if the ball is lost halfway,then the defence might get caught,if you know what i mean.<br><br>The next point is regarding drifting to the centre.If you mean drifting to the centre of midfield,its a big no no but if you are covering for the centre of defence when the opponent is coming down the right,then i guess it alright.<br><br>The final point about covering....well dun worry too much abt it because its takes a team effort to do that,you can only do so much,how are you going to take two players at a time,it takes discipline and teamwork in that area.A left-back's job would be mainly to cover his side of defence.As for the midfielders of the opposing team coming down the centre,its the midfielder's job to fall back and try to win back the ball or mark them.<br><br>All i have said is just my point of view,it does not mean that you are guilty of any of these...in fact i wanna compliment Ian on his high workrate and speed(envy...sigh...).Although you push up often,i must agree with Bara that you do in fact make a concerted<br>effort to fall back quickly,and do more often than not,win the ball back or clear it to safety.<br><br>Hope my posts has been of at least some help or answer to yr questions.<br></div>

Nobody in the team is,  cos we are not professionals. Even professionals make mistakes let alone you and me.<br><br>As bara had mentioned earlier, your stamina and determination on the pitch is something few of the players crave for, me especially. (very obvious rite?) With your assets, I felt that you are definitely contributing to our team.<br><br>Being a new member to this team, I am very glad to be part of it as I could see most, if not everybody, is enjoying the game and that is what our main objective is for every weekend. On the other hand, (I am not referring about you, Ian) I felt that with no offense to any of my team mates, I do not think we are able to take comments in a right attitude. Most of us seem to be very serious when comments are made.<br><br>If we can take things or comments more constructively, then I am very sure more contributions would be taking place in order to improve our team.<br><br>Hope I would not create hatred for myself from you guys for this comment. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ian, you have been a great contributor.  Don't worry and upset when being criticised in regards to your role.  One point to note is that, if you like to play offensive defender role, you need to improve in your crossing ability as well as shooting.  Is good that you can recover back fast but if you can't, there always the left midfielder to cover you.  That is team work.  We will take more time to understand each other game and adjust accordingly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some of my views follow in pt form<br>1) It is definetely ok for a fullback to join in the attack.The frequency and the need depends on many factors<br><br>2).If we are trailing, more man should push up and vice versa, if the opp is attacking in droves, it is of coz wiser not to push too up field and try to stay compact in defense<br><br>3) Quality of the opp is also important, i remember then when me and ian play some fast wingers like gary previously, both of us will take turns to cover him therefore when he or me push up, we will cover each other.Luckily for the exception of alwyn, we have not meet fast wingers who can torment us the whole match<br><br>4) Jem have pointed the one pt i fully agree that is, know what you are doing.If there is a huge amt of space for a fullback to exploit , by all means go ahead.Even pros do get caught by counter attacking.So a player's performance should not be based on one incident.Does over-dribbling on one occasion brand me a selflish player???<br>It is never easy to make the correct decision all the time in the field.As i have gone through some club training with mounbatten.i can say that positioning can only be perfect if there is a coach around.Therefore where to position oneself and when to push up and who to cover ian when he push up will never be that easy.Therefore if ian feels tat he can contribute upfield, he should be encouraged.1 or 2 offensive midfielders in a team is NOT enough<br><br>5)Formation does play a part, 4-4-2 will give fullbacks more chance to push field.4-3-3 will be slightly more uncomfortable as the centre midfielders will find it harder to cover the flanks partly due to fitness too.Slighly off topic, robin maybe we can rotate all our central midfielders every 25 mins or so to ensure optimum performance.<br><br>conclusion is, ian by means push up when there is a chance or<br>need.If the opp is faster than you are or if you are tired then try to stay back.it is never easy to be a defender or keeper.High workload, little rewards.Maybe you should have been a striker from the start buts its too late now to regret...hahaha<br><br></div>

The reason being too many "indian chief" n will cause more confusion in the field.  What we need is to give the basic respect to Robin in his decision.  We will discuss all related issue and the final decision will still depend on Robin.<br><br>I know it's very difficult to manager a social team where all the players come from different background.  Even the team I managed during my Army time gives me lots of problem.  But so far, our team haven't encounter any problem yet.  Well done Robin.  I believe you have being doing a great job.

            <div class='col-md body'>True that 25 mins may not be enough for one to settle down if he start the match.It depends on individual but most players take 5-10 mins to settle down in a game.I understand the frustration of being taken out just when you are settling in the game.<br>Central midfielders actually have alot of job to do , damn shag therefore my suggestion for the change every 25 mins is for the central midfielders to ensure optimum performance if we are playing 4-3-3.Flexibility should be exercised, if the player is doing well , he should ideally not be taken out.See no pt if the player is in form or have plenty of reserves left being taken out so soon..<br>Therefore robin's job is not easy  to see who is and who is not playing well at all times.<br>Robin just a tot,touchng on having a assistant, i don think we need to have a 2nd in charge atm,but on team subs,maybe you can discuss with the reserves if you are at the bench too ( i remember we did have some discussion during the st wlfred match).<br>if you are on the field, maybe you can let the player know when you are or whether to take him out. letting a player know he is go in or coming out in 5 mins time is a good mental preparation for the player <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Derrick, thanx for your kind words. It's indeed not easy as a manager. I'm sure yourself, Baracuda, Khairul....those who had done it before would understand the difficulties (such as earning respect, managing prima donnas  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> etc).<br><br>I would say that doing it at a competitive level is even worst after managing my police team for 3 years (Khai will know, being in my team before). Never regretted it though as the experience was excellent....lots of learning values.<br><br>In any case, I agree with Ian actually. In the intial stage, I appointed certain roles for some of us but somewhere along the way, things changed. Let me revised and think thru' the whole structure again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>We have come to the end of our first journey at our own home ground, it's the beginning of another.......experimenting different grounds, different opponents, different challenges.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>As long as all of you are willing and committed to the team, I can only promise you my best services. But just remember that I am also learning as a manager. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
