            <div class='col-md body'>Hey <strong>mit</strong>... no worries man . Safety first always. we guys are not playing soccer for a living. its nvr worth it to risk ourselves too much for the game. I've been guilty of not being hard enuff at times ... becos of the obvious reasons too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">    Most impt is to play the game at the level we all can enjoy it. I always believe there's different approach to the game with some players having the built to contribute to the more physical aspect while some provides the grace and beauty of it....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Yo Kai, let me kick-off in response to your last thread.... Frankly Its been a pleasure watching u play from the defence. The way u distribute your crosses and passes were breathe taking at times... Your running with the ball and taking on defenders reminds me of my favourite player ...Thierry Henry.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  These are esp when Kai is a striker... can always expect something brillant from u when u get the ball within 30 yards from the opp keeper.<br><br>Just a little reminder for the team's attacking players not to get too carried away with being the top scorer for the team. I guess its betta to be on the winning side than to have scored and end up losing ya? Having confidence between team-mates is a key to a great team... These are my views on football generally, guys dun take it personally ya? Cos on the contrary, i do understand that it is difficult to be always aware of where your teammates are and there's a need for strikers to be selfish at times when they have the confidence to score.<br><br>There is no perfection in playing the game, but we can always work towards it.<br><br>Our strikers are quite often called off-side. I'm sure there's lots of dubious calls in it... Maybe as a striker, Kai, maybe u can discuss with your fellow partners on ways to draw defenders to keep u guys on-side to the ref?<br><br>Kai as a midfielder will be much more quieter. Probably not the kind of player dat suits the combative nature of a midfielder. An Attacking Midfielder role behind the 2 strikers will work fine for u but it may not be suitable for our team to have this role.<br><br>Hence, i happy to see Kai being placed as a striker and doing well in recent games.... Cheers man!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>*Beep Beep Beep !!!! Full time ! Dat's abt all from me Kai....<br>Doing very well lately.... keep it up man!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks max, but I know I've been guilty for not even try giving some effort in improving my game.  Can see all other players are improving games after games except me.  Will try to change my attitude.<br><br>In fact, there are a lot of room to improve in our offensive play.  Do you agree most of our goals come from through balls, beating offside line?  Not a good sign if our opponent are very discipline in their offside line.<br><br>Just like what Robin brief B4 last match, centre midfield will try to string more passes to the winger but seems not happening.  I believe this is a good option we should practice on in the future to add on our attacking play.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> back to work.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[b]For a SOCIAL  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> team, I personally think it's important for every player to adapt to different positions (except keeper) if the need arises. If we have full strength for matches, I will definitely see that everyone gets to play in your most effective role. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">   However, in situations when we are lacking players in certain departments, I will try to spread out the players accordingly. For example, Ian pushing up to midfield, Lancer/Khairul/Ang/Russ dropping back to midfield etc.<br><br>Many of us hopes to score during matches but we can't possibly put everyone as a striker, right?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Like wat Ian said, we are a team.  To function effectively as a team, there bound to be times when sacrifices need to be made like not playing in your favourite positions. Nevertheless, we will try to fulfill the wishes of everyone so that we can enjoy the game better when we play.<br><br>From the last match, I made certain switches in the midfield and striking positions. I definitely agree that Khairul is more effective as a striker than a midfielder.  But if a situation arises such as shortage of midfielders due to injury etc, Khairul will still be one of my first options to pull back for a simple reason that he can adapt to the role well.  I feel that Khai has the ability to play well in the midfield area if he wants to.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Differing from some of your opinions, Khai has shown that he can play well as a midfielder when he was playing for my police team at a competitive level against club players/S-league players so wat's more at a social level where the opponents are not as good and competitive. I used to have a NFL centre midfielder in my police team (Khai should know him) who was smaller in size than Khairul but he was fantastic!! Size is a factor in soccer but I feel that it can be compensated with other things like speed, aggression, fitness, determination etc.  Nevertheless, I know Khai's desire and I will definitely support him as much in the striking position. Khai, you doing fine as a striker so not much feedback to give you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Mit, I heard that you were an instructor/PTI in army days.  Thus, I gather that you know the importance of warming up and stretching.  Some of you may find that I am naggy in this aspect, adult/not adult, I will continue to emphasis the great need to do a proper warm-up. Mit, I seriously feel that you should consider doing a proper warm-up before you even touch the ball. The very first ball that you kick is like a bolt of lighting, so fast and so hard!!! I will not be surprise if you injure yourself before the game starts <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> . I hope that you take my advice. For the rest of you, pls take note of this too. Warming down after the game also helps in preventing muscles aches/pains.<br><br>I'm actually considering conducting a team warm-up before the game. Wat do you guys think? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Baracuda, agreed with wat Russ said, good to know your efforts in improving your game but hope it's not one of the excuses to go 1819 more often. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>From the 1st day that Reds FC was set up till now, there have not been any doubts about the committment of every single one of you.  I hope to see the continual consistency of commitment and basic discipline in the team. Keep up the good work!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>As the manager, I also hope that all of you would support me by giving me the due respect in managing and keeping the team together.  Pls talk to me if you feel uncomfortable about certain issues.  My CREDIBILITY as a Manager is important (always remember that).  Any disciplinary issues will be taken into hand seriously (I mean it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> ).<br><br>Now, let's hope that Liverpool loses over the weekend so that we will win our games!!! hehehe.....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Ooops <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> , did I just say that????? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from yesterday's game,i think it would be better to have boon at centre-mid and jimmy on the flanks rather than the other way round. boon has good distribution and gets involved much more when he's playing in the middle. jimmy on the other hand is good when running at defenders and playing on the flanks would allow him to run more with the ball.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>robin, in view that we'll be losing majority of the students for the next game onwards (kelvin n ian - leftbacks, boon n chia - midfielders, jem??), i dun mind a switch in position as we have sufficient strikers around in ang, russ and robin. i can drop back to midfield or since we are losing both our leftbacks, i dun mind filling in the leftback slot since i've played there before back in jc (juz hope i still remember how to play  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ). juz to give you more options since we won't be having as many players next time round.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
