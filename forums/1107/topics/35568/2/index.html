            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, I think it was quite fruitful.  Main thing was that we had a chance to practice on short passes and off the ball running.  Such sessions will definitely help us improve our team play.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Short passes is definitely good but I believe we need some time practice our long passes as well.  I think the main reason why we always concentrated in the left is because there isn't any long pass to switch play.  Once the ball landed on the left side and naturally our mid fielders and defence will move closer to support.  This might pose a thread to us if our opponent can easily switch play.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah Boon??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Is that you??  Steady lah! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyway, my personal view about the match was that we gave our opponents too much space (if that is at all possible in our small field!).  Looking at the way they played, they were thriving on space to play passes and looking out for teammates.  When we play with teams like these, teams who are better at passing the ball around, we should try to cut off the space.  Our opponents were pulling back to the defenders to create more space for themselves, so we could have either pushed up a bit to restrict space to their midfielders, or really sit back in our own half to defend.  I don't think we want to do the latter, so the former should have been done instead.<br><br>Among other things, I feel that we need to have more specific instructions going into the game.  Firstly is what I mentioned above, which is our <strong>style of play defensively</strong>.  Basically what do we do when we do not have the ball? Do we pressure our opponents to get the ball back? Close them down early? Or do we play just sit back in our half and contain our opponents? This can be told before a game or even during a game, but it is important because only if the whole team does the same thing, then will it be effective.<br><br>Secondly, is our <strong>style of attacking play</strong>, in other words, what do we do with the ball?  Are we going to play a more direct style (which is what we do)?  Or do we want to slow down the attacks with more passes?  Of course this can be quite dynamic during the game, just because we decide to play a passing game doesn't mean you don't play a long ball to an open player.  However, with the common understanding of a general style of play, we will be able to support each other better with the right type of runs and passes.<br><br>Last but not least, I think there should be more specific <strong>instructions with the formations </strong>that we use.  Again, this can be quite dynamic as a lot will depend on our opponents, but with a proper understanding of each others' roles and positions, we will be able to perform better with the increased synergy.  If any player has to drift due to our opponents' playing tactics, then it means that we should be switching our tactics too.<br><br>The main thing is that there are no right or wrong ways to play the game.  More importantly is that we are playing a similiar style, singing to the same tune.  With the proper understanding, we will definitely be able to play better as a team.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah it's me Ah boon <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> hopefully i can try to contribute more online<br>from now on<br><br>You are right that we give too much space away in midfield the last match.Got to say that our midfielders was not marking the opp at all when the opp player nearest to them doesnt have the ball.Many a times we are guilty of ball watching and trying to covering up spaces only when the opp midfielders recceive the ball.By then play would have been dictacted.A certain level of marking in midfield by all midfielders would make oppenents have a harder time in passing and easing some work load off the defenders.Marking by midfielders in not only during corners and throw in.<br><br>Regarding our style offensively, maybe we should have a game plan as to which man to target in attack(russel??)and which playmaker to look out for.This would make passing much  easier.For example derrick or khai could keep themselves free on the far left and our team mates could immediately look out for them when starting a attack.<br>I hope the midfielders could push up a bit more to support the attack and shoulder some responsibilty in scoreing some goals.Thumbs up to jimmy and jeremy in this area.<br><br>Preferably, we should actually plan our game plan taking into account our opp's strengths, formation and weakness too.Changes should be make asap if the need arises.If we need to score goals, a defender should be sacrificed for a striker or even to the extent of pushing the defender up.For example when the chips are down, bara could be deployed as a extra striker near the far right penalty box and hopefully use his forte in excecuting  the kind of shots he has done previously at hcjc.<br></div>

But don't worry, I believe when we settle down, we will perform well.<br><br>I totally agreed with what kai's point of view on 4-4-2.  We need our left, right midfield to overlap the attacks at the frank and that require high level of fittness.  The 2 strikers will stick to our opp last man, waiting to beat off-side track or hold the ball and switch it to the left or right frank or back to the centrs mid to recompose.  This is really a fast attacking game which I believe our fittness level can't cope with it.  If we want to play this formation, we need to practice more on cross, header and trapping the ball in the air.  Just my point of view.<br><br>Another thing, trust me, don't miss this chance.  You will love the field.  But advise not to slide.  will have abrasion.</div>

There is never a definite formation we are extremely good at if you might agree with me, which is why I find that it might be good to try out various formation and see how well we can cope with.<br><br>As for last Sunday game, that is the 1st time we are playing 4-5-1 formation and I think we did well to hold them who is playing much better than us where their midfield is concerned.<br><br>On the other hand, if our opponent is a weaker side, I am sure even when we are playing 4-4-2, we are able to adapt to it as this is what we are applying for most of our games. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have to agree that 4-4-2 doesnt really suit our team so far.We have been trying it for many games, but seriously not many a times have our wingers have not been effective due to some reasons, A lack of speed and the the small width of our homeground.Igot to admit that i have been struggling to make even one decent run down the byline.Many a times i am caught falling too deep in trying to mark out the left midfielder.<br>A 4-3-3 fomation suits our team pretty well in sense that we have left right forwards in bara, kai and derrick.Playing 3 central midfielders would also give everyone a chance to rotate during the game and tighten the marking in midfield.<br>Though we should plan our plan against our opp, maybe we can start playing well in our 4-3-3 and let the opp worry abt us and alter their own fomation <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
