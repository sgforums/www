I am hardly involved in the decision making. Like the rest of the team, I offer my views to Robin and its really up to him. Of course, I do try to influence Robin's decisions but I am only as successful as any of you. In fact, it was you and russ who were left in charge when robin was away in KL.<br><br>4-3-3 is a very attractive option and yes, we did reasonably well when we tried it two weeks ago. We were playing well offensively but problems surfaced in our defensive plays. These problems were caused by our center mids' eagerness to defend  the flanks. When the opponents attack down the flanks, the center mids should just fall back and mark out any other players near or at the center and trust the left or right back to move up and contain the player with the ball.<br><br>No matter what formation we play, we should all be very clear about our roles, both offensive and defensive.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First thing first....we got to be clear on a few things.  Please take all comments constructively.  It is nothing personal, okie? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Decisions are not soley made by the 3 of us.  Our decisions are based on discussions and feedbacks from the team.  As the team's manager, I am trying to execute the decisions and strategies with the best of my abilities.  Thus I continuously try to solicit feedback from all of you during half time and after the game.  If you say nothing, I will take it that you are happy or you have nothing to say.  Another thing is; even if there are changes to be made.  It has got to be done at the right time. This change, that change.....in the end, all confused.  I try to do it as it comes.  If you tell the players 1001 instructions, you will have him walking off rather than enjoying and playing the game.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Please also bear in mind that decisions are not easily made or executed as it seems.  Decisions would mean compromising other players' playing position, maybe playing time, the way we go about rotating players, very specific instructions on our style of play etc. If any one thinks it's easy, pls fill my shoes (this is said on a lighter note). Decisions may benefit some but may cause others to feel uncomfortable.  I am trying to strike a balance thus I always check to know if all of you are comfortable playing in your postions. Try not to tell me "anything", more difficult for me in certain sense.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>For example, I appreciate Lancer's direct approach as he told me that he hopes that he can stick to only the striker's position, I respect that.  Boon, I will also look into your suggestion to play u in the centre.  In fact, I know you can play in the centre thru' a few matches previously. Yourself, Ang and Bara fitted nicely in the centre for the 4-3-3 formation as well.  Khai, I dun think that you are boastful but all I can say is that how you feel or perform during the game does affect the whole morale of the team (I mean it!!). Can you tell me what position you really want to play?  You told me that you dun mind trying out the left as you felt that you were not effective in the centre.  I did the change.  However, you did not seem comfortable during the last game and when approached, you said that it was one of your OFF days??  For old times sake, I need you to be more transparent with me. Bro, tell me in the face if you want to, I juz want to know wat the hell you are thinking so that I can try my best to see to the arrangement, can?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  This goes the same for all other players as well.      <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>My 1st priority for the team is try to ensure that every single player plays a fair and enjoyable share of the game which is why we set up the team in the first place....PASSION.  We will play to win but if it's becomes too much about winning only, I dun think we will enjoy the game as much. I personally like to play the whole game myself but I will rather sub myself out than take any one of you out.  Fun, fun, fun....... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Changes with a certain style of play does not mean that we will see improvement so quickly. Khai and Boon, I personally also like the 4-3-3 formation which I feel suits us but we need time to adapt.  For last week's game, I started with 4-4-2 cos I knew that the opponents was good before the game started.  I wanted to play safe in the midfield area by playing 4 rather than 3.  Eventually, they had about 3 play makers who took on our 4 so easily.  In the end, we got to pull back one more to midfield.  For this week's coming game, I would like to try the 4-3-3 formation again but bear in mind that the field is much bigger.  We might not cope that easily but we will try. I will also have very specfic instructions for the centre mid from now on.  I think we lack communication and discipline in the centre. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Ah Boon, I'm glad you are sharing so much online.  Your suggestions will be taken into consideration.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Russ,as what I have told you, I fully understand what you are saying about specific instructions but let's put it this way, let's get our fundamentals right like marking, corners kicks and throwings before anything else. At this point of time, we can give some simple instructions on the style of play but not too many and not too complex ones. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And yes, I agree, with our "cute" home gorund, we cannot play by the flank.....one pass and it's out to neverland.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>One last thing, when everyone gives me different suggestions and opinions, it's difficult to come up with a decision that makes everyone happy but of course, I will try to come up with a "Win-win" situation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Khai, try not to miss this week's game, you will regret missing playing on a nice ground.  I'm sure we can play some beautiful soccer this Sat (after all the hedious condition at home ground). After our game, I will be continuing to play the 5pm game with my church team on the same ground. That's how much I enjoy playing there!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  See ya guys this Sat. Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have to agree that team talks are for our guys to speak up, if we dont..robin will never know what we are thinking about.But due to fatigue during half time or a lack of ideas on what to say yet after the game, not many of us have really poken up alot.Online posting is good in the sense as it has given the players some time to sort out their thoughts.Hopefully more of our team mates will come in and find it meaningful too.We can discuss the match the next week as we dont have the luxury like pro team who meet up the day after or soon after the game.Hopefully we can still remember what happen during the last match.<br><br>Robin has his pt that he wanted to use 4 midfielders against our opp last week.The fomation inefficency could be due to many factors, our players weakness, our opps strength, game form.Many factors.But one thing for sure, having 5 in midfield would mean only a lone striker.Even if we are playing 4 midfielders, we could push them to be a bit more compact in the centre.<br><br>No doubt about it, the main piority of the team is not to win and win but to have fun and enjoythe game.AFter all we are a social team , therefore enjoying the game and friendship is the most important.No ones likes the losing feeling but even if we lose, it is still right that everyone in the team have a fair share of the game and be able to enjoyed the game.I would never wan too major a share of the game as it will mean less playing time for my fellow fren <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Lets see how this week game goes and on this pitch, it could be a diferent story.See you guys this sat and remain optimistic <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>robin,dun get me wrong...i'm not trying to question the effort u'v put in in running the team.like i said b4 u'r the very reason i decided to join this team as i'v played under u b4 back during our police days...so no hard feelings ok bro!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>juz wanna be honest with my views...i can pretend to be full of praise for evry1 but that wld make me a hypocrite rite... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>anyways,it's only through this kind of fiery discussions that i can draw the others ( especially the quieter 1s  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  ) to participate and give meaningful "sincere views" instead of those "diplomatic" ones..<br>at the end of the day, being a social team, the most impt thing is to have fun on the field and to achieve this,we need to find a certain system of play which evry1 is comfortable with and happy to play...being a newborn team it's only natural that we'll get a lot of these conflicting opinions at this stage but personally i feel it's probably good for the team in the long run...btw i got to noe about this open league through a fren and i was thinking maybe we can participate in about a year's time..quite interesting,the competition is broken up into 2 parts, league and fa cup.<br><br>i have decided to skip my cls this sat so i'll be down for the game..<br><br><strong>to all sim-ers</strong>,there's a meeting in school this sat at 8.30am with the admin dept n the other clubs and societies...colin and i will be attending.i wld really appreciate it if u guys can come down too but i won't force u...but do let me noe if u're coming.<br><br>looking forward to sat's game,feeling good about it.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[b]Boon, I guess you are right about giving feedback in here but if possible, it will also be good to hear some during the debrief so that everybody can discuss about the issue involved there &amp; then.  Nevertheless, it also make sense that we put our thoughts right before expressing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Khai, can I conclude that you feel better in the striking position? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   Things that come to my ears will not be left unattended (I know about certain things but I won't change things that easily unless you talk to me).

Bro, I need a confirmation.  If you tell me anything again, I will put you as keeper!@# <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Few things I would like to highlight:<br><br>During play, it is difficult to switch play/formation if we encounter problems.  Russ and Khairul, you have been appointed to assist in identifying possible switches or changes.  I cannot do everything, too many things on my mind.<br><br>We play to win with the best of our abilities but like wat Predator had said, we also have to learn to lose at times.  Being a social team, our NO 1 OBJECTIVE  is for everyone to play a fair share of the game regardless if we are losing or winning. I will try to balance such arrangements.<br><br>If anyone thinks I'm wrong in certain things, tell me.  I am not God!! I am not perfect.<br><br>Previously, before the birth of the Reds, when we were all in a mess and wearing a mixture of continental colors, we tried 4-5-1 but it didn't work that well.<br><br>Now, we have tried 4-4-2.  I feel that it not's working cos' not enough balls are going to the left and right wings due to a lack of discipline in the centre midfield + small size of our home grounds.  We also did not utilise the potential of our full backs during this formation as well. I personally feel that we can play 4-4-2 if we want to BUT not at homeground and more specific instructions got to be given to players.<br><br>We shall attempt to try out the 4-3-3 formation and let's see how we fare from there.  We will switch accordingly depending on the situation.<br><br>All said and done, let us all enjoy this beautiful game till we grow old together!! I am glad to have a team of 20 (including Chester)  committed, disciplined (have to monitor) and passionate players/friends.  It's only a "few" hours from our game tommorrow.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ya man!  We're one bunch of passionate, committed soccer "sioew".  Let's enjoy the game and play like a pro.<br><br>In fact, we have been trying almost all the formation and still haven't really found which one suit us best.  As mentioned b4, we need to adjust our formation according to out app strenght and I agree with robin that we can't easily change play during the game.  But I believe we can provided we have good communication during the game.  We should have a mutual understanding to what role to play if we were push up or pull down during the game.  That can be done throught experience in the past games and discussion before the game.  That might be quite confusing to switch play in the game but we need to adapt to it.  We are not like those pro that can access their opp strenght before ttheir game.  we only know when the whistle first blown.  But I still strongly believe we should have just one formation set and change only when can't hold our opp.<br><br>Don't miss this sat game.  Very good field to play in.  If possible, I will try to arrange padang field in the future with SRC.  But they are still too strong for us now.</div>
