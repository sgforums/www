            <div class='col-md body'><strong>I juz want to affirm that the defence played well in the game.  You guys are doing a wonderful job.  The goal they scored was purely one of those.....what I call...... "Ping-ball type" .  It all happened quite fast.  If you ask me, I would say it's one of a freak chance that they got.<br><br>Charles, dun paiseh lahhh, shout at the other defender if you have to. Can see that both you and Jem are "geling" better and better. Keep up the great stuff.  In the meantime, remember it's MASSAGE time. By the way, thanx for getting Derrick. I think he is a great "asset " to the team.  I'm certain that the Shadow Master agrees with me. Can somebody tell me where the hell is Damien?!@# Oooppss <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ......I forgot....he is "busy".....hehehe<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, its Ian here. this is my first posting. I really proud to be playing for this team and is really sorry for the last min thingie in the tanglin field match.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> The last match was the best i have seen the team play, but i do feel the team has much more to offer with the given potential and depth. I was pretty disappted wif my own performance after not having touch the ball for more than 3 weeks. Thanks to Jeremy and Charles for their contribution in providing the defensive cover. They have inpired a strive to improve for the next match. Cheers !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
