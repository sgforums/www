            <div class='col-md body'>Well... looks like we did it again... hahaha... up 2 goals at half-time, then losing our lead in the 2nd half.  We've really got to try to put that right.  Feel free to air your views on this.  For some reason, our team doesn't seem to function the same in the 2nd half.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>I have to sleep on it and hopefully I'll see some light on this tomorrow...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>However, I must say again that it was a good game and I think we were evenly matched.  The lowest point of the match for me was when the opponent actually called me Heskey...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[/b] I felt that both teams competed well for the 1st half but we were more organised and hardworking.  With the fainting spell of their players, mistakes from their keeper and defenders miskicking the ball to our strikers, we capitalise on that and managed to score.<br><br>I would say that Ben made a big difference in the defence and he managed to cut off most of the ball that were pumped in. I was actually thinking that Jeremy would be doing that as I had tasked him to be the "last' man controlling the line.  Nevertheless, somebody did the job and it's good to see that our defenders are not playing so much to the centre and are clearing the balls to the side. (hmmmm...I am considering booking fields with water puddles in the centre :lol<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>In midfield, there was not much action in the central area for obvious reasons. I did my best in "wrestling" with the opponents on the "water bed". Boon played relatively well as a left mid but needs to gel more with Heskey with his powerful thru passes.  It's either that or Heskey has got to run even faster?? Both of you figure it out <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Lawrence drifted too much up front rather than opening up wide.  It was difficult for the ball to reach him.  Nevertheless, it's good to see him in action after so many months of laying off.<br><br>Strikers Heskey and Jimmy Hasslebank were sharp and played well for the whole game.<br><br>Second Half<br>Opponents woke up and changed their game strategy. Their no 10 player switched side to our left and tagged one more player together with him.  They also moved up their last line. Despite an outstanding performance by Alfred who were executing his flying legs and tackles,  They were unstoppable and goals were scored with Perfect 10.  Heskey noticed the loophole and did well by covering the left back position.  Boon was in a faraway land  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> and the opponents kept bombarding our left side.  I got wrestled by one of the Fuji opponents as he pressed his studs on my left feet <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> ....the "victims" are not the toes this time but just above them.  I nearly "killed" my wife yesterday while she was executing her "iron thumb " on me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">   The swell is half the size of a pingpong ball. Alvin Chia came in but left after a while and then came in again......confuse the opponents??  I still have not ascertain the reason behind the "stunt".  Heskey did well by unleashing a long shot and competing his hectric.  Eventual score was 6-4.<br><br>Learning Values<br>1. I noticed that directing players on the field during the game helps to be more organised in the first half. There should only be one person giving instruction on the field.<br>2.  Left and right midfielders have to learn to play their defensive role as well.  Even though they are wingers, they have to drop back to cover the opponents' left and right midfieders.  Center midfielders are not Gods!!<br>3.  As Barcuda had pointed out, the team needs to put in more fighting spirit.<br><br>Pls feel free to comment on my performance even thought I am the manager. I appreciate feedbacks.  Barcuda, pls pardon me for losing my cool when we spoke after I came off the field. I was quite pissed at my injury, at the second half and it was just simply difficult to fulfill the different requirements of players in the team.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>To all, pls understand that I have to assess the big picture and make decisions which are based on feedbacks and comments.  I may not be right at all times and some decisions will not be able to  everybody happy. Whatever it is, we only have one goal and that  is to make the best decisions for this team.  As far as I am concerned, I agreed to build this team and I am not giving up unless all of you give up.  Whatever unhappiness or comments, come to me, my doors are open. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Our journey continues on possibly the 17th of Nov. Charles has been assisting in getting opponents and we have a few teams line up at home ground in the coming weekends. Glad to see the commitment from Charles and hopefully more to come from the other players.<br></div>
