And best of all......they had revised their members rate for Sunday from $3.50 to $2.80 per game. If I am not wrong, one membership is only needed as they should be taking it as the lane is book under a member and hence given members rate. Even if everyone must be a members to enjoy this rate, the membership is only $6 a year. It is still worth it. Compared to Jackies for a 4 games rate, one get to save $3.20 a week and $38.40 throughout the whole season.<br><br>Further comfirmation will be updated.

            <div class='col-md body'>Alvin, I am puzzled at the question u asked. Since 3 weeks ago, I have been asking you if you can talk to uncle Johnny whether its possible to make special arrangement for us to have 9 pin tap at jackie and you always replied that it wouldnt be a problem. And with your big name at Jackies, who else is more suitable to talk to Uncle Johnny than you? And of course if you feel that its a job solely for the competition director, then I will do it myself.</div>

It would probably only require a simple configuring of the consoles before the games. In this case, we can always approach whoever is on duty and do not have to specifically look for Uncle Johnny. Furthermore, I really do not believe my name has any influence on the outcome. My name could have been mentioned on occasions by the staffs, purely because our lanes are booked under it.<br><br></div>

However, even if they don't, we can always record our own scores manually.   More importantly, I propose that each participant contribute $10 for the prizes (please pay to our treasurer  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ).  I will be buying 2 prizes (i.e. top male &amp; top female bowler) for this competition.  Do let me know if this has any conflict with what you have planned.<br><br>Addressing the issue on your role as the "Competition Director", I personally have been impressed and appreciative of the enthusiasm and commitment you have shown in the past in fulfilling this role.  Nevertheless, if you now have other commitments that are making things difficult for you, we can always discuss about this on Sunday.  I believe that will address this issue more effectively and efficiently.<br><br>By the way, please bring the trophy this Sunday as I will need to include the current champions' achievements onto the trophies.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>Hmmm.. maybe I should save some time and include my name for the next one...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
