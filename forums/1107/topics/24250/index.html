I don't see a problem at all. Can you also explain why you need to start a new thread when there is already an existing one on the same subject matter.<br><br>Anyway, welcome to the new forum. I do empathise with your situation with the police team as I was manager for RSAF grp II for two years too. However, what do you mean by "if we have sufficient players to run the show"? Isn't the manager the one who is suppose to run the show? Anyway, since I am dying to play, I hereby volunteer for the job. Hopefully, we can get the team up and playing soon.<br></div>

Furthermore, the colour of the symbol beside each thread will be in yellow for the new postings. In fact I had that problem for the old forum as the replies were not placed in sequence.<br><br></div>
