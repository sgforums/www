            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with your latest plan. I made that suggestion as i felt that Alfred is more suitable than Khairul in a defensive postition. I guess you came out with a better solution. Khairul has no preference but do not wish to play on the left.<br><br>The opponents are wearing dark blue or black.<br><br>Btw, you can edit your own posts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Howdy people. I personally enjoyed watching the game from the bylines. Like I have told some of you, both teams were equally good but some of our opponents possessed better individual skills.<br><br>Their goals were not scored by set pieces but more of shooting from a distance. If our keeper was more experienced, he would have stopped them quite easily. Overall, our midfield was on par with theirs. Defence was also playing well. Striking can be better.  One thing we lost out was the fitness. Many of us were slowly down especially in the midfield area in the late part of the 2nd half. Not much ball winning.  However, I'm sure as we play more often, we will be better. As far as the game is concern, I take it as a draw and not a defeat. We will play with a 4-4-2 formation for the next game and see how we fare.<br><br>Khairul, it's good to see you in here and know that you can commit to the team (By the way, my wife's name is KAI also<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ). So far, I can say about 90% of our players who played that day can commit to the team. We are getting this thing going slowly.  By any chance, can you check with Ben if he is willing to commit and join us. He is a good player, both hardworking and determine.<br><br>Well, I hope that this team will play with passion and at their best. It all boils down to enjoying the sport rather than playing it for other reasons. As for other issues like fitness, we can work it out slowly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </strong></div>
