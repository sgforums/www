            <div class='col-md body'>[b]Good news......<br><br>The first good news is that we manage to get the Marina South Field for this weekend's game!! It was thru' the lobang referee, Selvam who did our game at Yishun Ring with the "Liverpoolers". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Without a current Home Ground, I guess we will see less of Mr Magoo and more of Mr "Gopal"...eeerrr.....I mean Mr Selvam. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Selvam invited our team to join a league that is going to start sometime on 5-6 April. Deadline to join is 31 Mar.  He will be sending me the registration forms, rules etc (should receive the thing by trw).  Prior to Selvam's invitation, I have already heard of the thing but did not share the infor as the details were unclear.<br><br>Each team plays 30 games in total (every weekend without fail - will last for about 7 months).  There will be prizes for the top teams, even the Golden Boot Award.<br><br>Registration fee is $100/- for each team to participate in the league. In addition, we continue to pay for every week's game which ranges from $70/- to $90/- for the referee and the field.  It's good money for the organizers.  To my understanding, it also allows the rolling sub thing which is good!!<br><br>This sounds like a "social team" tournament which is suitable for us. However, I'm not sure if our team is ready for this committment + the concern of our students' exams.<br><br>The money part is actually quite ok.  $100 divide by 18= $5.50 per person to register. Game money can be divided by the number of players who can make it for the games.  In any case, with the absence of our own homeground, we need to arrange the games through the lobang referee anyway.<br><br>Think thru  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> and comments please.  In the meantime, I will feed the necessary details to all of you when I receive the papers.<br><br></div>

Maybe you can take a look in this website for more information.  http://www.sportstown.gov.sg.<br><br>$36 pitch is only for open field like Marina South, Geyland, Ubi.  It apply to all pitches that cool booking is not allow.  Every month there will be a balloting.  Successful candidates will only be given max 4 time slot.<br><br>One thing I don't understand why these referees are having so many time slots.  Maybe, this is how they do biz.  They book as many first then find teams to fit in the time slots. And then charge higher fees.  That's why we always heard the full price, ref and field. If that is the case, we will fighting against their rice bowl. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I think no harm trying to ballot for open field as it only cost $36.

            <div class='col-md body'>[b]St Wilfrid is considered an open field. Strictly cannot be used for sanctioned tournament as it is an artificial pitch.<br><br>In the past, the procedure is to queue up physically at the office located at National Stadium to ballot for the fields.  Now, it is done thru' the internet.  It is definitely cheaper to book the field and arrange the games ourselves.  However my concerns are; How successful are we in getting the fields and how successful are we in getting opponents? For those of us who have been arranging games for the team, it's quite tedious and pressurising at times.  With the current momentum of our team, I'm quite confident to say that all of us look forward to our weekly game.  Missing one or two weeks of soccer would probably cause many of us to feel "sian" and demoralised. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>For convenience and other reasons, I am in favor to leave the hassle to the lobang referees to see to all the arrangement and keep us informed of the details.  Moreover, we have quite a large pool of player to split the cost which is only a couple of dollars for each game.  In this way, we also get to meet more challenging opponents and able to play at different grounds. Not forgetting having different referees instead of one Magoo.  Think thru and comment.<br><br>On Wed, I received the details of the tournament.  Everything is perfect for us except one possible problem............there is NO rolling substitution.  However, we can make a maximum of 6 substitutions which means that only 17 players can play each game <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> . Because of this reason, I personally think that this tournament may not work out for us, wat do you guys think?<br><br>In any case, the other details are:<br><br>Tenchi International Cup (sponsored by Tenchi International Comics) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>1.

            <div class='col-md body'>Using Lobang Referee is a good idea.  Don't have to stress too much in looking for opponents and worry that can't win the balloting.  If the Lobang referee not charging us to much, why not.  If happen that we can have our home ground secure, that will be more ideal.<br><br>As for the league, I don't see a problem at all.  Althought we have 20 committed players, on average, we have 16 turn up for all the matches.  Even all 20 turn up, only 3 wouldn't have the chance to contribute.  Can't say these 3 are unlucky, this is bits ang puzzles of tornament.  This week can't play, next week sure play lor.  What the big deal sitting by the side line supporting your team?<br><br>In fact, it is good news that this tournament play only on sunday morning and allow 6 substitutes.  I'm all in for this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with derrick and is all for the league. The timing is perfect for us. As for the limitation of subs, I too don't see a big problem as we often have injured players or players who are absent due to work or personal commitments. If all are present and fit, I do not mind sitting out and let better players play. If we were to take part in this league, the team must come first.<br><br></div>

Sounds challenging and fun.

            <div class='col-md body'>[b]From the discussion yesterday, the final decision is NOT to participate in the coming league.<br><br>I hope none of you feel disheartened about the decision. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>As mentioned, by joining the league, it would probably result in the following changes:<br><br>1. The objective and mindset of forming this team will probably change and progress to be more competitive focus.  That differs from our current objective of having plain fun and enjoying the game. Different ball game altogether.<br><br>2. If we join the league, some players may not get to play as much. Will every single one of you be prepared not to play at all for certain matches?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> Eventually, some may stop coming or drop out. That's not what I want. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>3. Possible conflicts in fielding players, style of play, formation etc may arise <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> .  Currently, I think our team has not mature or settle down to effectively manage such issues.<br><br>4. If we join the league, there will be a possible need to train and improve on our current team. Are we ready for the added committment?<br><br>Nevertheless, unless something changes along the way, we may join some league in the future.  For the time being, if any 1-day competition comes by (7-A-Side), we can still participate <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> .
