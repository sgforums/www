            <div class='col-md body'>THE GOLFING NUN<br>A nun is sitting with her Mother Superior, chatting.<br>"I used some horrible language this week and feel absolutely terrible about it."<br>"When did you use this awful language?" asks the elder.<br>"Well, I was golfing and hit an incredible drive that looked like it was going to go over 280 yards, but it struck a phone line that's hanging over the fairway and fell straight down to the ground after going only about 100 yards."<br>'Is that when you swore?'<br>"No, Mother," says the nun. "After that a squirrel ran out of the bushes and grabbed my ball in its mouth and began to run away."<br>"Is THAT when you swore?" asks the Mother Superior again.<br>"Well, no." says the nun. "You see, as the squirrel was running, an eagle came down out of the sky, grabbed the squirrel in his talons and began to fly away!"<br>"Is THAT when you swore?" asks the amazed elder nun.<br>"No, not yet. As the eagle carried the squirrel away in its claws, it flew near the green and the squirrel dropped my ball."<br>"Did you swear THEN?" asked Mother Superior, becoming impatient.<br>"No, because the ball fell on a big rock, bounced over the sand trap, rolled onto the green, and stopped about a foot from the hole."<br>The two nuns were silent for a moment.<br>Then Mother Superior sighed and asked, "You missed the dam putt, didn't you?"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To celebrate 50 years of marriage, a couple booked a<br>weekend at St. Andrews. On the 3rd tee, the husband<br>said, "Darling, I have to confess something. Twenty<br>years ago I had a brief affair. It meant nothing. I<br>hope that you can forgive me."<br>His wife was hurt but said, "Dearest, those days are long<br>gone. What we have now is far more valuable. I forgive<br>you." They embraced and kissed.<br>On the 17th tee the wife said to her husband, "Darling,<br>since we're being honest with each other, I have something<br>to tell you. Fifty-two years ago I had a sex change<br>operation, I was a man before we met."<br>The husband threw a fit! He cursed, threw his driver away,<br>broke the rest of his clubs one by one, tore at his clothes,<br>screamed and ranted, "You liar, you despicable cheat! How<br>could you? I trusted you, and you have been playing from<br>the ladies' tee all these years!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Two sides of the story<br>HER SIDE OF THE STORY<br>He was in an odd mood when I got to the bar, I thought it might have been my fault because I was a bit late but he didn't say anything much about it. I don't remember doing anything to make him upset but I could tell there was something wrong. The conversation was slow going so I thought we should go off somewhere more intimate so we could talk more privately.<br>We went to the restaurant and he was STILL acting a bit funny. I was getting really worried. What did I do? What was bothering him? Was he mad at me? I tried to cheer him up but it didn't seem to work. What was bothering him? Was it me or something else? I asked him if he was upset with me and he said no. But I wasn't really sure.<br>So anyway, in the cab on the way back to his house I said that I love him and he just put his arm around me and I didn't know what that meant because you know, he didn't say it back or anything.<br>We finally got back to his place and I was wondering if he was going to break up with me. Why didn't he want to talk about this? So I tried to ask him about it again and he just switched on the TV. Why would he rather watch TV than talk to me? Reluctantly, I said I was going to sleep hoping he would get the hint that I was upset and wanted to talk. I was SO hurt that he was out there watching TV while I was in here going through emotional turmoil.<br>Then after about 10 minutes, he joined me in bed, we had some great foreplay and then had sex. I thought that maybe he would open up after we shared such an intimate experience, but he still seemed really distracted.<br>So afterwards I just wanted to leave because I was so upset, but I just cried myself to sleep.<br>He didn't even notice how upset I was! I don't know, I just don't know what he thinks anymore. I don't know what to feel anymore. I'm on emotional overload. I'm so confused. I don't think he loves me anymore. Why does he have to play mind games with me? I mean do you think he's met someone else???<br>HIS SIDE OF THE STORY<br>...<br>...<br>...<br>Played badly today-shot 83---can't putt worth shit. Felt kinda tired.<br>Got laid though.</div>
