            <div class='col-md body'>Its opened only to all of Social, Associate and competitive members. As long as one of the couple is a members of "Pinstrikers". E.g Lets say we have a new Guy (Daniel) who joined "Pinstrikers" in whichever level of membership and not his girlfriend. So in order to join the "couple competition", he must have his girlfriend to team up with him. So Daniel is allow to get his girlfriend to bowl with him only for the "couple competition even if she is not a member of any sort. It is not opened to public.<br><br>Reference to Shadow question, I would propose the competition to be held the immediate following week at the end of the season. Then a week break before the "Pinstrikers championship" take place. The "Couple tag-Team Competition" is also a good way to end the season while both couple can interact and bowl together unlike normal days when the guys and gals bowled separately.<br><br>Regarding the prize money......As this is the first opening of the new "Couple tag-team Competition", I will be sponsoring a prize money of $100. How will the money be allocated to what kind of prizes should be discussed between the Prize Secretary and the treasurer. If Prize Secretary feel that $100 is not quite enough, then treasurer may collect more from the members as required. Its all in the hand of the Prize Secretary to decide if the treasurer need to collect more money.</div>

Jasmine doesn't bowl and I can't remember when was the last time Rick bowled. Do you seriously think Rick will pay ten dollars to join a competition like this?</div>

To help the games run smoothly, here's some rules and regulations:-<br><br><strong>PRIZE AWARD</strong><br><br>a.  Apart from Terence's generous contribution of $100, all participating couple (less Terence and Ivy) will contribute an additional $10 for the prizes.<br><br>b.  The top prize (A total value of $90) will be given to the couple with the highest total score.<br><br>c.  There will also be a prize (Value of $25) for the couple with the most number of consecutive spares.<br><br>d.  Tokens of $5 will be given to every couple who achieve a score of 180 pinfalls and above in one game.<br><br><strong>RULES &amp; REGULATIONS</strong><br><br>a. There will be a total of 2 games bowled each team. The gals will bowl first, with the guys doing the spare throw, and the reverse for the second game. There is also a warm up game before the actual event. This warm up game is shared within  the couple. (2 person shared one warm up game)<br><br>b.

To avoid distractions and disturbance to any bowlers, <strong>NO COACHING</strong> or <strong>guidance</strong> is allowed from the team members once the bowler step onto the bowling platform.<br><br>d. Code of Conduct is adherence at all times.<br><br>Last but not least, Thanks to all who has one way or another contributed in making the "Pinstrikers Couple tag team bowling tournment" a possible one.
