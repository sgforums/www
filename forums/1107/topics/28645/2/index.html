            <div class='col-md body'>Just wanna hear some feedback from you guys....<br><br>Though it is good to have a large pool of players which are committed to the team, i feel that to have 20 players coming down for every game is a bit too big a number. In the last game, we only had 3 subs and already most of us are confined to playing about 60 mins of the game. With 9 subs, on average every player would get only 1 half of the game. And this seems most likely the case as we now have a fully fit team apart from chester who is still out with injury. Moreover, we'll have another addition to the team tomorrow.<br><br>Obviously, what all of us want is to have fun playing these friendly games but if we have to rotate players too often during the course of the game, it would definitely take that "fun" away.<br><br>I'm not trying to sound too serious about this but like i said, we'd like to keep these sunday morning sessions fun and enjoyable.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your concern is noted.  Personally, I am comfortable with the figure number now but I dun see a need for any more addition that will be more than our current 19 or 20.<br><br>Basically, everyone will play at least  45 minutes which I think is a fair share of the game. I also believe that 45 minutes can be as fun for the players. Along the way, some will play more while some will play less, depending on the situation. In our team, not many can last the full 90 minutes EFFECTIVELY.  I have actually fixed the players for certain positions and they should rotate accordingly.  The arrangements are as follows:<br><br>1. Colin<br><br>Defence<br>2. Charles<br>3. Jeremy<br>4. Pat - right back (rotate with 6. Kelvin)<br>5. Ian - left back (rotate with 7. Alfred)<br><br>Midfield<br>8. Alvin Chua -right mid (rotate with 9. Alvin Ang)<br>10. Derrick - left mid (rotate with 11. Lawrence)<br>12. Myself - centre (rotate with 13.Damien)<br>14. Khairul - centre (rotate with 15. Jimmy)<br><br>Strikers<br>16. Russell (rotate with 17. Alvin Chia)<br>18. Robin (rotate with 19. Ah Boon)<br><br>20.  Chester shall cover centre defence when he comes back.<br><br>We are a friendly committed bunch and I see great things ahead of us.  For now, we have just started settling down and I dun see the need for too many changes. The fitness of many are still lacking and it's good to start picking up.  As for guest players like Bernard, "Chik Ping" etc, my stand is that they will only be GUEST players as of now.  Both Russ and Colin are aware of the situation and my stand has been put very clearly upfront.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, it seems that every1 is happy with the current arrangement  and i would also assume that we've made sure that all our players would be more than contented to play only 1 half of the game... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>btw, apart from chester any1 else would not be down for this sunday? i wld be bringing down a couple of my guys down as guest players, 1 of them is a keeper...</div>
