            <div class='col-md body'>Subject: Boycott KFC<br><br>KFC has been a part of our American traditions for many years. Many people, day in and day out, eat at KFC religiously. Do they really know what they are eating?<br><br>During a recent study of KFC done at the University of New Hampshire, they found some very upsetting facts. First of all, has anybody noticed that just recently the company has changed their name? Kentucky Fried Chicken has become KFC. Does anybody know why? We thought the real reason was because of the "FRIED" food issue. It's not. The reason why they call it KFC is because they can not use the word chicken anymore. Why? KFC does not use real chickens. They actually use genetically manipulated organisms.<br><br>These so called "chickens" are kept alive by tubes inserted into their bodies to pump blood and nutrients throughout their structure. They have no beaks, no feathers, and no feet. Their bone structure is dramatically shrunk to get more meat out of them. This is great for KFC because they do not have to pay so much for their production costs. There is no more plucking of the feathers or the removal of the beaks and feet.<br><br>The government has told them to change all of their menus so they do not say chicken anywhere. If you look closely you will notice this. Listen to their commercials, I guarantee you will not see or hear the word chicken. I find this matter to be very disturbing. I hope people will start to realize this and let other people know.<br><br>Please forward this message to as many people as you can. Together we make KFC start using real chicken again.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I received the Mrs Field's version.<br><br>THE $250 COOKIE RECIPE<br><br>Okay, everyone....a true story of justice in the good old U.S. of A. Thought y'all might enjoy this; if nothing else, it shows internet justice, if it can be called that.<br><br>My daughter &amp; I had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe in Dallas &amp; decided to have a small dessert. Because our family are such cookie lovers, we decided to try the "Neiman-Marcus Cookie." It was so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe and they said with a small frown, "I'm afraid not." Well, I said, would you let me buy the recipe? With a cute smile, she said, "Yes." I asked how much, and she responded, "Two fifty." I said with approval, just add it to my tab.<br><br>Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from Neiman-Marcus and it was $285.00. I looked again and I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom of the statement, it said, "Cookie Recipe - $250.00." Boy, was I upset!! I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress said it was "two fifty," and I did not realize she meant $250.00 for a cookie recipe. I asked them to take back the recipe and reduce my bill and they said they were sorry, but because all the recipes were this expensive so not just everyone could duplicate any of our bakery recipes....the bill would stand.<br><br>I waited, thinking of how I could get even or even try and get any of my money back. I just said, "Okay, you folks got my $250.00 and now I'm going to have $250.00 worth of fun." I told her that I was going to see to it that every cookie lover will have a $250.00 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus for nothing. She replied, "I wish you wouldn't do this." I said, "I'm sorry but this is the only way I feel I could get even," and I will.<br><br>So, here it is, and please pass it to someone else or run a few copies....I paid for it; now you can have it for free.<br><br>(Recipe may be halved.):<br>2 cups butter<br>2 tsp. soda<br>5 cups blended oatmeal**<br>2 cups brown sugar<br>1 8 oz. Hershey Bar (grated)<br>2 tsp. baking powder<br>2 tsp. vanilla 4 cups flour<br>2 cups sugar<br>24 oz. chocolate chips<br>1 tsp. salt<br>4 eggs<br>3 cups chopped nuts (your choice)<br><br>** measure oatmeal and blend in a blender to a fine powder.<br><br>Cream the butter and both sugars. Add eggs and vanilla; mix together with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking powder, and soda. Add chocolate chips, Hershey Bar and nuts. Roll into balls and place two inches apart on a cookie sheet. Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees. Makes 112 cookies.<br><br>Have fun!!! This is not a joke --- this is a true story.. That's it. Please, pass it along to everyone you know, single people, mailing lists, etc..... Ride free, citizen!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PLEASE MAKE A DIFFERENCE<br><br>The President of Procter &amp; gamble appeared on the Phil Donahue Show on March 1, 1994. He announced that due to the openness of our society, he was coming out of the closet about his association with the church of Satan. He stated that a large portion of his profits from Procter &amp; Gamble Products goes to support this satanic church. When asked by Donahue if stating this on t.v. would hurt his business, he replied, "THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH CHRISTIANS IN THE UNITED STATES TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE."<br><br>Product list includes:<br>Cleaning supplies: Bold, Cascade, Cheers, Joy, Comet, Dash, Spic &amp; Span, Tide, Top Job, Oxidol, Ivory Dreft, Gain, Mr. Clean, Lest Oil, Bounty Towels<br>Food: Duncan Hines, Fisher Nuts, Fisher Mints, Dehydrated Fruits<br>Coffee: Folgers, High Point,<br>Shortening Oils: Crisco, Puritan, Fluffo<br>Deodorants: Secret, Sure<br>Diapers: Luvs, Pampers<br>Hair Care: Lilt, Head &amp; Shoulders, Prell, Pert, Vidal Sassoon, Ivory<br>Acne Product: Clearasil<br>Mouthwash/Toothpaste: Scope, Crest, Gleam<br>Peanut Butter: JIF<br>Personal Hygiene: Always, Attend Undergarments<br>Lotions: Oil of Olay, Wondra<br>Soap: Camay, Coast, Ivory, Lava, Safeguard, Zest, Oil of Olay<br>Fabric Softener: Downy, Bounce<br>Citrus Punch: Sunny Delight<br>Medication: Aleve, Pepto-Bismol<br><br>If you are not sure about the product, look for a Procter &amp; Gamble written on the products, or the symbol of a ram's horn, which will appear on each product beginning on April. The ram's horn will form the 666, which is known as Satan's number. Christians should remember that if they purchase any of these products, they will be contributing to the church of Satan. Inform other Christians about this and STOP buying Procter &amp; Gamble Products. Let's show Procter &amp; Gamble that there are enough Christians to make a difference. On a previous Merv Griffin Show, the owner of Procter &amp; Gamble said that if Satan would prosper he would give his heart and soul to him.

            <div class='col-md body'>Subject: WARNING TO THE PUBLIC PHONES USERS IN ASIA!!!<br><br>According to a Singaporean Tan Kim Leng, recently many people were reported sick (diseases like Hepatitis B, Aids, etc.) after being poked by a needle, what happened is this. Some cruel, sickening people would place an infected needle or pin inside the little compartment of the public telephone where you get the return change, (the opening with a flipping metal door where you put your fingers in to get back your remaining coins after you used the public phone) and this is how you get in touch with the needle and you get infected. Many cases had been reported, I mean many severe cases. Quite a number of the employee of Singapore Telecom (those who went round to collect the coins in the public phones were infected too). As far as we know, it has not been announced publicly, but very soon they would. Just be more careful if you really need to use the public phones, you may use, but insert the exact amount, otherwise, just forego those changes, I'm sure your life worth much more than these. Remember to spread this piece of information to as many people as possible, especially to your children and the elderly at home or those who do not have a cellular phone.<br><br>By the way, Tan Kim Leng is heading the Jurong Branch Police Station in Singapore, if you watch the Singapore news tonight, you probably would have seen him on TV.<br><br>This is a true incident that happened in Jarkata &amp; Singapore discovered by a doctor. Sooner or later it will spread over the region including Hong Kong &amp; Taiwan as well. So, please be alert with public phones and beware of aids !!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Waterproof Sunscreen Warning<br><br>I wanted to tell you a story about a very serious thing. We still use sun screen on our whole family, but we are more cautious now. I tell you this only to make you more aware and use caution.<br><br>When Zack was 2 years old I put on the waterproof sun screen like I always had. I don't know how but he got some in his eyes. Most likely from his hands. It happens so easily at that age or any age really. He started screaming!! So I tried to flush it out with water. But guess what? Didn't matter...Remember *WATERPROOF.* So I just held him and let him cry, thinking the salty tears would flush it all out. But it got worse. I called the poison control center. They told me to RUSH Zack to ER NOW!! I was surprised. I got him there and they rushed me back without a second to spare. They started flushing his eyes out with special medications. Anyway, I found out for the first time that MANY kids each year lose their sight to waterproof sun screen. It burns the eye and they lose complete sight.!!! I was appalled. I could not believe the sun screen we use to help keep our kids safe from skin cancer can make them go blind!<br><br>Well I made a big stink about it. I wrote the sun screen company and they admitted to the problem but they said something to the fact that the seriousness of getting skin cancer is much worse then the chance of going blind. I think it's wrong if just one child goes blind! They should change ingredients or should at least have a huge warning on it. But they claim that if you put a huge warning on it then parents won't use it due to fear. I kind-of get that but there needs to be a change. We did this huge article in our big city and went on the news warning parents. Education along with the importance of using it. Well anyway Zack did go blind for 2 days, it was horrible. So please be careful!!! Don't stop using sun screen, just be very careful your children don't touch eyes for at least 15-20 minutes after you put it on!! And if your child does get it in his/her eyes then get to the emergency room at once!<br><br>***PASS THIS WARNING ON!!!***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Forwarded Message:<br>Subj: DON'T DELETE THIS!!! (it scared the crap outta me)<br><br>Once there was a a beautiful young girl who lived in a small town just south of Farmersburg. Her parents had to go to town for a while, so they left their daughter home alone, but protected by her dog, which was a very large collie. The parents told the girl to lock all the windows and doors after they had left. And at about 8:00pm the parents went to town. So doing what she was told the girl shut and locked evey window and every door. But there was one window in the basement that would not close completely.<br><br>Trying as best as she could she finally got the window shut, but it would not lock. So she left the window, and went back upstairs. But just to make sure that no one could get in, she put the dead-bolt lock on the basment door.<br><br>Then she sat down had some dinner and decided to go to sleep for the night. Settling down to sleep at about 12:00 she snuggled up with the dog and fell asleep.<br><br>But at one point, she suddenly woke up. She turned and looked at the clock...it was 2:30. She snuggled down again wondering what had woken her.....when she heard a noise. It was a dripping sound. She thought that she had left the water running, and now it was dripping into the drain of her sink. So thinking it was no big deal she decided to go back to sleep.<br><br>But she felt nervous so she reached her hand over the edge of her bed, and let the dog lick her hand for reasurance that he would protect her. Again at about 3:45 she woke up hearing drippping. She was slightly angry now but went back to sleep anyway. Again she reached down and let the dog lick her hand. Then she fell back to sleep.<br><br>At 6:52 the girl decided that she had had enough...she got up just in time to see her parents were pulling up to the house. "Good,"she thought. "Now somebody can fix the sink...'cause I know I didn't leave it running." She walked to the bathroom and there was the collie dog, skinned and hung up on the curtain rod. The noise she heard was its blood dripping into a puddle on the floor. The girl screamed and ran to her bedroom to get a weapon, incase someone was still in the house.....and there on the floor, next to her bed she saw a small note, written in blood, saying: HUMANS CAN LICK TOO MY BEAUTIFUL.<br><br>Now it is time for you to lock all the windows and doors. This letter is the only chain letter that is true. This did happen many years ago, and the man who killed the dog was never caught. If you delete this letter you will suffer the same fate as the girl in the story did, years after the door was killed. She was raped and killed in the same town and same house as the dog. Do not dismiss this letter, becaue if you do, a horrible thing will become of you, everyone will soon know your name. But only because it will be the headline of your local newspaper for a long time. It will read..Small Town Murder On The Loose! You can not chance your luck on a chain letter so serious as this. Give up your chance to send this letter to 23 people and you will be giving up your chance to live. You were warned. I hope that I will not see any murder stories in the papers anytime soon. And now I bid you a good day. And one more thing.... you only have 23 minutes.... sorry.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

This ring is well organized, well funded, has very skilled personnel, and is currently in most major cities and recently very active in New Orleans.<br><br>The crime begins when a business traveler goes to a lounge for a drink at the end of the work day.<br><br>A person in the bar walks up as they sit alone and offers to buy them a drink. The last thing the traveler remembers until they wake up in a hotel room bath tub, their body submerged to their neck in ice, is sipping that drink. There is a note taped to the wall instructing them not to move and to call 911. A phone is on a small table next to the bathtub for them to call.<br><br>The business traveler calls 911 who have become quite familiar with this crime.<br><br>The business traveler is instructed by the 911 operator to very slowly and carefully reach behind them and feel if there is a tube protruding from their lower back. The business traveler finds the tube and answers, "Yes." The 911 operator tells them to remain still, having already sent paramedics to help. The operator knows that both of the business traveler's kidneys have been harvested.<br><br>This is not a scam or out of a science fiction novel, it is real.<br><br>It is documented and confirmable.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Friends, Please take time to read all that is written here!!! This is for your info and please share this to all your friends with or without e-mail... Thank you and God bless...<br><br>DO YOU KNOW THAT BILL GATES' REAL NAME IS WILLIAM HENRY GATES III? HIS OFFICIAL REAL NAME NOW IS BILL GATES III. SO WHAT'S SO EERIE ABOUT THIS NAME? OK, IF YOU TAKE ALL THE LETTERS IN BILL GATES III AND THEN CONVERT IT IN ASCIII CODE (American Standard Code for Information and Interchange) AND THEN ADD UP ALL THE NUMBERS YOU WILL GET 666 WHICH IS THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST!!! SICK!!! COINCIDENCE HUH? NOPE. TAKE WINDOWS 95 AND DO THE SAME PROCEDURE AND YOU WILL GET 666, TOO! AND THE SAME GOES FOR MS-DOS 6.31!!! SICKO, RIGHT!!!<br><br>OK THAT'S THE FIRST PART. NOW FOR THE SECOND PART... FOR THOSE FELLOWS WHO STILL HAVE THE OLD EXCEL '95 (NOT OFFICE '97) TRY THIS OUT: 1. Open a new file; 2. Scroll down until you see row 95; 3. Click on the Row 95 button, this will highlight the whole row; 4. Press tab to move to the second column; 5. Now, move your mouse and click on help THEN about microsoft excel; 6. press ctrl-alt-shift and click on the tech support button simultaneously; 7. A WINDOW WILL APPEAR WITH TITLE : THE HALL OF TORTURED SOULS... This is eerie ... it has doom style format and you can walk around the hall ... and on the sides of the walls are the names of the tortured souls... 8. NOW WALK UP THE STAIRS AND COME BACK DOWN, FACE THE BLANK WALL AND THEN TYPE EXCELKFA... this will open the blank wall to reveal another secret passage, walk through the passage and do not fall off... when you get to the end you will see something really eerie.. At this point in time, countless witnesses all over the world have verified this point... it's really an eye-opener. It could be a joke by MS Programmers or is it really?<br><br>Wouldn't be surprised if Bill Gates is "The AntiChrist." After all, it was already foretold in the Bible that someone powerful would rise up and lead the world to destruction. Bill Gates definitely has that kind of power in his hands. More than 80% pf the world's computers run on Windows and Dos (including those at Pentagon!) If all his products have some kind of small program embedded (like the Hall of Tortured Souls) that can give him control, setting off nuclear arsenals, creating havoc in security systems, financial systems all over the world, etc... all from his headquarters isn't a far-off reality! Just using Internet Explorer may just allow him to map out what you have on your computer bit by bit each time you log on. perhaps the endtimes are near and this is just the tip of the iceberg!<br><br>"HE ALSO FORCED EVERYONE, SMALL AND GREAT, RICH AND POOR, FREE AND SLAVE, TO RECEIVE A MARK ON HIS RIGHT HAND OR ON HIS FOREHEAD, SO THAT NO ONE COULD BUY OR SELL UNLESS HE HAD THE MARK, WHICH IS THE NAME OF THE BEAST OR THE NUMBER OF HIS NAME. THIS CALLS FOR WISDOW. IF ANYONE HAS INSIGHT, LET HIM CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST, FOR IT IS MAN'S NUMBER. HIS NUMBER IS 666...." - Revelations 13: 16-18<br><br>This is an e-mail for us to think about... The Bible, in the Book of Revelations says, without the sign of the beast one would not be able to buy, sell, do business transactions, etc..... and... the question boggling us is whether Internet is now a necessity in doing business?? The Internet also bears the sign... Note that the internet is also commony known as the World Wide Web or WWW... One way to write WWW is V/ (VI) WWW V/ V/ V/ 666 Something to ponder upon, right? Isn't it that everything's going towards the Internet? Isn't it that Microsoft is always on the move to have monopoly when it comes to software technology? And now the Internet...<br><br>Revelations also say that the mark of the beast will be carried on one's hand and one's forehead... Of the Internet would indeed be the sign of the beast, aren't we all starting to carry it in our hands and foreheads??? Screens (foreheads) and mouse (hands)??? Are things finally falling into place or are we just letting our imagination run wild?? Remember, THE DEVIL CAME TO CHEAT, STEAL, AND TO DESTROY... SO BE VIGILANT!<br><br>About Bill Gates and Microsoft: Proof that Bill Gates is the devil: The real name of Bill Gates is William Henry Gates III. Nowadays, he is known as Bill Gates (III), where III means order of the third (3rd). In converting the letters of his current name to ASCII- VALUES: B - 66 I - 73 L - 76 L - 76 G - 71 A - 65 T - 84 E - 69 S - 83 I - 1 I - 1 I - 1 ----- 666 ---- THE NUMBER OF THE DEVIL....<br><br>We might ask, How did Bill Gates get so powerful??? Coincidence?? or... Is it the beginning of mankind's ultimate and total enslavement??? To agree or to disagree on the WWW or the beast is not the argument... What if WWW is 666 or Bill Gates the Beast? What will you do? Cancel subscriptions to the Internet? Resign from Microsoft? Set out a campaign against Bill Gates? Shut down all Windows 95 forever? It will not do you any good.... A Christian friend of mine had sent this to me and I feel the urge to share the same to all of you... I am not convincing anyone to believe whatever is written here... who am I to judge anyway? But let us all think about this and pray.... pray really hard for God's guidance and intervention... Never stop believing! God bless us all!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Date: Fri, 4 Aug 2000 01:59:13 EDT<br>Subject: Fwd: Harry Potter Books?<br><br>This is the most evil thing I have laid my eyes on in 10 years... and no one seems to understand its threat. The Harry Potter books are THE NUMBER ONE selling children's books in the nation today. Just look at any Barnes &amp; Noble or Waldenbook storefront. Go to Amazon.com and read the reviews. Hear the touting by educators and even Christian teachers about how "It's great to see the youth so eagerly embracing the reading experience!"<br><br>Harry Potter is the creation of a former UK English teacher who promotes witchcraft and Satanism. Harry is a 13 year old 'wizard.' Her creation openly blasphemes Jesus and God and promotes sorcery, seeking revenge upon anyone who upsets them by giving you examples (even the sources with authors and titles!) of spells, rituals, and demonic powers. It is the doorway for children to enter the Dark Side of evil.<br><br>I think the problem is that parents have not reviewed the material. The name seems harmless enough... Harry Potter. But that is where it all ends. Let me give you a few quotes from some of the influenced readers themselves:<br><br>"The Harry Potter books are cool, 'cause they teach you all about magic and how you can use it to control people and get revenge on your enemies," said Hartland, WI, 10-year-old Craig Nowell, a recent convert to the New Satanic Order Of The Black Circle. "I want to learn the Cruciatus Curse, to make my muggle science teacher suffer for giving me a D." [A 'muggle' is an unbeliever of magic.]<br><br>Or how about the REALLY young and innocent impressionable mind of a 6 year old when asked about her favorite character:<br><br>"Hermione is my favorite, because she's smart and has a kitty," said 6-year-old Jessica Lehman of Easley, SC. "Jesus died because He was weak and stupid."<br><br>And here is dear Ashley, a 9 year old, the typical average age reader of Harry Potter:<br><br>"I used to believe in what they taught us at Sunday School," said Ashley, conjuring up an ancient spell to summon Cerebus, the three-headed hound of hell. "But the Harry Potter books showed me that magic is real, something I can learn and use right now, and that the Bible is nothing but boring lies."<br><br>DOES THIS GET YOUR ATTENTION!! If not, how about a quote from a High Priest of Satanism:<br><br>"Harry is an absolute godsend to our cause," said High Priest Egan of the First Church Of Satan in Salem, MA. "An organization like ours thrives on new blood - no pun intended - and we've had more applicants than we can handle lately. And, of course, practically all of them are virgins, which is gravy." [Since 1995, open applicants to Satan worship has increased from around 100,000 to now... 14 MILLION children and young adults!]<br><br>It makes me physically ill, people! But, I think I can offer you an explanation of why this is happening. Children have been bombarded with action, adventure, thrills and scares to the point Hollywood can produce nothing new to give them the next 'high.' Parents have neglected to see what their children are reading and doing, and simply seem satisfied that 'Little Johnny is interested in reading.' AND... educators and the NEA are PUSHING this crap with NO WARNING as to the effects or the contents.<br><br>Still not convinced? I will leave you with something to let you make up your own mind. First the URL to read some background of what I have given you: http://theonion.com/onion3625/harry_potter.html ( Harry Potter Books Spark Rise In Satanism Among Children ) and finally, a quote from the author herself, J. K. Rowling, describing the objections of Christian reviewers to her writings: WARNING: THE FOLLOWING QUOTE CONTAINS HIGHLY GRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS OF A PORNOGRAPHIC NATURE AND SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED BY MINORS!<br><br>"I think it's absolute rubbish to protest children's books on the grounds that they are luring children to Satan," Rowling told a London Times reporter in a July 17 interview. "People should be praising them for that! These books guide children to an understanding that the weak, idiotic Son Of God is a living hoax who will be humiliated when the rain of fire comes, and will suck the greasy **** of the Dark Lord while we, his faithful servants, laugh and cavort in victory."<br><br>My hope is that you will see fit to become involved in getting the word out about this garbage. Please FWD to every pastor, teacher, and parent you know. This author has now published FOUR BOOKS in less than 2 years of this 'encyclopedia of Satanism' and is surely going to write more. I also ask all Christians to please pray for this lost woman's soul. Pray also for the Holy Spirit to work in the young minds of those who are reading this garbage that they may be delivered from its harm. Lastly, pray for all parents to grow closer to their children, and that a bond of sharing thoughts and spiritual intimacy will grow between them.<br><br>In service to the Lord Jesus, His honor and glory,<br>Roger Lynn<br><br>Col. 2:8 See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ.<br><br>2 Thess. 9-12 The coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie, that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This really takes the cake!<br><br>Subject: True Story<br><br>Here is a true story by Paul Harvey. Pass it to anyone who you think would find it interesting and inspiring. You will be surprised who this young man turned out to be. (Do not look at the bottom if this letter until you have read it fully)<br><br>Years ago a hardworking man took his family from New York State to Australia to take advantage of a work opportunity there. Part of this man's family was handsome young son who had aspirations of joining the circus as a trapeze artist or an actor. This young fellow, biding his time until a circus job or even one as a stagehand came along, worked at the local shipyards which bordered on the worse section of town.<br><br>Walking home from work one evening this young man was attacked by five thugs who wanted to rob him. Instead of just giving up his money the young fellow resisted. However they bested him easily and proceeded to beat him to a pulp. They mashed his face with their boots, and kicked and beat his body brutally with clubs, leaving him for dead. When the police happened to find him lying in the road they assumed he was dead and called for the Morgue Wagon.<br><br>On the way to the morgue a policeman heard him gasp for air, and they immediately took him to the emergency unit at the hospital. When he was placed on a gurney a nurse remarked to her horror, that his young man no longer had a face. Each eye socket was smashed, his skull, legs, and arms fractured, his nose literally hanging from his face, all is teeth were gone, and his jaw was almost completely torn from his skull. Although his life was spared he spent over year in the hospital. When he finally left his body may have healed but his face was disgusting to look at. He was no longer the handsome youth that everyone admired.<br><br>When the young man started to look for work again he was turned down by everyone just on account of the way he looked. One potential employer suggested to him that he join the freak show at the circus as The Man Who Had No Face. And he did this for a while. He was still rejected by everyone and no one wanted to be seen in his company. He had thoughts of suicide. This went on for five years.<br><br>One day he passed a church and sought some solace there. Entering the church he encountered a priest who had saw him sobbing while kneeling in a pew. The priest took pity on him and took him to the rectory where they talked at length. The priest was impressed with him to such a degree that he said that he would do everything possible for him that could be done to restore his dignity and life, if the young man would promise to be the best Catholic he could be, and trust in God's mercy to free him from his torturous life.<br><br>The young man went to Mass and communion every day, and after thanking God for saving his life, asked God to only give him peace of mind and the grace to be the best man he could ever be in His eyes.<br><br>The priest, through his personal contacts was able to secure the services of the best plastic surgeon in Australia. They would be no cost to the young man, as the doctor was the priest's best friend. The doctor too was so impressed by the young man, whose outlook now on life, even though he had experienced the worse was filled with good humor and love.<br><br>The surgery was a miraculous success. All the best dental work was also done for him. The young man became everything he promised God he would be. He was also blessed with a wonderful, beautiful wife, and many children, and success in an industry which would have been the furthest thing from his mind as a career if not for the goodness of God and the love of the people who cared for him. This he acknowledges publicly.<br><br>The young man. Mel Gibson.<br><br>His life was the inspiration for his production of the movie "The Man Without A Face." He is to be admired by all of us as a God fearing man, a political conservative, and an example to all as a true man of courage.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
