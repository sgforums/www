            <div class='col-md body'>We signed up with Cyberheart IT Online, they claim to be a BusinessTrust and Trustsg Company, for web hosting (from January 2006 until January 2007).<br><br>During the year we had 3 main problems as follows;<br>1. We were unable to log in via web mail and each time we asked Cyberheart on this the reply is not to use web mail as it is unstable despite us telling them that we travel often and need the service which is included in the hosting plan.<br><br>2. When we logged into our web control panel to perform administration, we received messages saying that another user was logged into the system.  We asked Cyberheart about this but received no reply or no solution.<br><br>3. We initiated a transfer to another Hosting company on the 20th of December 2006.  Cyberheart replied to my email with explanation of what issues they had and I should move to their new server. We refused and asked Cyberheart to transfer.<br><br>Cyberheart asked for DNS numbers after we sent repeated emails to ask them the status but delayed the transfer and withheld the correct EPP key until one of my domains expired on the 07/01/2007.<br><br>My new hosting company in the US advises me to renew my domain with Cyberheart so that we can continue with the transfer as they cannot do anything until Cyberheart provides the correct Authentication key. We suffered with our websites down and emails not working.<br><br>We asked registrar WEB COMMERCE COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED DBA WEBNIC.CC (ICANN registrar that Cyberheart works with) to intervene and only after did Cyberheart reply on the 10/01/2007 that we had outstanding invoice and Cyberheart will not provide the EPP key until we paid. We asked for the invoice to affect the payment and Cyberheart did not reply until the second reminder email today (11/01/2007). In the email (with no invoice) Cyberheart asked for $129.00 per domain name renewed which totals $258.00.  The initial quoted amount was $18.00 per domain registration.<br><br>On the 15th January 2007, we received an email from Cyberheart to say we owe them S$396 as we did not terminate our hosting with them.<br>This is our reply" We have terminated our hosting and domain registration on 21st<br>&gt; December 2006<br>&gt; for xxxx.com and on the 1st of January for xxxx.com.  YOU<br>&gt; terminated<br>&gt; web hosting for xxxx.com, xxxx.com and xxxx.com (Not even<br>&gt; your<br>&gt; server and you have the audacity to say you are hosting) on the<br>&gt; 07/01/2007,<br>&gt; all three websites were pointing to a travel site then.  You even<br>&gt; sent me 2<br>&gt; emails asking me to reconsider terminating our hosting with you as<br>&gt; all the<br>&gt; issues we had can be resolved with a transfer to a new server -<br>&gt; maybe this<br>&gt; will jog your selective memory."<br><br>On 17/01/07, Cyberheart sent this email<br>" Our of goodwill we had updated the dns.<br>We will cancel the hosting.<br>Since you are no longer our reseller, the renewal fee for the domain name is $30. Total $60.00.<br><br>Please complete payment within 7 days.<br>This is the final reminder, due to non-payment, we will take possession of the domain names."<br><br>Please complete payment within 7 days.<br>This is the final reminder, due to non-payment, we will take possession of the domain names."<br><br>Our reply " We are the registrant and administrator of the domains, we bought hosting services from Cyberheart, Cyberheart should take our instructions to change DNS and provide EPP code when we request, how can you do it out of goodwill? Goodwill is when you are performing services for free and this is not free.<br><br>We will pay the S$60.00 out of goodwill (yes, we can use this because you refused to transfer until expiry forcing us to renew with you) but we need an invoice first.  We are a company and require an invoice to pay. If you choose not to provide an invoice thus causing non-payment and than choose to take possession of the domain names you can expect we will be taking legal action against you."<br><br>Today, 18/01/2007, Cyberheart sent an email"We are waiting for you payment before the issue of invoice.<br>You have 6 days left."<br><br>Our reply" What part don't you understand - I need the invoice to pay.  What is so difficult to send me an invoice like what you use to do in an email? You are clearly making things difficult.<br><br>I cannot pay without an invoice, I am not in charge of the Singapore ops anymore, I am not in Singapore and I cannot ask accounts to pay without an invoice.<br><br>I need an invoice to pay.  You send me an invoice and get this over with.<br><br>Send invoice by email to me."<br><br>While typing this more has arrived. Cyberheart reply"<br>Hello,<br>What part don't you understand - you need to pay, then we issue the invoice.  What is so difficult to make payment then receiving the invoice like what you did before? You are clearly making things difficult.<br><br>I am not in Singapore and I cannot generate an invoice now."<br><br>Our reply"You have access to email but cannot issue an invoice?<br>We paid the first transaction without invoice because I was in Singapore, now I am not, you issued a receipt grudging after this transaction, remember? Lena, you colleague issued an invoice for xxxxxx.com for the second transaction and we paid.<br><br>An invoice is issued before payment and a receipt is issued after payment is received.<br><br>Issue us an invoice and we will pay immediately."<br><br>We are still waiting for Cyberheart's invoice.  It appears we are not the only one complaining see http://forum.powweb.com/showthread.php?t=33846<br>http://www.sgwebhostingtalk.com/archive/index.php/t-925.html<br><br>We tried to contact CommerceNet about this Business Trust company and IDA but they have not replied.<br><br>I hope others will not suffer like we did.<br><br>Will post more when it is available, hopefully we can receive the invoice and move on.<br><br></div>
