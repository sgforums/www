            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gasband:</div><div class="quote_body">aiyah giving birth is such a general term. Does giving birth entails only something poping out from your reproductive organs? I think giving birth should be term as reproduction. Plants reproduce too just that they dun pop out from somewhere on them but thru seeds. does that make them any lesser than animals? Its either u eat everything or u eat nothing. There shld be no double standards. And to those vegans eating veggies, ONE MORE TIME U ALL EAT MY little green PATRICK, I gonna start a movement against the cruelty against vegetable life. Vegans, You cruel people.</div></blockquote>ok then I give you a better definition of "giving birth". Giving Birth means pain, blood, sweat. What entails giving birth is years of nurturing, the bond between a mother and kid. This does not occur in the human race only. All animals go thru this. This is a fact. You dun give me all those "how I know plant give birth dun have blood, sweat and pain." The FACT is I dun see a plant cry when I pluck out another plant which was grown out from its seed. But I have seen animals crying when they are being drag to slaugtherhouse or their kid being taken away.</div>

The fact is that what you DO NOT see doesnt mean it doesnt exist. You dun see oxygen but it exists isnt it? Thus, using what you see to determine that you shld become a vegan is too ridiculous. NOT ALL animals nurture their young. Some leave them as soon as they have given birth. For your information, it is widely known research that other than dolphins, all other animals have sex just to reproduce not that we humans who have sex for amongst many reasons, that is to form a family and community. Animals have no sense of family hood, one female can have sex with any and many males to just reproduce. So whats the big deal abt that?</div>
