            <div class='col-md body'>Shinn killed Todaka, the admiral who sent him to PLANT. Though he never found out who he killed, i am indeed disturbed by him. THe main character of GSD is nothing but a belligerent, brutal, indifferent and naive murderer. I feel like beating him up right now. Here i list the hedious crimes he committed:<br><br>1. He lambasted Representative Athha " YOU don't know anything", as if he knows everything. Now, consider what Cagalli had gone through in the last war, Shinn's experience as a new pilot is nothing. Cagalli is by no means the most competent leader, but in front of shinn, she has the authority to give her comments and thoughts. Shinn's naive insistance that his family's death is due to Athha's ambitions made no sense at all. THE ideals of Athha family is sacred and shinn has absolutely no right to comment on that.<br><br>2. He is nothing but a brutal killer. Look at how he executed his enemies, he always opted for the most gruesome tactics. He ensures no survival of his enemies. That means he is just a freak who is fond of massacre.<br><br>3.He killed Admiral Todaka, an honourable man who died for his country with pride, not to mention that Todaka once saved Shinn from the turmoil of the war and send him to PLANT. Without him shinn would never be that one he is now. Yet he is full of hatred towards his native country ORB, and seems to enjoy slaughtering ORB's military.<br><br>4. Most disturbingly, he fired at Cagalli's strike rouge in an attempt to kill her. If kira had not been able to protect his beloved sister, cagalli would have died.Shinn aroused much fury in gundam seed fans in endangering the life of one of the most popular characters' life without convincing reasons.<br><br>Overall, by now i absolutely loath SHINN ASUKA. Apart from his annoying personality he is already a murderer. I cannot keep watching GSD with his evil presence in it.</div>

If u look at world war 2.. the same goes for japan. it is like tat de.<br>the things u stated here is not wrong.. but u must understand Shin.. unlike us dun have the previleage of seeing the full picture or story. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>cheer up dude~ aniem is meant to be fun and nice to see de.<br><br>if u noticed, most anime main's character is seldom older than 17. If u think of it logically it make no sense too~ when u are 17, one dun expect u to make decisions which an older fellow with more experience can make.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well...just saw a forumite from other forum express his views which kinda making sense......well here it is...<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Shinn is a hurt kid, he puts on an outer shell to look tough and strong. He wants to become godly powerful so he can stop his own pain and the pain of others around him. When you sit and watch how he acts he seems like a complete and utter jerk, with no back story you'd probably be right, but with the back story he's the complete and utter reverse.<br><br>In the more recent episodes involving Rey and Stellar you see Shinn's true personality comming through, he's really a sweet guy, he wants to look after those weaker then himself but at the same time knows he's too weak to do it. So he wants to get stronger as mentioned above.<br><br>The only problem with Shinn is when he lets his pain "take him over". He becomes so bitter and hateful that he outright thinks everyone else is scum and below him. Only he knows best and only he can see the "right path". Simply put he was left on his own and doesn't see others understanding him. They miss some "obvious fact" in his opinion.<br><br>A good example of this is with Athrun slapping Shinn. Shinn knew them people would just be exploited again and so went and "solved" the problem. To him "A means is just a way to get to an end". If he has to kill someone to save someone he cares for them he's happy to do it because to him people dying is just how life goes. Athrun has the opposit view to Shinn "Fix the problem without hurting anyone if you can".<br><br>Since all we've seen in SEED is the later view when Shinn came along he clashed with pretty much everyone except Rey. If you watch episode 20 and how Shinn is you can see he suddenly changes as he goes to ZAFT, he put up all his barriers and started to force himself to "be the best".<br><br>Shinn is much like Duo in a way (I figure he's the best example), he's willing to become death it's self if he can use it to save others.<br><br>This post is quite messy and hard to explain which sucks.. I'll try and think of a way to rewrite it and explain it later because I'm not happy with it at all and can't find the words to express how Shinn is feeling even though I know the exact thing :/<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i dunno but i think we must empathize with Shinn as he watched his whole family get killed in a war.Being a soldier,if i personally witness it,i will definately lose all senses in battle, knowing i have the power to destroy the ones that killed my family.<br><br>Shinn have no idea that Colonel Todaka [or something like tat] was in the flag ship,so can't blame him for it can we?<br><br>However, my personal feel is Cagalli is a incompetent leader,she have no charisma to lead her pple,no will power, weak and meek. Being a strong iinfluencial al leader you must not succrumb to pressure,and yet she did.what she's capable of is only shedding tears,thinking only her father's ideals.inflexible and demanding.<br><br>and yes,we must all remember that the characters are only kids.Cagalli is only a mere 18?if i remember correctly,there fore we must know that leading a state at the age of 18 is no small matter.<br><br>the moment that really affected me was when the golden Zaku was destroyed.the Faith pilot[forgot his name also,hahaa] was such a guy and i thought he would be the one changing the whole script.<br><br>another point is that this show is to educate children,but in my point of view kids would most likely find this show cool because of the massive fight scenes with giantic robots.i myself get lost at times in between the shows sometimes.kids wouldn't really understand the deeper meaning of this show.<br><br>last but not least, i would like to add that i only watched Destiny and not Gundam Seed  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">   so please correct me if i'm wrong anywhere ya?</div>
