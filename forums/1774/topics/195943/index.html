Although he expresses indifference towards the break up, he's quite torn up inside.<br>On his regular commute to work, he catches a glimpse of an attractive high school girl on the train. Reflexively, he tries to ignore her, but ends up helping her because she drops her train pass as she gets off of the train.<br><br>Later that evening, he returns home, where he lives with his father.<br>His father reveals to him that Koushirou's younger sister will start living with them tomorrow.<br>By living with them, it would cut down on her commute time to the high school that she's going to attend.<br></strong><br><br>Extract from <a href="http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/2005/07/feature/01.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/2005/07/feature/01.php</a><br><br><img src="http://www.hillcity-comics.com/anime/koi_kaze_03.jpg"></div>
