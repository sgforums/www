            <div class='col-md body'>After reading this at CS.net forum.<br><br>It just hit me.<br><br>------------------------<br><br>Im sick of reading the posts, the posts that say, "I wish it was the old way." You know what? I played cs when it first came out untill now. Every version has been great and continues to get better. Maybe things change that make the gameplay different, but thats what keeps it fun. Learning the weapons over again and building skill. Thats whats fun about cs, building your skill. The people who can just go through and dominate everybody eventually get bored of it, but when you get something new, like 6.5. You have to work again to get back to the top. Only complaint I have, is the new netcode is to easy. I used to have to work to kill people with 40 ping on my little old 56 k, now people just die. I can be shooting someone, then stop. Half a second later it says I killed them without firing a bullet. hmm.. Anyways, I think I can get over that.<br>I remember when cs didnt even have a silancer on the usp or colt, no scope or anything. It was awesome too, made the coolest noise. I remember when the machine gun cost 8k and it was absouletely flawless. When you had to buy body armor everyround cus it disappeared after each round. When the only map people liked was siege, and there was only one way in. And It was fun, you know why. Cause no one bitched like you guys do. SO shut up and play, if ya dont like it. Dont tell us about it, because we couldnt give two sh*ts.<br><br>By-Choded<br><br>--------------------<br><br>I think if I really continue to play 6.2, I would really get bored with it.<br><br>Afterall, I really feel I have master the game and could top frag 90% most the time in every game I play.<br><br>I think 6.5 gives us a really big challenge again. To train up and learn new things.<br><br>This just hit me after reading the message by Choded.<br><br>Well, thats what I think now.<br><br></div>
