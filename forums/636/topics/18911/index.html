            <div class='col-md body'>I want LCPL Avery to be out of MC right from this moment.<br><br>I want snowfest back as I respect him for his tactical style during battle.<br><br>Avery has screwed things up more than once.<br>First, he left the squad but wanted to come back after some time. This we forgive him.<br><br>Second, our defeat to RIP was partially thanks to Avery effort as NO ONE in MC can play properly at Netshock, which wasn't even our home base and whole match was arranged by him again. His awesome intelligence has failed to think for all the MC members whether that they can perform at Netshock. This I forgive. Yet after the match, he had speak ignorantly despite his great mental ability in the forum and caused us great trouble in the gaming community and has once again deprive MC of the reputation we have been upholding. We could have the advantage of playing at our homeground but he choose netshock just because of his one man's idealogy. MC once again was seen as dumb enough to insist fighting on a battleground which we all are not even familiar to it. However, just let this issue close as I don't want another arguement with RIP. They are good and I will respect them. I respect MC too but I think we shall not shift our responsiblity to others. After much consideration, losing is not that the enemy is great, it is because we're lousy. We're too individualistic and our actions have never been in unity. I know we have improve a lot as a team since our last defeat but there is still more to go.<br><br>Thirdly, he had speaked with such arrogancy in IRC and has greatly affected our reputation. This can be varified by some MC members. MC has been complained by many other men of honour as being too complacent and way too arrogant. Now may I question, who had created this image for us all?<br>This, I shall not go on further for you all shall use your intelligence to figure.<br><br>Fourthly, Avery is also a SS clan member and had initialised an alliance with SS without permission from the council. Even I, a Captain has no ability to decide an alliance without permission from the MC council.<br><br>Lastly, now he made proposal by himself that Snowfest is to explain to him for what he had done. In his cause of action, he had caused the lost of a good comrade. Pardon me, but even in the Army, NO PRIVATE NEEDS TO REPORT TO A LANCE COPORAL. Only recruits does.<br><br>Conflicts has been created by Avery times and again, now we lost one invalueable man due to one man's irresponsiblity and thus LCPL Avery has violated our code of conduct, rule number 6, line 1.<br><br>MC code of conduct,<br><br><strong><br>VI<br>I will never forget that I am a fighting man, responsible for my actions, and dedicated to the principles which made my nation free.<br>I will trust in my comrades, God and in the Mirage Corps.<br></strong><br><br>LCPL Avery has violated his soldier's creed,<br>paragraph 4, line 1.<br><br><strong><br>I am proud of myself and my mates.  I will try to make the people of this cause proud of the service I represent, for I am a Mirage Corps Soldier.<br></strong><br><br>I too scold people when I am not happy, so that means I should go too right? Should that be so, I will tender my resignation right at this moment.<br><br>Your's sincerely,<br>Tango.<br><br>[This message has been edited by tango (edited 21 May 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gosh Tango, I really feel bad about this. I do appreciate your support but I dun want to be of any trouble to the clan. I am still very new to the clan and Avery is much more senior, I do hope that this matter will not affect the clan as this is between me and him. I quit is because I dun wish to spoil MC reputation. I think what Avery said is right, I should not scold pple. I do have a short temper so I can't help it. As for camping, I dun deny it, but I am a thinker so I do plan my moves, I am not such a good player really but I put myself at an advantage by my planning. I do not camp until times out though, and I will only cheong if it requires me to. It will be stupid to cheong when u know u are at a disadvantage. Thats all I have to say, Bye!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorries one more point i dun understand Thirdly, he had speaked with such arrogancy in IRC and has greatly affected our reputation. This can be varified by some MC members. MC has been complained by many other men of honour as being too complacent and way too arrogant. Now may I question, who had created this image for us all?<br><br>IRC did i do that if really i would liek to know who did i offence or who say one cause i dun think i have offence any1 in IRC.<br><br>If i really have pls tell me not to defend for it.<br><br>thks for the understanding<br>I realise that i will not be MC again any more but i hope we still be friend like usually and will help in any clan match immediately u ask for me if i have no appointment on that day or times. All i hope it MC will let me play as a friend name.<br><br>Sincerely Avery<br><br></div>
