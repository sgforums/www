Think of how u 1st got to know these group of brothers and sisters, how much we had went through together.<br><br>Actually, can u guys tell me what do u expect after u join MC? Being competitve and just treat others as a clan-mate? or like me, treat everyone like a brother or sister, ppl who we can share our pains and joys. U guys are the closest friends I have currently. Friends do quarrel sometimes, but is it worth leaving behind friends whom u have known for so long, your "brother" ?<br><br>Ken and Derek, I hope u 2 can just sit down and talk about things, I dun know the main reason for the quarrel, but after U have read the 1st paragraph, I hope it has changed your perspective of each other. Life has ups and downs, same goes to having friends, u can laugh together, and may have quarrels sometimes.<br><br>Tarepanda, Sky, Kfc, Dead Duck, Mephosis, I hope u guys can consider wat I had said, before u guys follow eurofunk and disfunk on a "all quit" mission. I do not think there's a need to rearrange the teams, u guys can still still together and bring s.B!? to higher heights. If there's a need, u guys can recruit 1 or 2 guys to strengthen your team.<br><br>This applies for all, next time before u tell me u wanna quit MC, I hope u can do wat I had said in paragraph 1, and if u have done that, and u feel its not possible to stay, I will let u leave.<br><br>------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ever noticed how a minute can seem so long?<br>How it stands still when times are so wrong.<br>Ever noticed how a minute can go so fast?<br>In good times when you wish they would last.<br>Ever notice how dark the skies can really be?<br>On those nights when your feeling a little lonely.<br>Ever notice how bright the skies can seem?<br>When your not afraid to let yourself dream.<br>Ever notice how love can break your heart?<br>Moving in completely and ripping it apart.<br>Ever notice how love can also set you free?<br>Opening your eyes so you can see eternity.<br>Ever notice how time can stand still?<br>Haunting your mind and weakening your will.<br>Ever notice how time can pass right by?<br>Taking precious moments in a blink of an eye.<br>Ever notice how life can be so unfair?<br>Leaving pain and sorrows without even a care.<br>Ever notice how life can be so sweet?<br>Pieces coming together making us so complete.<br>Ever notice when you love someone to much?<br>Closer you try to get the further your out of touch.<br>Ever notice when you love someone with all<br>Makes everything else seems so small.<br>For I have taken notice of all these things you see<br>Because of all this love you have given to me.</span><br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">-=MC=-N|rVaNa<br>Don't you dare move into my crosshair....</span></strong><br><br>[This message has been edited by -=MC=-N|rVaNa (edited 24 May 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The thing is tat i have treated all MC as brothers and sisters. But a pact we have made is a pact we have made.<br><br>We promised to fight together, to quit, quit togetheer. Im really upset tat kenneth quitted without even discussing things with me.<br><br>If i were to quit, kfc and sky would follow no matter wat. I have informed them of euro's situation, they are ready to accept my final decision whether to stay or not. As for ducky, im not sure...im unable to get him...as he's really bz with his preparations for 'A's.<br><br>Firstly....quitting is not on my mind rite now. All i hope is tat Kenneth comes back to MC. I dun wan to face the idea of quitting since...i really do love MC very much.<br>Even when there are other clans out there waiting to get me to join them, coz they heard news of my unsettled situation here. But still, first and foremost, MC is my very choice for now...unless Kenneth refuse to come back, then i have no choice.<br>Right now, when i do play outside...im really uncertain whether i still wan to use MC tag...but in the end i still use it, coz im still proud to be of MC and will always be.<br><br>Most important thing is tat i want Kenneth to come back to lead s.B.<br>Secondly, hope no reshuffling of s.B, no authorized addition/removal of any member.<br>Lastly, i want people to stop stereotyping s.B. We have not done anything to offend anyone, or to be biased to anyone. We have never said "we the most pro in MC", or "elite MC members" or watever shit.<br><br>On behalf of s.B, i admit we are really at the moment very busy and unable to contribute to the clan right now. But tat doesnt mean our loyalty has wavered or passion has declined for our clan esprit de corp.<br><br>Im still waiting for good news.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah...totally agree wif u all...i think quitting is not the solution...it's escaping from the solution. CS is just a game...whether like nirvana said ...to treat it competitively or treat each others like official-clanmates or not...still...it is CS that brought all of us together. It is because all of us share one same interest and one same goal that brought forth the closenest in us.<br><br>Still like to say...if Ken leave it'll be a shame that no one can replace such a good leader/friend/player and brother. Hopefully ken if u are seeing this please reconsider and come back to MC.<br><br>------------------<br><strong>CrazyCow[T] | -=MC=-Depeche-/RaGe/-</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wad the hell is wif these ? For such a thing the whole MC has to be questioned? OMG...... wad if someone tries a major break between 2 team? wad happen? man.....guys face it, such things juz have to be calm abt it. NO such things as "my rage goes beyond those 2 yrs friendsship" Well.... friends....as they are ..are ur treasures....its onli how u treat them.... even if someone takes u for granted , tell them straight tat u dun like it and wishes him to change his altitude.... He's sure to change ...unless he's really having altitude problems...then i have nothing to say. BUT now the situation ahve been so badly savaged...tat DA WHOLE mC IS UNDER questioned....u fink its worth it? ANd derek... u are a leader...( i heck care if u quit or not....i still take u as a leader) U should try to control ur temper...Dun u know tat ur Anger does badly affect our MC....and for tat sake of Anger u turn on ppl...( no offence , juz a piece of of mind ) Hmm...maybe u should talk it out...and remember ur actions affect MC badly</div>
