            <div class='col-md body'>Why don't you guys take comment with a pinch of salt?<br><br>My picture of MC is where we are all friends with the same interest, CS that is.<br><br>David, I am not flaming you but just stating my point. You saying why the point in getting a homebase, a sponsorship, teams and clanmatches. Is it very fun to go Mechmaster frag ah bengs? Well, no to me. It is much more fun getting together as a team and winning the opposition as a team.<br><br>Sponsorship, who would mind having not to pay at Lanshops?<br><br>I understand the current MC wants to be one of the best 'clans' around but is training together once a week sufficient to make us the best team around? Think about it. If you want to be the best, you have to do it thru actions with 100% effort and not just 50% or lesser.<br><br>For myself, I play CS more for fun than competitive playing but that does not make me not want to compete, who like to lose?<br><br>If MC is build together purely because of Counter-Strike, we will never last long.<br><br>If MC is build together because of our interests and friendship, I am sure MC will last for ages.<br><br>Think about it which MC you guys prefer.<br><br>If you guys want a pro-MC 'clan, I do hope people will know when to get 'serious' and when to 'joke' around.<br><br>Derek:<br>Nothing particular against you but seriously, you need to polish up your temper. Yeah, I know you got bad temper but think about it, if it is for the better, why not build up your tolerance?<br><br>Just another thought, why MC is still one of the oldest Counter-Strike clan around? Think about it. What was it built upon?<br><br>If my post is offensive to anyone, I hereby apologize before hand, I know I sux so you can ignore what I said too =).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can tell u guys, if MC is built solely on being just a cs clan, would u have stayed so long? U want a to join a competitive clan, go join those no-life ppl, play cs everyday, and all u do is cs. Nothing else. Would u even talk so much, would u even care whehter one member has quit? Go find someone more pro than him then. Would u rather join a clan like this?<br><br>And I never ever begged or pau lan pa to be a leader of MC. Even when derek 1st told me he wanted to step down as leader, I never ever told him I wanted to take the post of such responsibility. I even discouraged him from that. But he feels I should lead, then fine, I take up the responsibility, if anyone of you guys think I am not up to the job, then fine, tell me abt it, and I will step down.<br><br>Being a leader is not easy, who do u think holds the heaviest responsibility when we lose a match? Who do u think must be able to make every single MC member happy, when u urself know its impossible. I try to be fair to everyone, but ask urself that qn, are u able to?<br><br>Yes, I agree on Tango, and I believe having a friends clan is much more impt than being just competitive, where everyone just cares abt themselve. And on a final note, if anyone of u thinks that u are bigger and more impt than the clan, pls leave, I dun encourage egoists in the clan. Nobody wins a match by themself. Without your teammates damaging or taking the damage for you, do u think u can get the frags? Learn to respect others.<br><br>Some of the things I said may not be related to the stuffs talked about in this topic. But just some things I hope every single MC member would bear in mind during your stay in MC. And I am not pin-pointing anyone in this post, just for everyone to know.<br><br>------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ever noticed how a minute can seem so long?<br>How it stands still when times are so wrong.<br>Ever noticed how a minute can go so fast?<br>In good times when you wish they would last.<br>Ever notice how dark the skies can really be?<br>On those nights when your feeling a little lonely.<br>Ever notice how bright the skies can seem?<br>When your not afraid to let yourself dream.<br>Ever notice how love can break your heart?<br>Moving in completely and ripping it apart.<br>Ever notice how love can also set you free?<br>Opening your eyes so you can see eternity.<br>Ever notice how time can stand still?<br>Haunting your mind and weakening your will.<br>Ever notice how time can pass right by?<br>Taking precious moments in a blink of an eye.<br>Ever notice how life can be so unfair?<br>Leaving pain and sorrows without even a care.<br>Ever notice how life can be so sweet?<br>Pieces coming together making us so complete.<br>Ever notice when you love someone to much?<br>Closer you try to get the further your out of touch.<br>Ever notice when you love someone with all<br>Makes everything else seems so small.<br>For I have taken notice of all these things you see<br>Because of all this love you have given to me.</span><br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">-=MC=-N|rVaNa<br>Don't you dare move into my crosshair....</span></strong><br><br>[This message has been edited by -=MC=-N|rVaNa (edited 27 May 2001).]</div>
