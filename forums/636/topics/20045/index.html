No, really.  An incandescent,<br>feathery white-winged, ten-foot-tall angel.  Don't ask *me* how<br>it got there.  I don't even go to Mass.  I left the Church when I<br>was twelve.  In any case, no nun I ever talked to mentioned the<br>possibility of vaguely-gendered, stark naked, holy visitations.<br>Not even the saints got naked angels.<br><br>What did I do?  What would any sane person do in that<br>situation?  I don't know.  I shut the bedroom door, scant moments<br>after the cat fled, squealing as if all the legions of hell were<br>after it.  Perhaps the Inquisitors had been right about black<br>cats.  I leaned against the door, and waited.  Then it beckoned.<br><br>It was definitely an "it."  When it wasn't definitely a<br>"he," or a "she."  Have you ever on a melting August afternoon<br>ignored your mom's yells to open the fridge door and just stand<br>there, basking in the tingle?  The angel, it glowed.  Only it<br>glowed heat so hot it froze you -- or maybe it was cold so cold<br>it burned.<br><br>I stepped over to the bed, noticing the sheets weren't on<br>fire, or covered in ice.  Just me.  The angel never said a word,<br>although later I would have sworn it was singing hallelujahs the<br>whole time.  My roommate never heard a thing.  The angel drew me<br>down to her breasts, the long white feathers dissolving into<br>rose-pink skin.  No pores.  Nipples hard as the proverbial rocks.<br><br>Later, when my clothes had gone to never-never-land with a<br>brush of angel wings (they never did come back), I brushed my<br>nipples against hers, only to find the feathers had come back.<br>It wasn't until I sat, impaled, that I noticed he had pointed<br>teeth.<br><br>The roommate didn't even hear my screams, as I rode the<br>angel's hard body, locked in an embrace of biting teeth and<br>engulfing wings.  I don't know what angel semen does to human<br>flesh -- the angel shifted right after my orgasm, gone out of me<br>as if it had never been there at all.  The breasts reappeared and<br>disappeared at will.  The wings never changed, though.<br><br>Tired, I struggled not to fall asleep, and it grinned its<br>first grin as I watched it slowly dissolve into a tacky plastic<br>crucifix on a blue-bead rosary.  Then the rosary dissolved too.<br><br>You figure out why it came.  Maybe it fell in love, or it's<br>a new kind of ad campaign, or I'm going crazy, or Lucifer's gonna<br>approach me with a real sweet deal and all the angel slaves I<br>want thrown into the bargain.  Me, I have to go to work in the<br>morning, and if it weren't for the feather-shaped burn mark<br>between my breasts, I'd put it all down to a momentary psychotic<br>episode and try not to stress too much.  As is, I'm just waiting<br>for the men in the white coats or some clearer instructions.<br><br>If there's a God watching over me, wanting something from<br>me, then It's gonna have to be a lot more convincing to talk me<br>into joining Its side.  But if you see Sister Agnes anytime soon,<br>tell her for me.... nah, don't tell her anything.  I don't think<br>her universe could hold an angel like that one.  I do have a bit<br>more hope for a God who'd create a universe that can.  Maybe<br>that's all It wanted.<br><br>Some say the world will end in fire, / Some say in ice.<br>From what I've tasted of desire / I hold with those who favor fire.<br>But if it had to perish twice, / I think I know enough of hate<br>To say that for destruction ice / Is also great / And would suffice. - Frost</div>
