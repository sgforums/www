            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I think many of you can feel that MC will be falling soon if nothing is done.<br><br>I greatly appreciate Nirvana for his effort in organising a outing. However, just an outing would not be really save the downfall of the clan. It would take many more effort to re-establish our clan and make it a known one.<br><br>I wouldn't really want to see the day MC falls apart. It would be a sad day if it should come. I think it's time we really put actions to our words. Though I do not play CS online and well, I practically is very lousy in CS now but, I wouldn't mind coming out and meet up with the rest for some gaming or fun. I think I should stick to the topic first.<br><br>Ok, I think we need at least decisive leaders for now. I personally feel the council is pretty much a failure. Sad to say, but it's the fact. It's time to be flexible. I think we need new leaders. I hope to see this clan still stand till the day when we're all are so busy that we can't even have our leisure time.<br><br>The leaders would need to have spare time to organise and plan for the clans. Plans, not last minute outing and such. Plannings for outing in my humble opinion, should be discuss and decided weeks before. Just take outings as an example, if we decide outings at the last moment, I am sure many members will not be able to make it. Perhaps future outing should be planned 2 weeks ahead or so and hence forth, members will be able to plan their own time and it will definitely result in a much more successful outing. During June, most of the outings only result in us seeing the same faces again.<br><br>I would say, a clan without proper planning and administrations should be prepared to see it's own downfall.<br><br>Say, our own database. Members' contact numbers and such, well I think I am the only one who has most of the members' contact since I had the numbers joted down when I made a thread for the members to leave down their contacts way back then. In such a situation when I am not available, we will not be able to reach some of the members.<br><br>I do not think we should go on with the council anymore but maybe members with specific task. Say, we can have 2 members incharge of outing. Their job woud be contacting and making sure who is attending and who isn't. This would be troublesome job and who is willing to do this? I would do this if I can spare the time but now I can't as I got my studies to manage and pretty much personal life stuffs.<br><br>So say we're done with the people incharge of outing. We would need 2 good people who are willing to spend time to update news. It is really tough for Koyo alone to just update the news. I have tried it before and I would say it gets tiring as time goes by.<br><br>Now, as a clan, may I ask, where are we heading? Towards being one of the best clan around or being just a friend clan? We tried to be a good and friend clan but that is hard to maintain. We need to be specific with our heading, else we're not going anywhere. Of course this could be solve with 1 pro team in MC and 1 friend team in MC. This had been suggested by someone before but I forgotten who was it.<br><br>I care very much for MC still even though I do not play CS much, and actually practically none at all. For those who got themselves into AC action, we're still MC. Once we get into higher levels, we're just going to make our own clan in the game.<br><br>I have much to say but I'll continue another time since I think bored many of you. For those of you whom never read my essay properly, I'll summarise it for you.<br><br>All in all, what we need now is decisive leaders, planning and a good administration.<br>Lastly, all talk and no action will still result in nothing at all. I feel I have tried to done my part now but who's willing to do some action? I hope no one is scare to volunteer as long as you feel that you can do it.<br><br>For those whom wish I would be back helping as much as I did last time, I am sorry to say I really can't. At least not until Decemember when my exams are over. This is one critical moment of my life and I hope not to regret my actions later. In fact, I don't even play that much AC as I did during the holidays. Sleep really early nowsday. I fell asleep during 8+pm last night.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the way I see, MC will work well if the leaders both ex and the future leaders are willing to put in an effort.<br><br>Roger, I know you have been putting in a lot of effort in trying to push MC to greater height. I would recommend you as one of the new leaders of MC. I wish to step down from my Captain post which is leader of Legion A as I am inactive in Counter-Strike now. I would still be around giving sound advises.<br><br>We will need a leader, someone who has the responsiblity, and with the correct mentality to lead the clan on. I can't really lead on the clan anymore as I have too much work load now and as I said, I don't play Counter-Strike much anymore and hence forth, it is not possible for me to be a leader anymore.<br><br>Roger, you have always been a striking figure in MC. One who will think and plan things out. Should you be one of the new leaders, MC will have a better chance of survival from changes and too will have a better administration. There will of course be a new for more than just one leader so as to unload the burden.<br><br>I think it is time for people to be independent and stand out if they think they are capable for the task.<br><br>In the past, we are so used to giving names to take up certain task. This only result in certain individuals not able to finish their task or rather is unable to. I would say, preferably, anyone who think they are capable of taking up to lead MC on, stand out and say you would take up the job.<br><br>Roger, you would be one of the leaders of MC, if you would like to try and lead everyone on.<br><br>Before I stop once more, I would say to everyone, think with consideration whether you are up to the job, whether you have the time and whether are you responble enough to take up your position. However, just remember these are all my personal views only and hence, you can choose not to listen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I am ready at least for now to organise things going but i will be enlisting for NS in two or three months time. I need quite a few of us in certain departments to handle things.<br><br>One thing is our members dun have the habit to read the forum which is so important.<br><br>Can we make it a point that MC members to check their forum everyday just 5 minutes to 15 minutes will do. Read what is happening.<br>Like some members who did not even touch the forum before. It is sad but true.<br><br>I think we will seperate from friend friend clan to a pro clan.<br>yes normally we play as friends. As in Pro CLan my suggestions is to create a pro team of 8 players which is in MC.(Depending on tactical, accuracy, reaction, frags and more..) This 8 ppls must be able to come out often enough for friendly matches and etc.<br><br>As for outing, we can fix like every first Friday of the month  we will have Clan outing and training session. (Fix one time a month ain't too much right?)<br><br>We should have a couple of departments. Like recruiting department, disiplinary department,  welfare department (Organising Friendly Matches and booking PC in advance for CLan training)<br><br>Recruiting department should have only two persons which is very active in CS and able to give a go to put on official MC tag for those trials.<br><br>Disiplinary department should have two persons. They are able to give sensible punishment or demote anyone of us. They are supposed to tell those juniors that what things they do are right or wrong.<br><br>As for welfare department will be three persons. Y three is because it is quite taxing organising trips and outings or even friendly matches. In fact I want to increase to 4 person everyone take turn every week.<br><br>Those peoples in department are SUPPOSED to set good examples for the juniors or Members to follow. And should not be hot headed because when you are angry you can't think!<br><br>Above is just some suggestions of mine.<br>Need some opinions flowing in.<br></div>
