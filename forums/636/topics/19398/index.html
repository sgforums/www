            <div class='col-md body'>Ermmmm i got a comment...<br>as i read Nirvana post about today outing i heard Leftover is not coming majority and Nirv said form new team....<br>i got this thought that struck my mind....why not have internal competition some days after? I think the purpose is to see who can pair up best right??? Yup and this means these teamed guys should come out and train together some sessions and not juz one day come out competition....Its like juz depend individual skills even if its teamed game...I told this thought with kali b4 he also agree that shouldnt have this internal competition so fast...Guys think of this grping objectives....I hope the internal thingy can be played some days in the future when all teams r rdy to move out...I can rest assured ALL teams r not fully rdy and ALL HAVE NOT EVEN HAVE A ONCE MEETING TRAINING...AM I RIGHT?<br>And also i hope teams r fully satisfied AND I MEAN FULLY SATISFIED for every team...Rage and Ops is fairly too strong for leftovers...and i think we can have more teams rather than juz 3.In time for next competition(which i dunno if got),all teams pls reselect members to make it a fair and square competition...I also hope to see all MCs take part and dont leave some away...For example KUKU...WHY HE NO PLAY...i dont understand or maybe he got play i dunno....<br>Best is Trials form a team and let them come out training...so i expect to have 4 or 5 teams next time....now i state some problems in team.<br>For my team....Rage....Toppie got play in net but not same timing with me.....Insignia in Singnet which is lagged to we cable users...Nirv bz last few days no chance to play much CS....Tomie still getting his form....Me SUX...i think rage need more time.....<br>Converted Ops....Kali got play but he kenna watched by sch teachers...COS HE PLAY TOO MUCH LOL!!!Force i think only play in LAN Target bz these days no time for weekdays outings which we had last week...Cloud and rain no see them liao(I MISSED THEM   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">)But i know the 2 of thewm is well trained and understood with each other.....Ops juz left with gathering trainings....<br>Leftovers......VERY UNFAIR TO THEM....they like have no chance to choose the players they dreamed to be paired up with in MC....PLS GIVE THEM A CHANCE!!!!<br>OK thans all i wanted to say for time being. Pls understand....<br>I hope the next time the match is fixed is the time when all the MCs team r fully rdy....<br>Juz a comment.....Hope u all understand my thoughts...<br><br>------------------<br>WAH LAO......WHY IN WHOLE MC MY AWP SUX MOST???<br>TEACH PLS!!!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Spawn (edited 22 July 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes is hard to choose players of each teams ...<br>but some players are too inactive...<br>NOT totally INACTIVE<br>but less active than other members lor.<br>Sorrie to say.. but i feel that its hard to have 4-5 teams...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> there's juz too little full time MC.<br><br>I feel that onli team Rage has all active members that ALWAYS come out.<br>for C.ops *my team* onli me,kali and Target 1 is much more commited. Rain and cloud is well.. harder to jio out lor <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">.<br>imagine if we separate Rage's members into other teams... then it will be worse.<br><br>e.g..<br>if spawn or nirvana go over to ????'s team.<br>Then ???? decides not to turn up as he's not that committed... then wat does Nir or spawn do then? Also Rage will become weaker due to the separation and it might turn out that someone that is added to Rage decides to tua rage like ????. well...<br><br>As for kuku's case....<br>I feel that<br>kuku<br>helmet<br>jason<br>cyn<br>and<br>Universal<br><br>should form a team<br>Cyn is *surprisingly* :p getting better and also..*due to nir* i feel that she might be 1 of the few more active members...<br><br>Helmet altot he is still on trial,he's always fully active in MC lor...<br><br>juz my 1cents of tots... =)<br><br>------------------<br>Fallback is not an option...</div>
