            <div class='col-md body'>Well, hmmm I have pretty much not posted on this forum for the last few days hehe.<br><br>Pretty much things to say before I go to my dreamland tonight.<br><br>I think I am kind of sorry for causing the commotion(my resignation) in MC.<br><br>Honestly, I wasn't the exact founder nor was I the co-founder of MC(CS) anyway, just that maybe I was one of the earlier member. Being in the present MC, limitation of 30 members made me feel that I should leave as not to obstruct the developement of MC. However, David persuaded me to stay on. I do wonder, MC is a clan of friends or we're going elite?<br><br>As I am writing this, memories of the older days flew across my mind.<br><br>Somehow, maybe I think we should do a credit and maybe a page, a MC hall of fame for the old members. I do remember, members like Rex, Ghostwalker, Dashwolf, Shootbird and many more made MC famous. I am very sure our fame is build up on the net rather than in LAN shops. (I am not saying this because I think I should be in the HOF[Hall of Fame] as I am still a MC member.) I do really think we should credit the honoury members. Dashwolf was one of those who had participate much to our clan and though he had left but we should really give him some credit. Just like Rex, he did great in the match against our 1st SS Match.<br><br>Of course, this might be a pretty bothersome job for our webpage maintainee, Koyo.<br><br>Another thought that comes to my mind is the member profile. Since there is going to be a limit to the members as of this moment. Maybe we should include a member profile now like we used to though the old one was incomplete.<br><br>As I talked to Top on the phone, theres something about the booting issue. Who to boot? As of now, I am of no administration responsiblility, what I said in this thread do not represent their idea. =). I do think if you guys are intend on booting the "extra" members,<br><br>I think you need to consider what you want MC to be in the future. A friend clan? A top-notch clan in Singapore? A multi-gaming clan? I think you guys need to have your aims for the clan.<br><br>I do know pretty much of our members play games like Asheron Call and Diablo II. I think the Diablo II and Asheron Call clannies can merge together to form a RPG MC. Don't neccesary have to use the same name Mirage Corps for the RPG MC. We can try something like the Medival Circle? Mage Circle? Or we can drop the MC tag and have new names for the RPG clannie. I think MC can be expanded to a multi-gaming club. As for the RPG MC, I think we need a new homesite though unless we are to do something like Clan HELL.<br><br>Sorry for the ranting. Just soime ideas of mine. (Hehe, at least by saying some crap, I do contribute a little bit to MC. =P )<br><br>------------------<br>Treasure your time, your love and yourself before you lose them. ~Tango~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tats why i dun really like the ranking system nor the "who's more power" kind of mentality in MC. All the same, brothers in the clan.However i was sad to hear tat you say you were obliged to leave coz there was a limit of 30 people in the clan.<br><br>If tat was the case, i feel me, sky and kfc shouldnt have joined in the first place if we knew it would cost the rest of their place in MC, wat if future members come in, would we feel obliged to leave too?<br><br>I have not much to say at the moment... i think we shouldn't say we want to leave base on our own feelings and consideration for other new members. If were to base on consideration for others, i would say maybe you all want to consider how others would feel if you were to leave.<br><br>Im really very saddened by the departure of dashy and shootbird. These two people are the ones of many whom i really respect in MC.<br><br>When i first started playing cs... the only clan which impressed me was MC, and it was shootbird who was always online, and he being kfc's fren, i learnt more eagerly and to prove myself. I joined SS, no doubt i wasnt skilled enuff for MC, the chance came, i simply wont let go.<br><br>But to see everything coming to this current situation... really saddens me deeply...<br><br>I dun want to say much..but i hope no more ppl leaves and say sad things...<br>i juz hope things will be better and happier...<br>i juz wish all those who left will come back...<br><br>*sad*<br><br>------------------<br>TarePanda<br><br>You thought the Hello Kitty craze was bad...now meet ur nightmare in counterstrike -<br>-=MC=-TarePanda<br><br>~ Cute but Deadly ~<br><br>"SOOOOOOONNNNNNNGGGGG  BOOOOOHHHHHHHHH!!!!!????!!!??"<br><br><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ct/sanctuary" rel="nofollow">www.angelfire.com/ct/sanctuary</a></div>
