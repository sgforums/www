            <div class='col-md body'>After reading the forum over and over again.<br>I think something is not right.<br>Kind of having a unstable feeling cos ppls just come in and out as they like.<br>In the sense that it does not seems loyal or having fun with our clan.<br>Ya i have to admit we guys are great friends  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>happy aBout this and glad to play with all of u on the net.<br>Tango and topgun and a few keep bringing up topics on forum like keep advicing us to control our temper sometimes. We need to think before we say anything out. If not there is more flaming. I hope we MC guys dun take losing so hard on us but we MUST train continue training Till we get in top 50 or top 100 in <a href="http://www.theclq.com" rel="nofollow">www.theclq.com</a><br>True we must agree Cst is rank on the top 5<br>but i seriously believe we do not rank that low not even the top 100.<br>This is not forcing or making lifes hard for anyone but all of us is in Clan MirageCorps and of course we want our clan to look nice. So we must try to FRAG more and lesser death.<br>I also realise that we guys like to cheong get frags and die in the End. What we need is cheong get frags and try not to die so fast. Agreed is free and easy on server but must try to make it a habit to frag more thou we playing so we have certain standards.<br>Coming competition on June is a BIG one.<br>Hope all of us train well.<br><br>Ok this may sound bad. But i some sort of have a feeling that someone of us or maybe most of us just feel that we join a clan and settle with it.<br>Since you join a clan we should even do better and our best for the clan. I agree I am not a good player in fact quite a lousy one..... And i still training hard to use the least bullets to kill a enemy.<br>Plain talking over Here will not bring us to anywhere. Few things I feel good is there is always some of us remind each other and control each other<br>this is very good  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>But can we do till a certain standards that even some BIG POWER clan challenge us up we dun feel the pressure.<br>And on my part... I have to apologise at the moment the MC server still not being approved.....dun ask me y cos the server dun belong to me...i waiting for Pacific net to approve it..... I am sorry for the delay but at the same time i trying my very best to get the server up for training session together like last time we have the server fragging each other together.<br><br>And i also feel that most of us like satisfied with our own performance online...but that frankly speaking that is not enough...<br><br>Just hope that everyone buck up<br>Keep fragging the hell out there but try your best at the same time not to get frag.<br>I personally also dunno how but got to dig my own ass to find out..<br></div>

No matter how hard things we organise somethings is in fact useless.<br><br>We guys got to face the fact<br>Yes we quite famous in onlines servers but famous and good skill is two different thing<br>we must not put them together.....<br><br>All i want to say is keep fragging and try not to get fragged.<br>All the best to every of my clanmates.<br>No offences to anyone<br>I apologise if i make anyone out there angry or unhappy.<br>Sorry<br><br>Have a good time fragging out there<br><br>------------------<br>I am who I am...<br>And I am KuKuBird...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I think for us, we would need to know your reason in joining MC.<br><br>Is it to make new friends or just have a clan tag. A clan which is "known", I mean known as people kinda know us, though we ain't famous for being good.<br><br>Some people join just for the sake of joining. To me and Derek (Topgun), a gaming clan is one which are friends and the clan members are sporting. Actually, I don't really call you all as my clan mates, I regard most MC whom I know and met several times as my friends. As for those I never meet before, It's kind of hard for me to say you're my friend, rather my clan mate seems more appropriate.<br><br>Even though MC is a "friend-friend" clan, we want it to be a good clan too. We don't get together because of CS only but because of fun.<br><br>But it's kinda ironical to say. I know some of you have school work and need to study really hard, I too would encourage you to study more. However, should there be any clan outings, try to participate in it. It sure is boring if you just join MC to have your name in the member listing and yet you don't play with us or go out with us.<br><br>We don't go out because of gaming only, theres other things to do like say, pubbing, eating or just whatever crap you guys wanna do.<br><br>Thats all for now..<br><br>/Tango going to upload pictures of how Merv and TopGun fuck the lamp post at East Coast.<br><br>------------------<br>-=MC=-@bSoLuTiOn|LA|<br>Absolute Accuracy<br>Absolute Killings<br>Absolute Rulez<br>-=MC=-@bSoLuTiOn|A.o3</div>
