            <div class='col-md body'>1)Getting too big for us to handle.<br><br>2)We're supposely a friend friend + good clan. I mean this is our idea, but this idea is very hard to maintain, very very headache for the Capts.<br><br>3)Bigger clans=Bigger problems. Presently, I know it sucks if we only recruit good players only, that only makes us like CST. I am not saying CST is bad or what but I don't like their way of recruitment.<br><br>If you know, MC was initially a newbie clan, we was way sucky back then. I was sure sucky big time, anyway I still suck.<br><br>I don't mind new people to join us even if they're not that good but they must have the correct attitude. Being loyal is one thing. I hate those who join, learn things from us and leave when a supposely famous clan invites them to join. This is one of the main reason why we're closing recruitment. I absolutely hate people who join us and when they become good, they will skip to another clan.<br><br>For MCs only..<br><br>Actually I have come to know our Mr President TopGun for almost a year++ but in real life, I have only know him since last December. We have become good friends since (thats what I feel, don't know what that gay feels anyway) December. David aka Insignia has too become one of my closer friend since he starts to stick around with us. I guess its easier for us to communicate since all of us have something in common. I don't feel MC is a totally gaming clan. I don't mind pubbing with you guys and having other activities. Sad to say, I don't wish to go out and play CS everytime, it is boring.<br>I am not very old but at least I can enter most of the pubs locally without being questioned.....cept for Mdm Wong and such...Anyway, I know it is irritating for some of the MC members who drives to fetch us everytime. (maybe you all don't feel so lah, but if I am the one driving, I would feel like that loh.) I really appreciate you guys for spending the time to fetch us as sometimes driving can really be tiring due to some idiotic dumbass drivers. I hope the rest of the members too appreciate them if they fetch you home or fetch you to SLS. Come of think of us, it really isn't a must for them to bring us here and there so we must be thankful to them.<br><br>I am feeling to talk today so here I am talking craps.<br><br>Anyway for those who rarely come out with us, I do hope you will come out and fool around with us. I find it fun but guys don't everytime go play CS can a not? A bit boring to CS everytime.... can go kia kia sien charbor one leh.... but no AH LIANs please.....(better hope my gf don't read this one, anyway she don't like to read =) )<br><br>Maybe I am only the one feeling like this so therefore nevermind....<br><br>Actually I do have a few questions to ask you all honestly...<br>MC is a purely a gaming clan in your heart or that MC in your heart is a just a name for a bunch of friends who can enjoy activities together?<br><br>To me, MC is just the name for calling us as a bunch but what I like is enjoying fun with all of you......<br>I don't really like the tag MC anyway cause it's really like Mcdonald or Medical Certs.... but I do like to take MC though....<br>1 year at least 50 MCs for me. It's true....</div>
