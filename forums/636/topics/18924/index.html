            <div class='col-md body'>Dear MCs,<br><br>I believe every1 has it rights to defend for itself as i dunno i consider my this final conclusion to be my final but i think in theory it is. Hope every1 give it view on what i have to say.There are 5 parts together.<br><br>First: I have contribute so much for MC and also contribute so much trouble for MC. This first point i would say and alway thinking how come i do such a thing.First to RIP thing.<br><br>1) All because of me no1 has mood to play againist RIP- that i dun denied about.<br>2) I create trouble after tat.<br><br>The reason i done so it only 2 point that make me do such a stuipit thing is<br><br>a) At first they were ghost cheat first few rounds. That why i throught they are cheater and very angry. This was in my mind even after the match.<br>b) In rage of hot temper which tango say is totally true which i can;t denied too.<br><br>Secondly: IRc thing. i believe i would not be so yaya untill like that and say those sentence "WHich u are not fit to play with me or watever".<br><br>About i challenge 9mm thing it totally true and the suitation is like this and why i wnat to challenge him.<br><br>DO you all know what i was thinking before i set my mind to challenge 9mm. Was to lost. But i know lost to him i can gain alot of his skill which would help me to improve alot. I dunno what u all think and this is what i throught about it when i challenge him.<br><br>He told me he dun wants or he mean he dun like 1 v 1 challenge ,i not sure but anyway and i respect him. And i nv challenge him again or do anything.<br><br>I ask u all and why should i do that????<br><br>Thirdly: About SS thing. First i did told Topgun i will be helping SS that is only for my bro squad and SS would naturely be our invisible ally which is not offically one not like HELL is offically one.<br><br>And if MCs would to force me to choose a choice between MC and SS how do i make this choice.<br><br>One Is my bro one is my friends which i so happy to be together with it.<br><br>Of course deeply sadly i would choose to help my bro. i ask u all if u would to be me how would u all choose this painful choice.<br><br>Fourth: Snowfest: i dunno why i can;t ask for a explaintion why snowfest did that as it consider too directly to scold pple like that. AND most IMPORTANTLY i nv have the aurthouriy to boot pple out r and when say i boot him out of MC and "me boot out and  snowfest come back".<br><br>Quite stunting when i read the forum. This fourth reason really lead to 5th point.<br><br>5) Rank seen to be making us look more not like friends clan cause i jsut as a friend or teammate to ask snowfest for a simple reason how come he do that is because i trying to help  maintain  MC repuatation.<br><br>THe reason i want to do this is because i wanted to redeem my wrong tat i had done.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>What i have all done is for the sake of MC and i know i did gd and bad too MC and tat what i dunno i was doing. Forgiven is one thing i ask from u every1. I am feeling deeply very very sad that this thing happen after RIp thing is cool down.<br><br>From now if i have  a chance to be back with MC as the way before i would be listening jsut order from captain. NOthing but order cause i learn so much leessons that i have created.<br><br></div>
