            <div class='col-md body'>Now you will know why new netcode sucks.<br><br>Why does this patch suck? Because the new netcode plays to the lowest common denominator. The 28.8 HPB. Why should the Half-Life online experience be changed when the game is essentially designed for a zero lag situation? ItÂ’s like designing a rollercoaster for those with heart conditions. Yeah the poor bastard with the weak ticker will like it, but the othersÂ…NOT. Valve dropped the ball and I strongly suggest that FireArms make the switch to the Unreal Tournament engine.<br><br>Now here's the comparison<br><br>I like analogiesÂ…Yugo is getting into the Indy car racing circuit you know. But they complained enough to the officials to level the playing fieldÂ…You see, they only produce little four bangers, 1.2L, 69 hp enginesÂ…they say its not fair they have to compete with the high octane 12 (?) cylinder Indy cars of today. Indy officials now require that Ford, Honda, etc. remove eight spark plugs from their engines so that the Yugo can compete. Do you see a problem with this?<br><br>[This message has been edited by tango (edited 10 June 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cd key problem anyone?<br><br>-------------------------------<br><br>Seems to me that the new code makes the game better for dial up modems, but worse for LPB. Valve has blighted all the LPB with this netcode, and the rest of the CS community as well due to the newly found exploits. most gamers pay for highspeed ISP to play these online-games, and now are hard spent cash is compromised for this?<br>Furthermore, leave it to corporations to exploit the free; by this i'm referring to the alteration in the number of CD keys in use to 1. Now everyone who had been playing on a friend's Cd-keys, must now go out and buy their own. I understand that this is all about making money, after all, this still a capitalist country last i checked, but it's the concept of exploiting the popularity of Counter-strike to make even more money off Half-Life makes me lose my patronage to Valve. Or perhaps it is one of the Rich cronies from Sierra who doesn't even play video games, but wants that new Home on the Lake, that is to blame.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe you guys can try this out<br><br>--------------------------------<br><br>I can't speak for everybody, but I think some people might be having problems due to the fact that most of the network cvars are different now. That means your old network config is no good anymore. If you have any network or frame rate cap settings in your autoexec.cfg, you might want to try commenting them out, and then setting your connection speed in Half-Life's multiplayer menu. If that doesn't help, here are some of the new variables I have found:<br><br>r_netgraph is now net_graph<br><br>fps_modem/fps_lan is now fps_max<br><br>cl_cmdrate and cl_updaterate look like they control upstream packet rates, so try setting to whatever you used to set fps_modem to<br><br>rate is the same as before<br><br>cl_rate is upstream data rate, probably should be same as rate if you are on a symmetric connection<br><br>cl_vsmoothing - could this be used to smooth out player velocities? I haven't had a chance to play with it yet.<br><br>If you try any of this, please post and let us all know if it helps or hurts.<br><br>Haqsau<br><br></div>
