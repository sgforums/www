            <div class='col-md body'>Just my thoughts on Taiwanese.<br><br>Taiwan is going through a unstable political moment(Taiwan President constituitional crisis &amp; Chinese aggression), the crash comes in at the same time.<br><br>Unstable political conditions already warrant the decrement of tourist and yet now an air disaster. Taiwanese government would most likely not want it's airport to be involve in this incident.<br><br>Situation as news report in <strong>Singapore</strong> shows that the Taiwanese are definitely trying to shift all responsibility to SIA.<br><br>As quoted from CNN news.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Yong said the pilot, C. K. Foong, knew which runway he was supposed to be on, and that he had not been misdirected by the control tower. However, Yong said there was no indication why Foong was on the wrong runway. </strong><br></blockquote>Plain accusation even before real investigation starts? What are the Taiwanese side trying to prove?<br><br>FYI: Kay Yong is managing director of Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>If both sides of the runway -- which was filled with construction equipment -- were illuminated, the pilot could have mistaken it for a clear airstrip, said Kay Yong, managing director of Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council.<br><br>"If the lights of the runway were not on, then the runway would not look like a runway," Yong told reporters after a briefing with legislators.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Contradictions against his words earlier on? Your call.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Investigators have said that visibility was poor late Tuesday night when the plane crashed, and air traffic control -- which didn't have ground radar -- had no way of knowing the pilot was on the wrong runway, which was parallel to the one he was supposed to use.<br><br>Although the pilot told air traffic control that he thought he was on the correct runway, pilot error could not immediately be confirmed as the cause of the crash, Yong said.<br></strong></blockquote><br>Is he trying to say, CKS Airport have no way to inform SQ006 and hence forth CKS Airport control tower has no responsibility in the crash <strong>at all</strong>.<br><br>Further on, as I said before, any <strong>SANE</strong> pilot will not even consider risking his own and the lives of many? Not to even mention there are total of 3 pilots.<br><br>A pilot would risk running into a "unlighted" runaway?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Some Taiwanese relatives, however, have demanded U.S. dlrs 600,000 from the airline since the preliminary findings of the investigation were released<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>As directly quoted from CNN, <strong>Taiwanese relatives only.......</strong><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>The pilot was supposed to take off on the runway marked with a big red sign saying "5L-23R." The strip was next to the closed runway, "5R-23L." The runways were also marked with an "05L" and "05R" painted on the airstrip's surface.<br><br>American attorney Gerald Sterns, who specializes in representing air crash victims' families, said the airport might have been able to avoid confusion by altering the "5R-23L" sign on the repaired runway.<br><br>"The best defense is to put up a sign that says, 'Runway Closed.' It's no big deal," the San Francisco-based lawyer said.<br><br>He also said that during big storms the control tower, which doesn't have ground radar, should use its radio to warn pilots about the closed runway to make sure they aren't using it. The "black box" cockpit recorder indicated that wasn't done with the Singapore Airlines flight.<br><br></strong></blockquote><br><br>A quote a lawyer from <strong>neither of the 2 nations</strong>. Unbiased and fair. More could have been done.<br><br>Not forgetting as far as news had said, locally or from other nations, it will take 1-2 years to fully investigate the air crash.<br><br><strong>1-2 years</strong>, delaying to tide the storm?(Politcal stability in Taiwan and further involvement in air crash would result in decline of economy?)<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>The recording begins from 18 seconds after 11:15 p.m. (1515 GMT). Runway 5L was open; runway 5R was closed for repairs.<br><br>11:15.18 - ATC (tower) said to SIA 006: "Singapore 6 runway 05 left (5L). Wind 020 (degrees) at 28 (knots). Gust to 50. Clear for take off."<br><br>11:15.26 - Captain: "Clear for take off. Runway 05 left. Singapore 6."<br><br>11:16.19 - Captain: "We can see the runway not so bad. OK, I am going to put it to high first."<br><br>11:16.51 - First Officer: "80 knots."<br><br>11:16.52 - Captain: "OK, my control."<br><br>11:17.08 - First Officer: "V1." (Speed of 142 knots/hour, at which take-off can no longer be aborted)<br><br>11:17.12 - Captain: "(Expletive). Something there."<br><br>11:17.13 - Banging sound.<br><br>11:17.14 - Captain: (Unintelligible words).<br><br>Followed by a series of crashing sounds.<br><br>11:17.18 - recording stopped.<br><br></strong></blockquote><br><br>No comment<br><br>Links:<br><br>Air crash information from CNN<br><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/05/taiwan.plane.ap/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/05/taiwan.plane.ap/index.html</a><br><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/04/taiwan.plane.ap/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/04/taiwan.plane.ap/</a><br><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/03/taiwan.crash/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/03/taiwan.crash/index.html</a><br><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/06/taiwan.crash.ap/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/06/taiwan.crash.ap/index.html</a><br><br>Taiwan political situation information  from CNN<br><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/06/taiwan.politics.02.ap/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/east/11/06/taiwan.politics.02.ap/index.html</a></div>
