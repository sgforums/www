            <div class='col-md body'>I was leading a plain and simple life until 2 months and 12 days ago exactly. From then on, I found a goal in my life.<br><br>This goal gave me hope and a new lease of life. But I actually failed to achieve that goal due to some stupidity of mine. Now, this goal drifted further away from me and the chance is taken by someone else.<br><br>I had been having a great dream these past 2 and a half months. This goal have greatly changed my life. But the dream is shattered now, and sadly, I have to wake up.<br><br>I regretted deeply that i did not treasure my chance and messed it up. But i guess its all too late now. I would definately not regret having this dream, in fact, I would love to have it again....... But what's done cannot be undone, and there's not much I can do about it now....<br><br>My life is now aimless, and i have to find my way through the vast lands once again.......<br><br>If God really do exist....did i do something wrong in my previous life to deserve this?<br><br>------------------<br>Love is patient. Love is kind. It does not envy. It does not boast. It is not proud. It is not rude. It is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered. It keeps no record of wrong doing. It does not delight in evil, but rejoices in the truth. It always protects, trusts, hopes, perseveres<br><br>[This message has been edited by -=MC=-N|rVaNa (edited 23 September 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nirv ur goal must have been a girl. Lemme guess, from ur Poly. Erm... same orientation group.<br><br>Sometimes setting goals in life is a good thing, but don't set goals which involve other other people in order for it to be achieved. Setting goals in life is for yourself, never involve others. Because if u set a goal that depends on other's reactions, and it fails, u'll have a terrible time because of the fact that u failed.<br><br>However, set goals that only involve u and no one else.<br>For eg. It's a bad goal to set if: "I want to make that girl like me. Hopefully we can get together and have a good time."<br>A better goal to set would have been: "I want to better myself and improve the way i present myself." (To make yourself a more worthy person for that girl. Anyway, she certainly deserves the best right?)<br><br>Keep your goals in check and things will be fine. If the goals don't work out despite them being a good one, then take it as a lesson for the next goal u wanna set for urself.<br><br>Life isn't just about attaining that one goal, it's about many many goals that will come our way. If goal no.445 doesn't work out, learn the lesson and put the lesson into good use when u try for goal no.446, etc. Be encouraged that we too go through the same things as you, we all just have to learn together and live life to the fullest.<br><br>As for the thing about God trying to make things difficult for you, it has never been the case. Hey man, God cares for you, but do u care for yourself enough to say, "Hey, I can live on. I WILL NOT be discouraged. Jimmy is stronger than that."?<br><br>------------------<br>*DaNi3L Dropped Due To Timeout*<br>-Transmission out-</div>

DO realise that the girl may not be interested in you at all, if so, what are you gonna do? what CAN you do?<br><br>move on.<br><br></div>
