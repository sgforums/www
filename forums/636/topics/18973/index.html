Secondly, a just cause.... Thirdly ... a rightful intention."<br>--Saint Thomas Aquinas<br>"The brave men who died in Vietnam, more than 100% of which were black, were the ultimate sacrifice."<br>--Marion Barry, Mayor of Wash. D.C.<br><br>"The decision to attack the entire nation [of Yugoslavia] has been counterproductive, and our destruction of civilian life has now become senseless and excessively brutal. ...<br>"The United States' insistence on the use of cluster bombs, designed to kill or maim humans, is condemned almost universally and brings discredit on our nation (as does our refusal to support a ban on land mines).<br>"Even for the world's only superpower, the ends don't always justify the means."<br>Jimmy Carter<br><br>"When the swords flash let no idea of love, piety, or even the face of your fathers move you."<br>--Gaius Julius Caesar, (100-44 B.C.)<br><br>"If you will not fight for right when you can easily win without bloodshed; if you will not fight when your victory will be sure and not too costly; you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all odds against you and only a precarious chance of survival. There may be even a worse fate. You may have to fight when there is no hope of victory, because it is better to perish than to live as slaves."<br>--Winston Churchill<br><br>"I would say to the House, as I said to those who have joined this government, I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat. We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering. You ask, what is our policy? I will say: It is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark, lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: Victory -- victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory there is no survival."<br>--Winston Churchill<br><br>"War is not merely a political act but a real political instrument, a continuation of political intercourse, a carrying out of the same by other means."<br>--Karl von Clausewitz<br><br>"No one starts a war - or rather no one in his senses ought to do so - without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve in that war and how he intends to conduct it."<br>--Karl von Clausewitz<br><br>"War is too serious a matter to entrust to military men."<br>--Georges Clemenceau<br><br>"Beware lest in your anxiety to avoid war you obtain a master."<br>--Demosthenes, (384 B.C.-322 B.C.)<br><br>"The Civil War is not ended: I question whether any serious civil war ever does end."<br>--T. S. Eliot<br><br>"The essence of war is violence. Moderation in war is imbecility."<br>--John A. Fisher<br><br>"There was never a good war, or a bad peace."<br>--Benjamin Franklin<br><br>"The art of war is simple enough. Find out where your enemy is. Get at him as soon as you can. Strike at him as hard as you can and as often as you can, and keep moving on."<br>--Ulysses S. Grant<br><br>"And when all the world is overcharged with inhabitants, then the last remedy is Warre; which provideth for every man, by Victory, or Death."<br>Thomas Hobbes, "Leviathon"<br><br>"In peace, as a wise man, he should make suitable preparation for war."<br>--Horace<br><br>"The patriot volunteer, fighting for country and his rights, makes the most reliable soldier on earth."<br>--Thomas J. 'Stonewall' Jackson<br><br>"Every citizen should be a soldier. This was the case with the Greeks and Romans, and must be that of every free state."<br>--Thomas Jefferson<br><br>"There is no such thing as an inevitable war. If war comes it will be from failure of human wisdom."<br>--Andrew B. Law<br><br>"It is well that war is so terrible -- we should grow too fond of it."<br>--Robert E. Lee<br><br>"War creates no absolutely new situation: it simply aggravates the permanent human situation so that we can no longer ignore it. Human life has always been lived on the edge of a precipice."<br>--C.S. Lewis<br><br>"Military glory -- the attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood."<br>--Abraham Lincoln<br><br>"Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object."<br>--Abraham Lincoln, 1848<br><br>"Wars are caused by undefended wealth."<br>--Douglas MacArthur<br><br>"Old soldiers never die; they just fade away."<br>--Douglas MacArthur<br><br>"In war there is no substitute for victory."<br>--Gen. Douglas MacArthur<br><br>"Where the very safety of the country depends upon the resolution to be taken, no consideration of justice or injustice, humanity or cruelty, nor of glory or of shame, should be allowed to prevail, But putting all other considerations aside, the only question should be: What course will save the life and liberty of the country?"<br>--Niccolo` Machiavelli, Discourses<br><br>"War is in fact the true nurse of executive aggrandizement."<br>--James Madison<br><br>"The strongest passions and most dangerous weaknesses of the human breast; ambition, avarice, vanity, the honorable or venal love of fame, are all in conspiracy against the desire and duty of peace."<br>--James Madison<br><br>"The Constitution supposes what the history of all governments demonstrates, that the executive is the branch of power most interested in war and most prone to it. It has accordingly with studied care, vested the question of war in the legislature. [If a president is successful in bypassing the Congress] it is evident that the people are cheated out of the best ingredients in the government, the safeguards of peace which is the greatest of their blessings."<br>James Madison, letter to Thomas Jefferson, 04/02/1798<br><br>"A riot is a spontaneous outburst. A war is subject to advance planning."<br>--Richard M. Nixon<br><br>"No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country."<br>--George S. Patton<br><br>"It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather we should thank God that such men lived."<br>--George S. Patton, Jr.<br><br>"Throughout the history of the United States, war has been the primary impetus behind the growth and development of the central state. It has been the lever by which presidents and other national officials have bolstered the power of the state in the face of tenacious popular resistance."<br>--Bruce Porter, "War and the Rise of the State"<br><br>"One of the fondest expressions around is that we can't be the world's policeman. But guess who gets called when somebody needs a cop."<br>--Gen. Colin Powel<br><br>"The surest way to prevent war is not to fear it."<br>--John Randolph<br><br>"History teaches that wars begin when governments believe the price of aggression is cheap."<br>--Ronald Reagan "You can have all the advanced war methods you want, but, after all, nobody has ever invented a war that you don't have to have somebody in the guise of soldiers to stop the bullets."<br>--Will Rogers<br><br>"We are the only nation in the world that waits till we get into a war before we start getting ready for it."<br>--Will Rogers<br><br>"Diplomats are just as essential in starting a war as soldiers are in finishing it."<br>--Will Rogers<br><br>"War is cruelty, and you cannot refine it."<br>--William Tecumseh Sherman<br><br>"The last person to achieve unambiguous victory in an air war was Zeus."<br>--Tony Snow<br><br>"Peace is not an absence of war, it is a virtue, a state of mind, a disposition for benevolence, confidence, justice."<br>--Spinoza<br><br>"So, as you go into battle, remember your ancestors and remember your descendants."<br>--Tacitus<br><br>"Be convinced that to be happy means to be free and that to be free means to be brave. Therefore do not take lightly the perils of war."<br>--Thucydides<br><br>"All those who seek to destroy the liberties of a democratic nation ought to know that war is the surest and shortest means to accomplish it."<br>--Alexis de Tocqueville<br><br>"Know your enemy and know yourself; in a hundred battles, you will never be defeated. When you are ignorant of the enemy but know yourself, your chances of winning or losing are equal. If ignorant both of your enemy and of yourself, you are sure to be defeated in every battle."<br>--Sun Tzu, The Art of War<br><br>"In all history, there is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare. Only one who knows the disastrous effects of a long war can realize the supreme importance of rapidity in bringing it to a close."<br>--Sun Tzu, The Art of War<br><br>"No power but Congress can declare war, but what is the value of this constitutional provision, if the President of his own authority may make such military movements as must bring on war?"<br>--Daniel Webster, 1846<br><br>"To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace."<br>--George Washington<br><br>------------------<br>-=MC=-|]EsTrOyEr-=|c.e2|<br>Sniping into 2000 and beyond<br>NCC(AIR) Stgab Unit LCP Shawn Chng</div>
