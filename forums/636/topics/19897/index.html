            <div class='col-md body'>Toppie ah dun stress yourself over the homebase thing. The more stress u r, the more complicated things will be. Also morale most likely will go down too.<br><br>Perhaps you guys should juz take things easy.<br>hehe afterall life isn't juz abt CS u noe?<br>being serious abt gamin isn't really that bad for u guyz now.. at least it give u all a motive/aim in life. But u guyz must remember that CS is juz a passin phase of your life *i learn that when i quit MC and CS* I think tango shld also understand that too. hoho.<br><br>Anyway abt the homebase... it's good that someone sponsor us to play... it's an opportunity not to miss by any serious clan.<br>But then... the moment they say sponsor us... means we got to commit ourself and shoulder the responsiblies to win. Things like coming for trainings at a certain day and etc can't be taken lightly.<br>It's a bit boliao loh... i personally feel that it not worth it loh... becoz y stress yourself over A GAME? NO matter how fuckin hard uou train... you wun really get any benefit from it loh.<br><br>I not that good in sayin certain things but i guess u all shld noe wat i'm tryin to imply here.<br><br>I'm not sayin that goin for the LAN shop is a bad thing... but i dun really like to see things like wat happen after the match against UM loh.<br>*all lok so disappointed in the carpark and blamin this and that*<br>they win so they win loh... but SO wat the fuckin hell they get for winnin us? At the most they can rejoice to others they win MC. so? does it hurt your purse?<br>*i noe toppie has work hard on MC and hope to maintain our reputation. i prefectly understand that.*<br>But.. toppie, maybe we shld take things the usual MC style... be it to increase our morale or juz for the sake of fun. The restriction of shouting across the room maybe is good to show that we have discipline.<br>but discipline in gamin? for wat? GAMIN IS SUPPOSE TO BE HAVING FUN.<br><br>Everything really depends on toppie. If he want us to quiet down we will coz we respect him as our leader. But i believe most of us.. even koyo, prefer to give our pg or hp numbers to those who we BUAY SONG. HOHOHOHOHo<br><br>PS : toppie... i prefer to shout SONNGGG BOOHHHH when playing and be crazy than tryin to be a member of a reputable clan =).<br><br>------------------<br>u.own.mi? sorrie.no.way~<br><br>*throws a grenade at himself*<br><br>-i.own.myself-</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the selection of best 12 MC...to split into 2 teams is a good idea, and very fair.<br><br>But please leave Team Song Boh alone. No one else can use our tag...pls? I mean the 2 new teams for Beta X can use any other names, i dun care. But not "Song Boh".<br><br>To me...and i believe to the rest of s.B members...the team name is "sacred" liao. Our reputation online, everyone knows us liao.<br><br>So out of courtesy, i dun mind u all use other names for the 2 teams! thaanx! =)<br><br>Anyway last nite's loss...i play a major part for blame.<br><br>1. keyboard too small...no slope gradient<br><br>2. mouse fly wildly (my sensitivity only 4), im not sure with the rest...but i cant aim at all. Even minor adjustments while firing at enemy, the mouse crosshair wont respond properly.<br><br>3. Most lame reason, i caused. No binding of buy weapon key. As you all know impossible for me to buy on the run...all my controls on the numeric pad. I end up buying my stuff, and always the last one in the group to catch up with the rest. One reason i dun have enuff time to buy H.E or flashbang or defuse kit.<br><br>4. I was really low morale with all the above, plus the air con i think wasnt on...really i play until "pek chek"....first time clan match...i actually slammed the mouse more than 2 times. (i dun slam mouse one)<br><br>Lastly sorry guys... i know you all damn demoralized. Me too.
