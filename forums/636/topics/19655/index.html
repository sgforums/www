Good question. The realism of this world, we have to study to be able to acheive what we want in the future. Yes there are other alternatives but for most of us, only when we study, we get our degree which is the key to our future. Unfortunately the education system is never perfect, it enrich us in a way which provides us with basic knowledge yet boring and most of it does not applies to what we do in later life. Even if you go to University, in the end you get your degree and what you put to use in your job might not be your field of specialty, unless you decided to be the professionals. eg. Doctors, Lawyers etc etc.<br><br>Perhaps you should ask yourself the question of, What you want? Ever ask yourself that? What you want on the long run. Most of us never think deep down, we'll just like to play and plan the next day. Perhaps you will now feel that it is really time to think on the long run. Playing is part of our life but if you go on playing and playing without planning for your future, it'll lead you to nowhere. In the end at a certain point in your life, you'll feel lost. Perhaps this is what you are going through now after some unexpected incidents.<br><br>Well, all I can say is, "that's life!".<br><br>Coming to the point of life is really base on your own perception. If you lose your hope in life, man it's all over. A goal/aim is a must have if you really wish to live life to the fullest. For the past 16 year I have been yondering over endless mountains, chartering over limitless sea and it's only till a good friend of mine wake me up from my dream. It's only then, I find life forever interesting. I used to live a day by a day, passing each day without any aims. If I had not wake up from my dream, I will probably be as lost as you are, my friend. Find your goal, know what you want and work hard and enjoy while achieving your goal.<br><br>Pardon me for going on, perhaps there are many unhappy issues bothering you? Find someone to rant it all off. You'll feel a lot better. Everyone has their bad times and if you keep brooding over it, you'll never feel well. Why bother about the bad times? You know my problem don't you Jimmy? I was upset but now it's all over. Relax, enjoy and remember, roaming aimlessly will lead nowhere but back to the same spot again.<br><br>If you feel you need someone to rant to, I am free for all ears. I am available =), but don't woo me because I ain't gay. J/K.<br><br>Call me if you feel a need to =).<br><br>Roger: Always unlimit sound advices from you =) Love to see you speaking, adds so much more life to this forum.<br><br></div>
