            <div class='col-md body'>A suggestion<br>--------------<br>Maybe after CPL we should consider reforming the legions and have them carry out training fortnightly? Seriously speaking... not much ppl are realli active in MC only the few that always come out... so i bet the legions 1 or 2 maybe enuff liao... others can all put in 'Cold Storage' loL~ And also hor.. maybe we can get G-surf to allow us for overnite training... anywayz juz continue on my topic post wat u all feel abt MC and to improve it...<br><br>P.S me feeling kinda boliao now.. waiting for time to past...<br><br>------------------<br>They ask me to <strong>fallback</strong> but...<br>A recon specialist has no option to live...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree wif Tango, as i mentioned to a few MC guys at the 7th training session and makan after. this time CPL my money is on one of those clans with a home base (LAN shop) I see the MC guys skills are good but need to work on teamwork, same with the Alphabets. i quite sure that CsT won't win the CPL thing unless they've been training hard. my money's on the following clans:<br>Death, Elements, Tankers, BH, Utensils (if they are playing)<br><br>IP: Logged<br><br>alweek<br>Junior Member<br>Posts: 6<br>Registered: Apr 2000<br>posted 09 June 2000 01:20 AM<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>one more thing to add. Since you guys got a Home base at G-surf, try to be more constructive wif the time you spend there. dun always play the free-for-all/top frag bullshit. Internet style of playing is VERY different from Clan/tourney style, internet style is very individualistic, once round start you see eveyone run all over.<br>my suggestion is that you all play against each other, discuss positioning in maps, strategy etc. one side try camping, other side try to break the camping, etc... after doing this for a few months, then i'm sure the teamwork will be much improved.<br><br>at your practices, assign diff guys to give commands and see who performs best under pressure. One guy give command and the rest must follow, dun have one or two idiots do their own thing, even if they don't like the command, also must follow.<br><br>Alphabet A aka -=MC=-Target 1<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I bet on the foreign teams.<br><br>SG gamers are not that pro as compared to most overseas players.<br><br>I used to play Deltaforce and man, you should see how some foreign team plays DF.<br>They play the team with superb teamwork and superb accuracy. I mean they really play hard and serious. Time to change your attitude if you guys want to be the best of all, but all in all just remember life is more important though, don't ignore your studies and work.<br><br>DF MC got trashed by Swiri like hell man.<br>They are from Korea most of them.</div>

Most would normally hesitate and would not rush out to help.<br>(Submachine Situation here, not awp)<br>If it be a awp, since your team mate is dead, that is of course forgiveable but most of the time, it is a submachine versus submachine situation and I have seen it more than enough that team mates are too selfish and are afraid to die.<br><br>Come on, this is a game only.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ermmm the topic a little off liao lehz... Suggestions lar...<br><br>haizzzz<br><br>Juz something to share wif u all abt wat i feel after playing beta6.5 and CPL. I need to mention before hand that i mean not to sound offensive.. but I realized that MC is still an immature clan.. in a lot of ways...<br>playing style,camping style,tactic wise too...and not to mention... defying of orders... So we must bucker up... and try to play better in beta6.5.<br><br>Also realized that beta 6.5 requires EVEN more teamwork... which is wat we are lacking in the clan now.<br><br>The match vs cst team1:<br>Altot we lost the match against CsT team1... i losted in gd spirits... becoz they realli show us wat is gd teamwork, wat is cooperative play and team fire.<br>If we were to compare our teamwork wif theirs.. i do rate it 1/10 for us and 8/10 for theirs.<br>Thats abt all.. another thing is that if we did reform legions we should train for a few months then we could ask either Aplhabets or Death to trim/train us...<br><br>------------------<br>They ask me to <strong>fallback</strong> but...<br>A recon specialist has no option to live...<br><br>[This message has been edited by -=MC=-Force!
