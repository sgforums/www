            <div class='col-md body'>Operating within a game as a clan unit is much different than playing as an individual. While playing as an individual, your primary concern is often maintaining a high ratio and staying alive yourself. Typically, you "lone-wolf it" more as an individual. However, while playing as a clan, more structure is necessary for success. Maintaining this structure can be difficult, as it is often trying even to create the structure to begin with.<br><br>One way to establish order in a clan match is to set up "fire squads," or teams of players that operates as a sub-team of larger team you play on, be it Counter-terrorist or Terrorist. These fire squads typically have a leader and several members. Oftentimes, the fire squads will operate both in conjunction with the clan as a whole and independently. Fire squads will often play one another in a practice with the entire clan, and practice by themselves as well. Fire squads can take specific roles within clan matches, while still interacting with their fellow clanmates in other squads. One squad may specialize in stealth, while another in sniping, and yet another in brute assault. These squads can work together in game. The snipers can provide cover fire while the assault squad storms the front. Meanwhile, the stealth squad can flank the opponent.<br><br>For instance, in Siege, one strategy would be for the CTs would be three fire squads consisting of one sniping fire squad consisting of one, two, or three players; one assault squad consisting of three or more players; and one stealth squad that consists or two or more players. The assault squad and snipers deploy by going over the bridge, following to the open area. Snipers could then deploy upon the rocks and atop the building. The assault squad then deploys to either side of the entrance waiting for the stealth squad to get in position. While the assault squad and snipers are deploying, the stealth squad goes through the tunnel, to the elevator, the sewers, and finally resting at the door to the garage. When the stealth squad is in position, the assault squad can move in to the boxes, and attempt to draw the Ts outward to the waiting snipers. Meanwhile, the stealth squad flanks the Ts. After the threat has been neutralized, both squads may then break the building and rescue the hostages.<br><br>Obviously, there are many permutations on this idea. There are nearly infinite possibilities with this structure. But there are others. I advise you to try this out, as other strategies, with your clan and see what works best for you.<br><br>-IcEMaN<br></div>
