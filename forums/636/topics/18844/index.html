No!<br>Please get it clear, if anyone stay in MC for a long time, yes he might get promoted but how far will he go too depends on how much contributions have he made. Being an officer will not be as simple as you all think. Are you all willing to be responsible and often get together with the other officers and plan things out for MC? Would most people want to feel inferior or try to fight their way out to make better prospect for themselves? I feel sorry for those people who feel inferior but this is the world, you will need to learn how to accept the facts that this world is never fair.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by -=MC=-Avery:</div><div class="quote_body">About what merv say i totally agree with that rank do give us some conflict between us.<br><br></div></blockquote>What conflicts? Don't just type something just for the sake of typing. Tell us what conflicts? I hate to say this but if you all want to change things in the clan even though you're not an officer, please give a proper reason and not just give a vague reason. It ain't easy managing things ok? I don't mind if anyone of you want to take over from me and I can be more free.<br><br>Thank you all for listening and have a very nice day.<br><br>------------------<br>-=MC=-@bSoLuTiOn|LA|<br>Absolute Accuracy<br>Absolute Killings<br>Absolute Rulez<br>-=MC=-@bSoLuTiOn|A.o3</strong></div>
