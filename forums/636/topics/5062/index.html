            <div class='col-md body'>Hey.. guess what,<br>its not like i've not done this before and you guys would probably remember me for this.. (if not other wierd stuff from me)... one of my 1st few posts on pagn which had many people demanding for more.. yes.. you got it.. The Playgirl Catalogue Series...<br><br>Finally Grandmaster is back to write for all you pathetic deprived horny souls, The PlayBoy Catalogue Volume 1 !(i think i wrote this before.. but there are new addition to the new season)<br><br>AA Yanie - Miss Universe Champion and Best Female gamer award winner, dont mess with her, she'd make u look like u never played CS before. she's smart, she's witty, she's pretty.. and oh yes.. very sexy. (***)<br><br>AA michelle - Miss Skinny Bones Champion. Best at Acting Blur (or being Blur) then anything else. she is skinny, skinny.. and very skinny. need i say more? if u have a fetish for nice curvasious bones.. you'd find her hot ! for people who love everglides.<br><br>AA S|nful - indian chinese rojak girl.. she's friendly, sociable and blends in well with the guys and the maids.. not becuz she is domesticated.. but she looks like a filipino maid. If u had a fetish in screwing u'r family maid.. here's u'r excuse to fulfill u'r dreams. (***)<br><br>AA M@Dprincess - Miss Skinny Bones runner-up.. as skinny as she may be.. she probably owns the best pair or.. err watermelons.. and requires her own custom made bra cuz there's never the right size for her in any lingerie shop. only for men who loves abnormally huge and tasty watermelons *slurp* (***)<br><br>AA Prissy - This girl is specially catered for those rare shy guys who just loves extra body hair. If you're a shy guy, fear not, as she'd help u make the first move. and oh.. her body hair is straight and fine type.. not curly and thick. (-*)<br><br>AA BabyElite - Miss Universe 3rd place Champion.. a cindy crawford lookalike.. she has a sexy mole like her american counterpart. dont worry guys, she shaves the hair off her mole. (btw.. its not at the same location as Cindy Crawford's)<br><br>AA Masaki - Miss Universe 2nd place Champion.. bubbly, friendly. she has freakish fake blue (or izzit green?) eyes that makes her look almost gothic, if not for her rather slack dressing. a relatively plain girl otherwise. that works at E-Games and sponsor fries for people everyday. she's attached so only for the guys who wants to be a 3rd party. (***)<br><br>Ferret - Camper Award Champion, dont ever be at the wrong place at the wrong time, she might be there waiting pound you and rape u'r sexy tool of pleasure. she stands at 175cm tall so not for the short guys.<br><br>Elm Princess aka Mystique - Goddess in her own right, she's one fleshy looking aunty with young good looks. a pity she's attached to young Skyline aka God of.. i dunno what.. so you wouldnt want to mess with her, otherwise he'd banish u into everlasting limbo. (***)<br><br>Elm little^_^ - a young 16yr old ger that looks 12yr old. she's cute and talkative and so ever full of nonsense.. u'll constantly see cow sh!t splurting out of her 12yr old mouth. "sister" of God Skyline (which makes her a goddess too i guess) and wife of Retrieval (which i guess makes him a god too...)<br><br>Elm fiona - not her confirmed nick yet, she's very sweet and pretty and petit. makes an excellent gf. not very socialble and relatively quiet. so.. kekeke.. no hope lar u guys.. so ugly oso u all. (***)<br><br>Elm Caecilia - for men who just love to try out foreign blood, wife of Revenant (sorry she's taken) she's pretty and proportionately busty. equiped with a fair pair of oranges and short legs. she makes a wonderful flirt machine. but do not be decieved by her friendliness. (***)<br><br>Elm Jolynn - Just turned 16 yesterday. buddy buddy with goddess (by relations) little^_^. she's short and sensitive. not much is known about her so...for those men who want to explore themselves.<br><br>AA xuez - Queen of Vulgarities. a Hongkee girl that doesnt behave like a Hong Konger. She's not as fasionable as the Hong Konger's and infact.. relatively plain if u ask me. for the males who have a thing for vulgar plain janes.<br><br>Excessive Sheryl - never with a fixed nick, she is an sexy party animal that just looooooves to make men drool. occasionally acts innocent. she's friendly and u may not know her, but has been around the CS scene for about 1 and a half year already. (**)<br><br>AA Retrogirl - she doesnt exactly look half retro at all, a very slack looking girl that doesnt need to dress up to get men oogling at her... or is it her CS skills they're oogling at?<br><br>AA Hanel - Tall Beastly and Monstrous in size. not as tall as Ferret tho. she's really quite pretty if not for her Monstrous size. she just has a large body frame (not fat.. i repeat.. not fat) that makes who look larger than normal petit girls. for men who are anti-petit. go for Anal...... erm.. i mean Hanel<br><br>Had Enough? or still begging for more.... stay tune for PlayBoy Catalogue Volume 2.<br><br>legend: (***) = GM's Highly Recommended. not to be missed, great looks, great character, great t!ts.<br>(**) = GM's Recommended.. worth a shot.. no harm trying.<br>(*) = GM's Recommended.. may differ in different individuals taste<br>() = no comments<br>(-*) = GM's Shortlisted for Damnation. i beg you to give it a miss.<br><br>__________________<br>[Elm] Grandmaster |-HTGK-|<br>*Proud to be an Element of Elements*<br><br>AA Lennete - The Gentle Thing of Athena's Advocate, ever so submissive to others. For those men who just CANT ever be the dominating sort.. she's an easy target to dominate. She's otherwise relatively bubbly looking.(for losers like Icy Cyril to feel dominant) (*)<br><br>AA Coven - Rather Tall and slim, Coven doesnt have any problems with shorter men. so if u'r born short.. like loser Icy Cyril, fret not, there are girls like coven that exist.<br><br>AA demonic - also popularly known by her pet name, Angie. This girl is in desperate need of a deaf man to listen to all she has to say.... why? cuz there's never anyone that can tolerate with all the crap she will say. if u'r not deaf, its okay, ear corks comes together in this package. (*) &lt;&lt;-- she's cute.<br><br>AA Khimmy - nicked name MegaHertz.. well known for her shrieks and her screams. u never need to worry about oversea calling bills if u have her as a gf and u'r away. u will alwayz be able to hear her "sweet melodious" voice. LIFETIME supply of ear corks comes together in this package... they dont usually last. please change one everyday or seek medical attention if not helpful.<br><br>AA Rejuvenate - also popularly known by her pet name, Julz. An expert in all Kharma Sutra positions, she has finally attained black belt in the art of sexuality. if u think u'r up to her match and would like a challenge or maybe u just want to have a shifu, Rejuvenate is da gal for you. an easy way to please her would be to buy erotic novels for her.<br><br>12Knights Cold^Soul - formerly of Elm fame, a tomboyish but still feminin gal that plays CS at FarEastPlaza Matrix occasionally, for those Gay tendency people .. like Icy Cyril to proof to others they're not gay. (*)<br><br>::stephi:: - Princess of Vulgarities in her own right. very well known on the internet servers, not only is she a pro in CS, she plays Quake too. (im not sure what others) i dont know much else about her. (***)<br><br>n9 subprincess - yet another Princess nick girl (u'll see a total of 4 princess nick gals). This girl studies in Nanyang Polytechnic and possess huge eyes.. so huge, u probably think she's a scorpio. her favourite colour is probably black. so if you think u have the same sense of colour taste.. not only are u gothic but u might make a wonderful pair!<br><br>xtr eureka - attached already apparently. the ah soh of GameStop@Play and GameStop2 she makes a great cup noodle chef (she cant go wrong.. then again.. who can?) and she makes great can drinks. lucky adrian(her bf) has all the well cooked cup noodles to eat everyday. (*)<br><br>Rinoa - hangs out most with the Icy people, very multi-talented and amongst her many talents, she has a "hidden talent" to be a really "sexy" dancer even before being able to go into discos legally. probably has a great future as a stripper in Las Vegas where she'll probably earn bombs. for men who like a nice striptease before the action.. or maybe just want to be her pimp. (-*)&lt;&lt;-- (i am so mean.. hehahah)<br><br>AA sephora - affectionately known as Tammy the Cute Bunny Gal. very petit and cute, and obviously very intelligent (u can tell by her posts and her educational background). NOT for the mentally challenged... like Icy Cyril. (*) &lt;&lt;-- she reminds me of some giraffe stuff toy i used to drool all over as a toddler.<br><br>AA LuvYun - for the more chinkish people who love chinkish faces (chink = Chinese). equipped with slitty eyes and rectangular glasses that help emphasize the slittiness (note: NOT slutiness) of her eyes. a typical olden day american animation of a chinese or a japanese looking face. (in this case.. more chinese). for the ham sup tiko guys who dont wanna get caught by their watchful gf's.<br><br>legend: (***) = GM's Favourite "Silent But Deadly" Fart. The Best Fragrance that is good enough for Aromatherapy.<br>(**) = GM's LawnMower Fart. Loud and Interesting, worth a whiff.<br>(*) = GM's Regular Fart.. smells different for certain people if they have stuffed nose.<br>() = no gas.<br>(-*) = GM's Short Fart. Nobody would notice this one, so dont bother.<br><br>If You Think Thats All.. YOU ARE DEAD WRONG!! i have enough gals for.. PLAYBOY CS CATALOGUE VOLUME 3 (well.. barely enough.. dont think i cant write much about them thats why i left them for the last) i have 12 more girls shortlisted and 5 more girls that i heard of but know nothing about.<br><br>btw.. please Contact S|Nful aka Zoe if u would like to book a girl.. she's not only the filipino maid but also the mamasan.<br><br>[Edited by [Elm] Grandmaster on 04-23-2001 at 02:15 AM]<br>__________________<br>[Elm] Grandmaster |-HTGK-|<br>*Proud to be an Element of Elements*<br><br>------------------<br>TarePanda<br><br>~ Cute but Deadly ~<br><br>OFFICIAL -=MC=-TarePanda Homepage<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ct/sanctuary/mcpanda.html" rel="nofollow">www.angelfire.com/ct/sanctuary/mcpanda.html</a><br><br>OFFICIAL Team SongBoh?!
