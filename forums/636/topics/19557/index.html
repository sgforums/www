            <div class='col-md body'>I thought say hao liao its C.ops and Rage and song bo if they can make it. Why now specially for C.ops. Dun sperate the MC clan too much juz becos of the names can?<br>Overnite training should be a clan affair where the 2 diff teams can share tactics and improve ourselves. Its like having practise opponents. In real match situations, not everyone of a particular team can make it, juz like the match against PWA, where some members from each team come out form a ja pang lang team to play.<br><br>The purpose of forming the teams i think is to have practise opponents, know each others' weakness and stuffs so we can improve. I dun wish that after we form the teams, only the 8 of u guys one team, the other 8 one team, then everything is like so seperated and stuff.<br><br>MC is a big clan, we form the teams to train teamwork and get organised, not to get ourselves seperated. Like that might as well we form 2 diff clans. Training sessions are for everyone, dun juz say its for C.ops.<br><br>I hope i have not offended u keith, its juz my point of view. If what i said was not what u were implying, then i'm sorry, forget this post. But if forming the teams is to compete against each other, see who's better, then we might as well forget this idea. And btw, i will be toning the coming friday. If i'm not welcomed if i'm a RaGe, then i go there play wif others, while u guys train. =)<br><br>I hope all MC members can try to make it and make it a clan affair. I dun wish to lose another match, then we blame it our lack or teamwork, i'm really sick of that liaoz.....we cannot discuss our tactics before a match and expect the stuffs to work for us. We need to play against each other and find the pros and cons of each tactic. Talking out tactics before each match will never work out. I'm sick of this liaoz lohz.....<br><br>The more u sweat during training, the more rewards u get during a match.<br><br>------------------<br>Love is patient. Love is kind. It does not envy. It does not boast. It is not proud. It is not rude. It is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered. It keeps no record of wrong doing. It does not delight in evil, but rejoices in the truth.

            <div class='col-md body'>Paiseh nirvana.. i dun mean that... thats y i put a FOR those who are also interested there  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But if we realli are going to train as a team... we are going to stick as a team. Not like during ITO or RONIN or BH or PWA. We ain't a team. We are juz fragments of a team(some from here and there).<br>MC itself IS a TEAM, i noe. But then MC 40++ members each got own specialized playing styles. Like 'Songbo?' team I organized the training juz becoz I wish C.ops's members can familarized wif each other's playing style.<br><br>Take for xample.. Rain defying orders and take nir's spot in the prodigy map. I noe its his wrong.. but then again... maybe<br>his playing style suits him on that spot... So i juz hope that i can use tactics that will suit C.ops as a TEAM. If ANYONE else wanna join in training no probs...hehe<br>But u got to be our opponents  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>This is the onli way to get stronger.... for my opinion... i personally feel that personal skill doesn't realli count that much in CS liao.. most ppl can kill by spraying at the rite postion now... so teamwork is veri important...<br>Wats the point of training wif some members juz to find that u wun be playing wif them at clan matches? Or that after training some members cannot make it and watever?? Juz my tots i may be wrong of coz.... pls enlighten me if i got on anyone's nerves. And tell me where i go wrong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Fallback is not an option...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yah keith, i understand.<br>But dun u think its kinda hard to have only members of RaGe, members of C.ops and members of Song Bo only for each match?<br>That's why i feel each training session should be for everyone, cos its virtually impossible to be free for MC always and u may have to mix the teams up a little sometimes. Thus, when we train together, at least we know what each others gonna do. When there's tactics, share with all the teams, so all the team knows and better still, use and train the same tactics cos we are all MC. No pt having C.ops training their own tactics and other teams training their own, its pointless, cos as i said and repeating now, its almost impossible to have the whole team for a match. The match against PWA was a classic example.<br><br>thank u and have a nice day<br><br>------------------<br>Love is patient. Love is kind. It does not envy. It does not boast. It is not proud.
