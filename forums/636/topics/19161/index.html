            <div class='col-md body'>Here is my only real Hair-raising experience .........I took my BMT in the RSN camp in Sebawang they it is called SNT then. I think now they called it INTO or IMS. During the BMT we need to perform prawling duty. The route of the prawl started from the Office building to all the perimeter of SNT(I think 2 PDF was there then). There is this 4 storey building of those colonial design  that you may find in Fort Canning,  within that route. This building was used only during the day(many classroom) while at night it is left empty. There was a check pt on the fourth storey of this building. As with most Building over there they have a tiolet in the corner of every level.So me and my prawling buddy were there during on of our duty and we are supposed to sign a prawling booklet on the fourth storey. When we both reach there he heard a flushing sound. Both of us were curious and went in to check to see who is in there. The tiolet was empty and we hear flushing again. Of course, both me and my buddy did the most logical thing at the moment.It took us about 30 seconds to reach the safety of  the next building(office building where other  off duty prawler stationed). So for those of you that is going in to the Navy for BMT, my advice is avoid venturing near to that building (beside the Muslim cookhouse)at night. Though we see nothing but I am sure that flushing sound came from that tiolet.<br></div>

(as i tell this story i getting goosbumps i very scared) .. now i say it might not seem scary but i tell u the branch was moving so violently like it was a hand waving to me and the other branches around it some looked more filmsy and thin but they didn't even sway abit but that branch just kept swaying like it never stop.. then after it sway 5 minutes plus then it stopped... then after that i went to look away awile then 5 minutes nothin happen when i look again.. guess what! the branch again was swaying so violently but i did not feel any gust of wind blow past me or anything... it was so spooky... especially when u only have about 5 people around and the nedxt pit is empty but luckily i think the pit two pits away from me was a christian group and i think they pray so no ghost if not confirm got even scarier story<br>i continue with the next 2 stories next time now my hand very tired<br><br>------------------<br>Love is not a cure for madness</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh my other ghostly encounter - Merv, there was also a night I saw bushes moving violently over Seletar Resevoir's carpark.I have just park my car and were at my boot taking out my sport shoes when I saw that shaking bush. Guess what I saw when it stop moving.- A nerdy couple peep out of it. They still pretended they were lost and walking into the bushes accidentally. They still got the cheek to kaykay ask me how to go to the what tower of the resevoir. Though I find them stupid but I do admire their endurance. Imagine all the discomfort of doing their funny business in that bush with all the mosquitoes and other insect around them. Wah sia what if a snake got into the wrong hole how ah? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
