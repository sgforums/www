            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I have seen great objections from some of the members about the new tag...<br><br>Ya, MC have been established and well dignified among ourselves =).<br><br>I know some people out there dislike MC, for what reason, I hardly could understand.<br><br>I know some people out there respect MC as I do feel we deserve the respect.<br><br>A change of tag of course would partially means we're somehow restarting again. Think again, we can establish a name for ourselves easily with our skill. We can somehow do some reorganisation within ourselves to make us a better organisation. This new tag would of course blow some new life into the clan. I know some of you really hate being taunted. MC as always refered to Medical Certs or Mac Chicken but some ignorant kids. (Well they can't grow up, we can't help it. If they're adult, they're definitely a adult with the brain of a kid.) Having a new tag as the 45th would stop the crap nick giving by those stupid kids.<br><br>Anyway, what we want is being different here.<br>45th Mirage Fighting Tigers is like that of a American Airforce combat unit. Say, 101 Airbone. Anyway, I dislike the SAF and hence forth if we were to use any name in conjunction with the SAF, I will disagree strongly.<br><br>We're trying to make us organise like a special combat unit in game. This too would prepare us for the next probably coming hottest game, TF2. Actually, we would rather have new suggestions of tag, don't give stupid ones though. This is a serious thread, don't change the topic or act cute.<br><br>Being the 45th MFT, we'll be the first clan to have a real unit number and callsign. Actually, I really wish all of you would reply to this thread and give us a name suggestion rather than me or TopGun work it out alone ourselves. Actually, Mirage Corps is still Mirage Corps. 45th is our unit number and Tigers is our callsign. Like in the United States Airfoce, they always have callsign for their unit.<br><br>I would rather see us as a World Peace Combat unit working like the real pros out there(In game of course, in real life, we're all friends.)<br><br>I would hope too the ranking be base on the person's ability to command and listen.<br>If the officer is not able to command a team well, I would rather he be a soldier.<br>The rank only applies when it comes to gaming, it don't applies in real life. If anyone feels that I do not have the ability to lead Element A, feel free to pull me down.(Free me from the work!!)<br><br>We play this game for fun but we play to win. I always hear from people "we play for fun only...., win or lose nevermind one.", so hypocritical. Sorry to say that. I do think we all play to win unless you wish to be a loser forever. (Maybe this is just my view only but I do think we play to win. Don't you get pissed off when you die? If that is so, I am pretty sure you play for fun and of course to win, unless you don't like having top frags and being call a pro.)<br><br>The sad fact about this world is, there is always the losers and the winners but most of the time human just like to deceive themselves that this world is equal and fair just to make themselves feel better.<br><br>If we're to be as good as a clan, we need to train together and not individually. Our clan has very good individuals which I am very sure other people thinks so too. Problem with us as all along is the little cooperation and inability to work together as a team. If anyone of you here used to play RB6, RS or even the newest Urban Operation, you would realise teamwork is the greatest power.<br><br>Do you guys not realise that even a professional cannot fight against 5 person when they're united. Ok, I'll admint I am quite ok with the AWP(yeh, 1 shot 1 kill). I was once able to kill most of the MC in the other team because they all come out 1 by 1 for me to kill. If they hard charge together in unity, I would have been filling my mouth with the sand and dust.<br><br>When it comes to gaming, I hope every member will listen to the officer in command. When it comes to real life, you want to ji siao him or even screw his asshole(not mine though), it's definitely no problem.<br><br>Sometimes, patience is the key to winning in CS. Since currently we're only into CS therefore we shall focus in CS. Even games like QIIIA or even UT need cooperation though its depending on game play type. CTF definitely needs cooperation. Honestly, I really like CTF games a lot especially Deltaforce CTF, those were the really professional trooper days.<br><br>I come to realise that those who were in the old DeltaForce days are the one who are really able to listen to commands. Shocker, Killer, Mephosis are very good soldiers(game). In a CS, cooperation is the key to winning. Learning to coordinate and whether you can coordinate is a very different thing. I hope when you see MC playing online in the servers, you will go and play with them instead of joining other servers. Try to train together and try to be together in the game so as to train up coordination.<br><br>Listen, only if a MC member is in the server, don't be too frag minded. Rankings are pointless. I don't give a damn fuck about ranking nowsday, initially getting the top of the table is thrilling but to me now, "What the big deal?". If we can train up good teamwork, winning tourament is the real big deal. CS is a team dependant game, not a superman or hero's game. If you really think you're rambo, I suggest you go and play Quake III Arena DM or UT DM.<br><br>Damn, I think I am really writing a long essay. I always wish for the good of MC, if anyone think I am too proud or arrogant let me know. I know I am always talking this and that, maybe I offended anyone of you while in the procedure, pardon me.<br><br>I know some of the policies we are adopting is really contradicting, example like friend friend clan yet we must be good. I with the council will try to plan something for us this June as it is the only time that most of us are much more free.<br><br>I do feel most of us in the clan have the ability to prove to be good in games, not only CS. MC is not only a CS clan but it spans to other games as well. (in the future but we will)<br><br>If anyone of you wish to be in the council, let the council members know. Bear in mind that being in the council will requires you to be responsible and is willing to spend time on discussion.<br><br>Initially, when I join the CS MC, we weren't that close. I do have the thoughts that we will disband one day when CS is not that popular or when we don't play game anymore. Now, I do not feel that way anymore, we will continue to thrive whether it is raining or there is a thunderstorm out there. I can feel MC is united, looking at the brotherhood when anyone of our members is in trouble, most are willing to help each others. I admit I am a little hot tempered when we play as a team and we lose like fuck. Honestly, in my heart, I don't feel we will lose to many clans locally if we really train up on our teamwork. I don't feel myself feeling proud but I am stating the facts. I am not afraid to let anyone see what I am saying here. MC members are able to top the frag table even if CST or any other real good clans are in the same server. Hence forth, I do not see any reason why we can't do good as a team. We really still lack the teamwork.<br><br>Some of you keep asking me why I don't want to join CPL. Well, it's sad to say that I am sure it's not really possible that we will win the tourament, but it's not because of this reason I am not joining CPL. I feel that I play too much CS and hence I really need to study more. CPL will take up a lot of my time. I do not wish that one day I will say, "I regret that I had not study hard for my O'levels.". I will ocasionally join the guys for the training session during June but I will start focusing more on my teamwork. Afterall, if I study hard this year, I am pretty sure I can choose which JC or Poly I want to go.(still not sure whether going Poly or JC, nm drop this topic.) For those who are in the clan, I just hope you all frag more but study hard in the mean time.<br><br>For those of you who are dreaming too much and playing too much games, I advise you that you better wake up now before it is too late. Studying is sure boring and I hate it too but if it be an exam that will quite decisive in your life, go forth and study hard for it.<br><br>Nah, don't worry I am not going to become a nerd in anytime to come. I won't study like those nerds anyway, I have a life. I hate nerdos anyway.<br><br>Looks like I am strafing way too far from the topic, lol....<br><br>Nevermind I'll go on... since I have the mood to do some English composition today.. =).<br><br>I'll go back to the topic of the clan. I do hope everyone voice their view about MC. No one is insiginificant in MC. Everyone is equal. Everyone can voice out.<br><br>I think some of you must be thinking, if MC is a friend clan, why would anyone be kick out? Well, as a clan we hope you too think for the sake of everyone and not just yourselves. Just like a class, if you organise a class outing just to suit yourself, you think anyone will come?<br><br>There is another thing I hope you all will listen to me. Would you all not mind that you all start speaking properly English in the forum? Sometimes, it's pretty hard for us to understand some of us to understand.<br>Singlish is fine by me but don't too much "han yu ping yin" and "hokkien" can?<br><br>Thanks for your understand.<br><br>Thanks for anyone who really read my post.<br><br></div>

And i Enjoy Dying (thats why i always chiong) Nowonder no 1 calls me pro  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>*bangs head on wall*<br><br>:p well heres my view<br><br>- Of cause we play to win, We play as a team we lose as a team. but you must rember we cant always win. CS is a GAME just like HALF LIFE or TETRIS.<br><br>- Winning is great but games are made to give enjoyment (FUN) if you lose you lose. what matters is you Do your best you play your part (and keep mouth shut if got nothing good to say) if you belive that you shuold have won then there always next time no need to make enemies.<br><br>- Lose is not always defined as a Lost. you can go to a match lose like shit and find out why? Did the team split up to much? or maby we grouped together to much and blocked each other? things like that. i was once from tfc's PKM (hehe i was a senior) we played our 1st clan match against XM (an odeo based clan) and lost like shit 70/170<br>we found our problems and had a rematch the score was pkm 120/xm 0  !power hor?<br><br>- about clan matches for MC maby we can discuss a strat on our irc channel? exchange info on enemy teams players ect???<br><br>- For me its a matter of Trying. if your teamates are not trying you cant do much scholding will make them upset and they will lose concentration. Just Do your best in whatever you do clan  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>PLAY ON FRAG ON AND MAKE MC PROUD!!!</div>
