I am not dao, but just that everytime I meet u, I play like hell. I'm sorry if I pulled u into this, it has nothing to do with u. I never knew so many pple in the clan disliked me until now. I have played CS for quite sometime already but no improvements instead I'm playing worse than before. Makes me feel like I'm wasting time here. I like CS and I sacrifice my personal pride to play this game in a sense my wife to be, my parents, my colleagues all think I'm so childish to still be playing this game, yet I still suck in it. Actually, this game is affecting me in my work in a way coz my bosses and subordinates all feel I'm still inmature, not really so healthy when it comes to respect. I am not the kind that quits easily but I really dun want to let the clan look bad coz I know I'm deterioting instead of improving. All the new players are so pro, make me feel so small. I back out coz of my own pride...sorry. Tango I hope I dun disappoint u too. I will miss some of u!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heheheheeh. I think now u all should understand my position, I'm actually too old for this game....32 liao u know. It hurts me sometimes when my junior staff tell me to quit all these childish games and get married to help me mature. I know my team staff all respect me coz I help my boss build my team up from scratch, but the respect is not complete coz they feel I'm inmature, u see most of them are older than me and have kids. That is why I know how Topgun feels to be a leader, it isn't easy really, especially when it comes to work, a lot of backstabbing etc. Most of u will know when u all come out to work.

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously Tango I dun agree with u more but in this society u fit into the environment and not the environment fit into yours. If u choose to be special u will have to be either damn rich or a somebody, grab it? I would like to be like what u said, thats why I'm still playing, but the society will never accept us as adults, understand? Probably when u reach my age and have a wife and working as an executive and still play games, u will see my point. Actually I dun mind what u said, but it just shows that u lack working experience.</div>
