I am not trying to prove u pple wrong here or saying gaming is wrong, I'm saying what pple will actually visualise u as when u do, understand?

Although u managed to name a few but that is because they have nothing else better to do, right? I did not say that pple will look at u differently coz u play games but how much time u put into gaming that leads them to think otherwise. Frankly, what do u gain from playing games?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hehehehe I will still play CS, regardless about what pple say, but I will cut down, no choice. I hope I'm not contradicting myself here but the discussion went out of hand actually like what Universal said. I dun want to be stressed out by representing a clan in a way(putting clan tag) and not performing thus making the clan look really bad. I know where I stand now, like I said before, after so long I play worse. I know MC is a great clan, great pple, but I really feel so inferior in the clan, eg a lance corporal playing so much worse than a private. I feeel alot of the new members play better and deserve higher ranks, as for some officers like Ghostwalker, Chrome, what have they contributed to the clan, do they deserve their ranks as officers, I feel pple like Dashwolf, Universal  and so on deserve their rank more. Anyway thanks, take care!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why tok bout rank!? Aiyoh. Not everything bout rank one mah. Clan is clan lah... but dun feel pressurize coz of the clan tag. I dun normally put clan tag, i fool around also, using other nicks like Uncle Panda...etc etc. For fun only lah, unless clan match or alot of MC in tat server than i put on clan tag, or when in the mood when im alone in the server. I mean joining a clan i dun so much pressure or stress.<br><br>So wat if you are playing worse than whoever's lower. All are friends mah. Why bother to compare all the time.<br><br>Like iggy...si iggy always camp one when we play different team on server. I scold him taunt him suan him...after every game, we still frens mah. Doesn't matter who snipe better or chiong better.<br>Friendship is juz there for you.<br><br>------------------<br>TarePanda<br><br>~ Cute but Deadly ~<br><br><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ct/sanctuary" rel="nofollow">www.angelfire.com/ct/sanctuary</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Tarre... I have been told the very first time I joined a clan that is DT and later LPB  that it is an insult or offence not to put the clan tag on when we play, saying that we are embarrassed of the clan by not putting the clan tag on, I've been told off several times, so that is why I always put the clan tag on no matter how bad I play. And secondly, I am not that paticular about ranking, I mean to me, but I just feel bad loh. Thanks for lending a listening ear.</div>

Our clan dun cheat mah, we dun do things like camp on roof using hostage(i have not seen any as of now), except occasional camping(our clan members mostly hiong one, all chiong steal frags one..LOL)<br><br>Dun be pressurized lah. Use tag when there's a few MC on tat server lor...it juz creates a team awareness.<br><br>Anwway if we put MC tag always(when we are alone on that server) it scares the people there. All those will be either pressing "1" or "2" frantically which ever team u join. Plus some of them out there...purposely want to taunt you, insult you, win u in frags, etc etc.<br><br>If they ask who i am, i juz tell them im MC one lor.
