            <div class='col-md body'>Why kiasuism?  Blame it on the government.  They emphasise performance so much with the advocation ofmeritocracy, so people are stressed to the very limits to try and perform well.  Anyway look at it this way, the optimum age to study is from 16 to 24, so it's ideal to mug your heart out for O's, A's, Poly, ITE &amp; Uni.  However, just because you didn't make it doesn't mean life is over.  Life is always full of opportunites to succeed!  Still, enjoy your youth!  I hope this helps if any of you are feeling the pressure to perform.....just take it in your stride.</div>

There are many potential students out there and they aren't doing very well in the current education system.

Why should meritocracy be stressful? You work for it, you get what you want. Why should that be stresssful too?<br><br>It is the pressure from parents,friends,classmates and school that adds on to the stress of students in Singapore.<br><br>Parents, afraid that their children will lose out to their kins//friends/colleagues' adds pressure by forcing their offsprings to study, have more tutions.<br><br>Friends/classmates, this applies to many people, when you see friends/classmates doing well in their results, you would want to do well too.<br><br>Blame it on the government?

            <div class='col-md body'>It's stressful because meritocracy says you're rewarded according to your ability to perform.  So the less capable end up being discriminated against, and nobody wants this to happen to them.  So it's society in general applying the pressure, not just parents; the system is channeled in such a way that it keeps piling on more and more work load, and to keep up, you have to keep studying and studying.  Excessive studying gets into your head when you're obsessed with beating the competition, and <strong>that</strong> propagates kiasuism!  I hate the system, but it's the only way to give oneself a headstart in front of others in the rat-race.</div>

Let us take a look at some of the JCs as example.<br><br>Serangoon JC, is consider a "slack" JC, consist most of the students with the lowest score to get into JC.<br><br>VJC and TJC is considered as one to the best JC in the Eastern region, yes indeed kiasuism can be view upon the parents and students in this 2 JCs.<br><br>However "kiasuism" in our education system can be view down to one's own perception. I have seen many people slacking for years in primary and secondary schools and yet they score at their PSLE and O's. As for the A level, slacking and scoring at the last moment is not that common though. However, opinion base on this is mainly due to my experience so it might not be brought to generally how "kiasuism" is seen in our education system.<br></div>

But unfortunately you single out the minority; only <strong>some</strong> people are able to score at the last minute - if we all could do that, then life wouldn't be called difficult!   It's called exam smart; you score, but you haven't really had a proper education due to weak foundations, poor method of study etc.  Because of that, you can do well for easier levels like the O's, but the A's for example needs strong foundations, time and motivation; plus the higher order skills if you know what I mean.  Also, some don't tell you they study, and that's often the case, those aren't your true friends!  I try to really picture it as an imagined race; you have to focus, train, practice, fine-tune, and gain experience.  So that's the approach I use.<br><br>You seem to forget that most students entering TJC are in fact from neighbourhood schools like St. Joseph's Convent and St. Hilda's, and they can do extremely well.  For example, one of our top students with '8 A-level distinctions last year, was from St Hilda's.<br><br>You seem to draw a clear distinction between the top 5 JCs and say, SRJC.  You should note that there's a normal distribution curve here, i.e. the top 5 are very kiasu; the next 3(SA, AC, Anderson) are relatively kiasu; and so on.  So if you sum everything up and look at the majority, there's still some 40% of the annual cohort dubbed as 'kiasus'.  Alright putting it clearer, look at the statistics, about 10% of post-secondary students enter the top 5 JCs, or so we're told.  That places 1 in every 10 students into the super-kiasu category, isn't that scary?  It's definitely a more nerdy student population than other countries!<br><br>If it was based on your personal opinion, are you / were you  in VJ or TJ?<br><br>Try not to judge solely on your individual experience, and take the system itself and everyone into consideration; the good,bad n' ugly!  =)</div>
