            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmmmm can I do my rantings again?<br>Exams coming, time for me to do some composition. =P<br><br>Well, basically I am not too familiar with the MC team now except for the old schoolers, however the MC trend forever lives on. The last friendly I had been to was like a few weeks back if I am not wrong. BH verus MC<br>I might be in no position to say this as I don't have the time for CS much now. I do think experience do helps though. MCs generally forever has the idea of self before team. Don't get pissed off with me but I am just saying what I think. It seems that most members' always want frags. How many would scarifice to die for a team mate so that the team can win?<br><br>Since long, MC always long to plan before we play. Does it helps? Seems not.<br><br>Why?<br><br>We always say who takes this position and who takes that other certain position and so on and so forth, however, do we do the exact?<br>Most of the time, yes for a few rounds and after that, everything goes haywire? Agree?<br><br>Of course, a certain tactic would work for a few round for some certain map. However, when it comes to map like "Dust" and "Nuke". The strategy to win is almost certain for CTs. Element of surprise might result in winning for the Ts but that's only 1 or 2 round. With the correct positioning of personnel, a win is almost certain.<br><br>All MCs do not have a lack in skill except me. Therefore, winning all the so call pro-clan out there is not a difficulty. It is mainly the team's mentality. What you put before yourself? Team or frags?<br><br>Everyone can say, "Yes, TEAM before myself".<br>Whether you do it or not is a different thing.<br><br>CS is 6.5 onward is really a different game. Exellence in teamwork will prevail over superb players.<br><br>MC has come a long way. Well, it's one of the most established and "old" clans in Singapore now. However, we were never the really top 3 clans in Singapore. There is really enough training but what does each training aims for? Seems to be aimless shooting rather than practise for teamwork. Honestly, I doubt we need practise for aiming. Maybe the next time you guys have training, try to focus on strategy and teamwork. "Pairing offs" will not work unless you can be sure, everytime there is a match or training, you and your partner will be together.<br><br>Just a thought here, the best strategists in the clan itself are probably Alan(Target_1 if that is still his nick), Roger(KuKuBird) and Kali. Very sensible mature guys who really think well in planning.<br><br>Enough rants for tonight. =)<br><br>I do miss my bros in MC. Long time since I see our beloved Roger hehe but I don't think I can spare any weekends for the next 2 months to meet you guys.
