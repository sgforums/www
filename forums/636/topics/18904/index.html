            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, clan members. I have always been like this. All of u that have known me for example Topgun, knows that I'm like that.<br>I dun care if it is SS clan or Cst. they are all the same. If u dun like it I'm sorry, I dun like to explain myself. This is my character and I dun need u to teach me. I truly believe I am much older than most of u pple and I dun need u all to discipline me, if U all do find a need to do so u all can freely disband me from the clan.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To MC avery, since I have so called violated the clan rules or your rule, I think I should have to do something in return for my<br>mistake. I will not explain myself as I have said earlier. So I think I will quit MC to meet your requirements. I know u all are so good and do not camp, so besides this mistake I think I am not fit to be in a clan where all are pros except me who suck. Thank you Topgun for bringing  me in your clan, U are still a very good friend. And to all the other clanmembers I have met in the net, its been great knowing u guys. As for Avery, thanks for your letter hope not to meeet again.</div>
