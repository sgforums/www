            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Guys,<br>just some thoughts that i've been thinking about.  now it's 7:30am so bear with my random thoughts.  I realise that some of what i have to say may seem, targeted at diff people, but please rest assured that i never intended to single out people.  I believe what i have to say applies to the whole CS community.  If you are offended by what i say then let me apologise in advance.  Please inform me personally if i have offended you or you wanna gimme constructive criticism @ alweek@pacific.net.sg<br><br>My idea/vision is for all MC members to be more profesional in some aspects.  My approach to CS is not to take it too seriously.  I know several people who approach the game too seriously (as if it's their life) to be a good CT/T and all this bullshit.   Please lighten up if you think you fall in this catergory.  I really enjoy going to competitions and outings as i get to meet up with my online friends who i meet every night on CS but never seen before.  It is also often at these outings and such that i get to observe many "interesting" characters.  Just take a look around next time you go to a LAN shop.  You know the type, those arseholes posers who scream loudy, curse loudy, screw other people who can't play as well, taunt others when they frag them, and the list goes on...  Please folks, it's just a damn game.  So what if you're a headshot/sniping/mp5 king or whatever crap in CS? so how does that carry over into real life?  just a dose of reality people... i dun think these same people can proudly proclaim to the real world that they're such kickass CS players.  What i mean is, invest time in CS, but invest time in something worthwhile that you can be proud of outside of CS as well.  To further elaborate, i know some folks who are real good in CS, but they have neglected many aspects of the real life until their studies/personal friendships etc are damn screwed up...  so where do you think these people are gonna be in a year's time when CS fever eventually cools down?<br><br>Another thought when going for outings/competitions...  When you are put in such situations, people get to see you. not like when you're at home and can change your nick and be as cocky as you like and people still dunno who you are.   When you play CS in a shop, you are physically there.  People can look at you and make a judgement about you.  This is both a good and bad opportunity.  Try to take the opportunity to improve MC's professional image by not misbehaving too much.  I'm all for having fun when we go out, shouting "Sooong boh?" to Toppy and the rest and what we normally do  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  but when you play clan matches etc, follow basic sportmanship rules like shaking hands, winning or losing gracefully, give compliments, etc.. dun just finish the match and disappear etc.  At the least if the rest of the team is lazy, the leader or older MC guys should make the effort to talk to the other teams leader.  This goes a looooong way in improving MC public relations, by being a bit more sensitive to the opponent.<br><br>Ok that's enough ranting for the morning.  i'll continue this post as i think of more stuff regarding "discipline" and such.<br><br>Frag on<br>Target 1 aka [-A-]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with him. We dont normally shout "song bo" during clan matches. (heh) As for having respect for other clans, i do wholeheartedly agree with target1. A lot of us simply dun have much respect for other clans, especially if they are deemed lower skilled than us. Wat happens if we got beaten by a stronger clan? wat do we normally do? hang our heads low...we surely wouldn't want tat clan to boast bout it and brag bout it.<br><br>alot people online have developed a "hate-mc" or "mc sux" fanclub. As me, sky and kfc are always online (virtually ALMOST ALWAYS). Although we do get compliments and requests to be accepted in MC. Lots more others say we sux, especially our attitude. First and foremost, we do try to reason with them with logic, tell them we are juz out for fun, and its clean fun, not making enemies everywhere we go. Normally those hostile people online are ok with us once we clear things up. We tend to be cheeky online, but we do draw a clear line on provoking anyone. No one benefits when a quarrel erupts online, juz declare war and be forever enemies cursing each other online , etc etc... its tiring.<br><br>Another thing there are some people who are really into hardcore MC hating, even though those innocent mc ppl are juz playing their game, keeping quiet. They will juz tease and taunt , trying to get a reaction from us. Come on u guys...get a life. It's juz a game.<br><br>Im juz into the game, frankly speaking, im not really tat keen into clan matches or competitions. I dun like those things. I juz want to play online, having an MC tag, juz gives a sense of belonging. And indeed i do feel good when im fragging well, juz think of it as making a gd name for mc.<br><br>Im not into cursing someone's mother or father. The most is juz some(or alot. haha) complaints bout the lag, some vulgarities AT THE LAG.(and not anybody's parents, relatives, pets...etc etc)<br><br>So wat i would suggest is having more respect for others or other clan members. A newbie who duno how to play now, maybe singapore top fragger next time. Make more frens, create a good image for urselves. (hey at least those gals playing will know "hey! he's a nice guy! and HE'S MY FREN!")<br>Im not pointing any fingers at anyone, im juz sick of internal quarrels, who hating who, who not giving enuff respect to who, come on...all mc members. Have fun, go outings, dun be mean to each other or others.<br><br>Have fun. Have a nice day.<br><br>As i always like to say after a good game:<br><br>"SOOOOONNNNNNNGGGGGGG BOOOOOOHHHHHH!!!!!!???!!??"<br><br>For now...its si beh song ah.<br><br>------------------<br>TarePanda<br><br>~ Cute but Deadly ~<br><br><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ct/sanctuary" rel="nofollow">www.angelfire.com/ct/sanctuary</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An exellent post. Hope to see more of quality post.<br><br>Well, as for the situation now, I am not sure. In the past, MC do used to shake hands with their opponent after every match as a show of appreciation and show of sportmanship,be it we won or lost.<br><br>My opinion on those I hate MC clubs, well, those people are either sore or jealous. No, I am not saying we're the best or I am trying to be boastful here. Practically, the best way to deal with those no life jerk is just to ignore them. I only scold people when I get damn fed up with their crapping or when I am not in a good mood.<br>If they just like to put names like MC sucks and so on, doesn't that shows our popularity? =)<br><br>Anyway, sorry to say about the phone number giving attitude in MC. Think it was me and TopGun who started it.<br><br></div>
