            <div class='col-md body'>I have been asking this for a long time.<br><br>What's the aim of MC now?<br><br>Leaders? Please reply.<br><br>One moment, we're going the pro clan style, one moment break down, one moment say friend clan.<br><br>I said before going aimless will do a clan no good and result in breakage sooner or later.<br><br>The following is the opinion of me about the present MC.<br><br>Honestly, the MC before June was a great one. We don't win every match (Not saying we win every match now) back then but even if we lose, it was all fun. Now it seems, after we lost to AX and PWA, morale is soooo low.<br><br>I remember back then losing wasn't such a big deal afterall. The MC back then is so much more fun. This is agreed by many of the other old MC members. Now, MC is like only a "CS-SIAO" clan. Ack, I am sure many of the old MC members remember the days when we have BBQ. When Derek was a gay, when Merv and him screwed a lamp-post. Wasn't those days more fun? More of a gang of like-minded friends rather than just calling each other clan mates. Those were the days where we're all so much more united. Exams yes, but not everyone is taking major graduation examinations. Where has that spirit gone to? I like CS but not to the extend of only meeting you guys for CSing only.<br><br>Now one by one, I can feel that MC is slowly dispersing. Only say, Team SB is still strongly united.<br><br>What's MC to everyone of you? Club? Clan or a bunch of good friends?<br><br>MC to me is a bunch of good friends who share the same hobby.<br><br>Lose clan match and so?. What's the big deal? Demoralised because of a game?<br>Honestly, I am greatly sadden by the way MC is going.<br>I admit that I don't participate in outing much but I do really have a valid reason for doing so. Not that I own anyone a reason but I am real busy with schoolwork. I believe Kali and Engima(Daniel) and a few others are having their graduation examinations too. How about the rest?<br>I wonder where has that unity gone to.<br><br>I hope FOR ONCE, everyone will respond to this thread, and let us know what you think MC is to you. Just be frank with what you want to say, no one will bear grudges against you.<br><br>Just take a look at the old threads in MC forum. IT IS SO DIFFERENT. We communicate more like ole good friends. It was really so much more fun. I really miss the good old days.<br><br>Ok, I am really tired and out now 1.55 AM in the god damn morning. Still gotta wake up at 6AM.<br><br>Good day to everyone of you and I hope to see serious respond, it's not compulsory though =).<br><br>By the way, Derek and Merv, no offense for what I said. Hehe =) But those days were really fun.<br><br>[This message has been edited by tango (edited 07 September 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok my turn......<br><br>When i 1st joined MC, u guys were all very onz guys.....jio each other out all these always, but i dun understand wat's wrong now.<br>I remember my 1st match for MC was against R.I.P and we lost unfortunately....but we took the defeat well  ( only some cork ups ).<br><br>Its like the whole clan so disorganised or moody all these. ( i know i'm one of them, but i really got lots of problems. ) I tried hard to get us together again but i really dunno wat to do to acheive that. I really hope we all can be like the past, all brothers type, go AMK makan all these. Dun all just quit suddenly or watever. Its just plain stupid.<br><br>I know u guys are studying for important exams, but even if u have no time to cs, u dun need to quit MC right? Quitting MC means u are ending ties with us. I never study for tests or exams or watever shit, so i may seem free all these, but i understand that u guys need to study. Just try to come forum check around post some craps like last time, make the atmoshpere better. Last time MC forum was so full of crap, but nice ones that is.<br><br>I really dunno what's wrong with all of u now, i am also sick of trying to get u guys together. Maybe i'm a born loser, cannot solve my own problems and now i can't even do a thing for MC.<br><br>Haizz...i really dunno wat to say now....i just really missed those days when we would sit around toke cork sing song all these, nowadays, MC is really fucked up, dun know wat is wrong.......<br><br>------------------<br>Love is patient. Love is kind. It does not envy. It does not boast. It is not proud. It is not rude. It is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered. It keeps no record of wrong doing. It does not delight in evil, but rejoices in the truth. It always protects, trusts, hopes, perseveres</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my turn........<br><br>i dunno what has happened these past few days what with ppl quitting MC for reasons unheard of....<br><br>i noe that many of us r very caught up wif their studies, work or other personal problems, but quitting is not a solution to any problems(unless u have a problem wif MC....although i suppose none of u have ).<br>i mean, so wat if u quit MC, will that solve any of ur problems? i suggest that if there's any problem, juz take a break for a short while...but DUN quit. Quitting will lower the team spirit of MC, we work as a team and fight as a team...so juz noe that if u got any problems, the rest of us are always here for u. i dunno wat started this trend of quitting but i hope that this disease does not spread to MC....we muz show everyone that we will stand united in times of trouble<br><br>i noe that a lot of ppl may not like MC, but as long as everyone's cool wif each other in the clan, who cares what ppl think!! Take for instance that apocaldog guy who wanted Rain to quit MC, he is juz one of many who are waiting for the day MC disbands, then they'll celebrate.<br>We MUZ show that we can take anything that comes our way...whether we win a clan match or lose, think positively. If we win, give a pat on ur backs for a job well done. If we lose, never mind...juz remember where u went wrong and dun make the same mistake twice. The AX match was the first clan match i lost ( except against BH in CPL ) and i learnt some things from them...they obviously put a lot of effort into training and coming up wif different tactics but im sure if we had our trainings, we could come up wif many more tactics.....once again, juz wait for the holidays to come then everyone will be free again. btw, going out to play cs wun promote teamwork, maybe going for bbq or some outing not to play cs will make us closer to one another....take me for instance i have not seen most of the MCs but if got bbq and the whole mc goes, i confirm can meet all of u guys..<br><br>lastly, i am still new to this clan but there are ppl who are newer than me ( medic, helmet, zan and cynthia ). I hope everyone would set a good example for them....Juz think of it, they worked so hard juz to get in and then ppl start leaving.... how will they feel?? lets juz give ourselves some time while we wait for the holidays to come. I hope none of u guys would ever think of quitting MC. I promise u that when the holidays r here, MC will be the united clan that it was well-known to be..<br><br>I also hope that if anyone actually wanna quit, dun say on the forum coz many of us read it.....and it lowers the morale of the clan as a whole...tell topgun or someone personally ( sorry toppy =P ) but i hope no one will do so<br><br>That's all i have to say....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm.........agreed....wat tango says make sense...we should brace ourselves up...make our selve stronger then ever....personally my opinion is tat everyone shld make it their responsiblility to the clan that they they fulfil their responsiblity as a -=MC=- and make it a point...train every week together...wat we truly lag is TEAMWORK!!!!!! and tactics not to mention.....thou i'm new..but i hope that toppie or someone else can stand out and say we make a point to train together everyweek....all of us individually is every ELITE and SKILLFUL(Except me lah) i must admit but we really teamwork...so pple....i hope u take wat i say seriously<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Destroyer ah... if you say later then type... might as well dun post first.<br>-------------------------------------<br><br>Anywayz... wat i wish to say is that we are still great frens wat.. no matter whether i'm still in MC or not. MC is after all a illusonary tag for gaming... While frenship is something that is lifelong. As i have say b4.. as long as there's still outing, i might still go if i have the time.<br><br>And one thing is i dun quit for 'reasons unheard of" Sometimes it's juz damn irritating to be kana tua all the times. . AND I MEAN ALL. not juz once or twice...<br>Also... dun post in forum abt quitting and go to toppie personally?? U think it's realli that easy to go in front of our leader and tell him u wish to quit? Perhaps u still dunno toppie i guess... go figure.<br><br>Frankly speaking... i'm veri committed to CS and i dare say that i have onli miss out on 2 clan matches. Also... I hope for the clan to win in most matches too. Especially wif me in it.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>However, I have a feeling that most guys in MC ain't that committed to CS. There's no training, nuting done watsoever to improve ourselves. Look at BH.. when they got training all 17 come down. MCs??<br>I noe most of u have your own things and probs to take care of... but then dun i have too??? Maybe it's juz that i veri eng or watever...<br><br>So i might as well quit since it's pointless to stay on. Quitting will let me put down my burden of trying to make it to every outing possible.<br>And also it will allow me to take my CS for leisure juz this once.. instead of playing everytime juz to promote MC's tag. Also... it will gimme time to solve my own problems too    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.<br>hehz I juz realised that i'm a bit too serious abt gaming and winning.. sorrie abt that...    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>anywayz correct me if i'm wrong.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Hmmm.. the new blood in MC such as Zan and Cynthia is promising.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I believe they will definitely be one of those leading MCs in the future... hehe *at least they are nvr late for outings*<br><br>------------------<br>Fallback is not an option...<br><br>[This message has been edited by foxtrot (edited 07 September 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly i think MC is a great clan. I first got to know wat is MC when i got to knew kfc, at Netshock (where we used to spend "our life" playing there, coz no egames yet") He introduced me to this guy -=MC=-shootbird, and -=MC=-Chromy. I was like captivated by them, they were so pro.<br><br>Although kfc, was like really a pro then, i only played lan game till i got to know kfc. Even then i juz intro-ed the game to Eric(sky). It was early May, when both of us started to learn how to play cs.<br><br>Everytime i got online, i was hoping to see any MC guys in there, coz i had no clan, and i hoped to join MC, though i knew i juz started and there wasn't any chance.<br><br>Soon, i joined SS clan which was based in NSC. I quitted coz i had disagreements with some of the members. Although i would like to say they are really a bunch of fun guys, especially Vernon the leader... he earned my respect coz he could actually stand in the open and snipe 5-6 guys without taking cover.<br>([SS]Overkill).<br><br>Then i trained with kfc, learnt from him. Tats how we became mass murderers on pacfusion server 3. All in the hope i could catch MC's eye someday.<br><br>I knew i did it, when iggy and funky started asking. Lots of other clans started asking bout our status too online, but i didnt want to join other clans. Coz we made a pact, me, kfc and sky would join a clan together.<br><br>Since i really wanted to join MC, they would follow me too. Now im in MC, i feel proud to be finally in MC. Even manage to get kfc, sky and funky to persuade Ducky to join, coz he was uncertain too.<br><br>True to say, although Team Songbo, hadnt really trained together. There seems to be a age gap between every member. Still im fiercely protective of all Songbo team. Even only one CPL tournament, it binded us closer together.<br><br>At first MC was VERY HAPPENING. Lots of outings and gaming. Members all very co-operative and talkative. Heh.<br><br>Now... seems like lots of people wanna quit. I agree with Tango, something is wrong here. Although Team Songbo may seem seldom involved in major MC activities, but we really put in the effort to get involved.<br><br>sky, got his 3rd year project and exams coming.<br>I got my art studies really stressful, lots of projects, and lots of personal problems<br>kfc is working full time<br>Ducky almost got grounded and banned from cs coz he went home late for the AX match<br>Funky got his own personal problems and sch stress.<br><br>I juz hope the rest of MC can be understanding.<br><br>Im sure something can be worked out for MC soon. Although most of us are not like always playing together in lan game all the time. (AX only plays lan game in their base, no online, so they are very close) Im sure most of u understand, MC members are from various walks of life. Each clan has its strength and weakness, MC is truly well diversified, lots of very strong individual talent. Once we gel together..the outcome would be unthinkable...<br>As for the time being... lets treat it as a time to learn to be understanding, not juz giving up and forget it.<br><br>Many times, in my own personal life, all my problems, i really feel like giving up. Somehow i can't seem to handle life like i handle CS. I handle CS like no problem, lose or die, come back again even stronger, im so highly motivated by MC people around me, team songbo has been so supportive of me, even when im feeling really down. (thanks to funky for keep asking me to forget bout her..nah beh,hahah)<br><br>Still as for real life..i cant seem to find the exact same motivation i have for gaming. So afraid i wont be saying "i quit MC" when i really leave this world.<br><br>Sux man...duno wat im talking bout here...so god damn emotional.<br><br>Maybe time will watever problems MC having now. Im really looking forward to having chalets and bbq with u all.<br><br>When i get my license, hopefully tomolo morning. I could join u all anywhere for late nite snacks or watever.<br>Yeah my father got lorry...provided i pass, and can get my lorry out. Then we can go anywhere piah chui.<br><br>HEHEHEHHEHEHEHHEHEHEHE.<br><br>If i got anything else to add...i will.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorrie for the late reply as u guys know IÂ’m always lagging behind. Well from day one I know that MC is not a pro Clan, I know this because Toppie actually took me in despite the fact that I had Â–Ne frags during my trial map. I luv being in MC and I luv know u guys, esp when I know some of your friends too, eg I know some of tangoÂ’s classmates, spawn and I played soccer in a basket court be4, nirvana, kukubird and Cyn are my sch mates~. The world is so small, its good to know friends who live near u, esp toppie~~ being the closest (actually thatÂ’s not too great, I still remember that faithful night! When your comp crashed!). Those outing to AMK S11 were great! Go there talk kok sing song~~ even funkie came~~ he practically just sat there and sing song where we were busy eating.<br><br>We have to be understanding~ sometimes we can spend all of our time in MC, sometimes we cant even spar a Sec. Fellow members please be understanding, losing a clan match is not that bad~ its not end of the world yet, losing is not too bad at least if we learn from our mistakes. What is there to learn or to be or to be looking forward to if we win every match~ it will be so boring.<br><br>Anyway all I have to say is this, in my option the fact that we are not getting good attendence in outings is because outings are not planed properly. Most of the time we are only imfored of outings like 1 day one a few hours be4 the outings.  Sometimes outing notices are only known throught the webby or the forum, that is not enough, why do we break in to smaller groups? (rage,songbo,C.ops) izznt it for this purpose?? I guess every member in MC is equally important no matter u are new or old ranking does not make a difference of couse being in different group does not make a difference. The leaders of repective groups should be responsible to imform their members abt outings, no not just thru irc, icq, forum but then thru phone. Of couse the leader need not imform the whole gourp he can ask some of the older members to help call up the newer guys.<br><br>Well it takes 2 hand to clap, IÂ’m prepared to organise the chalet and to do up the new webbie~ but my affort alone is not enough, pls do chip in your help if u can. It ok if you dun but remember MC is not about me, its not about u, Its about all of US.<br><br>My 2 cents worth<br><br>------------------<br>-=MC=-Koyo<br>"Mess with the best,<br><strong>DIE</strong> like the rest"</div>
