              <p>Hey. I'm 15 and I just completed my Grade 8 in piano. In my opinion, you should go for a graded piano course. You'll be more motivated to practise, and correspondingly, you'll improve faster. You save both time and money if you do it this way. If you want more info, feel free to PM me.</p>

              <p>Haa. Glad that you made up your mind to pursue your interest. May I ask which school would you be attending for your beginner course? And learning the piano requires a lot of patience. I am for one, pretty much of a late bloomer, I only enjoyed after many many years of coaching from my teachers. </p>
              <p>If you are going for long term, please get a piano, not those keyboard, if you take good care of it, it can last you for 10years. Choose the piano according to your own touch and feel. Different people have different preference, different piano, even if the same model is different too. </p>
              <p>Classical gives you a broader perspective. See where your interest lies. If you know classical, chances are you are able to play pop out, if you know pop, there is a chance that you cannot play the classical pieces due to technical difficulties and other interpretations. </p>

              <p>if i like those sad sad songs and also peace full songs but not most of those happy ones then it should be classical ? and also as i live in HDB , i dun tink i can get the traditional ones, as technology advances at a rapid pace, i guess there should be digital pianos costing 1k + thats the same as traditional pianos ? i was told that by cristofort(dono spelling) music school.</p>
              <p>and also yah i'm be going for Abrsm, no point just learning piano without qualifications = wasting money</p>

              <p>Eh, personally I don't really like Cristofori pianos as I don't think their lower ends one are very great. I have a few students who uses them, but I feel that it won't last in the long run. If you do want to invest in a digital one. I recommend Yamaha Digital Grand Series. The 88 Keys. As for which model, I guess you can choose it according to your own preference of sound and touch. Some sounds a little too digital. Get those that come with a sustain pedal, most should come with it anyway. </p>
              <p>Not all sad peaceful songs are classical songs. Some of the New Age songs do fit your criteria. You can check out Secret Garden and Joe Hisaishi just to name a few. Feel free to ask me if you do have any queries. =) </p>

              <p>i still think classical is the best. even if i like some of the non-classical songs and i noe the basics of piano . there shouldn't be problem in me reading the</p>
              <p>script/score/whatever u call for the piece of paper that shows u the musical notes</p>
              <p>and playing from there. Hmm okae i'll take into consideration haha thanks for telling me Yamaha!</p>

              <p>lol. If you are talking about the damn good ones, and also extremely expensive, it would be Steinway &amp; Sons and Bosendorfer (There are some others too, but these 2 are more prestigiously recognised). <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> Haa, just tell you for your knowledge. Ppl like us won't buy it. It's too expensive. </p>
              <p>There are second hand pianos, which are decent and at a cheaper price. You might consider getting them. There is a second hand piano dealer at IMM, cannot remember which floor. But I last went there 5 years ago, so whether they are still there or not, I'm not very sure. You can also try out Piano Man at Paya Lebar. Get a honest dealer or you might be sold piano which are not up to standard. </p>
              <p>Some brands to consider: Kawai, Baldwin, Yamaha, Schiller, Wilhelm, Schimmel, Steinberg, Young Chang.</p>
              <p>For Schiller and Young Chang, I tried them in a piano shop in S.Korea, Singapore dealers should have them, but for the brand consistencies, im not too sure. There are a few piano dealers at Peace centre that area, check them out. </p>

              <p>hmm okay but i'm not interested in things used by other people...cuz i'm not those that collect what others do not want...so i'm going for brand new ones ^^</p>
              <p>but whatever the case..still the quality and sound that matches a grand piano or good piano would be the ideal choice haha</p>
