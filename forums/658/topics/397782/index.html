Alphabeat</p>
              </div>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding: 0px;">The second album by the Danish pop act Alphabeat has been and largely gone, to reviews ranging from lukewarm to savage. I enjoyed it, partly because of its brazen revivalist intentions. It summoned a throng of 1990s pop ghosts, from Ace of Base to Corona, and running through it were the huge, sad keyboard sounds of 90s trance records – great glass spears of melancholy sending me back to a time I never realised I could miss.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding: 0px;">Back in the 1990s, wags like me would occasionally quip that the decade couldn't be revived; it was already such a hotchpotch of half-borrowed styles that any music drawing on it would be a Xerox of a Xerox. I was being silly. With time, the differences between, say, Britpop and the 60s and 80s music that sometimes inspired it seem sharper. The fact Cigarettes and Alcohol borrows from T. Rex is the least relevant thing about it – the way it fitted into its time and the lives of its listeners is more important.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding: 0px;">This is how successful revivals work: like a storytelling tradition, ideas are passed down a generation with the details changing in whatever way the new audience needs them to. Why this happens isn't hard to understand: pop music is identified with youth by critics, marketers and former youths alike, but there's mountains of it already, and most is not itself terribly young. Trying to make sense of the music that shaped you is a noble endeavour, and nothing new. From one angle much British music of the 70s – from Roxy Music to Showaddywaddy to the Sex Pistols – seems like an attempt to work out what to do with 50s rock'n'roll. It was a music waking up to the fact that it had a history, reacting with fascination and repulsion, and transforming itself in the process.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding: 0px;">That's the good side of revivalism. The element I'm less keen on – though it's inseparable – is the aspirational return, where musicians and fans see pop's history as a rebuke to its inferior present. Think the reverent attitude of 80s singers (and ad men) to 60s soul, or the sudden descent of Britpop from sharp songs about brushing your teeth to Deep Purple covers. Or more recently the way La Roux was marketed as bringing "weirdness" back to the charts – but a wholesome, Hovis kind of oddness: quirky the way quirky was in 1982.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding: 0px;">There's also a humbler type of revival – a personal trip to the dressing-up box that doesn't relate to anything much. Goldfrapp's new album, for instance, mostly sees them excavating a particular seam of 80s European disco-pop – synthetic and spacey, the kind of music where a Syndrum is only a bar or two away. The single Rocket comes with an "eight four" and a "one zero" remix, just to emphasise the time-jumping. In one way, the Goldfrapp album is a delightful LP; in another, it's so well-observed as to be disorienting.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding: 0px;">That is the problem for a listener of the right age: having your memory tweaked so expertly can feel manipulative. The last I'd heard of Alphabeat were the extraordinary Pete Hammond mixes of their Boyfriend single. Hammond, a studio engineer for Stock Aitken and Waterman's PWL Records, turned his mix into a perfect, indulgent recreation of their sound, every lattice of hi-NRG beats and crisp synth hits positioned just so. It was a genuine guilty pleasure for me, not because the music was naff but because it was so exactly pitched at a pop fan of my age that it felt a little like a trap.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding: 0px;">Alphabeat's new material can feel that way too, though for now the trap's a novel and tempting one. It puts them just ahead of a 1990s revival that seems inevitable. My only question is what its dominant strain will be – creative storytelling, reactionary finger-wagging or just treating the decade as a costume shop. We might be spared the worst effects of reverence, as the 90s' now-disreputable irony should inoculate it against becoming a moral lesson for modern pop. But as always the real interest will be in musicians who can take the 90s' nostalgic toolkit and use it to surprise the people who remember it as much as the ones who don't.</p>
