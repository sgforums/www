              <p>We are currently working on a project concerning the local music scene. And we have just 2 questions that we need help in.</p>
              <p>1)
              What is your opinion in the saying that local artistes are too
              impatient in making a breakthrough thus eventually hindering their
              progress.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) ( We have no intention of any sort to offend anyone &amp; so, we ask anyone who answers this question to be open about it)</p>
              <p>Do
              you think there is a race issue when Singaporeans do not support local
              bands/singers which are mainly made up of Malays/Philippinos.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>1. no. you first need to dissect the industry. in the chinese scene, singapore is relatively successful. tanya's recent award, ah du in china, etc. all points to a good pool of singapore talents recognized overseas and locally.  in the malays scene, i think singapore artiste is also relatively ok altho' i dun follow the scene well. it is the english artistes/bands that's struggling. as to whether they are impatient, i think not. some preservered but it is an uphill task if you have a general music population in singapore that is shallow-minded and think anything non-singapore is better, you have your work cut out for you. this could be compounded that our musicianship is also a bit lagging. you go listen to some of them play live and they suck.</p>

              <p>Pick up a copy of 'Live' magazine, visit the pubs where there are live music acts, judge their quality for yourselves and talk to the musicians and editors. Many of them know that the market here is small but they still need to build up a following first,</p>
              <p>Go to HMV and Gramaphone, and judge the albums by Electrico, Shirlyn Tan, Plain Sunset and Jack &amp; Rai for yourselves. As with the live acts, you'll find that race has little to do with quality.</p>
              <p>But first, you need to decide specifically what you're going to focus on. 'Local music scene' is just too vague - here you have amateurs and recreational musicians, and among the professional musicians there are Chinese acts, English local acts and expat musicians, and they have had various levels of success.</p>

              <p>1. I can't be too sure about question one because I don't pay much attention to the local music scene.</p>
              <p>2. Nope. I think lots of Singaporeans don't support local music, period. Regardless of race. I mean, my personal opinion is that music from overseas is so much better. Like for example, from America. So the thing is, if we can support music overseas, why should we support local music? Therefore, lots of us don't. Well, I don't anyway. And it has nothing to do with race at all. I simply like music from American artists more. (:</p>

              <p><br>1. The local music scene can be classified into two distinct categories..i.e Doing so as their career and as their hobby/pastime. Singers like Taufik,Stefanie,Tanya,JJ and others normally manage to break into the market because they are managed by recording companies full time with each having their own minder, make up unit and manager. According to the budget of the recording company, these artists may have to produce 1 or 2 albums every year. Hence, it is wrong when you say that local artistes are impatient because they are not given enough opportunities to do so.</p>
              <p>2. I think you have to delve in the local scene because the local music is so diversified! All chinese English rock bands include Ronin, Electrico, West Grand Boulevard, Penn State, Karl Maka, MarchTwelve, Deviant and Slumsville. All Malays English bands include Airsick Pilots, Acid9 (ahem ahem), Plain Sunset, One Men Army, Forced Vomit, Fish tank and firefight.. Then got the ang moh ones like the Saw Loser..then got the mixed races band like The Observatory, Flybar, Allura, Blind Meets Mute and Breed Her Agony..Then the indian ones like Raksasa, Shurva, Sarganis, KellBathur and Omm...there are so many gigs going on..such as Baybeats and the Rockstar Collective Fundraiser concert to raise awareness of such bands...</p>
