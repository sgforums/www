              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">Bubblegum Dancer counts down the <em><strong>best bubblegum ballads ever written</strong></em>!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">_________ __ _</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><img class="alignright" style="float: right;" title="Miss Papaya" src="http://www.bubblegumdancer.com/Images/misspapaya/misspapaya_03-01.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="200"><strong>#30 :: Miss Papaya – Please Don’t Leave Me Tonight</strong><br>Miss Papaya sings her cheesy ballad from her 1998 album “Pink”.  The song itself is quite pretty, and I like how she has continued to use sexual innuendos even in this ballad (“never knew that your loving could touch me oh so deep”).  For me, Linnea’s Papaya voice doesn’t do this song justice, and it would have been better if she had sung it with her normal vocals.  Please Don’t Leave Me Tonight therefore falls at #30 on my list.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#29. :: Combayah – Free</strong><br>A ballad is usually an artist’s way of showing how good they are at singing as they challenge their range and tuning best.  “Free” is the ballad of Combayah’s album “Fantasy Dreamworld” from 1998, and the vocalist Batizba does a good job.  I like the power in the chorus and the message that this song conveys.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong># 28. :: Yummie – 7 Seas</strong><br>When I first heard this song, I actually didn’t like it at all.  But “7 Seas” is actually a very beautiful song and was a favourite of the group members.  The song has a beautiful message that we can all relate to, and Qute’s vocals are good, though I think more harmony behind her may have improved this song.  I love the bridge part of this song, it is very strong.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#27. :: Smile.dk – Nothing’s Missing (For Once In My Life)</strong><br>This was the token ballad release from Smile.dk’s 2008 album “Party Around The World”.  Both Hanna and Veronica’s singing abilities are outstanding, and they really shine in this song.  I like the instruments used, and the bridge up to the chorus is outstanding.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#26. :: Rollergirl – Eternal Flame</strong><br>Rollergirl covers The Bangles beautiful love song of the same name in her album “Now I’m Singin’…And The Party Keeps On Rollin’” (2000).  While I do like The Bangles version more, Rollergirl sticks to the original and while she doesn’t make it better, she doesn’t make it worse either.  She also released a dance mix, which I do not like.  “Eternal Flame” is one of the most beautiful love songs of all time.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#25. :: The Fireman – Flames Of Love</strong><br>This is one of the more creative ballads and The Fireman does a great job sticking to their cheesy, fire-inspired image.  The lyrics are hilarious “when you put out a fire, when you drive your big red truck”… The music is actually (surprisingly) very pretty, and I don’t think the cheesy female vocals do this song justice (just like Miss Papaya’s ballad).  However, the concept works well, and since this song is very pretty it earns position #25 on my list.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong><img class="alignright" style="float: right;" title="Crispy" src="http://www.bubblegumdancer.com/Images/crispy/photos/photos/9531_177976220434_739460434.jpg" alt="" width="151" height="200">#24. :: Crispy – Love Is Waiting</strong><br>This is an eerie track with a haunting melody that will echo in your head forever.  At first I didn’t like Crispy’s ballads at all, Mette’s vocals don’t seem to suite slow music in my opinion.  However, on that note I praise “Love Is Waiting” for its originality as a bubblegum ballad.  It’s one of the more spooky songs, and on an album with cheesy candy-coated dance anthems, this song stands out.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#23. :: Bubbles – Fall In Love</strong><br>By the time the Bubbles girls released this song they were maturing as teenagers, and their vocal talents were growing stronger.  This is one of my favourite songs from “Inbetween” (2002) and is absolutely beautiful.  The girls voices mesh together perfectly.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#22. :: Banaroo – Coming Home For Christmas</strong><br>Some of the most beautiful songs written are christmas related, and as you can see, I have included a lot on this list.  “Coming Home For Christmas” is my favourite from Banaroo’s Christmas World album.  It’s a very pretty ballad with a strong chorus and nice verses.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#21. :: BeFour – Hand in Hand</strong><br>I can only assume that BeFour and Banaroo’s music is written by the same people, and the flavour of “Hand In Hand” is very much like Coming Home For Christmas.  However, I feel that it is just a little bit better, in both song writing and singing talent.  From all of the German bubblegum pop groups, I actually think BeFour are the best singers and their English pronunciation is better.  “Hand in Hand” is a lovely song with a gorgeous message.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#20. :: Ch!pz – Christmas Time Is Here</strong><br>This is Ch!pz’s only ballad release and is (naturally) Christmas related.  It was included on their Present:Past:Future album, on Part II.  I like this more than Banaroo and BeFour’s song, and I think the singers do a very good job – especially the girls.  Chipz truly captures the mood of christmas in this song.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#19. :: Creamy – It Can Happen To You</strong><br>The girls of Creamy are very talented vocalists and released some very pretty ballads.  I feel that “It Can Happen To You” is their strongest, and is about a girl who is lucky to have found love and ensures the audience that it can happen to them too.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#18. :: Djumbo – Made To Love You</strong><br>This may be a little bit faster than most of the ballads here, but I still think it falls into the ballad category.  “Made To Love You” is a very pretty song and one of the highlights from Djumbo’s debut album Jump from 2005.  The girls vocals are gorgeous, and I really love the mix of English and Dutch in this song.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong><img class="alignright" style="float: right;" title="Rebecca" src="http://www.bubblegumdancer.com/Images/rebecca/rebecca.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="200">#17. :: Rebecca – Love Is The Hand</strong><br>Rebecca from England recorded this beautiful song for her 2000 album “In My Dreams”.  “Love Is The Hand” is a love song about her wanting her dream guy to come rescue her.  Rebecca has one of the prettiest voices I have heard, and this song really does her justice.  I can’t imagine anyone else singing this song better.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#16.  Machoman – I Will Always Love Me</strong><br>A more comical ballad from Machoman, this is more of a parody of a love song as it is about how Machoman will always love himself.  The singer behind this project, Britt Eliskov, does a great job and while the song is extremely cheesy, I still take it seriously as a ballad as it is indeed very pretty.  You’ll love Machoman too after you hear this.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#15. :: Smile.dk – Counting On You</strong><br>“Counting On You” is my favourite ballad from Smile.dk, and it’s no surprise that it was written for their 2000 album “Future Girls” which in my opinion is their best.  Veronica’s lead vocals are absolutely perfect, and we really get an idea of how amazing these girls’ voices really are.  I love the “counting” concept of this song, and the clever lyrics (“it’s like an equation, it’s causing frustration).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#14. :: Tiggy – Falling</strong><br>“Lock the door and show me that you want me” – the first sentence of this song is incredibly strong, and you can instantly tell that this will be a great song.  Tiggy has one of the best voices in bubblegum, and it’s only in ballads like this that we really appreciate her true vocal talent as she tends to send in a more high-pitched nasally voice for her upbeat music.  “Falling” is a beautiful song about falling in love that has a perfect arrangement that flows great from start to finish.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#13. :: Evelyn – One More Try</strong><br>This is actually one of my all time favourite songs by Evelyn and was released on her second album “I Wanna Dance,” which is very rare.  The production is wonderful and works well with Evelyn’s deeper voice.  I love the “whistling” sounds in this song.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#12. :: Passion Fruit – Do You Remember</strong><br>Passion Fruit’s “Do You Remember” was released on their debut album “Spanglish Love Affairs” in 2000.  This is the saddest and most dramatic bubblegum ballad I have ever heard.  Two of the Passion Fruit members died on a plane crash shortly after this album was released, and the message in this song is eerily appropriate.  An incredibly powerful ballad that has earned its place at #12.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#11. :: QT – Stranger</strong><br>QT was one of the first ever bubblegum dance projects, and was more of a musical experiment into a number of different styles.  Some people have dubbed her the “Celine of Bubblegum” due to the many ballads on her album.  “Stranger” is a beautiful love song about falling in love with a stranger.  Duets are not common on Bubblegum releases, and I feel that both QT and the male vocalist did an amazing job with “Stranger”.  Another notable mention by QT is “Candles,” though I feel that her duet “Stranger” is the best.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#10. :: Toy-Box – Teddy Bear</strong><br>Anila and Amir were very proud of “Teddy Bear”, and promoted it as a single and on the radio, even making a music video.  However, being a bubblegum ballad, its success was limited, and therefore “Teddy Bear” did not receive the recognition it deserves.  I love this song, it is one of the cutest love songs ever written.  Anila’s vocals really shine in this song, it’s undoubtedly one of Toy-Box’s best releases.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#9. :: Crispy – Always On My Mind (Swedish Version)</strong><br>The original version of Always On My Mind was never one of my favourites as the production wasn’t very strong.  For the Swedish release of The Game (1998), Crispy completely re-produced the song, adding harmony to Mette’s vocals as well as extra backup parts, and more detailed instrumentals.  “Always On My Mind” is one of the catchiest bubblegum ballads, and has a great message that I’m sure everyone can relate to.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#8. :: Aqua – Turn Back Time</strong><br>One of Aqua’s most famous songs, though a song that most people don’t recognize as Aqua, “Turn Back Time” was Aqua’s first breakthrough single in the UK, and was featured on the movie soundtrack to Sliding Doors.  Labelled as a “one hit wonder” with their single Barbie Girl, Aqua shocked the world when they released Turn Back Time, proving that they are indeed an incredibly talented band.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong><img class="alignright" style="float: right;" title="Tiggy" src="http://www.bubblegumdancer.com/Images/tiggy/photos/A-141722-1124190033.jpg" alt="" width="196" height="268">#7. :: Tiggy – Give Me</strong><br>Charlotte Vigel is an amazing vocalist, and “Give Me” is the one song by her that actually gives me goosebumps.  This is an exceptional example of song writing and singing, and Tiggy hits the notes perfectly.  She sings without the help of backup or harmony, which is incredible, and all of the verses flow beautifully together.  The song is simply produced, with piano and synths, that gives the song a dramatic feel and works well with her album’s fantasy theme.  This is easily one of the best bubblegum ballads ever.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#6. :: A-Moe – Forever In My Mind</strong><br>A-Moe’s release “Beauty and the Beast” in 2005 came as a big surprise and can be described as a mix of Bubblegum dance and death metal.  “Forever In My Mind” is a haunting vocal performance by Natalie Davadi.  I think there is a little bit of auto tuning that gives her vocals a “trance-like” feeling.  “Forever In My Mind” is an incredibly powerful song, and one of the most memorable bubblegum ballads of all time.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#5.  Aqua – We Belong To The Sea</strong><br>Released on their second album “Aquarius” in 2000, Aqua once again proves that their music writing talents go far beyond catchy dance music.  “We Belong To The Sea” is an uplifting, beautiful song with exceptional vocals by both Lene and Rene.  The song’s style can even be compared to that of the ocean itself – flowing, relaxing, and calm – yet incredibly powerful.  Lene really shines in this song, and it will always be a favourite of mine.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#4. :: Blue 4 U – The Cage</strong><br>A less known group, Blue 4 U are best known for their single “The Furby Song”.  They released an album “The Blue Experience” in 1999 that included a number of great songs.  In my opinion, “The Cage” is one of the most beautiful songs ever written.  It has a very strong message about escaping from “the cage” (a metaphor for a difficult and challenging life) and has a raspy, very “real” production about it that makes you feel like it was really sung and written from the heart.  This song has a lot of meaning, and at 5:50 it is very long, but once I start listening – I can never stop.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#3. :: Fast Food Rockers – I Love Christmas</strong><br>This was the Fast Food Rockers’ last ever release, and in my opinion not only their best track but THE best Christmas song ever written.  It may not be a “real” ballad, as it has beats, but I couldn’t create a list about beautiful songs without mentioning “I Love Christmas”.  The girls’ vocals are truly beautiful in this song, and you’ll find yourself smiling no matter what your mood.  The lyrics are cheesy, just like the Fast Food Rockers like it, but they fit perfectly.  “I Love Christmas” sums up the spirit of Christmas perfectly.  This is an another example of a flawless masterpiece, and it should have been a huge hit for the Fast Food Rockers.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong><img class="alignright" style="float: right;" title="Aquarius" src="http://www.bubblegumdancer.com/Images/aqua/Photos/aqua_33-01.jpg" alt="" width="196" height="200">#2. :: Aqua – Aquarius</strong><br>Aqua’s second album “Aquarius” is absolutely riddled with amazing ballads, and the title track “Aquarius” is a perfect example.  Lene’s voice is absolutely incredible in this song, and the beautiful instrumentals that accompany her compliment her give me chills.  I hope that Aqua returns to their roots and records another song as amazing as Aquarius for their new album this year.  There’s absolutely nothing negative to say about this song – it’s pure perfection.  As always, Aqua does it best.  It’s no wonder they’re the best known.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><strong>#1.  Aqua – Goodbye To The Circus</strong><br>“Goodbye To The Circus” represents the end of Aqua, and their promise that they will one day be back.  I think this is the most beautiful bubblegum ballad ever written, and the fact that they kept their promise and did indeed return (even modeling their initial return after this song by dressing up as circus characters), makes this song even more special.  It was a tough decision choosing between Aqua’s “Aquarius” and “Goodbye To The Circus”, but because of this special meaning, I feel that Circus wins.  “Goodbye To The Circus” is an absolute masterpiece.  With expert production and the most beautiful vocals from Lene and Rene, I feel that “Goodbye To The Circus” deserves the title as the best bubblegum ballad ever.</p>

              <p>Lianamaster, long time no see. How are you?</p>
              <p>It is not because that Aqua is not continuing to produce anything.</p>
              <p>The reason that Aqua now is not producing "Bubblegum Eurodance" like in the past is the cause of this petition.</p>
              <p>The two tracks above represents general pop songs from the electropop genre.</p>
              <p>Similar to Cascada who have dropped the Eurodance flavour nowadays and go for the electropop genres.</p>

              <p>Yo Bangulzai, I am fine after my exams, but busy preparing for the next semester.</p>
              <p>Now still have some time to spare for SgF. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>Oic, if it's that specific genre u are referring, then that's certainly well missed.</p>
