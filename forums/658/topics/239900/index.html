            <div class='col-md body'>it is also a chicken n egg situation....if local english acts release rubbish music, i.e. poor mixing, mediocre sound engineering, etc., who could be bothered? but if there is no support from the vested group in general, i.e. investors, music labels, etc., how can they grow.....?<br><br>My other theory is tt a lot of local english music acts dun take their craft seriously; it is essentially a platform for them to attain their 15mins of fame, get some chicks and then it's back to their day job.<br><br>Also, they want to `pau ka liao'. instead of engaging the professionals to work on their songs, they are protective and wanted to attempt everything themselves. This is self-limiting. And the `dun want to sell-out' mentality is over-rated here in sg.<br><br>Of all the existing English acts here, who do you think will make it big (regionally?) electrico was selected for a music fest in the usa this year. however, catchy tunes as they are, i dun quite like their music......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think there's a lack of the culture... a lot of the heavily westernized demographic of Singapore are westernized not because they really represent a unique Singaporean take on our western influences but because they have been dazzled by anything froming from the west.<br><br>But if you are talking about a uniquely english Singaporean culture, there's still a lot of taking anything from the west instead of truly knowing ourselves to deal with. If we don't know ourselves, we certainly won't identify with any of the music in that language from our local acts.<br><br>As such, it's difficult for local english acts to break into this, given that by any extension they are their logical audience... and the audience does not want to listen yet.<br><br>But I think some of them are seriously good, Corrinne May is very talented... though she had to move to LA to survive as an artiste.</div>

The place is literally teething with bands and musicians. I think if you were to count, it would be in the thousands!<br><br>If a big marketing company like Sony BMG or Warner Music picks up a local bands act on MySpace, it would definitely go BIG...but that's taking that the CD be marketed mainly in the States. If it were to just be local, not much of a living there...<br><br>Now, as long as you appear on MTV with your music videos showing, you get your stuff out to a lot of people. Kids are watching MTV like it's their bible. Their music tastes are shaped out with what is mainstream and a definition of cool...even a crappy music can get you huge, just with the correct marketing. So basically, good music don't get you anywhere, anymore...the marketing company does.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
