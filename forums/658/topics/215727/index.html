Are those considered illegal since we havent form companies yet? If they are then all those legal mp3 file creation software are hence illegal? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>How about compilations of mp3s that are remixed and merged into a single mp3? Are these still consider illegal since the content are no longer similar versus the individual counterparts? Do they have to set up a panel of song critics who spends the whole day comparing and contrasting the remix with the individual songs?</div>
