Sound engineer H Sridhar passed away in December due to cardiac arrest and the cause of MJâ€™s death is still a mystery.<br><br>Consequently, Rahman has decided to put together a special album as a mark of respect to MJ. Of late, Rahman has been making several trips to the US because his secret dream project is ready to take off. Artistes from all across the globe will contribute to this album. It is believed that the album will have a few recreated songs of MJ, along with Rahmanâ€™s original compositions.<br><br>The King of Popâ€™s untimely and mysterious death unsettled Rahman. A source said, â€œThe two deaths one after the other made Rahman realise the uncertainty of life. These tragedies have made him more spiritual.â€ï¿½<br><br>Rahman had earlier said, â€œArtistes and their art lives for ever. My late sound engineer Sridhar had brought me a video of the premiere of Michaelâ€™s Remember the Time when I was recording the track Kadal Rojave for my first movie Roja. That afternoon, that video inspired all of us. Now, there is no Sridhar and no Jackson anymore.â€ï¿½<br><br>Rahman was looking forward to working with MJ whom he had met during the Oscar Awards in Los Angeles earlier this year. Talking about his meeting with the pop star, Rahman had said, â€œMJ was concerned about contemporary developmental issues such as global warming, wars and their consequences. He asked me to compose a unity anthem on the lines of We are the World for him. I nodded in awe.â€ï¿½<br><br>When asked about the album, Rahman, who is going LA this week, said cautiously, â€œItâ€™s too early to talk about it. Talking about it right now may jeopardise things.â€ï¿½<br><br><br>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/news-interviews/Rahman-pays-tribute-to-MJ/articleshow/4888197.cms<br>Â <br><br>Rahman fever</p></div>
