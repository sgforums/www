              <p>I feel like I am the only one among the people I know who dont enjoy music of today.</p>
              <p>No matter how much I was exposed to or try to like the new music and artistes, it just doesnt impress me at all. Lets face it, no matter how, we can never escape from the exposure of these materials.</p>
              <p>Music of the 80s and 90s still the best for me. And the artistes who I love listening to are all from that era, some from the 70s. Im a big fan of those 80s rock bands like Bon Jovi, Metallica, Megadeth, Bryan Adams, Mr. Big, Scorpions, Guns N Roses etc. Also Michael Jackson, Richard Marx are my favs. I do listen to other genres like ballads or soul, but those in the 80s and 90s only. 80s party music are definitely yes to me as the sound is so happy and energetic.</p>
              <p>Its very hard for me to like new music, even though its from my fav bands. The only new stuff that I enjoy is Megadeth's latest album.</p>
              <p>Artistes such as Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Bruno Mars or rockers like Linkin Park, Coldplay or other current popular acts are so not for me.</p>
              <p>Im wondering is it becuz of this I have difficulty to get around with people or what. And I also love music from video games I played.</p>
              <p>I wonder if any of you know of people whose music taste are similar to me.</p>

              People are not defined only by their choice of music. There is something wrong if you think that is the only barrier between you and your peers. Go figure.</p>
              <p> 'New' does not necessarily mean 'good', and the market of contemporary pop/rock music is much bigger than what's on Singapore radio. Set your own criteria, go to websites like Last.FM and Spin to find some lesser-known acts and decide for yourself. Amazon and the iTunes store will also suggest "similar artists" to the ones you are listening to. You may not find anything you like though because the technology back then produced a different sound.</p>

              <p>I don't like pop music either. It sounds like trash to me. In fact , if you ask me , music from people like erm.. Lady Gaga , Rihinna (not sure how you spell it) , Black Eye Peas are just spawn offs of Trance music in it's 2008 to current state. <br>The sweeps , supersaws.. Which is considered "outdated" in the EDM scene already. Hip-Hop , does it still exist? All that's left is sampled beats and that sample annoying chord progression again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And it's always the same four chord progressions . Boring. Lyrically wise , it's always about some sort of love , getting high , wasted , and.. I can't think of anything else.</p>
              <p>Music isn't evolving , it's dying. It's dying because of the current generation. They don't want complicated , intricate music. Maybe it's because it's easier to listen to simple music , I don't know. Personally , modern day music is like.. Eating out at KFC or other fast food outlets? It's simple , it's fast , it's enough to fill you up.</p>
              <p>It has become a business , a plot. It's no longer an art. All artists and contract labels want are the $$. I remembered on American Idol , some rapper ( can't remember who ) made a guest appearence about a contest where fans write lyrics for his songs , and he says something like , "So I ended doing nothing much , just like always." Just like always. That shows how much singers really care about their songs , while the rest is done by the producer. If singers don't care about their songs , you think they will care about music as an art?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To the OP , I listen to Dream Theater , Opeth , Racer X , Primus , A7X , Slipknot..<br>Heavy metal stuff .. Which itself is quite dying away I guess.. But I actually listen to mainstream bands , since that's where my guitar level is somewhere at o_0.<br><br>I could proceed to talk about how every single genre is dying, but that would take too long..</p>

              <p>Weird? I like 60s 70s 80s music and movies and my friend never said i'm weird ever.<br><br>Although not easy to find but i do have a friend whom although not exclusively, but enjoys them too. </p>
              <p>I also believe it has no direct relation in knowing/relating to people. As least for me, it did not affect, or could possibly brought me more topics to talk about making new friends. <br><br>Anyway i more into bands like blondie, B-52s, they might be giants, a flock of seagulls, herman';s hermit,pet shop boys etc etc... Can tell that you're more into metal rock la but u can try these bands..<br><br>If u dont mind singers also can try like bonnie tyler, sandra lauer, tom tom club etc etc...<br><br>I am blabering, i tink because i am thrilled to find people who enjoys the  previous decades arts. <br><br><br>U like olden movies? Watch audrey hepburn, my favourite actress of all time! also classic like clockwork orange mulberry drive clerks etc etc...<br><br><br>Go on and enjoy man... maybe we can exchange some nice bands!</p>
