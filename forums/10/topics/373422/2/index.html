              <p><span>Reference Research Paper: <a style="color: #22229c;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/EP073984414.pdf">The Chronic Dependence of Popular Religiosity upon Dysfunctional Psychosociological Conditions</a><br><br>The link is above for those interested in reading this in-depth. But to summarise it:<br><br>In recent years, it had been claimed and assumed by multiple researchers that humans were innately religious, because of the prevalence in religion in human societies since time immemorial, and that the rising secularism in human society since the 19th-20th century is but a recent phenomenon. </span></p>
              <p>On the same tangent, plenty of religious people contend that their religion, be it Christianity, Islam or Buddhism (but I don't consider Buddhism a 'religion' per se) provides a strong moral compass for whichever society it resides in, and is generally beneficial to society. I disagree with both contentions.</p>

              <p>Since the dawn of time throughout the history of the Homo Sapien, he has always been curious of his environment, and those that captivate his mind are the mysteries of the unknown matters in his time and space.</p>
              <p>From ignorance, the Homo Sapien first worshipped Lightning and Thunder -  then the Fire, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars.</p>
              <p>When the faculties of the Homo Sapien became developed and able to grasp the origins of lightning, thunder, fire - it led to a redefiniion to all these elements as no longer being God.</p>
              <p>It has always been the power of the mysterious unknown shrouded by superstition that has kept in check the wayward ways of the Homo Sapien.</p>
              <p>Religion has also similar influential powers through its teachings of the Final Justice that will need to be faced.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br>The data gathered in this paper suggest that increased religiosity in society does not correlate at all with a more stable or harmonious society in both social and economic factors. The top five ranked nations, Sweden, Denmark, Japan, Norway and Holland are all noted for their secularism, and strong values in a stable society indicated by low rates of homicides, suicides, incarceration (number of people put in jail), STD rates, life satisfaction index, marriage duration and abortions, and economic equality.</p>
              <p>The United States, on the other hand, has a very strong culture of publicly declared religiosity (no American politician could hope to be elected to office unless they were publicly declared Christians, or were Jews), and has indications of high social and economic instability at the same time.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Has "religion" any relations to the "social / economic dysfuntion" of any society ?</p>
              <p>While the author attempts to compare the "intensity of being religious" to affect the results in the statistics of the social ills observed, there are erroneous conclusions in the claims made. </p>
              <p>Firstly, how was the conclusion made in determining that - <em>"the top five ranked nations, Sweden, Denmark, Japan, Norway and Holland are all noted for their secularism"</em> ?</p>
              <p>Is <em>"secular"</em>  intended to be a distinct separation of Church and State; or allowing the Church to  co-exist without the need for any patronage from the State ?</p>
              <p>If by "secular" it is meant that the general population are non-religious, then nothing can be more wrong as seen from the gems that correct the wrong claims made as displayed below :-</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Sweden#Religion">‘One fifth of Swedes chose to describe themselves as believing in God, while the majority (78 percent) of the population belongs to the Church of Sweden – the Lutheran Church that separated from the State in 2000’ (*1); </a></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Denmark#Religion">‘In Denmark, the Evangelical Lutheran Church is state supported, and accounts for 83 per cent of Denmark’s reglious affiliation’. (*2); </a></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Japan#Religion">‘Shinto and Budhism are Japan’s two major religions, and have been co-existing for several centuries – with most Japanese considering themselves Buddhist , Shintoist or both’ (*3). </a></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Norway#Religion">‘The Lutheran Church of Norway is the state church with 86 per cent of Norwegians being Lutherans, 3.5 per cent being Protestants, and 1 per cent being Catholics’ (*4) </a></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_Netherlands#Demographics">‘In the Netherlands (Holland) - the largest group of her population consist of 26.6 per cent being Roman Catholics, while the rest is distributed over a multitude of Protestant Church in the Netherlands forming 16.8 per cent as Protestants, and 43.4 per cent as Christians – with no religious affiliation forming 42.7 per cent of her citizenry’(*5). </a></p>
              <p> If the above shows the flaw in the claim to secularism in the top five nations, then this will lead to the second flawed claim in the conclusion that the intensity "of secularism and social values will be seen in <em>the low rates of homicides, suicides, incarceration (number of people put in jail), STD rates, life satisfaction index, marriage duration and abortions, and economic equality"</em>.</p>
              <p>Was it correct to compare the low indices in social ills found in these top five nations compared to the USA - when it is obvious that population size will affect the statistics with an increased potential to higher frequency of social ills occurring compared to a smaller size population ?</p>
              <p>Is it correct to place the cause of social dysfunction being caused by higher rate of religiousity ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br>My contention out of all this, is that the more evolved humans have proven themselves to not need God any longer. They have made for themselves, societies which have benign social and economic environments that do not create much stress to the point that people need to turn to the irrational supernatural (religion) for comfort or solace. It is true that humans have always relied on religion until very recently, but only because civilization was still very much in flux until the 21st century in a select few nations when its inhabitants have decided for themselves that God was no longer needed.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Man's need for answers to the unknown - the supra-natural - has resulted in the creation of religious worship to placate his superstitious being.</p>
              <p>When the Homo Sapien becomes more learned with scientific and philosophical discoveries and thinking, he should be less superstitious and will develop a higher intellect to seek the abstract quality in a God that is worthy of his developed intelligence.</p>
              <p>Will the Homo Sapien ever reach the point in its intellectual development to decide that he will no longer need a more Superior Being ?</p>
              <p>Societies and Religions are the hallmark of the intellect of the Homo Sapien - can it be anything less ?</p>
              <p>Social stresses appear in a society of Homo Sapiens not due to poor planning but due to environmental factors beyond the control of the Homo Sapiens.</p>
              <p>Weather can play havoc to agriculture produces that result in increased breakdown of the social system unless there is a strong communal bond in self-help that will need supplementing from higher authorities.</p>
              <p>Is the modern civilisation that we know today abandoning God ?</p>
              <p>If it is so, how should one conclude the increase numbers of new found religious groups that are not from the main stream churches, and prefer to worship in small groups in the outdoors, or in rented ballrooms, or rotating through members' homes ?</p>
              <p>Even in Islam, there are groups being accused of preaching or following deviant forms of Islam.</p>
              <p>Is Civilization in the 21st Century no longer in flux ?</p>
              <p>Has it come to a halt in its progress into the future ?</p>

And that Changes and Evolution had alway been an ongoing progression, nothing last, nor you, nor me. The way of changes bring about adaption and new evolution, that is the basic of social change, in Sec 1, we already learn about it, it is nothing new, whatever religion or sectoral divided religion, as long as it preaches good, it is good for the well being and the society as a whole, it makes the govt job more easier. But if a sect practised killing and extreme destruction to others, we must stop it.</p>

              <p>The Homo Saipan are the most intelligent living creature on earth, it is the only creature that can smile and laugh, the only creature that can step out of him/herself to analyze what he/she is doing is right or wrong. And sadly, the only creature that create so much sinful things. The inner self of every Homo Saipan keep a believe within, and because of the ability to understand right and wrong, it path the way for emotion that need to be console at time. Due to such high emotional that exist within the homo saipan, be it good or bad, they seek a warmth protectional belonging, and maybe that is where God is created. Taking such weaknesss in Homo saipan, some of them created religious sects just to get funds and support just to get power.

              <p>Therefore, Homo saipan, if evolve wisely, can good and survive for many centuries to come, but their evolvement also bring about the 7 deadly sins which can totally destroy the function and existence of Homo saipan on earth. Every creature on earth have the instinct of territorial protectism, it is like every one is right of their own, and sad to sad that the homo saipan goes all the way to kill each other, throw babies, sabotage death at the expense of innocent ones etc etc..all these paved the way for the end of Homo saipan.</p>

              <p>Religion is an individual beholden believes, we must respect all, be it believers or non believers. And that Changes and Evolution had alway been an ongoing progression, nothing last, nor you, nor me. The way of changes bring about adaption and new evolution, that is the basic of social change, in Sec 1, we already learn about it, it is nothing new, whatever religion or sectoral divided religion, as long as it preaches good, it is good for the well being and the society as a whole, it makes the govt job more easier. But if a sect practised killing and extreme destruction to others, we must stop it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Homo Saipan are the most intelligent living creature on earth, it is the only creature that can smile and laugh, the only creature that can step out of him/herself to analyze what he/she is doing is right or wrong. And sadly, the only creature that create so much sinful things. The inner self of every Homo Saipan keep a believe within, and because of the ability to understand right and wrong, it path the way for emotion that need to be console at time. Due to such high emotional that exist within the homo saipan, be it good or bad, they seek a warmth protectional belonging, and maybe that is where God is created. Taking such weaknesss in Homo saipan, some of them created religious sects just to get funds and support just to get power. The idealogy or psychology of heaven, hell and earth had put in discipline among the Homo saipan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, Homo saipan, if evolve wisely, can good and survive for many centuries to come, but their evolvement also bring about the 7 deadly sins which can totally destroy the function and existence of Homo saipan on earth. Every creature on earth have the instinct of territorial protectism, it is like every one is right of their own, and sad to sad that the homo saipan goes all the way to kill each other, throw babies, sabotage death at the expense of innocent ones etc etc..all these paved the way for the end of Homo saipan.

But to summarise it:<br><br>In recent years, it had been claimed and assumed by multiple researchers that humans were innately religious, because of the prevalence in religion in human societies since time immemorial, and that the rising secularism in human society since the 19th-20th century is but a recent phenomenon. <br><br>On the same tangent, plenty of religious people contend that their religion, be it Christianity, Islam or Buddhism (but I don't consider Buddhism a 'religion' per se) provides a strong moral compass for whichever society it resides in, and is generally beneficial to society. I disagree with both contentions.<br><br>The data gathered in this paper suggest that increased religiosity in society does not correlate at all with a more stable or harmonious society in both social and economic factors. The top five ranked nations, Sweden, Denmark, Japan, Norway and Holland are all noted for their secularism, and strong values in a stable society indicated by low rates of homicides, suicides, incarceration (number of people put in jail), STD rates, life satisfaction index, marriage duration and abortions, and economic equality.<br><br>The United States, on the other hand, has a very strong culture of publicly declared religiosity (no American politician could hope to be elected to office unless they were publicly declared Christians, or were Jews), and has indications of high social and economic instability at the same time.<br><br>My contention out of all this, is that the more evolved humans have proven themselves to not need God any longer. They have made for themselves, societies which have benign social and economic environments that do not create much stress to the point that people need to turn to the irrational supernatural (religion) for comfort or solace. It is true that humans have always relied on religion until very recently, but only because civilization was still very much in flux until the 21st century in a select few nations when its inhabitants have decided for themselves that God was no longer needed.</span></p>
