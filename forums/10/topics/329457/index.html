              <p>Â </p>
              <p>When I was in jail in 2006, I re-read the book <em>Comet In Our Sky</em>,
              a compilation of essays written by friends and associates of the late
              Lim Chin Siong. I will assume most of you here know Lim Chin Siong and
              will not endeavour to go into detail how he was seen by the majority of
              Singaporeans as the natural leader of our then fledgling republic in
              the 1950s and 60s, other than to say that his charisma and
              compassionate style of leadership won the hearts and minds of many.<br> <br>The book includes a chapter written by Professor of Southeast Asian
              Studies, Terence Harper, from Cambridge University. Professor Harper
              documented his research after poring through bundles of de-classified
              papers, memos, letters, etc. written by Britsh colonial officials
              during the turbulent period leading up to Singapore's independence.<br><br>The
              picture that emerged was one not quite the story that I heard and read
              growing up. In a nutshell, the Professor's account was that the people
              of Singapore wanted Lim Chin Siong as their leader but the British
              would not allow it and wanted Lee Kuan Yew instead.<br><br>So we have
              two versions of what happened: one written written by a disinterested,
              third-party academic and based on verifiable de-classifed papers, and
              the other by Lee Kuan Yew who still has vested personal interests in
              telling these events. I do not think I would be far wrong if I say that
              the majority of people would look to the former for a more accurate and
              objective account of that part of history.<br><br>This is what I tried to do in the first part of <em>A Nation Cheated</em>, that is, summarise Professor Harper's research finding's.<br><br>But
              my nerves are rubbed raw when I keep hearing Lee Kuan Yew, who came to
              power backed by the colonialists, rant about how the West should not
              foist its system on an Asian people, meaning us. Somehow the democratic
              practices that allowed Lee Kuan Yew to become prime minister suddenly
              become Western and not suited for us Singaporeans.<br><br>Today the
              propaganda continues unabated, that Singaporeans are not interest in
              human rights and democracy. I will come to this subject in a moment and
              show you how this lie has now been exposed.<br><br>For now, let me dwell a little on the notion that things have worked worked wonderfully for Singaporeans.<br><br>Whether
              it is our CPF or healthcare costs or wages or our financial reserves, I
              have presented evidence in the book to show how things are not quite
              what they seem. I have tried to stay away from polemics especially in
              part two of the book and concentrated on putting together the data from
              alternative sources to make my case. I will leave it to you the reader
              to decide for yourself whether I have done my job or not.<br><br>To
              illustrate what I really set out to say in this book, I want to relate
              a story. It is about a man whom I met when I went for my jog one
              morning. He is in his mid-seventies and works for the town council as a
              cleaner. He starts work at 7 am and knocks off at about one or two in
              the afternoon depending on how much work there is that day. He works
              six days a week. His salary? $400 a month.<br><br><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/PAP/NationalDay.JPG" border="1" alt="" width="400" align="left"><br>When
              he was a young man in his 20s, he was told that if he just stayed
              disciplined, didn't support independent unions, didn't clamour for his
              rights and trusted the PAP to govern in his best interest, he would be
              better off. He did that, or at least he wasn't given a choice.<br><br>Today,
              he is told that he must not think of retiring. In fact he is told that
              he needs to work for less pay. He is told that part of his savings is
              in Merill Lynch and in about 15 to 20 years, he should be able to start
              seeing returns on the investment, that is if the bank doesn't go belly
              up first.<br><br>Doesn't the word "cheated" come to mind?<br><br>This
              old man's story is not an aberration. Statistics tell us that our
              poorest segment of society continue to see their wages shrink. Fifty
              percent of the people haven't seen their incomes grow over the past ten
              years.<br><br>But then our ministers increased the salaries in 2007 by
              a heart-stopping 85 percent. The president is paid $4 million a year,
              for what no one quite knows. The Senior Minister and Minister Mentor
              are also paid close to that amount, again for what no one quite
              understands. The Prime Minister is paid $3.8 million which works out to
              be about $10,000 a day.<br><br>They tell you that they must be amply rewarded for building such a fine country. Really? Let's see what Singaporeans think:<br></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Despite
              having gone through national education at school, 37 percent of
              Singaporean youths say they are not patriotic. More than 50 percent
              want to emigrate overseas if given a chance. (<a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/perspective/vantage/983-half-of-singaporeans-youth-think-premarital-sex-is-ok-survey">Channel News Asia, 17 January 2007</a>)</li>
              <li>Another survey of older 	Singaporeans showed that two-thirds said they have considered 	retiring in another country. (<a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/perspective/vantage/984-many-want-to-retire-abroad">Straits Times, 20 August 2008</a>) </li>
              <li>A
              few weeks ago, the Government confirmed that an average of 1,000
              Singaporeans had given up their citizenship annually over the last
              three years. (<a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/907-singapore-hangs-out-jobs-vacant-sign">Asia Times, 21 	August 2008</a>)</li>
              </ul>
              <p><br>Have
              you thought of this number before, ladies and gentlemen? These are
              astounding figures. I cannot think of another country where after 50
              years of uninterrupted rule, we produce a nation where its people
              profess no love for it and can't wait to get out?<br><br>Tell me, hand
              on heart, that you still think that the PAP has governed in the
              interest of Singapore and Singaporeans. Tell me that we have not been
              cheated.</p>

The president is paid $4 million a year, for what no one quite knows. The Senior Minister and Minister Mentor are also paid close to that amount, again for what no one quite understands. The Prime Minister is paid $3.8 million which works out to be about $10,000 a day.<br><br>They tell you that they must be amply rewarded for building such a fine country. Really?

              </ul>
              <p><br>Have you thought of this number before, ladies and gentlemen? These are astounding figures. I cannot think of another country where after 50 years of uninterrupted rule, we produce a nation where its people profess no love for it and can't wait to get out?</p>

              <p>I quote this part is becoz this is the fundamental problem that our PAP government is facing right now.In other countries,like Taiwan etc,if the head leader of the countries wanted to cheat money,they still have to do it under the table.But,our fuking PAP ministers cheat money openly by giving themselves high payment.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>As if they are showing their own countrymen and women,"yes,we cheat money openly,what can you ppl do?"</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Well,there are 2 consequences,one is,there will be times when Singaporeans cannot take it anymore n revolt or assasinate the PAP leaders.When this occurs,the revolters will target Lee Kuan Yew,Lee Hsien Loong and boot-licker Goh Chok Tong and their families members.No one will dig up who teach our PAP leaders to become so arrogant as we dont know any other boot-lickers around the above name PAP leaders.</p>

              <p>And also,these 3 person(LKY,LHL,boot-licker GCT) has to decide whether or not to listen to the public discontent or their subordinates who give them a beautiful scenery that Singapore is quiet n everyone is contented n no one will dare to stage up a revolt or assasin plot.So ultimately,it will be these 3 person who got to pay for the price if anything goes wrong,not their boot-licking subordinates who give them the wrong info.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Another consequences is more n more Singaporeans migrate to other nations and not enough ppl to serve NS n pledge loyalty to this country.This problem already occur inÂ the past 10Â years and it has been becoming more n more serious with each year passingby.I believe the PAP leaders also getting headache by this issues,which ironically,they dont know what went wrong,LOL!!!!</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>In short,the PAP leaders winÂ the battle,but loseÂ the War!!!!</p>

              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:speakup@yoursdp.org">To</a> illustrate what I really set out to say in this book, I want to relate a story. It is about a man whom I met when I went for my jog one morning. He is in his mid-seventies and works for the town council as a cleaner. He starts work at 7 am and knocks off at about one or two in the afternoon depending on how much work there is that day. He works six days a week. His salary? $400 a month.<br><br><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/PAP/NationalDay.JPG" alt="" width="400"><br>When he was a young man in his 20s, he was told that if he just stayed disciplined, didn't support independent unions, didn't clamour for his rights and trusted the PAP to govern in his best interest, he would be better off. He did that, or at least he wasn't given a choice.<br><br>Today, he is told that he must not think of retiring. In fact he is told that he needs to work for less pay. He is told that part of his savings is in Merill Lynch and in about 15 to 20 years, he should be able to start seeing returns on the investment, that is if the bank doesn't go belly up first.<br><br>Doesn't the word "cheated" come to mind?<br><br>This old man's story is not an aberration. Statistics tell us that our poorest segment of society continue to see their wages shrink. Fifty percent of the people haven't seen their incomes grow over the past ten years.<br><br>But then our ministers increased the salaries in 2007 by a heart-stopping 85 percent. The president is paid $4 million a year, for what no one quite knows. The Senior Minister and Minister Mentor are also paid close to that amount, again for what no one quite understands. The Prime Minister is paid $3.8 million which works out to be about $10,000 a day.<br><br>They tell you that they must be amply rewarded for building such a fine country. Really? Let's see what Singaporeans think:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Despite having gone through national education at school, 37 percent of Singaporean youths say they are not patriotic. More than 50 percent want to emigrate overseas if given a chance. (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/perspective/vantage/983-half-of-singaporeans-youth-think-premarital-sex-is-ok-survey">Channel News Asia, 17 January 2007</a>)</li>
              <li>Another survey of older Singaporeans showed that two-thirds said they have considered retiring in another country. (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/perspective/vantage/984-many-want-to-retire-abroad">Straits Times, 20 August 2008</a>)</li>
              <li>A few weeks ago, the Government confirmed that an average of 1,000 Singaporeans had given up their citizenship annually over the last three years. (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/907-singapore-hangs-out-jobs-vacant-sign">Asia Times, 21 August 2008</a>)</li>
              </ul>
              <p><br>Have you thought of this number before, ladies and gentlemen? These are astounding figures. I cannot think of another country where after 50 years of uninterrupted rule, we produce a nation where its people profess no love for it and can't wait to get out?</p>
