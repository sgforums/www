            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Posted by theonlinecitizen on October 22nd, 2007<br><br>By Leong Sze Hian</strong><br><br><img src="http://img3.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/347f9963a2.jpg"><br><br>The entire wet market and food centre at Block 628A, Ang Mo Kio Street 61, was destroyed in a fire on 16 October 2007. (link)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">The affected stallholders are being asked to pay an estimated $8,000 to $10,000 to build a temporary market.</span></span><br><br>With 232 stalls, the total sum assuming an average of $9,000 is $2.1 million.<br><br>Why does it cost so much to build a temporary market which will be demolished after 18 to 24 months?<br><br>If all condominiums insure the entire building for fire, why wasnÂ’t the market insured by the town council or the HDB?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">I estimate the annual fire insurance premium for a sum insured of $2.1 million to be only about $2,500.</span></span><br><br>As most of the stallholders are tenants, they may not have the insurable interest to insure the building (stall) which they rent.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">If a landlord rents a part of the building to a tenant, is it reasonable to ask the tenant to be financially penalised by making a contribution, in the event of a fire which destroys the entire building (which was not insured) ? ShouldnÂ’t this be the responsibility of the owner? Who is the owner of a market?</span></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: darkred;">I do not know how much funds the Ang Mo Kio-Yio Chu Kang Town Council (AMK-YCK) has, but in my constituency, the Aljunied Town Council has $93 million of funds, with $67 million in itÂ’s sinking fund, according to itÂ’s annual financial report. (See here) </span></span><br><br>Should not the AMK-YCK Town Council use some of its funds to help towards the building of the temporary market?<br><br>This is not the first time that there has been a fire in a market. In fact, another market in the same constituency, at Block 342 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1, had a fire in January 2001.<br><br>Why have we not learned the lessons and experience from the several fires in markets in the past?<br><br>In this connection, Mr Wee Siew Khim, MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC said: Â“As we have practised in all the other market fires in the past, all stallholders will pull together and share the cost of building that market which they are going to use for the next 18-24 monthsÂ”.<br><br>With 35 per cent of the Service and Conservancy Charges (S &amp; CC) going into the sinking fund, why not use some of it to buy fire insurance for markets?<br><br>It is hard enough for small stallholder entrepreneurs to have lost all their business assets, equipment and stocks (hopefully most of these have been insured adequately), and endure months without income until the temporary market is ready - isnÂ’t it akin to a double catastrophy to have to decide and try cough up another $8,000 to $10,000?<br><br>Some of the stallholders interviewed have expressed their despair and predicament in this regard.<br><br>I would also like to suggest that affected stallholders be given the option to have the first priority to rent on a temporary basis the available stalls all over Singapore, at the same if not reduced rentals to what they have been paying.<br><br>By the way, how much will their rentals increase when the new market is built? And, consequently, how much will prices increase for the residents of Ang Mo Kio?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Help is on hand for hawkers and stallholders who are affected by the fire at Ang Mo Kio market and hawker centre on Tuesday night.<br><br>For a start, an interim market will be set up by Monday morning, so that those selling market produce can continue doing business.<br><br>At 4pm on Wednesday, the hawkers and stallholders had a meeting with the representatives from the relevant agencies such as the town council, Community Development Council (CDC), Citizens' Consultative Committee (CCC) as well as MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC, Wee Siew Khim, who stood in for MP Seng Han Tong who was away.<br><br>At the end of the meeting, stallholders were given the following few options.<br><br>- Give up their business and opt for a cash grant of $16,000 (for market stallholders) or $23,000 (for cooked food stallholders), or<br>- continue at an interim market which will be set up for one and a half month. They may then move to a temporary market that will be set up for between 18 months and 2 years or they can opt for an alternative stall in other markets and hawker centres.<br><br>But for those opting for the temporary market, they will have to pay at least a few thousand dollars to help build it.<br><br>Wee Siew Khim, MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC said: "As we have practised in all the other market fires in the past, all stallholders will pull together and share the cost of building that market which they are going to use for the next 18-24 months.<br><br>"We took note of their concerns and those who have any constraints or financial problems, we will probably structure it for them to pay by instalments. Or they could come to us and we'll treat each case on a customised basis."<br><br>Because of that, many stallholders are thinking twice about taking the offer to operate their business at the temporary market.<br><br>"I'll try to take it but if the rent is very expensive, like $8,000 to $10,000, then I think I can't afford it. If I don't take, I don't know what I can do," said Peh Thiam Hock, a stallholder.<br><br>Some have decided to take a break till the market is rebuilt in about two years' time, while others have decided to throw in the towel.<br><br>"Some of them, up to 40% of them, are first-generation stallholders, so they have the option of taking an ex-gratia payment and not operate anymore," said MP Wee.<br><br>The stallholders have till Friday to make their decision.<br><br>The fire on Tuesday night was one of the worst market fires in recent years.<br><br>More than 100 people were at the food centre having their meals when the fire broke out at about 9.30pm on Tuesday. They made a quick dash for safety when they saw the fire spreading quickly.<br><br>The SCDF said investigations are ongoing to determine the cause of the fire. - CNA /ls<br><br></div>

This would then be up to the indivdual house owners to purchase private fire insurance.<br><br>Same principle should apply to the AMK market.<br><br>1) It seems that the town council is making the stallholders bear the entire costs<br><br>2) Why has the town council not insured the entire market structure?<br><br>3) This market fire has not been the first and will not be the last. Yet, the stallholders seem to be ignorant about fire insurance as evident that only a few have purchased it. Perhaps the town council as the landlord could have educated more on this matter?<br><br>Even if a mere few thousand per annum out of millions of dollars of sinking fund is deemed as against the principles of fund usage, the town council could have at least done tie-ups with insurance companies to offer the fire insurance schemes to the stallholders.</div>
