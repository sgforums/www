            <div class='col-md body'>Who are making more sacrifice for the nation, ministers, MPs, Opposition politicians or the people?<br><br>Often we are told that the ministers and MPs are making great sacrifices for their country. Is this true. Now let us examine this issue:-<br><br>(1) Be a minister, earn million dollar salaries and be recognized by the people as their leaders. Such ministers may claim to make sacrifice for working under stress and getting grey hairs but since they are greatly compensated is that really called sacrifice.<br><br>(2) Be a opposition member, or take a stand as a critic of government and be threatened and called names by the government's cyber agents for speaking up on people's problems. Some of such people have been threatened or sued till bankruptcy. Even vocal critics are being inconvenienced of speaking up or offering solutions to the government which their own MPs or Ministers were too afraid to do so. All such people are contributing to the country in different roles without rewards or positions.<br><br>Who are really making sacrifices for the country or fellow citizens ?<br><br>These are many ordinary citizens who worked their whole working hards and paying taxes to feed the government contributing to building up the country to allow their ministers to claim success with accumulating their taxes as surpluses without expecting or getting anything in return.<br><br>When they reach 55, they cannot take out their retirement saving and soon when they reach 62, they will be told they again cannot take out any saving as the government has to be able to solve the ageing problem.<br><br>Who really sacrifice for the country or the people? How about many thousands of workers working quietly behind the scenes to get things done contributing to the surpluses and GDP who did not get any help when they become unemployed ?<br><br>There are many unsung heros who truly sacrifice and they do not even claim any credit even for offering solutions and checking government on behalf of elected MPs and Ministers who dare not speak up on wrong policies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some people have told me the word sacrifice is incorrect. The word should be "victimised" when it comes to describing sacrifices by oppositions or the ordinary people by their own toils and sweat are being deprived or short-changed to build the national golden calf (moneytheism) to keep rewarding the leaders for their own perceived sacrifices.</div>
