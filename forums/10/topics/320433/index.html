              <p>Just a question,but what do you think will be the state of Singapore politics when the old man finally dies?</p>
              <p>Granted the PAP will survive his death.Institutions will endure,but people will die eventually,even you and me.How will it affect the state of politics in Singapore?</p>
              <p>I sense that a lot of factions within the PAP which are currently keeping silent out of fear or respect of the old man will start opening up and party discipline will decrease.LHL simply does not have the oratorical ability,the hardened and sharp mind or political experience of LKY.LHL cannot and will not hold it together because I doubt he has what it takes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the I could be wrong....</p>
              <p>It will also open the way for the opposition to finally make the PAP bleed somewhat.There will be less chance of defamation suits every single time someone insults the old man's ego. Of course LHL could try and copy his father in suing each and every political opponent,using the ISD to lock them up and accuse them of plotting terrorist acts  or following communism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what's your take on it?</p>

              <p>People's Action Party is controlled by only a small clique of people at the top.</p>
              <p>Most party members have no influence over policy.</p>
              <p>The ringleader is Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>After the Lim Chin Siong debacle, Lee Kuan Yew would only recruit those who will kowtow to his dictates into the party.</p>
              <p>Those who do not kowtow, he will never recruit, otherwise factions will appear and split the party.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">...These developments
              				precipitated an open split between Lee and Lim Chin Siong. Lim's
              				group suspected – correctly – that Lee was up to no
              				good in his pursuit of merger with Malaysia and they openly
              				called for the abolition of the ISC.<br><strong><br>In July 1961,
              				legislative assemblymen, parliamentary/organising secretaries,
              				and members of the PAP split from the party and formed the
              				Barisan Sosialis. Lee's party was shaved to bare bones. </strong><br><br>At
              				the time, Harper writes, "there was an immense political
              				momentum, a sense that the future lay with the Barisan
              				Sosialis."<br><br>Even then, Lim Chin Siong never wavered in
              				his commitment to governing Singapore in a democratic way when he
              				wrote in a press statement that "any constitutional
              				arrangement must not mean a setback for the people in terms of
              				freedom and democracy."<br><br>This contrasts with the PAP's
              				demonisation of Lim as a front for the communist out to destroy
              				the democratic way... </span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>So, I think it will be hard for factions to appear in PAP after Lee Kuan Yew is dead.</p>
              <p>I think most people in PAP are not politicians but managers, they have no passion or desire for politics, so this may bring about downfall of PAP when Lee Kuan Yew finally dies.</p>

              <p>PAP rise due to Lee Kuan Yew, PAP fall also due to Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
