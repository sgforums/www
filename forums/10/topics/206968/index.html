            <div class='col-md body'>It's NOT surprising that even their own kind, couldn't stand their manipulative ways.<br><br>=========================================<br>Woman stabbed non-stop by friend in public<br><br>Passer-by saves woman's life by knocking knife from boyfriend's hand with motorcycle helmet<br><br>By Tanya Fong<br>Aug 25, 2006<br>The Straits Times<br><br>PRODUCTION supervisor Peh Hay Leng, 53, was on his way to work at about 7.20am yesterday when he saw a woman whose face was covered with blood.<br>Grabbing the back collar of her T-shirt was a man who was stabbing her with a knife.<br><br>Said Mr Peh: 'My first instinct was to pull her away. But he refused to let go. The woman was also too weak to get up.'<br><br>Continually stabbing the woman, the attacker kept shouting in Mandarin: 'I've had enough of you!'<br><br>The morning drama took place in front of about five horrified passers-by at the carpark in front of Block 149 Bukit Batok West Avenue 6.<br><br>Miss Lou Yan Wa, a 23-year-old China national, was attacked by her boyfriend, 25, also a China national on a work permit.<br><br>No one dared intervene until Mr Peh spotted a passer-by holding onto a motorcycle helmet.<br><br>Mr Peh recalled how robbers used a helmet to batter him in a robbery seven years ago - and borrowed the helmet from the passer-by.<br><br>He said: 'I realised I could also use the helmet as a shield for my hands. I could not bear to see her being stabbed to death.'<br><br>Using the headgear to hit the attacker's hand every time he raised the knife, Mr Peh managed to knock the weapon out of the man's hand.<br><br>Housewife Soon Siew Lan, 44, a local resident who witnessed the attack, said: 'Thankfully, the man used the helmet to stop him. I think it made the attacker tired because he stopped trying to stab the woman shortly after that.<br><br>'He also looked dazed when he dropped the knife to the ground and squatted beside the woman.'<br><br>Madam Soon said the entire ordeal lasted about 10 minutes.<br><br>Describing the attack, she said of the victim: 'She was trying very hard to keep her face downwards. I think it was so the knife would not cut her face.'<br><br>Madam Soon said passers-by stopped and wanted to help the woman but did not know how to approach the armed attacker.<br><br>The police and ambulance arrived soon after the attack stopped and took Miss Lou to National University Hospital.<br><br>The boyfriend was arrested.<br><br>The knife, which broke at the handle, was recovered by the police.<br><br>Miss Lou is in stable condition. She suffered multiple slash wounds to her head and abdomen.<br><br>'It was very scary watching the man attack her so viciously. I felt very helpless. I kept praying she wouldn't die,' said Madam Soon.<br><br>Miss Lou was on her way to work at a printing firm nearby in Bukit Batok Industrial Park when she was attacked by her boyfriend.<br><br>Said Mr Peh: 'The way he attacked her was really very cruel. Her whole face was covered in blood.<br><br>'I'm very relieved to hear that she's alive. It's really a miracle.'<br></div>
