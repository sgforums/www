This isn't about race, this is about our own gov's blind faith in China and their people, resulting in much hardship of the locals here.<br><br>Ugly people are indeed everywhere, but this isn't about ugly people.

He's sending money home to China where his parents are, to accumulate enough wealth so that he can eventually leave Singapore and set up his own business in China with his Singaporean wife.<br><br>We are being used as a stepping stone through and through, while many locals are at wits end without a job to support their own families on their own soil!<br><br>I run my own business, and ALL of my staff are locals above 35 years of age.

We don't have to worry about their retirement if they are going home after they have made enough!!<br><br>So what good are PRC FTs??<br><br>Just let them use SIngapore as a stepping stone leaving many jobless??</div></blockquote>It's good if we don't have to worry about their retirement...they won't be a burden to us when they can no longer work.<br><br>So what good are they? Ask the employers why they prefer PRCs to Singaporean workers. Ans: Because they are cheap, they increase revenue for the business. On a bigger scale, they keep inflation low and prices for goods/services low because businesses can keep their costs down.<br><br>Without low-skilled PRCs, Singaporeans must be prepared to pay more in the restaurants or hawker centres because the Singaporean waiter and dishwashing lady will demand a higher pay than their PRC counterparts. Costs of living will rise.<br><br>Industry will also suffer. Lim Swee Say had alluded a few times to wafer fabs that could not find Singaporeans willing to work 12 hour shifts in protective clothing environments. Without PRCs and other foreign workers who are willing to accept such working conditions, our companies will have to raise their pay much higher to entice unwilling Singaporeans to take such jobs. This will raise the cost of operating a factory in Singapore and adversely affects our competitiveness. Wafer fab companies may well move their investments to Thailand or even Hong Kong where there are lots of Chinese migrant workers.</div>
