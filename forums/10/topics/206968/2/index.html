They will also try to stuff big plastic bags of home throwaways into the chute causing the bigger plastic bags of trash to stuck at the chute, and rendering it almost impossible for other families to throw their trashes. Many times i have to use strength to push the stucked items down. And just last weekend, I did not know what the f*** they were doing, they just placed a lorry of old cupboards, sofas, tables, toys, chairs and other trashes in this common area, thus completely blocking the access to the chute bin. I just don't understand how come they have so much trash to dispose all the times. Lastly, the PRC couple is hardcore smokers and they just stand outside the corridors to smoke and just throw the butts to the grounds as if here is china. Wtf, how come almost 100% of PRCs are lacking in social grace?? One day, when I can no longer endure, I will confront them.

China needs another 1 or 2 more generation before their people in OVERALL learns tolerance, manners, and good social behavior.<br><br>Overhere, we who are the 2nd or 3rd generation of Chinese have had a head start. So, naturally now we can't stand the antics of some first generation PRC's here who came directly from China.<br><br>So, it's okay. One day one of the FT's child will become our Prime Minister.
