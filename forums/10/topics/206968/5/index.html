            <div class='col-md body'>Taken from Seancannot's thread:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShutterBug:</div><div class="quote_body">NO, we CANNOT and SHOULD not stopp ALL foreigner workers from coming here. BUT, our gov SHOULD HAVE regulated the influx from China. Our economy is better for all the FWs and FTs, but with all the low and mid level jobs saturated by FWs from PRC, it adds on to the Income Gap problem.<br><br>Our gov is obviously only looking at the economic level in terms of FWs' &amp; FTs' contributions, but appear to have closed one eye to the woes of locals seeking income.<br><br>No matter local or foreign labor are used, eventually many companies will move to cheaper countries as we will inevitably become too costly to operate within. I cite fuel costs as one of the many operation costs besides land and others. So, I feel eventually, the Universal Solution of FTs will have little or no effect in supporting our economy.<br><br>If our gov does not now look into ways to make use of local manpower resources, one day when FTs no longer are effective solutions, then what?<br><br>So far the use of FTs only benefits two entities; our GOV and the EMPLOYERS.<br><br>The people???<br><br>In Cold storage - or back burnner.<br><br></div></blockquote>If only the regime would wake up &amp; see the damage it has done to the voters. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
