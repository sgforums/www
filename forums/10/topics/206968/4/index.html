And I can;t help them cause I can only afford so many local employees. It's not cheap having them, and having them cheaply by depressing their salary, I might as well hire FWs and don't bother helping anyone but myself. </div></blockquote>As you said, it is not cheap having local workers. You choose to hire locals as a matter of principle, but you cannot employ many of them and do not contribute that much to the GDP.<br><br>The big multinational companies employ far more and they matter to the economy. The bosses in these MNCs wouldn't give a damn as to whether Singaporeans can find jobs or not. They want better profit margins...period. If they cannot access cheaper foreign labour in Singapore, they will move their business elsewhere.<br><br>We have to get our workers to constantly upgrade their skills. No point blaming the education system because whatever you have learnt in the Uni or Poly 20 years ago are useless today. Technology moves very fast and unless we keep up with the latest developments, we will be left behind. US workers are the most productive in the world. We have to acquire new skills as quickly as US workers, instead of trying to protect our low-skilled jobs from PRCs.</div>
