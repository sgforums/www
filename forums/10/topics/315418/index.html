              <p><strong>The Singapore Parliament is a white elephant</strong></p>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>If you ever thought Singapore is a
              parliamentary democracy, it is not. It is a one party state, with Lee
              Kuan Yew's PAP in power since 1959, no less than 50 years; and with him
              wielding absolute power and authority. It is a dictatorship.<br><br>It
              is true, Singapore has a Parliament with elections held every five
              years, but in truth these have no real effect at all. All civil
              institutions including the judiciary, the civil service, the police and
              the media take their orders directly from Lee Kuan Yew. To Lee,
              Parliament is merely a nuisance.<br><br>The Singapore opposition should
              not raise their hopes if they win additional Parliamentary seats other
              than the miserable 2 they presently have. Even with 10, 20 or even 30
              seats, and regardless of how many Parliamentary speeches they make; as
              long as Lee has a Parliamentary majority of one, he will still call the
              shots, because he alone has civil society under his thumb.<br><br>And
              even, in the unlikely chance that the opposition wins a parliamentary
              majority, it is more than likely that Lee will still continue to rule,
              because, as was said, the institutions that matter, the judiciary, the
              civil service, and everything else take their orders from this man.<br><br>If
              you realize the gravity of the situation, you may feel, and rightly so,
              that Singapore is a hopeless case. That you are destined by Providence
              to live as Lee's slaves and there is nothing you can do about it. But
              this is not so, and there is hope; abundant hope.<br><br>The way to
              bring about change in todayâ€™s Singapore is not by winning seats in
              Parliament, even though it is good; it is by demanding justice from
              each institution of government, and holding them to account for each
              transgression of your rights.<br><br>This is what has to be done. If a
              Malay or Indian is not permitted to reside at the place of his choice
              by the HDB because of illegal racial quotas violative of the
              Constitution, the aggrieved citizen should refuse to accept it, and
              protest against it; taking pictures and videos of his protest and
              putting them up in blogs throughout the island, publicly exposing the
              injustice.<br><br>The idea is to embarrass the government where they
              clearly are violative of your rights. The constitution provides for
              equality and prohibits racial discrimination. And in such a case, this
              government would find it impossible to justify the discrimination.<br><br>If
              a citizen is illegally deprived of his CPF retirement savings, the
              aggrieved citizen should refuse to take no for an answer, protest at
              the very spot, take pictures and videos of it and post it all over the
              Internet.<br><br>If a Singaporean is deprived of his job because he was
              displaced by a foreigner willing to accept lower pay, he should stand
              outside Ministry of Manpower or other ministry and protest his loss of
              a job, take pictures of it and post it on the Internet.<br><br>If the
              Tak Boleh Tahan protestors of March 15, 2008 have still not been
              returned their cell phones which the police had illegally confiscated,
              they should protest outside Cantonment Police Station and not leave
              until their cell phones are returned, photograph and film the entire
              protest and put it up on blogs all over the island.<br><br>If you see
              an employer discriminating against older workers, protest at the spot,
              take pictures of it and post it all over the island.<br><br>The purpose
              of this exercise is to shame these public institutions into respecting
              the law and treating everyone fairly and impartially. At present, the
              HDB feel they can discriminate against Malays and Indians because Lee
              has ordered them to do it; their illegal actions become lawful because
              of Lee's authority over them. The same with the CPF violating the law,
              the Ministry of Manpower and every other public institution.<br><br>It
              is quite clear that Lee's main tool to remain in absolute dictatorial
              control is his absolute power over the judges and the newspapers. If
              Singaporeans protest outside the state controlled newspaper offices,
              they will be shamed by their misdeeds being exposed through blogs and
              videos.<br><br>It appears to me, the energy of those opposing this one
              man dictatorship should be directed to the institutions of civil
              society such as the judiciary to force them to stop oppressing the
              citizens. In order to do this, technology has turned out to be a
              Godsend. The power of the Internet is something authoritarian
              governments cannot overcome, and citizens should use it to the fullest
              to force their governments to see reason.<br><br>The Internet has in
              fact made a great difference for the better even in authoritarian
              Middle Eastern countries. I have heard in Egypt, even a country under
              the iron grip of Mubarak, had to concede a little, when a blogger took
              a video of the police arresting some people and abusing them with their
              batons, and put it up on his website. Immediately thereafter, his
              website began to get several thousand hits each day, with almost the
              entire country up in arms about the incident, forcing the Mubarak
              government to take action against those officers. Were it not for the
              blog, nothing would have happened to the policemen.<br><br>Riad
              al-Turk, a Syrian opposition leader suffered many years of imprisonment
              for his opposition to the government. But with the Internet exposing
              the injustice publicly, the Syrian government eventually had no choice
              but to release him.<br><br>It is for these reasons that the Lee Kuan
              Yew government is terrified of public protests. In Singapore, a small
              built up, completely wired island, which depends on international trade
              and business; any adverse publicity involving the denial of human
              rights can be very damaging. And realizing this, the opposition should
              take full advantage of this and push this government to its limit of
              either accepting the truth or resisting it at their peril.<br><br>They
              are now clearly in the defensive as their actions show. You will
              recall, some years ago at the CPF protests in front its offices in
              Robinson Road, to disperse a mere 4 unarmed peaceful protestors holding
              nothing more than placards, the police officer John Baptist, a man
              totally undeserving of such a biblical name, deployed his Red Maria
              Police vans with about 50 armed police in full riot gear!<br><br>When
              such an over reaction, almost comical, on the part of the police was
              captured on camera and prominently displayed all over Singapore on the
              Internet, they realized that they had egg on their faces. Ever since
              then, even for the larger protest of 50 at Tak Boleh Tahan, the police
              began to use the soft touch instead; this time no riot police, no
              police uniforms and women plain clothes police were used to arrest the
              protestors!<br><br>This government is finding it increasing difficult
              to deny the legitimate demands of its citizens when their actions are
              being glaringly exposed to public scrutiny through the Internet. This
              is something this government cannot overcome since it cannot stop the
              Internet. No matter what, the Internet is here it stay and Lee whether
              he like it or not has to live with it. And he is finding that
              increasingly uncomfortable.<br><br>Since Dr. Chee's party now has
              extensive experience in organizing protests, protestors could
              collaborate with him to hold it at the offending location, pre-arrange
              with video cameraman and photographers and immediately put up the
              images on the Internet. If the protests attract police retaliation,
              their injustice can be visually exposed. It is my belief that if this
              done on a sustained basis, this or any other oppressive government will
              have to listen. They have no choice.<br><br>Trying to change Singapore
              through winning more Parliamentary seats may eventually be possible.
              Change may happen if Lee is dead or if the opposition wins a majority.
              But if you want to make it happen a little faster, protest take
              pictures and keep embarrassing this government. That way, you leave
              them no choice.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>
