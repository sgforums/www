            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes I wonder about the TRUE purpose of placing CCTV cameras. Is it meant to catch terrorist as claimed by our police force? Or do they serve a more sinister purpose such as having the potential to become "The Eyes of the Government"? I remeber reading something like that in George Orwell's 1984 about the government monitoring its citizen. So what happened in 1984 came true in 2004? Would anyone like to comment on these CCTVs? So far, what was reported in the news was that, Majority of the Public supports this move as they welcome any measures that protects their safety. 3 people interviewed on this measure whole heartedly supported this action. None oppose it on TV. (or maybe there were some that oppse it, but it is unlikely that their view will be broadcast). I am personally not in favor of such an approach that is likely to infringe my privacy. To me, this action is tantamount to taking pictures of an individual without his/her consent. How much more Privacy are we willing to give up in the name of "protecting our safety"??</div>

Since these are goverment stuffs, they could be more high tech than you think. They might boast better framerate refreshes and the motion they capture might be sharper and more accurate.
