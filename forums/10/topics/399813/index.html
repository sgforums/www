              <p>Speaker Corner = a special areas or a "slected zone" of 0.5 % of Singapore land where people are allowed to voice out their political opinons or views that are different from the rest </p>

              <p>We shall see as more Singapore become politically mature, we can do away with this special zone where you can only talk about politics. Sound more like you can only read a political book in a speical zone call libraray and not anywhere else. This is so typical of British-ness Hdye Park where Brits go there to talk a politics</p>

              <p>Andy Lau Sickness of Still Being Single &amp; Available</p>
              <p>In China, I found out there is this symption of (yin-hun / hiding you are already marriage)</p>
              <p>1) Most girls or men do that, their reason for doing that is (ren-qi / creating relationship) if they know you are marriage they will NOT HIRED you to work here. Maybe you may need to travel, you being a single had different views on fashion wear unlike a married protective mother, or you can't work late in the night.</p>
              <p>2) So it is very common for chinese girls or boys to deny you are a married. Sometimes, because of career progression, you are required to ( ai-mei / to create special relationship ) with your Boss, your Superior, your Customers. If they found out you are a marriage you are a mother, your career opporunity is zero</p>
              <p>3) China is fast adopting Hong Kongers mindset and behaving like Andy Lau. Where (cosmectic makeup / packing ) are highly value rather than a person (nen-li / his ablilies to performance) A society that is becoming to commerical in thinking. Where high divorce rates is acceptable for practical means. Who knows one day your wife had to deny you are her husband for the advantage of being single brings to her      </p>

              <p>Speakers Corners is a place where people goes there is whine.</p>
              <p>This is a very "outdated venue" for different walks of people to come together to discuss politics. The New Media, the Online World had taken over, and she is dong a fanstatic job. CNN &amp; BBC the Old Media was supporting Labor Mr Brown, when the polls of polls tell a completely different story. We had wintess how out of touch the old media or traditonal media is losing touch with her veiwerships.</p>
              <p>Apple Ipad had change the media landscape (hint Clouding Technology) and "Goggle Television is future" where Internet merge with Television. HP, Mircosoft, Intel, SONY...are all heading towards this Business Golden Opportunity ( Who need Speaker Corners ??? )</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The last few night I was watching (WO-BU-SHI-GAO-YANG) a very interesting China drama about having the ( 1 child policy ) In a typical school where a class there are 50 boys and 12 girls ratio. It is clear Chinese parents prefer boys rather than girls. The city boys had no problems getting married and finding wives for themsevles. The rest of the 38 poorer boys from the (chun-villgers) resort to kidnapp young girls to force them to become their wife. (In South Korea, the old days they love to kidnapp little kids cripple their legs so that they can become beggars to begs for money in the streets for their fierce master waiting to beat them up with a stick)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Singapore, we are feeling the side-effect of ( 2 child policy ) because of our shrinking young working adults, the income tax collection is too little to support our ever growing grey population</p>
              <p>These days, senior question it make no sense at all for senior to work to their grave to support themselves. These is this anger of working to 65 --- 70 years old. Our Govt. had tweak the laws making it easier to take their children to court for failure to provide sufficent care to their care. This is putting a huge stress on S'pore Society</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How China can avoid becoming like Singaopore</p>
              <p>Singapore had tried to bring immrgants, to top up the population. This is going to cause PAP Govt some votes and seats.</p>
              <p>1) The good things is China does not face the music of general election, yes she can used Liberal Immirgration Laws to top up her population China need to maintian her Biggest Consumers Status to attract FDI. Without her Big Population &amp; (Cheap Labor / Young Working Adults) she will start to lose her FDI.</p>
              <p>Solution: 2) More hospitals for test tube babies for city people this is the group of people that can afford 3 babies</p>
              <p>3) Having 2 chlid policy across China</p>
              <p>4) Surrogate Mothers using the Sperm &amp; Eggs but with a Carrier Mother (for those weak mothers with poor health)</p>
              <p>5) using DNA cells taken from womens that can no longer produce eggs. Borrow eggs from a healthy women then insert the mother DNA and the father sperm into the 3 party egg.</p>
              <p>Moral or ethic it is acceptable, since 98% this child is using her mother DNA and the father sperm just the empty shell egg from a 3 party...all these can improved China population growth</p>

              <p>BBC worldservice are dead against the idea of (babies selective gender) which I beg to differ. Every indian parents of chinese parents will want to have a boy. in Indian many too many inorder to have a boy is a burden to the society and the family. In China 1 Child Policy is means parents resort to premature abortion, killing thier babies or selling the girls away.</p>

              <p>Why we should enourage "babies selective gender"</p>
              <p>Once any family 1st child attain a baby boy, this brings relief, the tension &amp; pressure assert on the family. These families are willing to accept their 2nd child or 3rd child if she had baby girl.</p>
              <p>This will bring the ratio of (boy:girl) to a much balance population</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those Singaporean that complain too many immirgant in Singapore. Visit Shanghai, there are Breadtalk shops selling bread, Yun Nam shops selling their expertise on regaining their loss hair, Hyflux, Coffee Beans shops, Wellness slimming centres and plenty of Singaporean working in Shanghai provinces alone.</p>
