              <p>its no simple flood. the urbanisation took away the green to absorb the rain, so lead to flooding. flooding is quite common in urbanised countries.</p>

              <p>Some things cannot be policed or forced on people.</p>
              <p>Things such as sentiments, thoughts, feelings, these cannot be forced on people.</p>
              <p>And since on the internet, people can be anonymous and free to write their true feelings, some of these will surface. It is inevitable.</p>
              <p>I oppose those attention seekers and those who deliberately flame and troll and intentionally provoke other groups / races / religions, and I think it is good to apply the law on them, but, people should not be punished if they say something or write something which just express their feelings without the intent of fanning trouble.</p>
              <p>So how do you know which one is sincere expression and which one is deliberate trolling ?</p>
              <p>That is the hard part.</p>
              <p>For instance,</p>
              <p>Someone (you know who) has made several repeated comments openly in the media and the media print and reprint them, over the years, comments regarding certain group of people. And this person is a high profile politician and write many books and memoirs. He has generated many unhappy rebuke and complaints from the said group, and even members of his own party. Even his son is forced to come out and publicly rebuke him.</p>
              <p>But apparently he has never been charged with any law.</p>
              <p>So how do you determine which expression falls under the normal and permissible expression and which one is extreme and crosses the line ?</p>
              <p>It is a little subjective and it's like examining a movie for censorship and trying to determine whether a scene is porn or whether it is an art scene.</p>
              <p>I still agree with the principle of this law. Someone who is an attention seeker and just want to provoke people for the sake of provoking people, should indeed get punished. No doubt about that. Because they will disturb the peace and incite social chaos.</p>
              <p>However the proposal of further regulation of the internet, must be realistic. It is almost impossible to totally regulate internet and furthermore because of the nature of internet discussions, many internet users are just simply expressing their feelings and thoughts. It is almost impossible to regulate that.</p>

              <p>Some things cannot be policed or forced on people.</p>
              <p>Things such as sentiments, thoughts, feelings, these cannot be
              forced on people.</p>
              <p>And since on the internet, people can be anonymous and free to
              write their true feelings, some of these will surface. It is
              inevitable.</p>
              <p>I oppose those attention seekers and those who deliberately
              flame and troll and intentionally provoke other groups / races /
              religions, and I think it is good to apply the law on them, but,
              people should not be punished if they say something or write
              something which just express their feelings without the intent of
              fanning trouble.</p>
              <p>So how do you know which one is sincere expression and which one
              is deliberate trolling ?</p>
              <p>That is the hard part.</p>
              <p>For instance,</p>
              <p>Someone (you know who) has made several repeated comments openly
              in the media and the media print and reprint them, over the years,
              comments regarding certain group of people. And this person is a
              high profile politician and write many books and memoirs. He has
              generated many unhappy rebuke and complaints from the said group,
              and even members of his own party. Even his son is forced to come
              out and publicly rebuke him.</p>
              <p>But apparently he has never been charged with any law.</p>
              <p>So how do you determine which expression falls under the normal
              and permissible expression and which one is extreme and crosses the
              line ?</p>
              <p>It is a little subjective and it's like examining a movie for
              censorship and trying to determine whether a scene is porn or
              whether it is an art scene.</p>
              <p>I still agree with the principle of this law. Someone who is an
              attention seeker and just want to provoke people for the sake of
              provoking people, should indeed get punished. No doubt about that.
              Because they will disturb the peace and incite social chaos.</p>
              <p>However the proposal of further regulation of the internet, must
              be realistic. It is almost impossible to totally regulate internet
              and furthermore because of the nature of internet discussions, many
              internet users are just simply expressing their feelings and
              thoughts. It is almost impossible to regulate that.</p>
