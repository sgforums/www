            <div class='col-md body'>actually, the S. korean economy is a little mre complex than that. It's true that we started on abt equal footing, but 2 things differed. 1stly is that the Korean govt. interfered to a much greater extent in businesses forming conglomerates called chaebols. These Chaebols enjoyed vast advantages from the govt. and in fact became so strong that the govt. feared these conglomerates. With this, the check and balance system was gone and there was an over-borrowing from thse chaebols. When Korea was in Fast growth, these problems could not be seen. But when it went into a medim growth stage, these problems became obvious.<br><br>In fact, the debt equity ratio was at an astounding 200-500%. When the 99 crisis hit, many of these chaebols wen bankrupt. Although the IMF did come in to assist, it's policies only made things worse and it tried to force open Korea to foreign companies. This resulted in the transferring of wealth from Koreans to foreign companies. Which basicaaly means that a lot of wealth went out of the hands of Korea. The koreans had to sell many good strong companies and they came out at the losing end of the bargain.<br><br>Contrast this with S'pore, our impact was much lesser. Academics usually place Korea under the A category. S'pore in the 2B category. meaning that S'pore was far less affected. That being said, Korea has 1 big advantage over S'pore. Namely, their domestic market. Something which S'pore doesn't have.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is an interesting read as I was thinking about it myself as in how did South Korea zoom ahead so far in front of us when we were once upon a time, all known as the Asian Tigers (with Taiwan and all).<br><br>Like some of the points that have been made, one glaring thing has always been the size of our market. I remembered when I worked and helped launch our ADSL service in '96 and '97, the koreans hadn't even gotten their act together...they even sent reps here to look at what and how we did things. But 2 years down the road, they were ahead of everyone else. Of course apart from having a larger market (of maybe becos of that), they were willing to take the plunge and go all the way to offer ADSL at rock bottom prices...we on the other hand were counting pennies and working like crazy just to meet some stupid goals that were impossible to do (since we were tying our own hands with high prices etc.).<br><br>Apart from this, I also understand in Korea (based on my trip there and my current korean classmates in the US), the society is very willing to go after graduate degrees. According to a korean here in US, she is sponsored totally for her PhD by Samsung and there is NO bond. In fact, I think Korea has one of the biggest PhD output in the world.<br><br>So besides gungho attitude, "free" market (after all the crash and burn during the asian crisis), and willingness to forge ahead as a people, what else is pushing Korea ahead of us... Anyone who is more knowleagble about the Korean secret *kimchi* for success?</div>

Also, it's economy is drivn by it's manufacturing sector nad like i meantioned highly supported by it's domestic market. Additionally, Korean companies strategy are generally the same; enter the low end of the market with low price (factories in China certainly help) and gain market share. Once it has establish a foothold, push up the market and enter areas that have higher margin, This can be seen in Samsung, Kia, Hyundai, etc. Basically it's an export market share strategy, whereas S'pore's model is slightly different. Korea was also accussed of crony capitalism and having unfair trading policies though i would disagree. An interesting note is that Koreans assimilate technology very well, possibly like wad u said, they are very well educated. They have the top percentage of engineers in the world. An epitome og this knack for assimilating techonology can be seen in hyundai. Both Hyundai and Proton started on equal footing with borrowed technology from Mitsubishi. However, it took Hyundai 6 yrs as compared to Proton who took triple that time to develop its own engine. So i kinda agree with what u said abt the education aspect.<br><br>If you are interested in the competitve advantage of Korea, do do up some reading on the flying geese model, it's an interesting read though scholars do disagree on its relevancy. Honestly, Korea still has it's trouble and to assume that Korea is better than Singapore or vice versa would be difficult to quantify though i know many here would disagree. but this is my 2 cents worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><span style="color: darkred;">ben1xy and vaxjunior - both of your posts provide interesting views, and I can certainly agree that it will be hard to compare Korea with Singapore as many circumstances differ (geographical size and endowment, population size), but there remain some that are common but moulding us differently.<br><br>The early political systems that influenced each country had resulted in the difference in political culture - the Koreans were subjected to the harsh discipline of the Japanese Colonial Rulers, while Singapore had the benefit of a benevolent rule from the British Colonial Office.<br><br>Yet the common Asian trait exist from the influence of Confuscian philosophy in the respect towards authority, and the necessity for society to have defined law and order.<br><br>This resulted in the Korean rule under a strong man for many decades, as well as the present experience in Singapore.<br><br>Korea had the strong rule of the late President <a href="http://www2.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/park.htm" rel="nofollow"><strong>Park Chung Hee</strong></a>. while Singapore had over 45 years of LKY - as a PM, then as SM, and currently as MM.<br><br>With the assassination of the Korean Park Chung Hee, it allowed Korea to blossom to its full potential; while Singapore is still floundering under the insistent influence from the Rule by the POWER OF ONE.<br><br>Chaebols formed by the Korean Government ? You may have got some wrong information on this topic, as the <a href="http://www2.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/chaebol.htm" rel="nofollow"><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Korean Chaebols</span></strong></a> are mainly Private Family owned Companies.<br><br>These Private Korean Companies were encourage to grow aggressively by Park Chung Hee, who directed his Government to work closely with these Private Korean Companies so as to compete globally.<br><br>This approach was modelled after the large Japanese businesses that are completely owned and operated by Private Japanese Families. These Zaibatsus are involved in manufacturing, trading, banking, and with their activities covering all marketing levels and axis.<br><br>While the large Korean population provide a good domestic base for her manufacturing industries, the output capacities are all geared for export to earn foreign exchange.<br><br>The economy of Korea during the rule of Park Chung Hee was much like a Command Economy, similar to the Communist model - (Park was a Socialist before he came into prominence in the Military); and ironically, the economy only took off after the assassination of Park Chung Hee by his trusted Head of the Korean Intelligence.<br><br>His demise allowed a fresh beginning for South Korea, and resulted in liberalisation of its political, social, cultural and economic development.<br><br>Singapore remain bridled by the weight of a monolithic power that is afraid of change to its own political fortune through liberalising and truly plugging the Citizens to a Global World - all that is said are mere lip service; and all that is done, are much like <span style="font-style: italic;">wayang kulit</span>.<br><br>Singapore's manpower requirement is much like that of a Command Economy, with the human resources being filtered and classifed into abilities at the age of Six Years, and depending on the needs of the economy, co-horts of students are then moved into different levels of trainings so as to meet the needs of the economy.<br><br>The Singapore education curriculum has drawn criticism when critically evaluated from different perspectives, and yet paradoxically will win praise for some of its unique practices.<br><br>Unfortunately, the Singapore economy continue to recruit applicants with some years of experience, and seems reluctant to provide on-the-job or in-house training for the inexperienced and untried - unlike Korean Companies that put new recruits to work as apprentice or serve internships.<br><br></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I get the points made correctly:<br>1.

The democratic process that took place from 1987 had its financial crisis and setback in 1997...from 1998 a series of reforms made to Chaebol and other parts of the economy...giving us the the current form and shape of the Korean economy (Source: Wikipedia).</div>

Our attempt at high value mass production of electrical products was also a failure - with nothing comparable to the range of mobile phones, notebooks, plasma and LCD TV and monitor screens, and a whole range of household electrical goods produced by Samsung and LG.<br><br>Singapore found a niche in the petro-chemical industry reaching the Number 2 spot in world production; and as well as in the Financial sector with services to the region in special fund raising programs through IPO; and other Financial Consultancy and Banking Services.<br><br>After the last crisis in 1997, Biotech and Life Sciences were included as niche areas that will propell Singapore forward.<br><br>Unfortunately these niche activities require the expertise which are not locally available, and require a large input of the controversial Foreign Talents.</span><br><blockquote><strong><br>2.

His atrophied muscles will need guidance and training to regain its familiarity of new found strength and freedom.<br><br>Therefore, it is not surprising that there was a period of turmoil and conflict in Korea, when they begin to search for a way forward.<br><br>Singapore can avoid this experience, if civil institutions that are non-political should now be remodelled to stop and reverse the process of politicizing. Such civil institutions will form the bedrock of stability in any transition of political powers - as such it is left to the responsibility of the present Ruling Party to ensure that such a situation exist.</span><br><blockquote><strong><br>3.
