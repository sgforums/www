The impact of the revision on the resident unemployment rate series is minimal. <br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> True. Even though the effect is minimal, it still subtracts 0.1 Â– 0.2% of the unemployment rate. For non-resident population, it takes away 0.4 Â– 0.8%. In business / economy / politics, it is often the case whereby overall unemployment rate is quoted. Taking the two together to get the overall rate, the new methodology results in lower unemployment. It is like doing nothing and claiming the economy is improved. In fact, China did announce to change their methodology recently.<a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-10/22/content_3666127.htm" rel="nofollow">http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-10/22/content_3666127.htm</a> Our govt just quietly change can liao.<br><br><strong>Only by generating actual and true statistics, can these accurate and comparable data be better use for drafting policies and new law. Also, which clause in the document suggest that there will be no Resident Unemployment Rates data in the near future. It only advise on the new methodology. </strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Correct. I was not hinting at no data, it is whether the data is useful that matters. For example, suppose 100 out of a population of 1000 people are unemployed on a small island Â– 10% overall unemployment. Of these 100, 60 are natives, 20 are visitors (8% resident unemployed) and 20 are outsiders. Now, 40 jobs are created, and the visitors and outsiders become employed. Therefore, overall unemployment falls from 10% to 6%, resident unemployment falls from 8% to 6%. Economy improves that is for sure, resident welfare improved?<br><br><strong>Fall? The unemployment rates are on the raise. Look at the chart. Although it is seen raising, I wish to refer you to philip's curve (page 2) - where there would be a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. </strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Correct on Philips curve, but I was referring to MOM report.<br>(cut and paste again below)<br>5) Preliminary estimates show that the seasonally adjusted overall unemployment rate improved slightly to 3.3% in September 2005 from 3.4% registered three months ago.  Among the resident labour force, the rate was 4.4%, also lower than the 4.5% in June 2005.<br>6) On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, the overall unemployment rate dropped sharply from 4.3% in June 2005, when this yearÂ’s batch of tertiary graduates joined the pool of job seekers, to 2.9% in September 2005 as more job seekers secured employment.  The seasonal decline also resulted from fewer students looking for temporary jobs as they returned to school after the mid-year vacation. Among the resident labour force, the non-adjusted rate was 3.8% in September 2005.  An estimated 69,400 residents were unemployed in September 2005.  The seasonally adjusted figure was 81,200.<br><br><strong>Yes. Being employed does not necessary means better welfare. But that is all about it. Look at the Residential Unemployment figures. At least 7/10 jobs are taken by Singaporeans.</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Where did you get the closely guarded information? The NTU professors got into trouble because they worked out their own calculation, simply because MOM does not publish sensitive information. The Resident Unemployment figures are whole numbers in units of thousands (Â‘000) not in percentages.<br><br><strong></strong></div></blockquote></div>
