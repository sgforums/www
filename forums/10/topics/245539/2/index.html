I posted in a few posts ago that every electorate 85% of the population is sheep, the remainder seek to manipulate the people, and the others are so disgusted with everything but just simply powerless to do anything or don't care. I am guessing that you actually subscribe to that school of thought where people are sheep to be manipulated. Now tell me now, since you clearly regard people as sheep to be bullied, manipulated etc. Why should we listen to the Govt who actually doesn't do things that are in our interest but theirs? Moreover, it is pragmatic that the Govt lies to us and cover up their misdeeds to give a pretension that they are doing things in their interest and yet aren't.

            <div class='col-md body'>Just my 2 cents on this particular reply by OM<br><br>I just met a chinese couple from Singapore, now migrated to the US and holding US greencard. They came to Singapore because they were looking for a better life from Nanjing. Indeed, they did enjoy the perks that Singapore gave to TALENTS. Her husband got his PhD from NTU and became a research fellow in GINTIC. However, after giving birth to a son, the wife left Singapore with her Singapore passport to Canada. After 2 years, her husband got a job based on his position in GINTIC in a US govt organization.<br><br>The main reasons for leaving were:<br>1. She did not want her son to do NS --&gt; NS dodging even before he had to do NS.<br>2. She saw how old people lived in Singapore and she did not want to (in her own words) buy prosperity with her youth and then pay for it in her old age.<br>3. Singapore was a unique meritocratic and pragmatic place that suited her pragmatic calculations - i.e. a great stepping stone to greener and more developed countries.<br><br>This is not the only episode or encounter with pragmatic talents that our govt wants to attract and then only lose to other places. But who can fault them since they all operate on the same pragmatic logic. You use me, I use you - all's fair.<br><br>What she couldn't understand was why I and my family are going back. Part of the reason is that I still consider Singapore my home. But with all the happenings in these few years, I wonder if that "idealistic" notion will survive. In fact, the current scheme that I am in has been discontinued in favor of attracting talents from north america by promising them with similar perks. Sad to say, most of my friends here only see Singapore as a poor poor alternative when they can't find anything better here in the US or for that matter in Australia.<br><br>So again, tell me why we are paying those guys up there millions when they fail to relook at specific policies? When they engage in groupthink?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">We have to come down hard on NS dodgers because they threaten to disrupt a system that works. If we do not come down hard on one dodger, we will have hundreds of 'young promising musicians' trying to dodge NS tomorrow. NS is essential for Singapore to have a viable military deterrent against real foreign threats. It is pragmatism that requires us to deny the aspirations of young musicians in the higher national interest.<br><br>Our pragmatic approach has brought Singapore from the third world to the first over the past 40 years. It is the myopic, obsessive idealism of living fossils that threaten our continued success against the wishes and interests of the majority of Singaporeans.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FYI, David Lane was only in Singapore till 2006. As for Dr Liu, I suspect he is still a US citizen though he heads up IMCB.<br><br>That's how pragmatism works. If that is what the govt is promoting, then Singapore will remain a port of call for professional workers without an identity of its own (other than a place for transient workers). In short, this is shooting ourselves in the foot and basically engaging a huge huge mistake. The point of this whole exercise is to develop talent and nurture talents and wanting talents to take root. Just attracting fly-by-night talents is a waste of resources that could be better used for other purposes.<br><br>Dsyequilibrium and state of flux do not necessary call for an ever pragmatic strategy. Rather, being surrounded by rapid and fluid environments requires one to not only be pragmatic to deal with short-term/near-term issues and challenges but more importantly, one has to have a vision - a long term goal/ideal to direct and chart the course. Without tempering pragmatism with idealism, one is doomed to mediocrity. This is evident from computer-generated agent simulation games. Agents that are only programmed with very short-term, specific (in this case pragmatic) commands will only find a local maxima that is usually not the global maxima. To circumvent this inherent problem, one have to be imbued with a larger sense of the environment in this case an analogy for idealism.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">First, your tale serves to illustrate what the government has been saying all along.

It will not. From the communes in Stalinist Russia and Maoist Chinan to the kibbutz of Israel, time and again it has been shown that even the most fervent devotees of Marxist ideology end up with a new ruling elite. Corruption is rife and life is worse than before. If there is an added measure of equality, it's just that everyone is equally poor and miserable.<br><br>Speaking as one having arisen from a very poor background, what the poor needs is not equality. That will never happen in any case. What the poor needs is social mobility. With access to affordable, high quality education and plenty of scholarships available for bright students from poor backgrounds, those with talent can move up the social ladder. As Shakespeare said, "lowliness is young ambition's ladder'; coming from a poor socio-economic background is one of the greatest incentive to work harder than everyone else. A government should reward such individuals with drive and ambition to succeed.<br><br>As Singapore becomes a wealthy developed nation, there is regression towards the mean. The poor aren't as poor as we were in the past and young people today tend to talk about their rights and entitlement, rather than fight for every opportunity to better themselves. It is not surprising that foreigners, more hungry and ambitious than we are, will begin displace us from jobs and positions.<br><br>Ranting about foreigners will not halt the competition. Mahatir discovered as much after he complained about the immigrant Chinese who forced the Malays out of their businesses in his book, The Malay Dilemma'. He admitted that the economic powess of the Chinese could be attributed to their hard work and even blamed the laid-back culture of his own race for their inability to compete. He responded by trying to protect Malay interests with extension of the New Economic Plan (NEP), which he admitted was a failure, years later.<br><br>The current Malaysian government is trying to exempt the southern Johor economic zone from the restrictions of the NEP. That is a pragmatic move to attract investment and a poorly-disguised admission of the failure of the race-based state ideology.<br><br>It is ironic that wimpy Singaporeans who cannot compete are trying to urge the government to repeat the mistakes others have already learned from.<br><br></div>
