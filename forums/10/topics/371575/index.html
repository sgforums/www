              <h2>Aggression in Asia (1954)</h2>
              <p><strong>M.K. Rajakumar</strong> and <strong>Poh Soo Kai</strong></p>
              <p>Originally published in FAJAR: ORGAN OF THE UNIVERSITY SOCIALIST CLUB, Issue No. 7, Monday, 10th May 1954. Transcribed by <strong>Karen Goh</strong></p>
              <p>Looming large in Asia once again is the threat of Western
                          aggression. The West has been the aggressor in modern history and Asia
                          has suffered bitterly from Western barbarity.</p>
              <p>The bitterness of these
                          memories is not easily removed. They will greatly influence Asian
                          thinking for a long time, until the West proves itself worthy of trust
                          and friendship. This day is yet to come and
                          vigilance is needed to prevent any form of Western imperialism getting
                          a foothold in Asia again. Recent events in Asia give great cause for
                          alarm.</p>
              <p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-220" title="fajar1954" src="http://s-pores.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/fajar1954.jpg" alt="fajar1954" width="224" height="300"></p>
              <p>We see signs all over Asia that that West is still a menace. In
                          Indo-China the French, backed by American arms, are striving to
                          suppress the Vietminh Nationalists in their struggle for freedom.
                          Republican China is being denied her rightful place in the United
                          Nations, whilst an émigré government is being maintained in Taiwan
                          under the protection of the U.S. navy.</p>
              <p>Republican India is being
                          dragged into the theatre of war by the purchase of American military
                          bases in Pakistan. Now we are told that Asia is to be defended, whether
                          she likes it or not. A military pact is being formed against Asian
                          objections and without Asian participation. We view this as being, in
                          Mr. A. Bevan’s words, “for the purpose of imposing European colonial
                          rule.”</p>
              <p>Little attempt is made to maintain more than a pretence of
                          consulting Asian opinion. The time is past, however, when European
                          nations could make decisions binding on Asia. But this is still not
                          recognized.</p>
              <p>The South East Asian “defence” pact is the latest example
                          of Western interference. Its immediate object is to stamp out the
                          freedom movement in Indo- China. Its long term object is to prevent the
                          development of any movement in Asia that will stand up against the
                          West. Asian national must take a firm stand now before it is too late.
                          We must warn the West to “Hands off Asia.”</p>
              <p>Clearly Asian friendship cannot be won under such hostile
                          conditions. Asia needs Western technical knowledge and we welcome
                          Western friendship. But there can be no compromise with colonialism in
                          any form. “The dramatic change, the psychological revolution” that
                          Jennie Lee speaks of is needed. Anti-communism is not a substitute for
                          this. Yet apparently this negative philosophy is all that the West can
                          offer.</p>
              <p>The prospect of Asia “going communism” has been responsible in a
                          large measure for every major Western concession ranging from Indian
                          Independence to land for the Chinese squatter in Malaya. Is it
                          therefore surprising that the spectre of Communism haunting the West
                          should leave Asia unperturbed? Is it any wonder that Asia will have
                          nothing to do with anti-communist fronts? For that is not our problem.
                          We need peace and freedom.</p>
              <p>The solidarity of Asia is the solidarity of
                          the suppressed. This alone is our fight and we will fight be our fight
                          and we still be dragged into no other. Our sympathies are with all
                          people like us who are thirsting for peace and freedom. We are
                          therefore comrades of the African struggling for the most elementary
                          human rights, of the Indo-Chinese fighting for his freedom. Our enemies
                          are those who would deny us these rights.</p>
              <p>Malaya, however, cannot choose. It is one more pimple on the face of
                          Asia where a Colonial Power rules with the help of quislings. As such
                          our interests will always be sacrificed to imperial expediency.</p>
              <p>Thus we
                          see our country being committed into a military alliance, the SEATO,
                          without the sanction of its people. Our young men are being
                          conscripted; our land is being turned into a military base. Our country
                          is to fight in wars over whose making it will not have any say. We must
                          collaborate in crushing the Indo-Chinese people.</p>
              <p>We are to be the
                          allies of petite fascists like Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai Chek and hibun
                          Songgram who stand for totalitarian tyranny. We would rather stand with
                          Republican Indian, Republican China, Republican Burma and their allies
                          in Asia and Africa. The people of this country do not identity
                          themselves with the actions of the Colonial government.</p>

              <h2>A Personal Journey In Search Of Fajar</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>...This got me interested in the contributions of the English-educated
                          in the anti-colonial struggle.</strong></span></span> I had done work on the Chinese-educated
                          and have come across the standard portrayal of the feeble attempts of
                          the English-educated in the anti-colonial movement. This has been a
                          point strongly made by Lee Kuan Yew in his memoirs and speeches, from
                          the 1960s to the 1990s.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I think we have reached a point where we need to reconsider the
                          history of the leftwing as more than the story of the Chinese-educated
                          and include the English-educated as well as the involvement of the
                          Malays and Indians in the leftwing movement.<a title="_ednref1" name="_ednref1" href="http://s-pores.com/2007/04/fajar/#_edn1"></a> This is in light of recent scholarship by Tim Harper, Huang Jianli and
                          others presented at the 2005 Paths Not Taken conference in Singapore.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Last year, a group of my friends, mostly young researchers, got
                          together to start an independent project to document the history of the
                          University Socialist Club. So far, we have made some preliminary
                          findings, including on the Fajar case.</p>
              <p>For this short essay, I will start off with the chronology of the
                          Fajar case, followed by what we have learned from the Colonial Office
                          (CO) papers on this matter and end with some questions that remain
                          unanswered...</p>
              <p>...Why are we interested in the subject? <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Because it is part of our legacy
              as former students of the university, whether it was University of
              Malaya, University of Singapore, and now, the National University of
              Singapore. We are products of the system and by remembering significant
              events such as the Fajar case, we learn what was achieved before by
              students then and perhaps this could inspire our students today...</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>Singapore political life and intellectual life have really regressed and suffered under Lee Kuan Yew's repressive rule.</p>
