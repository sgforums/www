              <p>1) Whether the REAL cost is above the global market price or
              not, is irrelevant to the discussion about the price of pork,
              because only one price clears the market</p>
              <p>it's the global market price for pork. If the price of pork in
              the global market is $30 per kg, the pig farmer can only sell at
              $30 per kg to clear the market. If the</p>
              <p>government removes the subsidies totally, the REAL cost of
              production of pork ends up being $100 per kg.</p>
              <p>Do you think suppliers will pay $100 per kg to the pig farmer
              when they can source for cheaper alternatives in the world market
              at $30 per kg?</p>
              <p>Subsidies is an act of protectionism, because the government
              deems that the particular industry is critical to it's future
              survival and self sustenance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Whether it's curved or straight line, the basic principles of
              demand and supply is the same. Maybe you can tell us what purpose
              be it if the demand &amp; supply is</p>
              <p>not a straight line?</p>

              <p>1) Basic knowledge. You assume on the part of the government. Your entire argument is based on your assumption that the government give subsidies to the farmers expecting nothing in return.</p>
              <p>2) Erm. Demand and supply curves are only straight lines in the imaginary worlds existing in class rooms.</p>

              <p>Do you have the figures to substantiate your point about
              transportation being a major cost component?</p>
              <p>Or are you just pointing in every direction you can except the
              P4P?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a) Since you say that currencies from these countries have
              weaken against the Singapore dollar, shouldn't the price of our
              foods be cheaper too as we also</p>
              <p>import food from these sources.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>b) You mean there is no competition in the food &amp;
              agricultural industry? I am flabbergasted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>c) I thought according to the P4P Ministers, they said that the
              growth for Singapore in 2008 is 4% to 6%.</p>
              <p>Your statement also contradicts with your fellow P4P supporter
              elindra who said:</p>
              <p>"And when those fashion houses come up with new designs and set
              a high price to it, people will still buy and because designs defer
              you can't really do an actual comparison."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess what all you guys are doing is just pointing the finger
              in all directions except the real cause of it all.</p>
              <p>You guys are in denial.</p>

              <p>a few points</p>
              <p>a) Theoretically that is correct. Backorders will indeed be filled at a cheaper price. But we're not talking about a snapshot in time. In the same logic, forward orders will now take more margins to fill.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>b) That's not what he said. I myself am flabbergasted at your comprehension skills.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>c) now you're trusting the pap source, which is hilarious in itself. But you're missing his point. He's talking about the world market price, not the bubble you deal in. Local growth has practically no correlation with what will happen to global prices</p>

              <p>what exactly is your point?</p>
              <p>Scenarios A and B:</p>
              <p>A(Temasek is linked to the gov):</p>
              <p>1) Your argument falls apart if you cannot prove Temasek INCREASED it's profits substantially via increasing prices. If any increase in profits come from extra usage/extra customers/stockpiled goods, your argument is moot. (It is, btw)</p>
              <p>2) The paper loss in their current investments are massive, as you have repeatedly pointed out. Are you so delusional that you think it's so easy to cover with a few increases in utilities charges?</p>
              <p>B(Temasek is independent of Singapore)</p>
              <p>1) Then why are you bashing so hard a privately owned fund? That's ridiculous</p>
              <p>2) If that were the case, it has no value in trying to make the government look good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You obviously side on A when you want to prove Temasek is harming us, then B when you want to make the point that Temasek is selfish. WTF.</p>

              <p>4) reverse engineering of facts. You cannot quote inflation rates and then start looking for problems. Problems emerge as well when a country suffers from DEFLATION. But I don't think you'll be outraged when prices come down, would you? What is good for the common man is not always good for the society.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>1) So you agree that the increase in prices was due to government's policy of importing immigrants from other countries?</p>
              <p>You always deny that any issues are the government's fault, it's always somebody else's fault.</p>
              <p>Have you knock your head on something today?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) No natural resources does not necessarily imply higher prices. If you have a country A with say crude oil and a country B without crude oil but with</p>
              <p>processing capabilities. Country B imports crude oil from country A (with transportation cost), after refining the crude oil country B sells it's refined</p>
              <p>crude oil to other countries (with transportation cost). Remember our natural resources is our skilled manpower, other countries lack skilled manpower.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe you can also provide an explanation as to why our inflation rate was contained within 1% in the past, whereas it has sky rocketed to 6.6% at the</p>
              <p>present. We still import resources as we do in the past.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Maybe you can provide another reporting by researching and giving us the figures for other similar countries not faced with economic uncertainty?</p>
              <p>I welcome you to research and provide us with other data.</p>
              <p>The countries I posted are either similar in GDP per capita or higher, there is some basis for comparison.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Reverse engineering of facts? It's more like root cause analysis. Obviously when a problem emerges, one has to do a root cause analysis to find the</p>
              <p>cause of the problem. Surely a responsible person would not cast the problem aside without finding the true cause of the problem and committing further</p>
              <p>similar problems in the future. I agree that there are problems both with recession and high inflation, I only expect that the government can target an</p>
              <p>inflation of 2-3%, not recession or high inflation (like the current situation). If there are no common men, there won't be a society. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>what exactly is your point?</p>
              <p>Scenarios A and B:</p>
              <p>A(Temasek is linked to the gov):</p>
              <p>1) Your argument falls apart if you cannot prove Temasek INCREASED it's profits substantially via increasing prices. If any increase in profits come from extra usage/extra customers/stockpiled goods, your argument is moot. (It is, btw)</p>
              <p>2) The paper loss in their current investments are massive, as you have repeatedly pointed out. Are you so delusional that you think it's so easy to cover with a few increases in utilities charges?</p>
              <p>B(Temasek is independent of Singapore)</p>
              <p>1) Then why are you bashing so hard a privately owned fund? That's ridiculous</p>
              <p>2) If that were the case, it has no value in trying to make the government look good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You obviously side on A when you want to prove Temasek is harming us, then B when you want to make the point that Temasek is selfish. WTF.</p>

              <p><br>Obviously you are too inept to understand quasi-independent company (fake), I have always stated my views that Temasek is government linked.</p>
              <p>It's just that you are too daft too understand it or too much in self denial mode to see it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>Obviously you have problems understanding the statement, I will make it bold for your failing eyesight and brain:</p>
              <p>"<strong>According to some pro P4P supporters</strong>, they say that Temasek don't even belong to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>So why would a profit motivated company bother about Singaporeans who has no connection with it."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Ermmm....Have you read my earlier post about the cost of electricity in Australia?</p>
              <p>Have you read my earlier post about the return on equity (ROE) for Singapore Power being higher than OCBC?</p>
              <p>Have you read my earlier post about El Paso Electric Company in the US having an ROE of around 10%?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Glad to say that you have still abit of semblance of intelligence left in you to see that the paper losses in her investments is massive.</p>
              <p>Nothing that an increase in electricity, rentals, transport, communications and food, can't correct.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have never cited your example of B before, please sustain your accusations through evidence.</p>
              <p>You trying to shove words into my mouth again?</p>

              <p><br> 1) So you agree that the increase in prices was due to government's
              policy of importing immigrants from other countries?</p>
              <p>You always deny that any issues are the government's fault, it's
              always somebody else's fault.</p>
              <p>Have you knock your head on something today?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) No natural resources does not necessarily imply higher
              prices. If you have a country A with say crude oil and a
              country B without crude oil but with</p>
              <p>processing capabilities. Country B imports crude oil from
              country A (with transportation cost), after refining the crude oil
              country B sells it's refined</p>
              <p>crude oil to other countries (with transportation cost).
              Remember our natural resources is our skilled manpower, other
              countries lack skilled manpower.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe you can also provide an explanation as to why our
              inflation rate was contained within 1% in the past, whereas it has
              sky rocketed to 6.6% at the</p>
              <p>present. We still import resources as we do in the past.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Maybe you can provide another reporting by researching and
              giving us the figures for other similar countries not faced with
              economic uncertainty?</p>
              <p>I welcome you to research and provide us with other data.</p>
              <p>The countries I posted are either similar in GDP per capita or
              higher, there is some basis for comparison.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Reverse engineering of facts? It's more like root cause
              analysis. Obviously when a problem emerges, one has to do a root
              cause analysis to find the</p>
              <p>cause of the problem. Surely a responsible person would not cast
              the problem aside without finding the true cause of the problem and
              committing further</p>
              <p>similar problems in the future. I agree that there are problems
              both with recession and high inflation, I only expect that the
              government can target an</p>
              <p>inflation of 2-3%, not recession or high inflation (like the
              current situation). If there are no common men, there won't be a
              society. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>1) I have never denied it is gov policy to bring in immigrants. What are you talking about.</p>
              <p>2) Pretty sure we haven't invented free instant teleportation yet. Correct me if i'm wrong.</p>
              <p>3) You're right, i should provide it. Will work on it.</p>
              <p>4) I'll show you why your reasoning is flawed here. Every government has a similar target, yet many fail year after year to hit it. There's a reason for this. Trying to control inflation is like trying to control the market. Sure, it can be done...but more often than not, it spins out of your control. If we were to want to blame the gov for letting it spin out of control, we would similarly need to praise it for keeping it in check. Yet I have yet to hear anyone express wonderment at how well the gov has fared in this aspect the last decade. Also not forgetting your parting statement, consider the fact that practically nothing that benefits the individual ant will end up benefitting the hive.</p>

              <p>for part 2, yes, straight lines curves are for the classroom. However, that's because it has to be simplified to explain basic economic theory.

              <p><br>1) I am not sure what you have studied in your university. From the way you are questioning me, it looks like you are someone who is only seeing things on the surface without asking why and how this can happen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You keep telling us that the price of pork in Germany is cheaper than Singapore, but did you ask yourself how this can happen when :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a) The cost of labour in Indonesia, Brazil or China is a tiny fraction of what the Germans are paid in Germany.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>b) Singapore doesnt have import duties for pork</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>c) The cost of running a pig farm in tropical region is cheaper than Germany because they dont need heater to keep the pig warm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) I am not surprise that you are using the economic textbook like a Bible or Quran The only differende is, people do interpret the Bible or Quran differently and wrongly, and thats why we have so much violence in this world today. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Talking about economic textbook, you might want to look under the section which they explain about different type of supply and demand graph and look for one where price is regulated by the government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are we talking about pork or deer meat?</p>
