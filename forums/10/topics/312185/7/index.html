              <p>1) Do you know every single price of every product in your supermarket? You were the one who wanted to tell everyone that you have done research on the reason why pork prices are cheaper there than in Singapore. Didn't you? Your research should have also given you the prices, else isn't it just half-fucked research done?</p>
              <p>2) Am I right to say that we talking about inflation in this thread with thread title</p>
              <h1>Inflation in Singapore Hits 6.7% for Feb 2008!!!</h1>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Your this statement shows very very clearly how you like to divert away from the thread titles.</span> </span></p>
              <p><br>3) Not wrong to make assumption, but from assumptions to "proven" is a different story. I'm also assuming you entered IMH frequently, as seen by your frequent periods of MIA here.</p>
              <p>4) This again shows you diverting from this thread. Very very off.</p>
              <p>5) You did not answer how you could make a conclusion on a long standing debate that no one has no answer. You really think you are above all experts?</p>
              <p>6) When you are irrelevant or wrong, I will point it out. And if you prove yourself, fine. But when you cannot prove it, this is all you are capable of?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just answer the following question:<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why are you drawing
                                              parallels to a <strong>current situation that has already
                                              happened</strong> with a "if" future event that does not look like
                                              it will happen in the near future?</span></p>
              <p>Any compelling reason why you continuously avoid answering this question? Is it because you think it is embarassing to admit that you made a mistake? Are you a man?</p>

              <p>1) Do you know every single price of every product in your supermarket? You were the one who wanted to tell everyone that you have done research on the reason why pork prices are cheaper there than in Singapore. Didn't you? Your research should have also given you the prices, else isn't it just half-fucked research done?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Am I right to say that we talking about inflation in this thread with thread title</p>
              <h1>Inflation in Singapore Hits 6.7% for Feb 2008!!!</h1>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Your this statement shows very very clearly how you like to divert away from the thread titles.</span></span></p>
              <p><br>3) Not wrong to make assumption, but from assumptions to "proven" is a different story. I'm also assuming you entered IMH frequently, as seen by your frequent periods of MIA here.</p>
              <p>4) This again shows you diverting from this thread. Very very off.</p>
              <p>5) You did not answer how you could make a conclusion on a long standing debate that no one has no answer. You really think you are above all experts?</p>
              <p>6) When you are irrelevant or wrong, I will point it out. And if you prove yourself, fine. But when you cannot prove it, this is all you are capable of?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just answer the following question:<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why are you drawing parallels to a <strong>current situation that has already happened</strong> with a "if" future event that does not look like it will happen in the near future?</span></p>
              <p>Any compelling reason why you continuously avoid answering this question? Is it because you think it is embarassing to admit that you made a mistake? Are you a man?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, I admit I screwed up because I thought you are not an empty vessel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Yes we are talking about Singapore, but you were talking about GERMAN pork. So why bring up germany if you dont want anybody to talk about anything outside Singapore? Plus who set the rules that we are not suppose to talk about global issues when discussin about inflation? (Arent you exposing your limited understanding of the subject again huh?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3/4) Take your time, you can go library, talk to friends, do wiki whatever, just dont embarress whoever who is trying to help you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) It only goes to show how much you know about inflation and how dependent you are on what others said and not your own common sense. Am I as good as who? Try to use external supports to make you look smart? thats so lame!!</p>

              <p>1) Since you claimed that you know so much about germany, I am
              giving you the benefit of doubt that you are not an empty vessel
              making noise. While doing that, I also do know of the EU farm
              subsidy which I highlight that we must take into consideration when
              comparing price.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, I admit I screwed up because I thought you are not an
              empty vessel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Yes we are talking about Singapore, but you were talking
              about GERMAN pork. So why bring up germany if you dont want
              anybody to talk about anything outside Singapore? Plus who set the
              rules that we are not suppose to talk about global issues
              when discussin about inflation? (Arent you exposing
              your limited understanding of the subject again huh?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3/4) Take your time, you can go library, talk to friends, do
              wiki whatever, just dont embarress whoever who is trying to
              help you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) It only goes to show how much you know about inflation and
              how dependent you are on what others said and not your own common
              sense. Am I as good as who? Try to use external supports to
              make you look smart? thats so lame!!</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6) I would be glad to learn something new, if whatever
              I posted was rubbish please do let me know. Of course, I
              dont expect you to mix and match what I said with nonsensical
              assumptions.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>1) Do I have to repeat every single post made to show you your nonsense?</p>
              <p>2) That explains very well why you frequently go out of point.</p>
              <p>3,4) On 2nd thoughts, I will stick to my original decision to be lazy in explaining to you. As qlqq9 said, you just want to win.</p>
              <p>5) Remember, I said I think it will not affect as much; it doesn't mean it won't affect at all. There are many more reasons to the increase in food prices (even this is stated in the article you posted). Trying to use external supports? Are you a hypocrite who puts out an external link and tells us not to be dependent on what others said? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>6) Nah, as shown in the thread on correlation, even when I pointed out how wrong you were in your concept of correlation, you would still think it rubbish.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, you still want to win. Ok, I declare that TCH wins! Happy?<br>*Claps*</p>
