              <p>Exchange rate policies by MAS of managing the exchange rate within a trading band?</p>

              <p>Singapore's inflation is not solely due to agricultural products, if you look at the first post, we have increases in all other sectors (housing, transport &amp; communication,</p>

              <p>Maybe because the mark up for clothing is already extremely high (always more than 100%)</p>
              <p>And when those fashion houses come up with new designs and set a high price to it, people will still buy and because designs defer you can't really do an actual comparison.</p>

              <p><br>Transportation is definitely a big cost component for perishable items such as fresh vegetable, seafood and meat stuffs. And being a nettimporter, a rise of transportation cost will have a bigger impact on cost of goods than countries with their own primary industry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reasons for the reduction of price of clothing could be</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a) Currencies of textile exporting countries such as Vietnam and China have weaken against S$ over the past 12 months</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>b) More competitions</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>c) Consumers are delaying or reducing their purchase of clothing due to uncertainty in economic growth. </p>

              <p>Isn't it a basic economic phenomenon (when demand outpace supply, prices will rise to equilibriate to market clearing price)?</p>
              <p>This basic law still fails to explain why our inflation is higher than other countries.</p>
              <p>Why is it that our inflation is higher than the other countries I posted in page 1?</p>
              <p>Would you accept the explanation that the increase in housing prices was due to the recent government's policy in immigrants?</p>
              <p>The increase in present immigrants and future immigrants led to a shortfall in housing, thereby leading to prices of housing to increase.</p>
              <p>The increase in immigrants also resulted in an increase in the money supply thereby exacerbating the effects of inflation (transport &amp; communications,</p>
              <p>food and healthcare).</p>

              <p>1) Whether the REAL cost is above the global market price or not, is irrelevant to the discussion about the price of pork, because only one price clears the market</p>
              <p>it's the global market price for pork. If the price of pork in the global market is $30 per kg, the pig farmer can only sell at $30 per kg to clear the market. If the</p>

              <p>Do you think suppliers will pay $100 per kg to the pig farmer when they can source for cheaper alternatives in the world market at $30 per kg?</p>
              <p>Subsidies is an act of protectionism, because the government deems that the particular industry is critical to it's future survival and self sustenance.</p>

              <p>With the losses in some of our overseas investment, where else can they look for to increase profits to cover the losses and still show healthy profits.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to some pro P4P supporters, they say that Temasek don't even belong to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>So why would a profit motivated company bother about Singaporeans who has no connection with it.</p>

              <p>Isn't it a basic economic phenomenon (when demand outpace
              supply, prices will rise to equilibriate to market clearing
              price)?</p>
              <p>This basic law still fails to explain why our inflation is
              higher than other countries.</p>
              <p>Why is it that our inflation is higher than the other
              countries I posted in page 1?</p>
              <p>Would you accept the explanation that the increase in housing
              prices was due to the recent government's policy in immigrants?</p>
              <p>The increase in present immigrants and future immigrants led to
              a shortfall in housing, thereby leading to prices of housing to
              increase.</p>
              <p>The increase in immigrants also resulted in an increase in the
              money supply thereby exacerbating the effects of inflation
              (transport &amp; communications,</p>
              <p>food and healthcare).</p>

              <p>1) increasing population-&gt;increase demand-&gt;increase prices.</p>
              <p>2) no natural resources-&gt;everything imported-&gt;naturally higher prices</p>
              <p>3) Biased reporting. Please post the countries that have HIGHER inflation rate than singapore as well.</p>
              <p>4) reverse engineering of facts. You cannot quote inflation rates and then start looking for problems. Problems emerge as well when a country suffers from DEFLATION. But I don't think you'll be outraged when prices come down, would you? What is good for the common man is not always good for the society.</p>
