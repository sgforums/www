              <p>What I am trying to highlight to you is that the farmers in Germany are getting about <strong>€</strong>10,000,000,000 worth of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">financial aid</span> from the government <span style="text-decoration: underline;">each year</span> and that is the reason why the pork prices in Germany can be cheaper than in Singapore, where 100% of our pork are imported from countries where they dont have such generous farm subsidies.</p>

              <p>Yes, less people will want to be farmers... According to economic theory, prices will rise, yes, but not to the full extent of the full amount of tax/subsidy...</p>
              <p>At the very most, prices will rise to the level such that it covers the 'missing' subsidy. But then, lesser subsidies will mean lesser tax on the products too. Thus, overall, the prices would not sky rocket.</p>
