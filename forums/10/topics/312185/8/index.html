              <p><br>Thats because Japan is still a very closed economy, in the sense that they seldom source their raw material from non japanese companies even though they are cheaper. With less external competitions, naturally the price of products will be higher.</p>

              <p>Your observations are not that accurate. What you say is probably true 2-3 years ago but the Japanese Yen has fallen about 20% since 3 years ago. Singapore items on the other hand, have risen significantly over the years. Consider these 2 factors, the gap has certainly been bridged.</p>
              <p>Now for similar products e.g. Coke at 7 eleven</p>
              <p>In Singapore it would cost 1.80 but in Japan it would only cost 100-120 Yen (1.66 SGD on 120 Yen)</p>
              <p>Clothing at UNIGLO ( the giordarno equivalent) cost from only 1000-2500 yen (14SGD to 34SGD)</p>
              <p>Their 100 Yen shops beat Singapore hands down in terms of prices too.</p>
              <p>Also consumer electronics in general are cheaper than Singapore</p>
              <p>Even the price of housing has come down significantly. For 300-400k SGD, Japanese families can own real property and not 99 leases, although the apartment size is smaller.</p>
              <p> Several months back when JPY was trading at 130 it would have been even cheaper.</p>

              <p>2. coke here in some abc stores in sgp is only 65 cents. i agree the 7-11 comparison is not appropriate. most drinks off vending machines or the convenient stores in japan are competitively priced, around the 110yen. here, 7-11's items are overpriced.</p>
              <p>3. the 100Y stores is japan offers much better value, price-wise and range. i visit them everytime i am there. here, a daiso equivalent go for $2 per item, but at 100yen stores in Japan, it is actually cheaper over there.</p>
              <p>4. uniglo stuff mainly comes from china. there are not exactly cheap. cheap relative to clothes prices in japan, but not when compared to elsewhere.</p>

              <p><strong>i hope you are not aruguing just to win. What i am trying to point out is the perception of high cost of living is no longer as true as 3-4 years back. Their currency has depreciated and the rest of the world has caught up.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>JPY was trading at 168 against SGD in 2003-2004  and 130 last year  so there is a big change in terms of cost of living.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Wrong. In many asian countries such as Taiwan and Japan, 7 Eleven is very popular. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Only in Singapore where there is is a duopoly, prices are allowed to escalate to such level. The same applies for Singapore Power charging Singaporeans 23.88 kWh when Hong Kong and Australia are charging 17 cents and 15 cents/ KWh respectively.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Japanese Yen has fallen about 20%? depending what currencies
                                              you are talking about.</p>
              <p><strong>I wasnt precise about the dates, but admit it, JPY has fallen significantly.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> 3) 100 yen shops are mainly selling rejected and firesale goods,

                                              quality of their products, one can obviously tell that the quality

                                              is high enough to compensate for the rejects.</p>
              <p><strong>I am comparing the same product in bargain shops with Singapore and Japan. The same product cost only $1.45 in Japan but in Singapore it can cost up to between $2 - $4.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>My point is that the perception that almost all of the products are over priced is not true. I went to the supermaket and the cost of meat is not too far from Singapore too.You made a sweeping statement about over priced Japanese goods, and anyone who has been there recently knows you are bullshitting.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Japanese Housing have fallen so much that HDB looks overpriced. 300-400k for a 70 year lease or 300-400k for a real freehold property ( but smaller)?</strong></p>

              <p><strong>JPY was trading at 168 against SGD in 2003-2004  and 130 last year  so there is a big change in terms of cost of living.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Nobody buy things at 7-11 unless if you are too rich or you have no choice.</p>
              <p><strong>Wrong. In many asian countries such as Taiwan and Japan, 7 Eleven is very popular.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Only in Singapore where there is is a duopoly, prices are allowed to escalate to such level. The same applies for Singapore Power charging Singaporeans 23.88 kWh when Hong Kong and Australia are charging 17 cents and 15 cents/ KWh respectively.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Japanese Yen has fallen about 20%? depending what currencies you are talking about.</p>
              <p><strong>I wasnt precise about the dates, but admit it, JPY has fallen significantly.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> 3) 100 yen shops are mainly selling rejected and firesale goods, hence you cant use that as comparison. however by looking at the quality of their products, one can obviously tell that the quality standard of their products is very high and the profit margin is high enough to compensate for the rejects.</p>
              <p><strong>I am comparing the same product in bargain shops with Singapore and Japan. The same product cost only $1.45 in Japan but in Singapore it can cost up to between $2 - $4.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>My point is that the perception that almost all of the products are over priced is not true. I went to the supermaket and the cost of meat is not too far from Singapore too.You made a sweeping statement about over priced Japanese goods, and anyone who has been there recently knows you are bullshitting.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Japanese Housing have fallen so much that HDB looks overpriced. 300-400k for a 70 year lease or 300-400k for a real freehold property ( but smaller)?</strong></p>

              <p>What I am trying to highlight is that Japan being a closed economy, doesnt welcome foreign companies to sell into the Japanese market despite offering cheaper price.  And for that reasons, the Japaness companies are actually commanding astronomical profits, which flow within the japanese economy.</p>
              <p>And which is why for such a relatively small country, they can generate a GDP that is second only to United States.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the same bargain products you are comparing in Singapore are coming from Japan, then you will have to factor in the shipping cost, packaging cost and the profit for the middle man in Japan and profit and cost of Singapore retailer?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The reason why Japanese Yen has depreciate against Singapore is because the Yen are very closely linked to the US$ because United States is their biggest trading partner and they have huge investment in the country. On the other hand, the Japanese Yen has actually appreciate against the US$. Hence if the Japaness are importing raw material in US$, the product is actually becoming cheaper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, have you heard of $150 rock melon? Thats what the japanese are willing to pay for fruits.</p>

              				Singaporeans?<br><br>At the very end of the piece (see below) the
              				reported read: "most of those (British expats) living in
              				eight of the ten countries said the cost of living was lower than

              				anyone find the British or Italian prime minister paying himself

              <p>Japan is a Closed Economy and North Korea is a Keiretsu. In your own words, Closed Economy = Keiretsu.</p>

              <p>What I am trying to highlight is that Japan being a closed economy, doesnt welcome foreign companies to sell into the Japanese market despite offering cheaper price.  And for that reasons, the Japaness companies are actually commanding astronomical profits, which flow within the japanese economy.</p>

              <p>Just hopefully the ppl able to profit from these investment. Only bad thing is our living standard will be somewhere btw those FT. Poor sg r now feeling the heat and pressure coming from Gov and FT, and we don't have strong support from local union.</p>

              <p><br>maybe "closed" enconomy might be more application. In any case, the economy might be open for business, but the businessmen are not too open to doing business with foreigners.</p>

              <p>If you have no idea what is "closed economy", don't use it.</p>
              <p>If you have no idea what is "correlation", don't use it.</p>
              <p>Can explain your theories in simple terms, we know you are not educated in Economics</p>
              <p>and you haven't had any proper tertiary education.</p>
              <p>That's why whenever we asked you to explain your theories, you can never do it, you can</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thats because Japan is still a very <span style="text-decoration: underline;">closed economy</span>, in the sense that they seldom source their raw material from non japanese companies even though they are cheaper. With less external competitions, naturally the price of products will be higher.</span></p>
