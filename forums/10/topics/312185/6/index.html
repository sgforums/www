              <p>1) I have changed it. I have no idea why you would blindly accept a piece of information and attempt to defend it without first making sure it is accurate. At least when I discover I make a mistake, I will say it out. Will you? Obviously not, with the recent example of you trying to tell us about correlation when you are so obviously wrong in the concepts.</p>
              <p>2) Obviously, I'm talking in the context of this thread, and not out of point, when asking you the question.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why are you drawing parallels to a <strong>current situation that has already happened </strong>with a "if" future event that does not look like it will happen in the near future? </span>Doesn't make sense right? Or are you just trying to divert away again?</p>
              <p>Btw, do you also need me to point out how wrong your if analysis is? That is the main reason I'm laughing at you, because you have no idea on what is happening in Europe. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why talk about international trade when you don't even have a idea on the situation there?</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Do you even know how Germans view pigs?</span> Do you even know their culture for it? Do you even know who in Germany eats pork and who doesn't? Isn't it obvious that you are just shooting aimlessly without having even experienced or learned about the culture? Spend some time to read up on their way of life before discussing on international trade.</p>
              <p>The number of ifs situations are so many that one can easily raise another 2 or more situations to tell you that your conclusion could be otherwise. Seems like you are trying to conclude in one post an ongoing debate about the EU subsidy, just like what you did with the Biofuel. Are you thinking you are better than the world's experts combined?

              <p>1) Whether the REAL cost is above the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">global market price</span> or not, is irrelevant to the discussion about the price of pork, because only one price clears the market</p>

              <p>Do you think suppliers will pay $100 per kg to the pig farmer when they can source for cheaper alternatives in the world market at $30 per kg?</p>
              <p>Subsidies is an act of protectionism, because the government deems that the particular industry is critical to it's future survival and self sustenance.</p>

              <p><strong>1) We are talking about current inflation in Feb 08,
                                              about current affairs<br></strong></p>
              <p>All you are talking about is "Supposed if", things that have not
                                              happened, and does not seem that it will happen in the near future.
                                              Please tell us how your "Supposed if" situations are related to
                                              this thread on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">current
                                              prices</span>.</p>
              <p><strong>2) We are talking about why is there <span style="color: #ff0000;">high inflation in Singapore as compared to the
                                              lower inflation in other countries</span> posted by

              <p>Yet now you are talking about how EU's "supposed if" removal of
                                              subsidies can possibly cause inflation <span style="text-decoration: underline;">worldwide</span>. Again, show us how

              <p> </p>
              <p>And TCH replied:<br>2) You are asking how EU farm subsidies can
                                              affect inflation in Singapore. I have explained to
                                              you using 2 scenario and ofcourse, I need to use IF or

              <p>nah you have not proven anything</p>
              <p>You raised a point totally irrelevant to this topic, and by questioning you on your irrelevant post, you think it is a lack of understanding? Wow. Your book taught you that?</p>
              <p>Let me repost the history for you:</p>
              <p>TCH:<br>You mean you still cant see the link between government subsidies and inflations?</p>
              <p>Eagle:<br>Kindly tell us the link between subsidies for German Farmers on pork prices vs Singapore Inflation<br>-- which of course is talking about this thread on Inflation in Singapore for Feb 2008</p>
              <p>TCH:</p>
              <p>-- Totally no link at all to Feb 2008, and only one sided piece of argument</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eagle:<br>I'm laughing at the idioticity of this post. Nvm, I'm too lazy to explain to you why. Shall let others look at this and laugh at your simplicity too.<br>-- Just have to laugh at his idiotic post</p>
              <p>TCH:<br>Isnt that obvious that undergrad like you have no clue about how international trade function these days. May I suggest</p>
              <p>that you buy yourself this book to enrich your knowledge on world trade before making a fool out of yourself.</p>
              <p>--immediately thinks he is correct and thinks that this proves eagle have no understanding when eagle laughs at his idiotic posting</p>
              <p>Eagle raises 2 points:</p>
              <p><strong>1) We are talking about current inflation in Feb 08, about current affairs<br></strong></p>
              <p>All you are talking about is "Supposed if", things that have not happened, and does not seem that it will happen in the near future. Please tell us how your "Supposed if" situations are related to this thread on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">current prices</span>.</p>
              <p><strong>2) We are talking about why is there <span style="color: #ff0000;">high inflation in Singapore as compared to the lower inflation in other countries</span> posted by maurizio13.</strong></p>
              <p>Yet now you are talking about how EU's "supposed if" removal of subsidies can possibly cause inflation <span style="text-decoration: underline;">worldwide</span>. Again, show us how your points are related to this point made by maurizio13.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And TCH replied:<br>2) You are asking how EU farm subsidies can affect inflation in Singapore. I have explained to you using 2 scenario and ofcourse, I need to use IF or suppose to make it clear to someone who have zero knowlegde on world trade and globalization.<br>-- which of course have no link to inflation in Feb 08</p>
              <p>And so Eagle asked back:<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why are you drawing parallels to a <strong>current situation that has already happened</strong> with a "if" future event that does not look like it will happen in the near future?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And TCH decide to evade the question by saying:</p>
              <p>I have already proven your lack of understanding on world trade, pork price, and inflation.</p>
