              <p><br>1) What it means is that the price of PORK in Gemany are selling below the farmer REAL cost and the reason why the farmers can afford do it is because they are getting subsidies from the government who is using the income tax revenue to pay for the subsidies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) May I know what are you trying to tell us with that supply and demand curve because in the real world, it can never be a straight lines and since farm subsidy (which will affect the selling price) is regulated by government hence I cannot see how you can represented it such simply S&amp;D chart.</p>

              <p>government removes the subsidies totally, the REAL cost of production of pork ends up being $100 per kg.</p>
              <p>Do you think suppliers will pay $100 per kg to the pig farmer when they can source for cheaper alternatives in the world market at $30 per kg?</p>
              <p>Subsidies is an act of protectionism, because the government deems that the particular industry is critical to it's future survival and self sustenance.</p>

              <p><br> 1) I am not sure what you have studied in your university.
                  From the way you are questioning me, it looks like
                  you are someone who is only seeing
                  things on the surface without asking why and how this can
                  happen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You keep telling us that the price of pork in
                  Germany is cheaper than Singapore, but did you ask yourself
                  how this can happen when :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a) The cost of labour in Indonesia, Brazil or China is a
                  tiny fraction of what the Germans are paid in Germany.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>b) Singapore doesnt have import duties for pork</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>c) The cost of running a pig farm in tropical region is
                  cheaper than Germany because they dont need heater to
                  keep the pig warm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) I am not surprise that you are using the economic textbook
                  like a Bible or Quran The only differende is, people do
                  interpret the Bible or Quran differently and wrongly, and thats why
                  we have so much violence in this world today. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Talking about economic textbook, you might want
                  to look under the section which they explain about
                  different type of supply and demand graph and
                  look for one where price is regulated by the government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are we talking about pork or deer meat?</p>

              <p>Just to inform everyone, I made a mistake in the cheaper part. I just compared the price of minced pork in cold storage vs in Germany again. In Germany, it was about 3 euros for 500g in the supermarket, that means $13.20 per kg. Cold Storage here sells for $13.10 per kg. So it is about the same price.</p>
              <p>Now considering my mistake, I'm now wondering why TCH continuously tries to defend his point that because farmers receive subsidies, the price of pork is cheaper there than Singapore. Seems like he only take information for granted.</p>

              <p>1) Our discussion on EU farm subsidy all started because of EAGLE claims that the pork in Germany is cheaper than Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) TCH assume that what Eagle claimed is right and try to highlight that it is due to the 10 billion euro EU farm subsidies the german farmers are getting, and that is why their pork can be competitive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) TCH then go on to ask Eagle, how can a german pork be cheaper when the cost of running a pig farm in Germany is so much higher compare to Indonesia, China and Brazil.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Eagle that admitted that what he claim about pork in germany being cheaper is rubbish.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) Eagle then ask TCH to tell him the link between subsidies for German Farmers on pork prices vs Singapore Inflation</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6) TCH explain</p>
              <blockquote>If the EU government stop giving out farm subsidies, the local farming industry will collapse and eventually, germans will have to import their food stuffs from overseas. Which means, they will be fighting for supplies with importing countries like Singapore, which will result in a shortage of supply and price hike.
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the german government increase their subsidies to farmers, the price of products will become cheaper and make imported products less attractive, which then will create less demand for non EU agriculture products, or the germans might increase their export overseas.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>8) TCH request Eagle to read up the book The World Is Flat to get some understanding on globalisation before making a fool out of himself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>9) Now Eagle start talking about current affair and call me name again.</p>
              <p> </p>
