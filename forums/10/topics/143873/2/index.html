            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday went to the library and it was so crowded in the Central Lending Library and has a lot of book collections too. Which I look until I giddy. I went to the reference library but the guard said that bags are not allowed and asked me to put inside the locker and decided that don't want to go already and next round then go and some reference library is not open too like the Rare collections. The environment there is nice especially the glass lift which look outside the scenery is very nice. All the things there are high -tech too like the borrowing of books, bookdrop, finding of books and etc. It was fanstatic man! I encourage everyone of you all to go. Even though it cost so much to build this library, it is still for us to use and share in a good way.</div>

Do you really believe that those 13 storeys are truly for what they had said?<br><br>I have know for a very long time that you can never take the PAP's word for it- let it be NLB top officials, ministry officials and small-time employees or the top brass of PAP itself.<br><br>In any case, then what are the National Archives for? And in the digital age, do we still need 13th storeys to store books- when there are computers which can shrink the amount of space? Cmon.</div>

You don't need to go to the library many times to do research.<br><br>This isn't the early 20th century or 19th century where people had to go to the library just because most libraries were the only ones to have reference books on normal subjects and sensitive information- at that period of time.<br><br>Besides, the internet will get better and more secured over time. Although the library will still remain important as a source of information and research, the internet will also take over some roles of the library too.<br><br>In any case, you have stated that many floors were empty when you visited it. Whether or not you had the intention or not, my first impression of that statement only verifies my belief that a 14 storey tall NLB HQ is not necessary.<br><br>And it will get less necessary with the rapid advancement of the digital age where more and more information will be stored in online reference books- that can only be accessed by certain people- and also by the public, if there are two portals catering to both groups separately.<br><br></div>
