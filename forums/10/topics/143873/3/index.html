            <div class='col-md body'>I definately won't go to the new library- it is more costly to travel there when I can go to nearer ones like M.Parade, Bedok or Tampines.<br><br>Moreover I can get most of my info from surfing internet.<br>Think it is too much to spend on a library- $200M. Should have use the money to subsidise health care/ help jobless, elderly etc.<br><br>Also what's the point of having a modern  bldg with many beautiful gdns. which are not accessible to the public.

            <div class='col-md body'>$200 million is a lot of money indeed. But if we compared that amount to the Esplanade's $600 million tag, I feel that 200 mil is just peanutsÂ… err, I mean well-spent.<br><br>Firstly, the building was just constructed and newly furbished. I think that there are probably detailed plans on the development of the other levels. My guess is that the borrowing floor will be expanded to more than one level as the NLB expand the size of the collection of books there.<br><br>Second - I was there myself, and I thought that the overall architecture was nice - the views from the green spots were great, and the spaciousness is a welcomed relief after being cramped for most of the day in the office. Considering the building as a long term investment, I can't really complain that the NLB have build something that is pleasing to the eye, comfortable, and have sufficient space for many other developments.<br><br>In my opinion, the NLB is one of the most impressive government-ran organisation around. The improvements that was implemented in the last couple of years range were all very well done.<br><br>Their revamped borrowing counters are fast, efficient and convenient. Their book drop makes book returning possible even at late hours - and unless I am mistaken, their electronic tagging is so good that seconds after you dump the book - it's registered as returned.<br><br>Gone too was the need to return the books to the exact same library that it was borrowed from - we can dump the book at any one branch and it will be rerouted to the library it originated. And in the last few years NLB also build an online search engine for its books - which adequately covers the search of specific titles/authors as well as the status/location of the desired text. Renewals, bookings can also be done online.<br><br>Hours are extended from 9 to 9 to the convenience of the working class. Newer branches like Marine Parade or Orchard are integrated with cafes for a cup of coffee while reading. Many of the libraries are conveniently located Â– near MRTs or town hubs.<br><br>My point is : I give the NLB credit for the good work/planning it have done thus far. And I think that we should all wait abit longer to see how the plans for the rest of the library are going to be implemented. If the NLB can do as good as job with the new place as what they have done so far, then I think the new library will be a great place to look forward to.<br><br></div>
