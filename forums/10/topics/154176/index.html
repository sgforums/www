            <div class='col-md body'>UNION membership fees will go up by $1 to $9 per month from 2006, announced NTUC Secretary-general Lim Boon Heng yesterday at NTUC's Pre-ordinary Delegates Conference.<br><br>But the hike, which will lead to an increase in monthly revenue of $112,500 for NTUC, will be mainly ploughed back into benefits for workers, said Mr Lim.<br><br>Currently, union affiliation fees to NTUC can only cover 19 per cent of its total operating expenses. The rest come from investment income, donations and sponsorship.<br><br>"The increase in fee is to strike a balance between what we think we should be getting from union membership fees versus other donations. The more resources we can get, the more we can do," said Mr Lim.<br><br>The last time NTUC increased membership fees was five years ago. In fact, for the past few years, NTUC had wanted to increase its fees, but had resisted doing so because of Sars and the Iraq war, explained the labour chief. But if NTUC continues to defer the increase, it's effectiveness would be affected, said NTUC's deputy secretary general Mr Lim Swee Say.<br><br>"I think if we were to become overly dependent on our social partners, the danger is either we will do less for the workers or we become less effective as an independent voice," said the deputy secretary general.<br><br>And union members seem to agree with the rationale. Said Union of Security Employees president N Silva: "When we heard about fee hike initially, some lower income workers were not happy. When anything increases except for pay, we will surely complain.<br><br>"But after we realised that the extra $1 will lead to increased resources for the unions, which can then do more for the lower income families, we feel that this will definitely more than cushion the fee increase."<br><br>The various unions are expected to announce benefit schemes for their members on the second day of the delegate conference tomorrow.<br><br>Yesterday, NTUC also unveiled a $1.15 million "Back to School" programme to help needy union members defray the cost of school-related expenses. More than 10,000 school children from 5,000 lower income households, ranging from pre-school level to post-secondary level, are expected to benefit from this programme, which starts in December.<br><br>Under the scheme, which is co-funded by NTUC and the Singapore Labour Foundation, union members with school-going children and who meet the income criteria, will be given $100 worth of "Back to School" vouchers. Those with more than one school-going child will be given more, subject to certain conditions. Valid till Jan 31, the vouchers can be used to purchase textbooks, shoes, uniforms, stationery, and other items in preparation for a new school term.<br><br>During the media conference, labour chief Mr Lim also urged employers not to discriminate against older workers. He suggested that the government incentivise employers who are willing to hire older workers and make an effort to re-design jobs to suit them.<br><br>The Singapore Workforce Development Agency is currently looking at how this can be implemented on selected companies, said Mr Lim.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sept 27, 2005<br>Why young workers are not joining unions<br><br>I READ with interest the report, 'Union membership fees to increase next year' (ST, Sept 23), that there will be a $1 increase for all NTUC-affiliated union members.<br><br>Based on the 450,000-strong union membership, that's a whopping $450,000 per month and $5.4 million per year. The 'Back to School' programme will receive only $1.15 million per year.<br><br>The article also quoted a unionist as saying that some members are taking home between $700 and $800 and, to survive, they had to find a second job. Their pay had not increased since 1998.<br><br>Another unionist also expressed concern about attracting younger members as younger workers feel that they can take care of themselves and don't need to join any union.<br><br>I questioned the relevance of being a union member in this globalised and ever-changing world a couple of years ago. Let me reiterate that if unions do not re-invent themselves fast enough, they will be sidelined.<br><br>Union membership has slipped globally as workers today depend on themselves to ensure that they are employed. Many younger people are forever retraining and upgrading themselves and thus do not need any union to ensure that they stay employed.<br><br>In Singapore, we have an excellent government which takes care of its people well and which has foresight and is always communicating in a timely manner to the people about changing global trends so that citizens can be prepared and be ready for the challenges ahead.<br><br>So what's the relevance of being a union member? The anecdote about the one-piece swimsuit and the bikini was interesting. A worker who can add or create value, and thus ensure that his company improves on its bottom line, depends solely on himself to stay employed, and not on the union per se.<br><br>When a company's bottom line is hurt and it decides to downsize, the company does not discriminate as to who to retrench - union member or non-union member. The person who works well and adds/creates value will stay. It's as simple as that.<br><br>How many of today's union leaders are below 50 years of age? NTUC-affiliated unions need to renew themselves with younger people at the helm as these people have a better feel of younger people's needs and are more receptive to new ideas. Even the managers of companies are getting younger these days.<br><br>Finally, will the extra $5.4 million collected yearly benefit all members or only a selected group? Will the additional funds ensure that members will always have jobs so that they can put food on the table, pay the mortgage, and not need to hold a second job, thus spending more time with their families?<br><br>Increasing the membership fee sends the signal that every business, in order to improve its bottom line, can increase the price of its products/services, citing increasing cost of doing business or that the price of its products/services had not been raised for the last so many years.<br><br>This will start a vicious circle of increasing prices, with some workers having to look for a second job just to put food on the table.<br><br>Riana Afiffin (Mrs)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe i am not getting it.  If it is a union, why is it being run more like a business than a union?  Why is there a need for increased membership fees when the union itself is engaged in income earning activities?  Aren't the different activities related?  I mean in that the revenue ultimately goes to the same parent company?<br><br>Participation in unions is a questionable act (in the local context) .  How does increasing membership fees add to its credibility?</div>
