              <h1>Flash in the pan no more: MM Lee now heaps praise on Obama</h1>
              <p><strong>From our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore’s octagenarian leader Minster Mentor Lee Kuan Yew had made
              another stunning reversal when he heaped praise on United States
              President Barack Obama</strong></span></p>
              <p>“He is a very eloquent man who can be very persuasive….And what
              impressed me most was his ability to appoint people with opposing,
              different minds,” he said of the US President during a National Talk
              show with U.S. journalist Charlie Rose.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lee had earlier described Obama as a “flash in the pan” and a
              “lightweight” </strong></span>compared to his Republican rival John McCain during the
              United States presidential elections last year.</p>
              <p>He also insinuated that Obama does not have the experience to lead
              the United States and he would trust McCain more where foreign policy
              is concerned especially in the handling of the two wars in Iraq and
              Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>Lee was forced to eat his own words when the Americans voted
              overwhelmingly for Barack Obama who has won plaudits for his leadership
              so far both at home and abroad.</p>
              <p>As usual, Lee found fit to dispense his pearls of “wisdom” to the
              Americans by urging the U.S. to avoid “getting entangled in the
              internal strife of Afghanistan”.</p>
              <p>‘Trying to make a country out of Afghanistan is a
              distraction…..There was no country in the last 30 to 40 years. They’ve
              just been fighting each other since the last king was chased out. How
              on earth are you going to put these little bits together? It’s not
              possible.”</p>
              <p>Lee argued that the longer-term strategic challenges for the US are
              not hot spots like Iraq and Afghanistan, but the resurgence of Asian
              powers like China and India.</p>
              <p>During a speech made after he won the presidency, Barack Obama
              promised that the United States would help undemocratic regimes
              worldwide to “unclench their fists” in obvious reference to Myanmar,
              Iran and North Korea.</p>
              <p>Mr Obama should not be deceived by Lee when they meet tomorrow.
              Despite its status as a first world nation, Singapore is not any less
              repressive that the “axis of evil”.</p>
              <p>Under Lee’s one-party system of government, there is no opposition
              to check on the ruling party, the civil liberties of the people are
              severely curtailed and political dissidents risked being harassed and
              arrested by the police.</p>

              <p>Fucking hypocritical bastard, that Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>Like a two headed fucking snake.</p>

              <p>I think you need a broader world-view if you think we're oppressed.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew could have led on as Prime Minister if he wanted to, and joined the ranks of other power-hungry asian contemporaries like Ferdinand Marcos, Mao Zedong and Suharto. He stepped down in 1990 precisely because he wanted to ensure continued stability in the government and in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The difference between him and other political leaders is that he really does care more about Singapore than himself. Despite being basically the founder of our prosperity, he never created or encouraged a personality cult like those said leaders. He never sought attention for himself. That's what makes people respect him.</p>
              <p>Put yourself in his shoes; imagine if Singapore never succeeded, which was a big possibility when he started out. With that in mind, how easy is it for you to forsake a better and safer bet as a lawyer, and pour out so much work for your country that may not develop. It isn't easy and it takes a lot of love and will to do that.</p>
