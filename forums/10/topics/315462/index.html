              <p>The government simply fails to understand logic. If it does not want
              hand-out then it should not over-burden the ordinary citizens by
              over-taxing and over-charging.<br> <br> It is a simple logic that citizens should not depend on welfare or hand-out.<br> <br> There is however an even simpler but often forgotten logic - if you do
              not hand out do not over-tax or over-charge the people and let them
              live with their own means.<br> <br> Practise a low-tax regime like HK and keep all prices reasonable
              especially low cost housing, basic food items, medical care, utility
              and transportation.<br> <br> Worse is to set up all the GLCs and get GLCs to charge monopolistic prices as seen happening in housing, medicare and utility.<br> <br> Government makes billions out of housing and double-charging on lands
              and infrastructure and yet has the hypocrisy or temerity to talk
              constantly about no free lunch when its ministers keep increasing their
              own salaries and taking free lunches by the millions.<br> <br> Government should re-examine such basis principle of government and go
              back to basic if it wants to grow a more cosmopolitan and competitive
              economy to keep up with Hong Kong and many others.<br> <br> Stop squeezing more monies from people and stop the hypocrisy in its
              propaganda about no free lunch and stop making such obscene hidden
              profits on the quiet to impoverish the many hapless and struggling
              citizens.</p>

              <p>Jojobeach,</p>
              <p>What you have said is the birth right of every citizen. Down here citizens' right to elect the government from the best individuals of passion and talents and leadership is not possible because the government has lost all the original visions of a good government we have shouted for as a people during merdeka. Why? Because once people are elected to power and people became naive to acept propaganda without questioning the leaders with good and independent views on roles and responsibility of government leaders became bolder and bolder and will pass all sorts of laws to increase their powers and ignore the people's needs. Today people are suffering gladly because of their own naivety to accept all such propagandas and nonsense. By using propaganda like "rule of law", "racial harmony", "freedom of press is lawlessness", "yes-men are million-dollar talents" "foreign talents create jobs" "small and resourceless island", "meritocracy equal opportunity", "no free lunch" we the people have been deceived into making men gods who accordingly uses excuses  to increase their power by passing all sorts of power to rid of their oppositions, control all the MPs into yes-men and circumvent and elliminate all of such citizens' rights. Without citizens' exercise such right through the public media or holding of protests to express their needs we will continue to be governed by rogue government.</p>
