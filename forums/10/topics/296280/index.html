            <div class='col-md body'>Maid's death sentence commuted<br><br>From correspondents in Kuwait City | December 10, 2007<br><br>KUWAIT'S emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, agreed overnight to commute the death sentence on a Filipina maid to life in prison after a personal appeal by the visiting Philippine president.<br><br>"Normally I don't interfere in the judicial process. We have a separate judicial system," Philippines presidential spokesman Ignacio Bunye quoted the emir as saying during a meeting with President Gloria Arroyo.<br><br>"But since you are here to personally appeal for her, I will not sign the decree of execution. That is within my power," Mr Bunye quoted Sheikh Sabah as telling Ms Arroyo during their brief meeting.<br><br>Ms Arroyo arrived in Kuwait overnight on a day-long visit to the Gulf state to urge that the death sentence passed on Marilou Ranario, who was convicted of killing her female Kuwaiti employer, be commuted.<br><br>Sheikh Sabah also vowed to "further reduce the penalty" when the parties sign a forgiveness letter, said Mr Bunye in reference to an agreement by the victim's family to forgive Ranario.<br><br>Ms Arroyo was due to leave Kuwait later today.<br><br>In 2005, Ranario was sentenced to be hanged for killing her 46-year-old female employer, who she said had insulted both her and her country.<br><br>Philippine vice-president Noli de Castro previously met the victim's family and sought their forgiveness in the hope of paying "blood money" to spare Ranario's life, but the overture was rejected.<br><br>Another Filipina maid is also on death row after Kuwait's appeals court in September confirmed her death sentence for killing her employers' two children early this year.<br><br>She is awaiting the final verdict of the supreme court.<br><br>Ranario's case has drawn widespread attention in the Philippines, where the economy relies heavily on remittances from nearly eight million Filipinos working overseas.<br><br>About 73,000 of them work in Kuwait. About 60,000 are women employed mainly as maids and earning less than $US200 ($230) a month on average, labour groups say.<br><br><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22897624-12377,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22897624-12377,00.html</a></div>
