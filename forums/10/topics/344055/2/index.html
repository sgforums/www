              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Singapore. The right to live normal lives.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Unlike normal people all over the world, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singaporeans are unable to express themselves openly. The Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew government have laws in place to prevent anyone ever openly
              challenging them. Laws prohibit public speaking and public assembly.
              With the one party state, the government can enact any legislation, any
              law, any policy they want. Regardless how you may feel, how much you
              suffer, you have to suffer in silence.</strong></span><br><br>This sort of a life is
              fit only for caged animals. Not human beings. How could you, as human
              beings, accept to live such lives? Why do you do it? Why do you suffer
              in silence?<br><br>Public Entertainments Act, an odd name for
              activities totally unrelated to entertainment, requires those wishing
              to speak in public or assemble in public to obtain prior permission
              from the Singapore Police.</p>
              <p>In the application, you have to state your
              reasons, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and if it happens to be relating to criticism of government
              policies or laws, it is automatically denied. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What this means is that
              regardless of what Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew's government does to you, with his one party rule, there is no
              avenue available to you to publicly express your dissatisfaction. No
              avenue open to you to try to persuade them to change their policies</strong></span>.<br><br>There
              are 2 opposition members out of 82 government members in Parliament.
              These 2 opposition members have been bought over by Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and therefore they are just like the other 82 members who only sing Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew's song. They cannot help the people.<br><br>Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew's one party state has citizen consultation sessions every week in
              housing estates for people to consult their members of Parliament with
              their issues. But these elected representatives are not truly
              representative of their constituents. The parliamentary elections are
              rigged in such a way that no one truly representative of their people
              can ever win political office. They are immediately sued, charged in
              court with trumped up charges and eliminated, leaving only Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew's agents as political candidates. They are not responsible to the people. Their job is only to please Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and his government. In return these government lackeys, pretending to be politicians are rewarded handsomely.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>When
              you cannot seek redress from your elected representatives, and when you
              have no other means to express your opposition to government laws and
              policies, there is nothing you can do but to suffer in silence.</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>With
              Singapore press entirely owned and controlled by the state, the true
              grievances of the people are kept under wraps; with the people not
              knowing what suffering their fellow citizens endure.</strong></span> The papers which
              serve Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and his government do not serve the people. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The people are kept unaware of the dire reality on the ground.</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The
              police are used to arrest and prosecute anyone who dares challenge
              these unjust laws. </strong></span>The police have turned out to be the enemy of the
              people.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> The people both fear and hate the police, who see them as
              instruments of Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew to suppress their fundamental human rights.</strong></span><br><br>Recently Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew has stepped up his repression. His Attorney General whose job is to protect and preserve Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew's rule has arrested more and more people who have challenged these
              unjust laws. They have been convicted and sent to jail for speaking or
              assembling in public. Yesterday, the Minister for Home Affairs has
              announced that the laws against civil disobedience are going to be
              tightened even further.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> One such new law will permit the police to
              arrest possible peaceful protesters even before they begin their
              protest. Exactly how this will be done is not explained but a guess
              would be for the police to enter people's homes or to arrest them <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">en route</span> to the protest location, when intelligence of a possible protest is
              received. In tandem, I expect the punishments to become harsher with
              lengthy jail terms and possible caning for protesters.</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>These unjust laws have permitted the Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew administration to continue so far through fear.</strong></span></p>
              <p>For instance
              Singapore law requires a person to be caned, a very cruel and
              excruciatingly painful punishment, for those who put up posters or
              slogans on walls or other surfaces. The idea is to prevent citizens
              from venting their anger by writing slogans such as "Down with Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_13" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew". That is why, unlike any other normal country, a visitor never
              sees any anti government signs or posters in Singapore. Whereas, the
              government posters and signs are all over the country. Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_14" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and his government are allowed to do it. Whereas you as a private
              citizen cannot. It is one law for Lee and his government. Another law
              for you.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is like Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_15" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, saying to you, "You shut up and do your work, or else".</strong></span><br><br>Have you ever thought to yourself that you are taxpayers? Don't you realize that it is your money that goes to pay this man Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_16" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and all his minions the outrageous salary, or theft, of $3.7
              million each a year. And since it is your money that pays them, are
              they not accountable to you? Why is it then, that you are not allowed
              to peacefully protest your grievances?<br><br>The people are suffering
              in many ways. Jobs are being lost, yet the government does not help
              those in need, but at the same time, these ministers continue to pay
              themselves these outrageous salaries, which I call call theft. People
              are not being permitted to draw on their retirement savings, because
              they have none.</p>
              <p>Astronomical rents for government housing has depleted
              their savings from the fund. The government refuses to say how much
              money they have as assets. The people are not told how of the assets is
              being siphoned off and stolen by these ministers. Old people in their
              80s are forced to work at food stalls cleaning tables when they should
              be given help to retire in dignity. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_17" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_18" class="blsp-spelling-error">Pao's</span>,
              or money handouts are being given only to selected friends and
              relatives of those in power and the truly needy do not get help if they
              are not politically connected.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>And to top it all, if you print or publish anything against these injustices, Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_19" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew's corrupt judges find you guilty of defaming his character,
              resulting in your having to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to
              him, and not being able to pay, you are bankrupted.</strong></span><br><br>Never mind
              the country for a moment. Just being humans, you should not tolerate
              this. Not for yourselves and not for your children. These laws are
              wrong. They prevent you from living normal lives. There is no pleasure
              in living lives this way. It is not good for your soul.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore
              is now effectively a police state. Anyone can be arrested anytime for
              any reason. The police are permitted to get away with anything, as long
              as it is on the orders of Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_20" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and his <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_21" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">government</span>.
              This situation is no different from Burma where the police are
              permitted to arrest anyone suspected of opposition to the military
              junta. The police remain immune from prosecution for their actions as
              along as it is done at the behest of Mr. Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_22" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew.</strong></span><br><br>I
              ask Singapore policemen and women to stop hurting their fellow citizens
              by obeying these unjust laws and orders. Refuse to obey. Tell Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_23" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew that as a human being and a police officer, you are not prepared to
              victimize your fellow citizens. Singaporeans who have friends in the
              dreaded Singapore Police Force should tell them they are doing wrong.
              It is wrong to unjustly hurt your fellow citizen merely because he
              holds contrary opinions.<br><br>If you have friends who are judges, tell them the same thing. Stop abusing the law to please Lee<br>Kuan Yew.<br><br>And
              as for the people, stand up and say no to these unjust laws. Stand your
              ground. Break these unjust laws. They have no legal basis and are
              unconstitutional. You cannot allow Lee to get away with this anymore.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br></strong></span><br>Gopalan Nair</p>
