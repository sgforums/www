              <p><strong>Two S’poreans protesting at MOM arrested for criminal trespass</strong></p>
              <p>Channel NewsAsia - <span><strong>Tuesday, January 13</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: Two Singaporeans protesting at the Manpower Ministry (MOM) were arrested on Monday for criminal trespass.</p>
              <p>In a joint statement, MOM and the Ministry of Home Affairs said Seelan Palay and Chong Kai Xiong entered the MOM building at about noon to protest against MOM’s refusal to renew the work permits of some Myanmar nationals.</p>
              <p>They refused to leave the premises despite being repeatedly ordered to do so by security personnel. Police were called in and they have since released the two on bail pending investigations.</p>
              <p>In response to media queries about MOM’s decision not to renew the work permits of a few Myanmar nationals, the ministries said Myanmar nationals who work, study or reside in Singapore are free to organise and express their political views so long as these are pursued within the framework of the Republic’s laws.</p>
              <p>They noted that a handful of Myanmar nationals had, however, shown a wilful disregard and contempt for the law and the Singapore authorities, even after benefiting from education subsidies and the hospitality of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Some, they added, had even demanded the right to stay in Singapore as if it was a matter of personal entitlement and had threatened to lobby political pressure through the media and agitate foreign public opinion against the authorities so as to compel them to concede to their demands.</p>
              <p>Such persons, the ministries said, are not welcomed in Singapore and should leave the country once their existing passes expire.</p>
              <p>The statement said they were free to leave for any country of their choice or any country which would have them.</p>

              <p>I mean.. if you really care about your country.. shouldn't you be more active IN Myanmar ? Or be working harder so you can send more money to the anti-junta organization ?</p>
              <p>It's like throwing stones at Myanmar from Sentosa and hoping it'll destroy the Junta ?</p>

His work permit expires on January 27. </span></p>

They are afraid Singaporean activists will emulate our demonstrations,” he said.<br><br>Burmese migrants have held demonstrations several times recently outside the Burmese embassy in Singapore, including protests in May against the junta's insistence on pushing ahead with the referendum in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis.

              <p>The Singaporean government refused to extend the work visas of at least five Burmese migrants last year for having police records of for being involved in demonstrations.<br><br>According to Burmese workers in Singapore, the city-state hosts more than 60,000 Burmese, who mainly work as general workers or technical skilled laborers, while some are students. <br><br>Public demonstrations are not allowed in Singapore without a police permit. <br><br>The Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs warned Burmese political activists not to ignore repeated police orders to stop illegal public protests in August 2008. <br><br>According to a report in the Singaporean daily <em>Strait Times</em> in August, a ministry spokesperson said that the rights of a foreign national to work or stay in Singapore is not a matter of entitlement or a right to be secured by political demand and public pressure, and the activists had repeatedly ignored requests from government officials to meet to discuss the group's conduct.</p>

              <p><br>More than public niusance. There were thousands of noisy Myanmar national protesters at Orchard and at their embassy. These were before the govt relaxed and changed the law on protest. <br><br>Poh Ah Pak once brought up the clip links to sgforums. You should see the clips.  At that particular points, all of them have breached the law of our country. Some were seen wielding sticks, mass agitating and song singing. <br><br>The Police was standing doing nothing. Clearly, the Police was outnumbered. I am not sure if this my imagination but some policemen looked scared. <br><br>What the govt doing now is to go for the ringleaders. This has always been the style of the PAP govt.</p>
