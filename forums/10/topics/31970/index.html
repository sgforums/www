            <div class='col-md body'>ha ha... a not too subtle veiled threat... seemingly in response to Australia's threats of pre-emptive strike to attack terrorism, but in reality, more directed at Sg...<br><br>the vocabulary is rather telling... "forward defence" is the term most favoured by SAF and MINDEF when talking about our defence doctrine... and the scenario painted is rather plain in referring to Sg...<br><br>even the mention of "bloody nose"... it is not referring to any western remark, but Sg's common response with regards to the forward defence doctrine... that if any one messes with Sg, Sg will give them a "bloody nose"...<br><br>and that cheap trick of refusing to directly point fingers, but neither confirming nor denying who he was referring to... childish... want to say, dare to say, then make yourself brutally clear  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>we'll see who bleeds more... if Sg moves, it won't be just to give them a bloody nose! we'll make sure they rot from the gangrene.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
