              <p>Chee (to Lee Hsien Loong): Would you refer to pg 192 of your AEIC, para 3 and read it to us.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee Hsien Loong starts reading. Just before he gets to the words
                                  he uttered about fixing the opposition and buying over his supporters,
                                  Mr Davinder Singh stands up.<em><span style="color: #ff0000;">(lion note:u see how cooperative our PM was ,just do what CSJ asked him to do in court.But LHL started waiting</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">for Chees from 10.58 am inside Witness Stand . Chees arrived at 10.05am)</span></em></p>
              <p>Singh: Objection, Your Honour.</p>
              <p>Judge: I’ll read it.</p>
              <p>Chee: Mr Lee, you read it.</p>
              <p>Judge: Dr Chee please tell us the relevance.</p>
              <p>Chee: This paragraph will show it’s true of him -</p>
              <p>Judge Move on, the question is disallowed.</p>
              <p>Chee: He has used words like “fix” and “buy votes”. He’s here to
                                  tell me that his reputation is based on so much. I’m here to demolish
                                  it, when he buys votes -</p>
              <p>Judge: Disallowed.</p>
              <p>Chee: Let it be recorded then. Mr Lee, come out and don’t hide
                                  behind your counsel. You have every opportunity to answer the
                                  questions. You allow your counsel to cover -</p>
              <p>Singh: Objection, Your Honour.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Judge: Court has taken note of Dr Chee’s conduct.</span></strong></p>
              <p><em>(lion note:Should Ravi remind Chee behave in court after this warning?)</em></p>
              <p>Chee: Mr Lee, please refer to pg 39 of your AEIC sub-heading “lack
                                  of transparency.” Do you agree with the last line and last paragraph
                                  that the GIC operates in secrecy?</p>
              <p>Singh: Objection. Dr Chee is seeking to reopen the issue. This
                                  article relates to the offending words. The meaning has been taken to
                                  be false. The question of liability is done.</p>
              <p>Chee: Turn then to pg 75 of your AEIC, bottom of the page. Is the Government transparent? Do you agree with this statement?</p>
              <p>Singh: I object.</p>
              <p>Judge: Irrelevent.</p>
              <p>Chee: Do you believe the funds belongs to the people?</p>
              <p>Singh: Irrelevent.</p>
              <p>Chee: Same line and reason, that he is the Prime Minister and takes pride in the integrity -</p>
              <p>Singh: The question is on the matter of Assesment of Damages -</p>
              <p>Judge: Move on, Dr Chee.</p>
              <p>Chee: You are the Deputy or the Vice Chairman of the GIC?</p>
              <p>Singh: Irrelevant.</p>
              <p>Chee: I want to establish that he says his reputation is sterling -</p>
              <p>Singh: My client didn’t say that.</p>
              <p>Judge: Yes.</p>
              <p>Chee: How and where you have invested the GIC funds?</p>
              <p>Judge: Move on.</p>
              <p>Chee: Were you aware of the scandal at NKF -</p>
              <p>Singh: Relevancy? NKF is a matter of liability.</p>
              <p>Judge: Dr Chee, irrelevant.</p>
              <p>Chee: Then you agree that T T Durai’s salary was excessive?</p>

              <p>Chee: Do you agree the salary -</p>

              <p>Judge: Irrelevant.</p>
              <p>Chee: If T T Durai had a summary judgement -</p>

              <p>Judge: Sustained.</p>
              <p>Chee: I disagree as the witness was a Prime Minister during the period and argued in Parliament -</p>
              <p>Singh: Maybe the Health Ministry was misled and my client did not know. The Government did proceed to investigate the matter.</p>
              <p>Chee: The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Health made
                                  comments and continued leading the people to donate to the NKF. You
                                  were the Prime Minister -</p>
              <p>Singh: Objection.</p>
              <p>Chee: Did you know the warning signals -</p>
              <p>Singh: Objection.</p>
              <p>Chee: These were raised in Parliament and whether he was sleeping like some of his colleagues -</p>
              <p>Singh: That is not necessary and insulting -</p>
              <p>Judge: Dr Chee, move on.</p>
              <p>Singh: I want to remind Dr Chee of the injunction against repeating -</p>

              <p>Judge: Disallowed.</p>
              <p>Chee: Do you think that your Ministers spend too much -</p>
              <p>Judge: Disallowed.</p>
              <p>Chee: I put to you that the PAP is bent on greed and power.</p>

              <p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
              <blockquote><strong> CSJ</strong>:  	    Mr Lee, we get to meet at last.<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>:  	    (pause)...Sorry?<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>:  	    We get to meet at last.<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>:  	    I thought we've met many other times across election rallies.<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>: 
                  Your memory fails you. I've never met you before and you know why?
                  Because you keep avoiding me. (Mr Lee laughs) Well, we have this
                  opportunity right now. Let me ask you this question. You gave an
                  interview saying: "If you defame us, and if I'm involved, I go to the
                  the witness box and you can question me not only on the particular
                  defamation issue, but on all issues in my life." Do you stand by your
                  words?<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>:  	I do.<br><br><strong> CSJ</strong>: 
                  Good. In the course of the cross-examination, will you then answer
                  questions not just on this particular defamation issue, but on all
                  issues in your life --<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"> </span>and I don't mean your personal 	life, I mean your political life? Will you stand by that?<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>: 
                  Your Honour, we appeared in court when the issue was whether or not the
                  summary judgment was proper. That was the time to challenge --<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>:  	Mr Lee, that was not my question.<br><br><strong>Judge</strong>:  	Allow the witness to answer. Mr Lee, please go on.<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>: 
                  I have to answer. I'm a lawyer. I no longer practice the law. I know
                  your purpose. You dodged that occasion and you're trying -- Dr Chee is
                  trying today when the issue is the question of quantum of damages, it's
                  not liability. I'm here to answer questions relating to the quantum of
                  damages.<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>:  Thank you. Then why is it that you say you will go to the witness box --<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>:  I have already explained that, Your Honour --<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>: 
                  -- and answer questions not just particular to this defamation issue
                  but on all issues of your life. Now tell me, are those just brave words
                  meant for public consumption and in this situation right now you're
                  turning tail and running?<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>:  Ha ha ha, no Your Honour --<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>: 
                  Good. Then you won't mind me asking you why is it that you make this
                  application to cut short your cross-examination precisely when you walk
                  in at noon and say that you have to be stopped in the cross-examination
                  by 2:15 giving me. the defence, only two hours and fifteen minutes, and
                  then insisting that all of us can't go for lunch. And on top of that
                  refusing to tell the court what this "important matter" you have this
                  afternoon is.<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>:  That's...Your Honour...(pause)<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>:  I'm lost for words too as I think you are right now.<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>:  ...(pause; Mr Lee was seen opening his mouth to answer but no words came out)<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>:  Go ahead, Mr Lee.<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>:  ...(pause)<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>:  No answer? That settles the question then. <br><br><strong>LKY</strong>:  Ha ha ha.<br><br><strong>Judge</strong>: Dr Chee!<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>:
                  Fine, let Mr Lee continue. I'm just waiting. He's probably lost for
                  words because he doesn't quite know what to say at this stage.<br><br><strong>Judge</strong>: If you keep interrupting the witness...Yes, Mr Lee.<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>: ...(even longer pause)<br></blockquote><blockquote><strong>CSJ</strong>: Please don't run down the clock. I've only got a few minutes.</blockquote>
              <p><br>At this stage, Mr Davinder Singh jumped in to bail out Mr Lee. <br><br><strong>Singh</strong>:
                  What is the question? Dr Chee has made so many points in his speech. He
                  has already been told that the time to cross-examine the witness was
                  during the summary judgment. If he had leave to defend. All issues
                  would have been open for Dr Chee to have questioned him. The witness
                  said that for Dr Chee to have questioned him. The witness said that Dr
                  Chee had dodged that application and is now trying through the back
                  door to introduce impermissible material. The witness said he is here
                  as he said to answer questions on quantum. Dr Chee should really get on
                  with the issue of quantum.<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>: Let me ask the
                  question again. Mr Lee, you have said that you are here to answer these
                  questions and I say that in that case why did you make an application
                  to, halfway through the session, want the court to cut short this
                  entire hearing. Now, I remind you that we have got until the end of
                  tomorow, the end of tomorrow. So we have one-and-a-half days. But you
                  insist that we have to finish by 2:15 for you to attend to some matters
                  that you won't even reveal to the court. Now I ask you now does this
                  sound like somebody who's willing to come to court and meet and resolve
                  the issues?<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>: Your Honour, I had a message
                  from one of my counsel's aides to say that I should be in court by here
                  2 o'clock - by 12 o'clock because Your Honour has imposed a guillotine
                  that the cross-examination of the prime minister would end at twelve.
                  So I turn up at twelve. I was told that the guillotine allowed - had
                  already been late he would be given 2 hours. I suggest - I asked my
                  counsel to request the court to finish this two hours so that I can
                  attend to some important matters. There's no disadvantage to anybody to
                  be sitting here and finishing off this cross-examination within the two
                  hours. What I do not want to be a party to is a deliberate abuse of the
                  process, of the proceedings of the court by delaying tactics.<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>: So, Mr Lee --<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>:
                  And by asking irrelevant questions, Dr Chee is running out the
                  gullotine. At the end of the day, we've had this confrontation face to
                  face have you thrown any dirt, have you dug up any scandal? Are you
                  still saying as you've said before that this government is run like the
                  NKF?<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>: Now, Mr Lee, let me try to --<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>: No, we are here because you have said that --<br><br>CSJ:
                  Mr Lee, I'm going to ask you this question and I wish you'd just stick
                  to the questions that I pose to you. I'm asking you why did you come to
                  court --<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>: Because I was asked --<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>: Let me rephrase my question. Are you telling the court that you had nothing to do with the curtailment of this entire process?<br><br><strong>Singh</strong>:
                  Your Honour, I made the application this morning and Your Honour would
                  remembers that I said I was very troubled with what the Chees did
                  yesterday and that it was quite apparent that they had nothing to ask
                  which was of any relevance and that unfortunately or otherwise has been
                  proven in this exchange. And I said, Your Honour, that the whole
                  purpose of the cross-examination was to insult, annoy and to scandalise
                  and that's also been proven true. For that reason, I had asked that
                  there be a guillotine. Your Honour had full powers to control the
                  proceedings. The order has already been made and I don't see why this
                  witness should be asked to explain something that was the subject of my
                  application and Your Honour's order.<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>: Do
                  you see the game that's being played here, Mr Lee? Do you see how you
                  are beginning to hide behind your counsel and then claim, "Look, I'm
                  willing to confront them. It's my counsel." Now I'm going to ask you a
                  very simple question: Right here, right now, tell Mr Davnder Singh
                  "Don't interrupt. I will answer these questions as they are put to me
                  right now."<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>: Heh-heh. Your Honour, I've
                  briefed counsel, I've always found it's never wise to be my own lawyer
                  in my own case. I know that some perople believe that they can do
                  otherwise, and I'm quite sure that Dr Chee is making a very great
                  impression on all the reporters in this court of how he is better than
                  Mr Ravi --<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>: I think you meant Mr Singh.<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>: I believe Mr Singh is better qualified to deal with the legalities of this case.<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>:
                  Well, I should hope so with all the training that he's got. Now, coming
                  back to my question, Mr Lee, is your answer no, that you wll not tell
                  Mr Singh: "Stay out of this. Let me answer my question because --<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>: I --<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>:
                  Let me finish my question -- because you have said -- and I repeat to
                  you -- that you will answer not only questions about the "particular
                  defamation issue, but on all issues in my life."<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>:
                  Yes...as long as that was what was an issue and that was the, it was an
                  issue in the summary judgement was appealed against. [Note how garbled
                  the answer is.] And we turned up for the hearing but you dodged the
                  hearing.<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>: Mr Lee, you are not unintelligent.<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>: Thank you.<br><br><strong>CSJ</strong>:
                  You knew precisely what you meant and what you mean is: "Come and ask
                  me all these questions that doesn't pertain to this defamation suit and
                  I will answer you because my entire standing, inlcuding the standing of
                  this government, is at stake." Is that not correct?<br><br><strong>LKY</strong>: I think, Dr Chee, we'll cut short this proceeding to become more relevant.</p>

              <p>Dr Chee: He (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) is talking about his integrity. Is
                                  this the same integrity that you are referring to when your government
                                  in 1963 arrested all your political opponents under Operation Coldstore?</p>
              <p>Mr Davinder Singh, counsel for the plaintiffs, rises to object.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee (turning to Mr Singh): Let him answer, he wants to answer.</p>
              <p>Judge Belinda Ang: Question is disallowed.</p>
              <p>Mr Singh: Thank you, Your Honour.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee: He wants to talk about integrity and I want to talk about
                                  integrity. Let’s talk about integrity, Mr Lee. Is this the same
                                  integrity as you are referring to when you jailed Mr Chia Thye Poh for
                                  32 years, when you imprisoned Dr Lim Hock Siew for 19 years, and when
                                  depriving them all –</p>
              <p>Judge Ang: Question is disallowed.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee Kuan Yew: May I point out to you what Singapore was when I
                                  became prime minister in 1959 and what Singapore is now. We had less
                                  than $100 million in the kitty. Now that the assets that we have and I
                                  am not disclosing this but Global Financial Services assessed
                                  Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund at over $300 billion.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee: I am impressed. Now –</p>
              <p>Mr Lee Kuan Yew: If you are impressed, Mr Chee – Dr Chee, if you’re impressed, you would not have made these allegations.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee: Mr Lee, is this the same integrity where you’re talking about declassified documents from London?</p>
              <p>Judge Ang: Irrelevant.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee: – that you have –</p>
              <p>Judge Ang: The witness is not required to answer.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee: And I would like – well, Your Honour, he’s brought up
                                  integrity and I just want to be able to pursue that line just a little
                                  bit more. Is it the same integrity –</p>
              <p>Mr Singh: Your Honour, I object to this line of questioning.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee: That you are referring to, Mr Lee, where now we begin to know –</p>
              <p>Justice Ang: Question is disallowed.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee: – and as a young man, I didn’t – I believed you but now I’m
                                  reading declassified documents from London saying that somehow –</p>
              <p>Mr Singh: Your Honour –</p>
              <p>Dr Chee: – somehow, Mr Lim Chin Siong –</p>
              <p>Mr Singh: Your Honour, please stop him.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee: – was in his –</p>
              <p>Judge Ang: Dr Chee</p>
              <p>Dr Chee: Was in his political situation, and that somehow –</p>
              <p>Judge Ang: Your question is disallowed.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee: – you had – I beg your pardon, Your Honour?</p>
              <p>Justice Ang: The question is disallowed. How is this relevant to the assessment of damages?</p>
              <p>Dr Chee: You haven’t even heard my question yet. You haven’t even
                                  heard my question. Let me ask the question and then you can disallow
                                  it, Your Honour.</p>

              <blockquote>The following refer to Lee Kuan Yew's testimony or rather the lack of it.<br><br>Chee
                  asked him whether he came to power through unfair means in 1959, as
                  shown by declassified British Colonial Office documents in London?
                  Question disallowed and the father shamefully just sits there,
                  protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.<br><br>Chee
                  asks about his throwing Lim Chin Siong, his political compatriot, in
                  jail under the ISA in solitary confinement for several years in the
                  1960s and whether this was a sign of a man with a reputation and
                  integrity? Question disallowed and the father shamefully just sits
                  there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.<br><br>Chee
                  asks about the Operation Cold Store in the 1960s where he jails
                  political opponents because he fears he might be overthrown? Question
                  disallowed and the father shamefully just sits there, protected by his
                  counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.<br><br>Chee asks about Chia
                  Thye Poh, Zaid Zakaharia and Lim Hock Siew, his political opponents
                  whom he imprisons without cause for many many years? Question
                  disallowed and the father shamefully just sits there, protected by his
                  counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.<br><br>Chee asks whether the
                  only people who have a good opinion of him are his state owned and
                  controlled Singapore press, whereas everyone else in Singapore as well
                  as the entire list of respectable foreign organizations and countries
                  including the entire European Union consider him as a thug and small
                  time street bully? Question disallowed and the father shamefully just
                  sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.<br><br>Other
                  than the dubious Transparency International Kula Lumpur Chapter (not to
                  be confused with Transparency International of Berlin Germany) he was
                  asked whether anyone else considered him in high regard other than the
                  local press which he controls? His answer was that PERC and a Swiss
                  organization, both of whom cater for businessmen thought highly of him.
                  But when asked whether highly respected Amnesty International, Human
                  Rights Watch, Lawyers Without Borders, Reporters without Borders, ILRW
                  and several other international bodies considered him a crook; he had
                  nothing to say, because as usual the Jack Rabbit Davinder Singh stood
                  up once again to object and the judge obediently sustained the
                  objection.<br><br>Then Lee Kuan Yew went on to insult Dr. Chee with
                  impunity, that he is a liar, a cheat a charlatan, a criminal and what
                  not. Of course the judge permitted these insults, since after all Lee
                  Kuan Yew and his son owned the courts and the judge as well.</blockquote>

                      four, I cited you at least ten, Mr Lee. So do me a favour, let us not
                      pick and choose at what endorsements you get because overall if you're
                      trying to show me that your standing in the world is that high you
                      wouldn't be clutching at straws and producing something from Tunku
                      Aziz. I had a conversation with him -</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Singh: Your Honour, what is the question?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">CSJ:
                      The question is why is Mr Lee depending on such a slipshop - when it is
                      not a verifiable - if you come and tell me that you have been awarded
                      the Nobel Prize I would accept it because that has been vetted. Tell
                      me, who is in this organisation called Transparency International
                      Malaysia. Tell me who are the officer here and when they make awards
                      such as these, what vetting process do they go through?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Singh:
                      Can we ask the cross examiner if he has a question? If he has not and
                      he wants to make a speech and maybe for the next one hour left he can
                      make his political speech. If he has no more questions for the witness
                      he should say so.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">CSJ: Your Honour,
                      my question is this: Mr Lee has brought this ridiculous piece of paper
                      and tells me that he is depending on this to prove his reputation. I'm
                      asking him, does this plaintiff know who is behind this Transparency
                      International Malaysia?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">LKY: Your
                      Honor, the man is on the Internet and the organisation is also on the
                      website. They asked me in a private letter if I would receive this
                      letter, There were wanting to score a point that it is possible to have
                      in Southeast Asia a clean government. I agreed and I assume he would
                      not sign a document citing TI which</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">rates us always among the top 5
                      unless it had been authorised to do so. And now</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">you are saying that he
                      is liar, that he has falsely attributed this paragraph to Dr</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Eigen.
                      Well then I say if you brought Dr Eigen here with an affidavit, then
                      you can demolish Mr Adnan (should be Aziz) but not demolish me because
                      I do not depend on Transparency International. I'm just putting this as
                      an example of what PERC, IMD -</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">CSJ:
                      But we haven't got the records of PERC, IMD and so in line with what Mr
                      Singh said, let's dispense with it. Because if you did, you would
                      produce them.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">LKY: Ha. The simple
                      answer really is between the competing NGOs, one for HR, one for
                      liberal ideas of how governments should be and rating agencies
                      concerned with actual assessment of government performance - where do
                      investors put their money in. hey have not put their money in, if you
                      study the World Bank and IMF reports in countries which are unable and
                      corrupt -</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">CSJ: I think you're deliberately running down the clock. Let me ask you this question -</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>

                      There are liberal organisations which disagree with the way Singapore
                      runs its social system but we believe we know better. Otherwise we
                      wouldn't be here, otherwise we wouldn't have this courtroom, otherwise
                      you wouldn't be able to be living in an HDB flat.* That's the final

                      this leap of logic that even Bruce Hawking would find did hard to
                      follow. You are saying that without you without this entire government,
                      we wouldn't be here? A little presumptuous, don't you think?</p>

                      You see, Mr Lee, in Hong Kong people thrive without you and your
                      system, in Taiwan people thrive without you and your system, in Korea
                      people thrive without you and your system, and you are coming to this
                      court and telling me that what we have right now is all because of you
                      and your system that you have created. I think you are making too much
                      of a presumption.</p>

              <p>A sock puppet is an <em>additional</em> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?OnlineIdentity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">OnlineIdentity</span></a> used by someone who already has another <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?OnlineIdentity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">OnlineIdentity</span></a> for participating in a given community, particularly when done in a non-transparent manner and where the identities interact with each other in some way. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The term originates with the metaphor of carrying on a conversation with oneself using a puppet in each hand.</span></strong></p>

We do not expect to discover that the guy who runs the coffee shop is also our neighbour, but with a fake mustache and beard. In most communities there is at least a social expectation, and sometimes a site policy, that each person will use only a single identity. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Thus, use of sock puppets is a</strong></span> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?DeceptivePractice"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>DeceptivePractice</strong></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>.</strong></span></p>

It is fair to expect that we all exercise a certain measure of discretion, but it is hoped that we do not engage in intentional deception. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>A</strong></span> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?SockPuppet"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SockPuppet</strong></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>, on the other hand, is dishonestly represented as being a unique individual, distinct from the existing identities already in use in the community.</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Uses</strong></p>
              <p>By using several Sock Puppets all posting in favour of an idea, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a dishonest person can give the impression that the idea has more grass-roots support than it really has.</strong></span> See also <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/mb.pl?StuffingTheBallotBox"><span style="color: #0066cc;">StuffingTheBallotBox</span></a>, which is a similar problem in a more formal, voting context. Sock puppets make it harder to enforce "one man, one vote."</p>
              <p>Sock puppet identities are disruptive in conversation because they are often used so that a person can <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">ask questions of himself and appear to be carrying on a thread between two individuals.</span></strong></p>

              <p><em>a lion puppet</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people the impression that there are others out there that would agree with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A <strong>sockpuppet</strong> is an <a title="Online identity" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Online_identity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">online identity</span></a> used for purposes of deception within an <a title="Internet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Internet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Internet</span></a> community. In its earliest usage, a sockpuppet was a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a <a title="Hand puppet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Hand_puppet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">hand puppet</span></a>.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[1]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In current usage, the perception of the term has been extended beyond second identities of people who already post in a forum to include other uses of misleading online identities. For example, a <em><a title="NY Times" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/NY_Times"><span style="color: #0066cc;">NY Times</span></a></em> article claims that "sock-puppeting" is defined as "the act of creating a fake online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company."<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[2]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The key difference between a sockpuppet and a regular <a title="Pseudonym" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="color: #0066cc;">pseudonym</span></a> (sometimes termed an "alt") is the pretense that the puppet is a third party who is not affiliated with the puppeteer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To "flame wars" and "phishing" we can now add "<strong>sock puppet</strong>." A <strong>sock puppet</strong>, for those still boning up, is a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a hand puppet. Recently, a senior editor at The New Republic got in trouble for some particularly colorful <strong>sock puppet</strong>ry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Lee Siegel began blogging for The New Republic, he found, as many others have, that Internet posters tend to be fairly outspoken — and a good number of the posters on the blog were harshly critical. An exception was ''sprezzatura,'' who regularly offered extravagant praise. After Mr. Siegel was criticized for his writing about Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' sprezzatura wrote: ''Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.'' A reader charged that sprezzatura was in fact Mr. Siegel, but sprezzatura denied it.</p>
              <p>The reader turned out to be right. ...</p>

              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned. Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>
              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by this "makepeace" was as such:</p>

              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Hence lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20 minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace. Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>But after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to makepeace</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Note the bad acting, where he pretended to be "excited" and "surprised" about what he wrote himself.</span></p>
              <p>Now this is the funny part, if his account was really hacked as he claimed it to be, he would certainly not be replying back to his "hacked" account so happily in such a way.</p>
              <p>But in any case when he was exposed he made this very funny, frantic and desperate post trying to suddenly divorce himself from the actions of his sockpuppetry by claiming he was hacked. Unfortunately all a basic look at the thread will reveal what really happened, and that is nothing other then lionnoisy was caught red-handed sockpuppeting.</p>
