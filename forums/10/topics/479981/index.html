              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GST rate linked property taxes for a progressive nation state.</span></strong><br> Increasing residential property tax across the board <a href="http://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/page.aspx?id=1780">to MATCH GST</a> will certainly go a long way to <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/premium/forum-letters/story/rent-seeking-culture-dampens-entrepreneurial-spirit-20140213">curb property price speculation</a>.Pls charge property tax at EQUAL to the GST level but with rebates for Singaporeans. <strong>The
               Annual Value (AV) rebate should be S$6000 per annum per citizen (half 
              for PRs)(based upon the median mkt price annual rental for single HDB 
              room)</strong>, so if U have a house with 10 Singaporeans staying and AV is 
              $100K, the AV rebate would be S$60K, the consequent taxable amount will 
              be S$40K, at 7% AV tax, the tax payable will be S$2.8K; (at 10%GST, it 
              will be S$4K, p.a.(BOTH affordable even compared with current 2014 
              "discounted" rates)).<br> <br> Of course, if the same house were solely tenanted by a foreigner family,
               then the AV property tax payable would be S$7K (@7%GST equivalent), 
              S$10K (@10% GST equivalent)(foreigners are not entitled to property tax 
              waivers unless they become citizens/ PRs).<br> <br> Much more fair this way because some bigger families stay in big house 
              NOT because they are rich, but because they have close knit families and
               enjoy the kampong spirit: they are equally important to Singapore, and 
              thus shouldn't be taxed more just by virtue of their good family 
              relationships.<br> Pls note that every Singaporean male does NS for pittance allowance, the
               $6K/ citizen (tenant/ otherwise) AV rebate should thus apply ACROSS THE
               BOARD to recognize every Singaporean as belonging to Singapore...<br> The<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces"> SAF budget was SGD 12.08 billion (1 in every 4 dollars spent by government) (FY2011)</a>:

What is this "Annual Value (AV)" thing is??? Surely it 
              doesn't mean the value of the property??? For eg, if you property is 
              valued at SG$1 million dollars??? The tax sounds rather high...</div>

              <p><strong>1. <a href="http://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/page04.aspx?id=2110">How is Annual Value (AV) determined</a>?</strong><br> <strong>A) Buildings<br> </strong>The AV is the estimated annual  rent of your property if it were to 
              be rented out, excluding the  furniture, furnishings and maintenance 
              fees.  It is estimated based on  market rentals of similar or comparable
               properties. The basis of  determining the AV is the same whether the 
              property is rented out,  owner-occupied or left vacant. If your property
               is rented out, the AV  could be higher or lower than your actual rents 
              as the AV reflects the  market rent at the time of review, while your 
              actual rents were  committed earlier.<br> <strong>Illustration (A):</strong><br> Estimated market rent of your flat is $1,000 per month<br> Annual Value is: $1,000 x 12 = $12,000<br> *Property Tax payable is derived by subsequently applying the relevant tax rate (%) on the AV. <br> <strong>Why AV is derived based on rental instead of transacted sale price?</strong><br> The rental transactions of comparable properties are used to estimate  
              the AV of the property, for two reasons. First, there are generally  
              more rental transactions than sales transactions to allow AV to be  
              determined for each property based on comparable properties. Second,  
              movements in sale prices are more volatile than rentals. Hence, using  
              rental transactions to derive the AV helps to keep property tax more  
              stable for property owners. This practice of using market rents to  
              determine the AV is also adopted by other countries like Hong Kong and  
              Malaysia.<br> <br> As property tax is a wealth tax based on property  ownership, the 
              property tax should take account of the prevailing value  of the 
              property as determined from prevailing rental transactions  instead of 
              historical purchase price. Using historical purchase price to  estimate 
              AV would be inequitable towards newer owners because for  similar and 
              comparable properties, the property tax would differ  depending on the 
              time of purchase. <br> <a href="http://www.iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page04.aspx?id=14316">Rental information on Private Apartments and HDB Flats.</a><br> <a href="http://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/page04.aspx?id=2110">IRAS: Know your property tax: How is Annual Value determined</a></p>

              <p>First it was income tax, then came GST. Property prices have been moving upwards lately, so no surprise that it will be the next target: only logical really. Shanghai has started it, UK is doing it for foreigners cos locals there are complaining about unaffordable property prices, my suggestion above self explainatory, hope that Singapore can impolement it soon: will be good for the country.</p>
