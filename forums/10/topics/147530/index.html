Their opportunities for defeats do not arise to this date because of pure preemptive electoral boundary and GRC ploys. This has been made possible by the electoral naivety of the people who easily accepted all their slogans but now they cannot do anything because most constituencies are GRC-cornered walkovers.</div>

It will be good to have some views on these aspects so that the alternatives can be more thoroughly explored to the present winners-take-all system.<br><br>The present system gives rise to the kind of problem we are now facing because they exist all the opportunities for incumbent to maneurve the process. In preferential and proportional system the opportunity for one-party domination will not arise.</div>
