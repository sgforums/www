Saying she need a operation so that she can give birth. Cannot use medishield. No money.<br><br>Guess what the Singapore editior woman say to her in the end ? Ask her husband to go china and work. Who don't know China salary is much more lower ? Ha ! What a idea ! Saying she is greedy for the Singapore PR.<br><br>This editior herself is divorce. Must be ga na dump by her own husband after losing her husband to a foriegn woman ! Who ask you to control husband like a dog for so long ? like you own the man. And end-up after too long control. Her husband run away. And she deserve it ! Husband rather pay for everything in the end. Lose his wealth, Lose his money. And She is now not marry. The ex-husband have to pay till she get another man ! ( Maybe husband bankcrupt she sure find another man, no extra income already mah ! Got a Singaporean auntie also like that mah ! Saying find new man ? Later, I got no income how ?   BLACK WIDOW LEH ! SMART ! MONEY FIRST ! )<br><br>That why got man say her. She read until she blow her top ! But the man is right. We are asking her to quit her job ( Since she got man free money already ) Anyway............ . Plently of people are not buying her story. Only thing left to read is 4D numbers on SAT, SUN.

I should think that this is really subjective to each individual, and from what you have been writing, I really think alot of Singapore women are thankful that you got a foreign bride. Most likely you won't understand and thinks she is praising you when she is insulting you in her own language with a smiling face  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>You talk about character and yet put so much on a woman's physical appearance. Talk about pot calling the kettle black and double standards  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Of course as usual, the grass is greener on the other side. Or in your situation, it sounds like a really heavy case of sour grapes  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> And going by your logic, it is not that they don't want to divorce at times but they don't have the choice. You hold the bargaining chip and not them. Gosh, this sounds so damn pathetic  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Ultimately from your point of view, what you're really talking about are not values, but bargaining power. You poor little man.<br><br>Keep it coming. You're funny  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I'm speaking in general. How many others in the same position can say the same, and how many others can inherit money from their own man. Also don't forget that most of those foreign brides don't work when they marry these SG guys. How long can they survive on the savings if they were to stay in Singapore. Do they have the means to get a job if they can no longer depend on their husband.<br><br>Of course there will be young bums, They are in every country. Just imagine that these young bums become old bums and get a foreign wife. Won't this foreign girl be much much worse off?<br><br></div>

Marriage failed even two highly successful and stable individual conjugate...<br><br>Just that we have to brave and prepare ourselves for the worst ... my ex surbodinate for instance ...dun you think its take a lot of courage for him to marry the China bride ...knowing all the talks that will go behind his back.. once you make the decision dun look back and things may just work out right !<br><br>Guess I lost my ex cos I wasnt brave enough then!<br></div>
