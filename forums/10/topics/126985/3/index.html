Good Luck Guys![/b]</blockquote>And they will be a better intelligence when telling you what is written in woman's chartor after she decided to divorce you. Hahaha!!! And even how much you are flying. You are grounded when you are divorce.<br><br>How much you earn per month ? $3000. She ask $1500 from you. Cut CPF. You left with $1200 per month and you still have to find a root on top of your head. No house. No secure. Then....... what ? SITTING DUCKS ?<br><br>Pretty ?

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway. Singapore woman is smart. But the thing is this. She will divorce you anytime anywhere. And She will go to family court and file divorce with you. Expect you to give half of your assents even she don't pay for it.<br><br>A lot of people ask me after they divorce.<br><br><strong>What the point of marry a Singapore woman and waste my whole life saving money since 18 years old. Then marry by 31. SPEND A LOT IN THERE USE UP MY SAVING BUYING HOUSE, Buy $5000 diamond ring, Put a big dinner,  Then........ she just divorce in 5 years ? </strong><br><br>I just laugh and say. Singapore one loh. So that she can take away all your money and make you poor. Control you. And you cannot do anything else but your job. Then you are poor and work like a ATM just for the sex intercourse.<br>A rich man need a supportive wife. Not a owner ! Usually, people to get rich have a good wife.</div>
