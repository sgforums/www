You need my son to help in your wedding or not ?<br><br>Because they have found a gf that is young, 25 years old Singapore woman that not willing to settle until they are 28 or 29 !

Since you think everyone in this world is posting crap.<br>Then set-up the forum for what ? Why not you just go to the chat-line. Right ?<br><br>I am saying outside of Singapore. Anyway, Singapore is just a small country with a less than 4 millions and they include the PR to make it 4 millions. There is even less Singapore citizens.<br><br>So Singapore woman is just a small number compare to the world. Why should Singapore man stick to find Singapore woman ? Singapore woman can also find other people. Right ?<br><br>Once I ask a Singapore woman to find the CHINA MAN. INDIAN MAN. Or even THAILAND MAN. Their answer is that. They are just too low-class for them. SO what make Singapore woman high-class ? Just because they can speak english meaning others are low-class man ? Because their country is low-class ? Or you are looking down on others ?<br><br>Successful people. Of course there is plently ! Even more people successful than LKY.

How come you are still available ?<br><br><span style="color: green;">i was right!!  you will marry a singaporean if only the opportunity presents itself.  that is the reason for such a question yeah?!!  i am still available because i have not met someone suitable, yet.  i dont get married for the sake of marrying.  i dont marry just for s e x.  i hope you can tell the difference.</span><br><br>Anyway, my time is over.
