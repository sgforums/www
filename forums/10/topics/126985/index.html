            <div class='col-md body'>Due to the Singapore tread nowdays . I seriously asking all the Singapore man to find foriegn woman as wife. How to find. I will tell you one by one. And do it at what age. Or do it in what time ! Best time !<br><br>25 years old. You tried to get Singapore girls. But in vain. They either keep changing or keep on want to break off ! Or just refuse to take bus with you. If that is the case. Dump the B!TCH and work all your time in money is the best. Work hard save lot of money. Do your investment till you are 27 years old then find yourself a wife. Why ? Simple ! Woman seriously on you because you are in your marriage age ! That is where it start ! Where woman will come to you and beg on your kneels. Because that is Your time of choose !  Find the girl. If you got a Singapore gf. She date you. Just fine. OK loh. No problem. Just let her feel that this is an agreement of love. You come. OK. You go. Also OK for you. Because you know you will get another very soon.<br><br>Marriage don't need to date 1 or 2 years ! Remember that ! Months also no problem can settle your marriage already ! Why wait at the age of 27 ?<br><br>( STEP 1 )<br>Go to matchmaker if necessary. Open up you cycle. Tell the matchmaker company you want to Know foriegn woman working in Singapore. Let face the facts. Foriegn girls working in factory. Almost work 6 days a week for Overtime. Where got time to know other man from outside ? She come here to work. Not geylang girls. If company know sure sent her home !<br>Holding work permit. She got a job in Singapore. Also a woman. Why not ? Right ? if she like you. You are getting a good salary of $2300. Why not ? She is willing to marry you. Tell her you are serious about her. You are looking for marriage and will settle down. She sure like you as she know you are not cheating her ! Find it hard to marry foriegn woman with work permit ? Problems ? Not really ! It's simple. Go to ministry of manpower.<br>Apply for marriage. Fill up the forms sent by post. Then approve. Marry in Singapore ROM loh. Then as husband you can apply PR for her. Both working. No problem of getting it in long run.<br><br>( STEP 2 )<br>If you getting age of 31 years old. Soon still cannot find. Go vietnam ! Just think. Letting all the old stinky old man of 45++ 50+++ to destroy the life of innocent vietnam girls. Why not you go and marry them ! Hahah!!!!! You are like a hero to them leh ! When she bring you back to her father. She also feel proud ! Her father feel good ! Young man ! Got good education. Not old old man raping her daughter !<br><br>( STEP 3 )<br>If you still think cannot ! Third Go malaysia and find ( IN your age of now ) ! Johor is enough already. Just go over ! Think of the bright side. If you are old. Like now. SHe can buy a house in Malaysia. You can stay there when you retired ! Why not ? Why stay in expensive Singapore when retired ? KL is not far. A house in Malaysia is not expensive. So what not worth. It's still your house !<br><br>( STEP 4 )<br>IF you died died want Singapore woman. Then you better go and find your 5C fast and pray you will not reach 35 ! Singapore woman want young man with 5C or else you be facing alone !<br><br>If above still cannot find ! Meaning you are really a failure as a man ! Must be something wrong with you. You are either too shy ! SHY WHERE GOT GIRL ? DROP DOWN FROM THE SKY HUH ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Then you choose step 4 already loh. Died Died improve. Hoping to get a Singapore woman as their standard get higher and higher. You are like chasing a never-ending road. And as you grow older and older. Time pass. You earn more and more. But seem like it's never enough. Like a black hole.<br><br>Single is nothing wrong with it. Of course ! It's only lonely that all. Lonely cause early death. And you will be surrounded by your brother and sister. Hoping after you died. You will give some money to them ! They say : LOOK AT MY KIDS ! SO CUTE" And you shall know. They pray you give money to their kids and as they are their ! So the money is control by them loh ! Right ? So they assents they want. But your dead body. No one want to deal with it !<br>That is way of life.<br><br>Plently of Singapore man 45 ++ go to vietnam find woman to. 18 to 21 years old so young. Truth. It's just use money to buy a wife for the point to see. But why not ? Since his married brother and sister are always around him with fake face.<br>Thinking of his CPF. Thinking of his HDB. Thinking of his little assents of $300,000 dollars. Why not give it to a woman who is foriegn ? At least she give you a sex and born you a kids right ? Why not ? Right ? Give all your money to her. Even you died. At least your assents will not fall into your greedy relative who are all waiting waiting like SHARKS IN THE WATER !<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Who is blaming the Singapore woman for high standard ?<br><br>No one is ! It's their choice. But why not get something when you are young ? In your 30. Right time for marriage and get it done. Not until 45++ go to vietnam find wife. Then shame by the public for "BUYING WIFE". No feeling or love. Why not get a foriegn wife like most of friends did ! And they all do it at the age of 28 to 32 years old. Nobody can say anything about that ! Get it done and forget about upgrading at that age of 28 to 32. Do it after marriage !<br><br>Your upgrading can do it after marriage. After marriage, you still can take part-time course. Still can work hard. Still can do more Overtime. Still can study a degree. Still can do a lot of thing. Who say you must do it b4 marriage and cannot do it after marriage ?<br><br>If Singapore woman prefer to buy instant successful man calling man to upgrade themselves. Until they get the status then Singapore woman willingly to get married.<br><br>What make the differents between Vietnam woman and Singapore woman ?<br>Same ! Both want money. So......... Singapore woman like that call more class ?<br><br></div>

Thinking of his little assents of $300,000 dollars. Why not give it to a woman who is foriegn ? At least she give you a sex and born you a kids right ? Why not ? Right ? Give all your money to her.

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not just Chinese. Even the Malays are turning to Malaysia, Indonesia for marriage. Better ask your friend around. Is Singapore man marry foriegn woman minority ? Sometimes you find out, times have change. The new tread have grow. Man starting to find foriegn woman as wife is growing. And speed-up. Not just the 40+++ but the 20+ is growing all the way to find foriegn wife.<br><br>Even Malaysian also consider foriegn wife. Isn't it ?<br><br>Like I say, A lot of greedy relative waiting for the singles. Assent. No matter how much that can be. Why ? Singaporean own a lot of money. First the HDB loans. Car loans, Credit cards loans. If one of your single relative died. Give the whole house to you. Sell it away isn't it going to solve all your problems ? Even the money maybe small. But it is better than nothing right ? At least a SINGLE 3-room HDB cost $150,000 dollars ! And best of all. In cash to your hand. Not after sold give the money to CPF ! Plus the CPF money of maybe $50,000 or more ! It's $200,000 dollars already. Why not ! It's cash !  And almost 85% of the Singaporean don't have such CASH !<br><br>It's already prove that 70% of the Singaporean have less than $50,000 of cash inside their bank account. Think about it !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I tell you a SAD story of a Singapore man who is at the age of 36. He is still single ! And what the reason ?<br><br>His father already died. Left her old mother who is always sick. He got a elder brother but he is worthless. Always jobless even he got a NTC-2. Lazy, don't want to work. Not married, and refuse to just do anything. Don't know what is going on. Don't care. This man have to take up the burden to support his sick mother monthly. And he been taking up part-time course at night Taking from NTC-1 and now to diploma. Praying someday he make money enough for him to find a wife ! And now he is 36 already so mostly he already give-up loh ! If his mother died. Is he going to hug his lazy brother ? Or he is going alone for life ?<br><br>Which Singapore woman who working as a manager ? Even earn $4000 or $5000 per month will marry him ?</div>
