              <p>So..... was there an Apology at the end...... No <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> Yes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> Was there a... "<em>I'm sorry that the CJ have to go through Sh*t..... and I'm now clearing their names....</em> "</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I do KNOW that the Sultan pick his Mentri Besar...... but rarely have they NOT accept the one chosen by the winning party. And if it wasn't that BN suffer their worst defect in a great numbers of years.... wouldn't the Sultan have - <span style="color: #ff0000;">largely kept their peace so as to avoid a Constitutional Crisis</span> - as they did with Dr M. PM Badawi had to give in NOT so much because he is more 'easy going'..... but because he is too busy trying to save his own politic career as even those inside his parties is calling him to step down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do I or do I not 'Appreciate' what PM Badawi had done...... Sadly, I don't give a Rat A** one way or the other...... I basicly just wrote in this thread to said there isn't going to be an outright Apology...... and till today.... still doesn't see one.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #800080;">''Japan squarely faces these facts of history in a spirit of humility and with a feeling of deep remorse and heartfelt apology always engraved in mind. Japan has resolutely maintained, consistently since the end of World War Two, never turning into a military power, but an economic power -- its principal of resolving all matters by peaceful means without recourse to use of force.''</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This was consider a 'Half' Apology by most people in China. Since "Deep Remorse" &amp; "Regret" is all the Japanese ever said.... without a straight forward - "We are SORRY''. And that is for what the Japanese Nation have done during WWII in general while very much avoiding the Naking Massacre.... even claiming that the Japanese army did not kill many people in Naking......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, I not too sure that the surviver and ppl who live throught that time in Naking..... felt it was much better than an Apology when "Deep Remorse" &amp; "Regret" is all they'll ever get..... follow by the Japanese refusing to ever admit what really happens there.</p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">The newly appointed Malaysian Law Minister is
              proposing that the present Badawi Government should
              make a statement of apology for the injustices done by the
              previous Mahathir administration towards Tun Mohd Salleh Abbas
              - the Lord President of the Malaysian Judiciary
              in 1988.
              <p>Will the Singapore Government also issue such a statement for
              being drawn into the entire scandolous situation in support of an
              ungrateful Mahathir Administration ?</p>
              <p>In 1988, when Dr Mahathir had a head-to-head confrontation with
              the Chief Justice of Malaysia - the then Lord President Tun Mohd
              Salleh Abbas, the Singapore Government responded to Mahathir's
              request for assistance by sending Singapore's Senior
              Judge Sinnathurai to sit on a Panel of Justices in a
              tribunal to prosecute the Chief Judge of Malaysia.</p>
              <p>The panel of justices that participated in Mahathir's scheme to
              remove his Chief Justice was drawn from Singapore, Sri
              Lanka, other Malaysian judges junior to the Lord President
              and the successor Chief Justice of Malaysia appointed by Dr
              Mahathir.</p>
              <p>The political commentators during that period noted that
              with two judges from Singapore and Sri Lanka known to be
              Government appointees - {with their history of siding Government
              positions}, and including the then newly appointed
              Malaysian Chief Justice sitting on the tribunal - the fate of
              the Lord President Tun Abbas was practically sealed with only one
              other neutral foreign senior judge on the panel.</p>
              <p>Singapore's Senior Judge Sinnathurai had presided in several
              high profile and controversial political cases and have always
              weighed heavily on the side of the Government despite the
              dubious evidence. Some of the prime cases included one
              involving the then NUS Student's Union President Tan Wah Piow
              supposed single handed riot inside the headquarters of the
              PIEU headed by Phey Yew Kok {now a fugitive}; as well as several
              cases involving J.B. Jeyaratnam.</p>
              <p>Now that the Malaysian Bar Council is also supportive of their
              Law Minister's proposed Statement of Apology to
              correct the shameful and wrongful acts done to the then
              Lord President of the Malaysian Judiciary, Tun Mohd Salleh Abbas -
              will the Singapore Government extend a similar apology
              for being drawn into this same shameful act of undermining the
              pillars of Malaysian democracy that was supposed to be
              divided in the separate roles of the Executive Government,
              Parliament and the Judiciary ?</p>

              <p><strong>So..... was there an Apology at the end...... No <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> Yes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> Was there a... "<em>I'm sorry that the CJ have to go through Sh*t..... and I'm now clearing their names....</em> "</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">PM Abdullah Badawi's ways are well known by now, his proposal to ''redeem the reputation and esteem of the sacked Justices - is in itself ''an act of contrition'' - which is even more substantial than the mention of the word ''SORRY''.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can an apology wash away the wrongs done to the sacked Justices ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even MM LKY cannot accept a simple ''SORRY'' from James Gomez, and expected more from the leadership of the Worker's Party - for the blemish to the Election Officials made by the erroneous position that James Gomez had taken with regards to his belief in having ''submitted the missing papers''.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>And I do KNOW that the Sultan pick his Mentri Besar...... but rarely have they NOT accept the one chosen by the winning party. And if it wasn't that BN suffer their worst defect in a great numbers of years.... wouldn't the Sultan have - <span style="color: #ff0000;">largely kept their peace so as to avoid a Constitutional Crisis</span> - as they did with Dr M. PM Badawi had to give in NOT so much because he is more 'easy going'..... but because he is too busy trying to save his own politic career as even those inside his parties is calling him to step down.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You must have been out of date, or did not care to take note of politics during the 1980s.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">UMNO had never lost in the state of Johor, yet it was during Mahathir's winning year that the Sultan of Johor rejected Mahathir's first nominated person, which resulted in a second choice of Muhiddyn being appointed as the Mentri Besar.</span><strong> </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Do I or do I not 'Appreciate' what PM Badawi had done...... Sadly, I don't give a Rat A** one way or the other...... I basicly just wrote in this thread to said there isn't going to be an outright Apology...... and till today.... still doesn't see one.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Sadly, for one that do not ''give a Rat A'' one way or the other'' you have taken alot of trouble to write in this thread without even understanding the background in the political affairs of Malaysia - except for your superficial gloss over of on-going issues.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Malaysian ways are unlike the Singapore way - as they have always accused Singapore of being too rigid - are you not a reflection of the years of PAP rule  ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This probably explains your inability to appreciate Badawi's offer to redeem the sacked Justices.</span></p>
              <p><strong></strong> </p>
              <p><strong>This was consider a 'Half' Apology by most people in China. Since "Deep Remorse" &amp; "Regret" is all the Japanese ever said.... without a straight forward - "We are SORRY''. And that is for what the Japanese Nation have done during WWII in general while very much avoiding the Naking Massacre.... even claiming that the Japanese army did not kill many people in Naking......</strong></p>
              <p><strong>So, I not too sure that the surviver and ppl who live throught that time in Naking..... felt it was much better than an Apology when "Deep Remorse" &amp; "Regret" is all they'll ever get..... follow by the Japanese refusing to ever admit what really happens there.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">China's Government does not seem to share your views about the ''Half'' Apology - and had even considered Emperor Akihito historic visit to China in October 1992 as a success, as it was seen as a reciprocal visit to the earlier visit in May 1992 by China's President Jiang Zemin to Japan.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Japan was the first country in the G-8 Western Alliance to break the financial and economic embargo on China following the Tiananmen Incident, and was the only country prepared to help China's efforts at modernising its industrial base - {although one can always ask if it has been for altruistic reasons by Japan}.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Unlike the Jews, the Chinese have moved on from the Nanking experience - while the Jews continue to keep the flames burning on the conscience of every community on this Globe, as long as their existence remain threatened by hostility that is fueled by their own seige mentality.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ask any Chinese about the ''Nanking Incident'' today - most will have vague memories until their emotions are purposefully stoked up for political reasons, with all current progress ignored even as Japan had contributed vast financial development aid, soft loans, and signed bilateral agreements to modernise China - all enabling it to leapfrog from poverty to its current national wealth accumulated.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This is not unlike the present day in Singapore, if you were to ask any Singaporean today about the experience of the days when Singapore was part of Malaysia - you will hardly find anyone today with any clear memories - except for the dwindling generation that lived through that period. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have this Singapore generation harped on the past as a continuous reminder to ourselves to remain independent ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As a whole, everyone moved on, and find a new equilibrium in building for the future, and some are working closely with the Malaysians.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You may or may not know that more of the younger Japanese are travelling around Asia, and are discovering their ''real historical military conduct during WW-2''; and we are seeing some university elites challenging their written History influenced by the views according to the Japanese Right Wing Politicians.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">We may see more acts of contrition from the Japanese for the mistakes made by their forefathers.</span></p>

              <p> If you are serious about giving comments in the current discussion about Malaysian Politics - you should based your views with some understanding to the events that led to the current situation.</p>
              <p>In order to understand the situation, you should also have some background knowledge to the Malaysian political culture - as after all, whether we like it or not, we have them linked to our island and we have to be interested in the events across the border.</p>

              <p>It is more then a point of view issue - if you are insisting on an explicit ''We're SORRY'' statement.</p>

              <p>Looking at MM LKY's ''apology'' to PM Badawi, his intent was clearly reflected in writing the letter of apology - as the intent was clearly reflected in the words - it was not even a half-apology.</p>
              <p> It was not even an apology. His intent was to justify the offending statements made. His intent was not at an apology.</p>

              <p>Your brilliance in mixing events is remarkable - even as you introduced the Sino-Japanese events into this topic.</p>
              <p>While China has accepted the stated remorse from the Emperor Akihito, and in various words from the various Prime Ministers - China has always objected to the visit by Japanese Ministers to the Japanese War Shrine, which had the remains of the Japanese leaders convicted of War Crimes for starting the war and committing all the atrocities across Asia.</p>
              <p>To China and South Korea, the continued practice by Japanese Ministers to visit the War Shrines annually to commemorate the war dead with these War Criminals included - are tantamount to worshipping the past.</p>
              <p>Had the Japanese moved the remains - of those convicted as War Criminals - from this Yasukuni War Shrine, the Chinese would not have protested the commemoration service of the ordianary Japanese soldiers who died fighting during the War.</p>
              <p>This is a clash of culture - more then politics alone - and with two nations proud of their history and culture, can any middle road be found to this issue ?</p>
              <p>China and Japan has found a way around to manouvre a middle road with the ''expression of remorse'' by none other then the Japanese Emperor.</p>
              <p>China's Political Leadership had shown magnimity and maturity to accept these <strong>acts of contrition</strong> that were delivered by no less a person then the Japanese Emperor, who had shown his own greatness in humility from an ethnic group reknown for their strident national pride.</p>
              <p>Can you begin to understand these political nuances ?</p>
              <p>Yes, time will develop to show how these sacked Malaysian Chief Justices will be redeemed, and their reputation restored - PM Badawi's personal belief in being a good moderate Muslim will surely allow a wide latitude of generosity in correcting the wrongs done to his fellow humans.</p>

              <p>I was very young when George Seah met with my mum after the crisis. I will always remember him saying ' History will exonerate me'</p>
              <p>Anyways , redeeming is as good as an apology. For Mahatir , he is still at a time where the people involved are still very much alive. The public aware of the truths. I wish he will be formally charged which i think if the judiciary wanted to , they can. And they can zealously go after Mahatir and also to restore the integrity of the judiciary back.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is , its a chance for Badawai to right the wrong. To gain back the confidence. To do some clean up. With the present strong opposition , raja Nzrin Shah's outspoken view on these issues , i see many more issues to be brought to light and the people responsible held accountable for thier actions.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">''what iszit'' ? </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is an <strong>ACT of CONTRITION </strong>.... and the meaning of the word ''CONTRITION'' is as follows:</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Thesaurus: CONTRITION noun - </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">A feeling of regret for one's sins or misdeeds: compunction, contriteness, penitence, penitency, remorse, remorsefulness, repentance, rue. See regret / impenitence.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">If you are looking for an outright apology - [as in ''The Malaysian Government would like to say 'SORRY' to the 6 judges sacked in 1988] - there is NONE to be expected nor will it be heard.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Malaysian Government - PM Badawi has already said that they are not apologising but will make something more meaningful to redeem and restore the six judges sacked by ex-PM Mahathir during the 1988 UMNO political crisis.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">However, if you are looking for a 'physical act of an apology' - in the manner of an Act of Contrition - then it will be seen in the acts of an apology as proposed by PM Badawi - who had said that the amount offered is a mere token to correct the wrongs done to the six judges sacked by Mahathir.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
              <p>What is the meaning of a stated <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>'APOLOGY' </em></span><span style="color: #000000;">if performed by the Badawi Government, when it had no part to play in the sacking of the six judges in 1988 ?</span></p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Thesaurus: APOLOGY noun -</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">1. An acknowledgement expressing <strong>regret</strong> or asking pardon for a fault or offense</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">2.a. A formal jusitication or defense</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">2. b. An explanation or excuse: ''<em>The consequence of those measures will be the best apology for my conduct''.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">3. An inferior substitute: <em>'the sagging cot was a poor apology for a bed.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">With the definition of the word 'APOLOGY' - should the Badawi Government make the apology to the six judges ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Malaysians do not expect this Badawi Government to humble themselves as the main perpetrator of the offense and apologise to the six judges. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Certainly no further apoligies are expected especially after Badawi's unsolicited 'Acts of Contrition' - which itself is already an indication of the remorse felt by his Government for the injustices ?</span></p>
              <p>Even a leading Malaysian Opposition Personality - who also is a senior lawyer - had stated that ''it is Dr Mahathir who should apologise'' to the sacked judges.</p>
              <p> </p>
