            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Singapore Airlines pilots who will be flying the new Airbus A380 fleet will get a better pay package.<br><br>In a decision that could set a new benchmark for the aviation industry, the Industrial Arbitration Court has decided that pilots should get a pay rise.<br><br>The new Airbus A380 planes are larger and have never been used by other airlines before.<br><br>The first of SIA's Airbus A380 fleet is due to arrive in October.<br><br>The Airline Pilots' Association (ALPA-S), led by Captain P James, had argued that pilots who fly these bigger planes have added responsibilities and thus deserve a pay rise. And the court agrees.<br><br>Captain James said, "We recognise there is no market data for the A380. Because there is no market data, we propose just an increase of S$1,000 for the captains, and the court has awarded S$700 and that's fine, it's at least more than half way what we wanted, so why not."<br><br>The Court ruled that the minimum salary for Captains on the A380 will be S$700 more than that of captains for the Boeing 747-400 series jet. And this works out to S$10,700 a month.<br><br>The maximum salary range will remain at S$16,500, which is also pegged against the maximum salary for the B-744.<br><br>In its ruling, the court also said the minimum salary for first officers on the A380 will be S$450 more than their colleagues on the B-744, with the maximum salary remaining at S$9,250.<br><br>SIA had earlier argued that flying the super jumbo is not very different from flying other planes due to technological advances.<br><br>But it says it is studying the implications of this salary revision.<br><br>The airline would have to incur more costs but it is likely to have little impact on its bottom-line.<br><br>The number of pilots affected by the ruling is also small, since the delivery of the new planes will be spread over the next few years.<br><br>SIA is satisfied with the outcome.<br><br>It said that with the judgement, it can now move forward with certainty and the pilots are keen to get the A380 off the ground.<br><br>Stephen Forshaw, Vice President, Public Affairs, Singapore Airlines, said, "We have to remember that from time to time, we are going to have differences of views with unions and issues; there is a process by which we are going to deal with those issues. I think at the end of the day, we've now got closure on this issue and we can now move forward.<br><br>"The judgement gives us some scope to work with the collective agreement negotiation coming up later in the year; the current agreement expires in September."<br><br>And looking forward, the court pointed out that it is not satisfactory that there must be negotiations for a new pay package every time SIA buys a new type of aircraft. And this should be considered when the new collective agreement is being worked out.<br><br>Addressing arguments from both sides, the panel said the ease with which modern planes may be manoeuvred is not a reason for docking the pilots' salaries.<br><br>Similarly, the size of a plane and the number of passengers carried cannot remain a reason for increasing the salaries of pilots.<br><br>In conclusion, the panel chaired by Justice Tan Lee Meng urged the ALPA-S and the SIA management to redouble their efforts to ensure continued success of the company.<br><br>He said while the sky is the limit for SIA, the pie in the sky has to be shared with other airlines who are ordering their affairs to be keener competitors of SIA. - CNA/ch/ms<br><br><span style="color: blue;">$700 for pilot, $450 for co-pilot and SIA is lamenting about this increase is going to affect future earning</span><br></div>

If you think your union cannot get what you want, then kindly go represent your union and workers and justify a pay rise. No teeth then grow teeth, or do a root canal. otherwise accept the fact that you are willing to be screwed by the company.<br><br>Demand n supply. It just goes to show that pilots are in demand because of their job nature which CANNOT be easily replaced while the bus drivers job scope is different. apples vs oranges?<br><br>Frankly, looking at the facts presented in court, who deserved to win?

If not for this opportunity till today Durai would remain powerful suing away people who try to expose his golden taps. So it is clear that our laws are subjective and are being interpreted to suit the power that be.<br><br>One round to the pilots and they are just plain lucky this time that the judge has no choice but to reward them this time.[/b][/quote]</div>

And also the most profitable? Perhaps you could help me along by quoting the source of info.<br><br>Another determinant of a pilot's pay has to do with the cost of living in the region. Cathay pilots require such high pay because the cost of housing and basic living is much higher than Singapore. Not to mention England, Australia, America and the UAE.<br><br>A pilot is no bigger than an airline.....just like no employee shall think himself above the company. SIA has to set the standard where pay is concerned, at the same time taking into account the salary standards justifiable for a pilot.<br><br>Also, labour market forces play a part too. There are many experienced Captains and Co-pilots out there queing to join SIA. No pilot, just because he has a wide-body rating, shall think of himself as indispensable.</div>

And also the most profitable? Perhaps you could help me along by quoting the source of info.<br><br>Another determinant of a pilot's pay has to do with the cost of living in the region. Cathay pilots require such high pay because the cost of housing and basic living is much higher than Singapore. Not to mention England, Australia, America and the UAE.<br><br>A pilot is no bigger than an airline.....just like no employee shall think himself above the company. SIA has to set the standard where pay is concerned, at the same time taking into account the salary standards justifiable for a pilot.<br><br>Also, labour market forces play a part too. There are many experienced Captains and Co-pilots out there queing to join SIA. No pilot, just because he has a wide-body rating, shall think of himself as indispensable.</div></blockquote>FYI:<br><br>1."SIA world's largest airline by market cap", The Business Times, 23 January 2007.<br><br>2. Collectively, the Singapore Airlines Group (including SilkAir and Singapore Airlines Cargo) is the world's largest carrier by market capitalization, having overtaken Southwest Airlines in 2006/7,[9] and ranks amongst the top 15 carriers worldwide in terms of revenue passenger kilometres.[10] In addition, it is the 8th largest airline in Asia and ranked 6th in the world in terms of international passengers carried.[11] .....source wikipedia<br><br>Analyst reports after SIA reported her 2006/07 results on 11 may 07 will verify the above. Unfortunately, most of the info are archived.<br><br>Dollar for dollar wise, SIA does not pay as well as the airlines you mentioned. Even after factoring in the cost of living, currency, taxes, SIA is still not ranked amongst the top few airlines.<br><br>Agree that no pilot, or any employee is bigger than the company. But why is it so that the pilots are the ONLY ones who took no-pay-leave during SARS????? a few even got retrentched.......<br><br>There are many INEXPERIENCED pilots queuing to join SIA to obtain a wide body rating before leaving to join another company that pays better. BA pilots who join SIA after they retire still receive a pension from BA to supplement their income in SIN.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>of course the A380 pilots will win the arbitration as they used the same logic as the pap when they argued for that 60% pay hike for their ministers!</div>
