You might say these are the places where the races of the same kind gather to relax or chit chat or its the place where the races of the same kind reside in.<br><br>Well here comes the irony of racial harmony. If SG promotes racial harmony, why cant they have ppl of all races living together as a whole and not having this kind of malay village, chinatown and little india areas? how come chinatown residents are mostly only chinese and not mixing a fair number of each race so they can communicate more with each other? Why when u step into malay village u can barely see a handful of chinese?<br><br>If there really was such a thing called racial harmony in SG chinatown wouldn't have existed.  the only reason why no1 dares to speak up regarding this matter is because the gov are putting ppl in jail for giving such comments and purely just voicing out their views.<br><br>Do u believe IF a foriegn talent here in SG were to give some nasty comments on a certain race like maybe the chinese, they would have gotten away with it cos the gov are giving them face?<br><br>[b]back to main point of this tread. Chinese population is on the decline, to what i think is because the chinese here actually thinks for their future genrations more than the others. We know our future gen will simply suffer if we continue to be here so when they have the money they'll migrate even if they will become a 2nd class citizen of the other country.<br><br>More chinese migrate = less chinese population = less reproduction of SG chinese = more population of other races including eurasians and other mixed blood. chinese marry malays malay marries indian and so on. there wun be much pure SG chinese left.</strong>[/b]</blockquote>those areas were created long long ago.. back in the 1800s. they're still there cos the govt wanna preserve the sites.. they've pulled down enuff places to remind singaporeans of the country's history.. pull down somemore.... i think there'd be no more historical sites in sg.</div>
