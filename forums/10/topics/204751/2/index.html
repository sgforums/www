            <div class='col-md body'>Maid's day off all very well, but what about other workers who put in very long hours?<br><br>THE article about giving maids compulsory days off ('Compulsory day off in maid new contract'; ST, July 21) set me thinking. I could not help but wonder if the day will come when some union can address the problem of long working hours in Singapore. This is especially true of executives, managers and senior managers.<br>A friend told me she recently worked 24-hour days when there were events in her company. I am sure this is not unheard of. I have also heard of marketing people working way past midnight. I have also heard the lament of accountants who have worked 36 hours continuously. And we have read about doctors who often have no time to visit the loo.<br>What about IT executives who often clock in 100 or more hours a week and are still expected to be on standby 24/7 including weekends and public holidays? Then there are 'after office hours' overseas conference calls that often go one till the wee hours of the morning, leaving people with little and perhaps no sleep.<br>Employers of maids are advised to give them eight hours of sleep every day. How many Singaporean workers have such a luxury every day?<br>On top of long working hours, there is overseas travel to deal with - often at last minute notice. It is not uncommon to hear of workers who are at home only one week in every month.<br><strong>I have read with wonder that Singaporeans are encouraged to procreate. How can this happen when spouses have such little time to see each other and little or even no time for themselves? </strong><br>Many employers - I am talking about big multinationals here - do not compensate staff with additional days off when they work their weekends away, sometimes for many weekends continuously.<br>When I read articles about work-life balance, I take it with a pinch of salt. I know it will not happen here. Our labour laws protect workers but little - pregnant and non-pregnant ones alike. The onus is up to the employer to search his conscience whether making 'slaves' out of his employees is justifiable.<br><br>Elizabeth Ng Boon Kwan (Mrs)<br><br></div>

So are all Chinese lazy gangsters who fight over small excuses?<br><br>The things you say can get you thrown in jail. Ironically if you said the same things about the chinese, you'd get off scott free and probably be commended for saying that. But I digress.<br><br>Even though the malay man cannot support his family, he still manages to bring up his children and they in turn bring up theirs right? Granted they can never be rich, they will have no savings (according to you) but they still make ends meet, maybe barely.<br><br>As chinese, we have our own culture and our own traditions, we should not impose these things on others. Just because you like to work 10 hours a day yo earn your high salary, doens't mean that the malays want to.<br><br>And I'd suggest that you not say these things in public as you might end up in jail.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i believe many of u ppl out there nvr kena 1 time jia lat jia lat b4 from malays, so thats y u see them differently la..<br><br>Thos who ever kena from the malays hor will know their power liao. they can actually be as crafty as the PRCs who want u out of ur job here. Can be as unreasonable as an auntie wanting arefund for a rotten egg from the market.<br><br>not saying that chinese and indians are not like that. but most of the time i see its the malays who are always doing this kind of things.<br><br>EG : among a grp of classmates, this malay guy dislike a chinese guy but he doesnt say out and at the same time wearing a mask befriending the chinese guy. when outside school, malay guys hanging out with his bunch of malay friends and this chinese guy pass by. chinese guy says hi to him and when chinese guy turns his back, malay guy and his friends ganged on him.<br><br>many of the incidents are like that it does not just happened in school, even in NS this kind of incidents happen.<br><br>I believe some chinese and indian guys are like that too but overall its the malays who are often seen doing this kind of stuff.<br><br>About the incident on the hawker that trendz mentioned, i canot verify if they throw away the chinese stall's plates and utensils, but i can be very sure of 1 thing, cos i ever experience this myself.<br><br>I went for lunch at a coffeshop, i ate bak chor mee and i still felt hungry, so i ordered malay stall's mee goreng. the stall was just beside where i was sitting. the stall owner, obviously a malay, told me no more mee goreng. Disappointed i went to order tau huey to eat as dessert trying to make myself full. then came another malay customer to this malay stall and ordered mee goreng. stall owner asked him where he sit, malay guy points at his table.i waited until the owner brings out mee goreng then i questioned him, how come he told me no more when that is not true. Stall owner replied u ate pork, i dowan to dirty my plates and utensils.<br><br>Incident happened in 1 of the coffeeshop in bedok. dowan to say exactly the location cos it might affect their business.<br><br>1 last thing i wanted to highlight is y are the malays hate dogs so much??? see dogs only run away like see ghost like that. heard 1 malay guy last time from my class say that the malays think that dogs are unholy animals. WTF man they're man's best friend leh. Unholy my @ss ah.<br><br>so far i've heard of buddhists or those praying to goddess of mercy canot eat beef only. and on the muslim part, they canot eat pork canot touch dogs. y they so anti- animals?  I've not heard of indians religion saying anything about animals restricting their religion to eat any kind of meat even though most of their gods take form of an animal.<br><br>wait until u kena jia lat jia lat from the malays gUms, then u will know how bad it is.</div>

Can be as unreasonable as an auntie wanting arefund for a rotten egg from the market.<br><br>not saying that chinese and indians are not like that. but most of the time i see its the malays who are always doing this kind of things.<br><br>EG : among a grp of classmates, this malay guy dislike a chinese guy but he doesnt say out and at the same time wearing a mask befriending the chinese guy. when outside school, malay guys hanging out with his bunch of malay friends and this chinese guy pass by. chinese guy says hi to him and when chinese guy turns his back, malay guy and his friends ganged on him.<br><br>many of the incidents are like that it does not just happened in school, even in NS this kind of incidents happen.<br><br>I believe some chinese and indian guys are like that too but overall its the malays who are often seen doing this kind of stuff.<br><br>About the incident on the hawker that trendz mentioned, i canot verify if they throw away the chinese stall's plates and utensils, but i can be very sure of 1 thing, cos i ever experience this myself.<br><br>I went for lunch at a coffeshop, i ate bak chor mee and i still felt hungry, so i ordered malay stall's mee goreng. the stall was just beside where i was sitting. the stall owner, obviously a malay, told me no more mee goreng. Disappointed i went to order tau huey to eat as dessert trying to make myself full. then came another malay customer to this malay stall and ordered mee goreng. stall owner asked him where he sit, malay guy points at his table.i waited until the owner brings out mee goreng then i questioned him, how come he told me no more when that is not true. Stall owner replied u ate pork, i dowan to dirty my plates and utensils.<br><br>Incident happened in 1 of the coffeeshop in bedok. dowan to say exactly the location cos it might affect their business.<br><br>1 last thing i wanted to highlight is y are the malays hate dogs so much??? see dogs only run away like see ghost like that. heard 1 malay guy last time from my class say that the malays think that dogs are unholy animals. WTF man they're man's best friend leh. Unholy my @ss ah.<br><br>so far i've heard of buddhists or those praying to goddess of mercy canot eat beef only. and on the muslim part, they canot eat pork canot touch dogs. y they so anti- animals?  I've not heard of indians religion saying anything about animals restricting their religion to eat any kind of meat even though most of their gods take form of an animal.<br><br>wait until u kena jia lat jia lat from the malays gUms, then u will know how bad it is. </div></blockquote>what is so jia lat about this ??? i have seen chinese pinching their nose infront of indians , and giving comments about malays , i have seen chinese treating other races like dirt ... but i still dont judge all chinese , that is why i aint got noting with chinese , malays nor indian , cos u are suppose to judge not by whole but by individual . . malays dont hate dogs or call them unholy , its their religion that de nose of a dog cant touch them , cos when ever a dog goes near u , its nose and mouth always touches u correct ???  and for Indians/hindu , they cant eat beef ... even in ns , i have heard so many comments about other races , etc , chinese , aiya KIATORS ARE LIKE THAT ONE LA ... so bro ~ dont judge de entire race , just judge that single person ..<br><br>MY MOTTO ALWAYS IS ... ALWAYS RESPECT OTHERS UNTILL THEY DISRESPECT YOU . THEN YOU GIVE THEM HELL.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Gunyandao:<br><strong>Maid's day off all very well, but what about other workers who put in very long hours?<br><br>THE article about giving maids compulsory days off ('Compulsory day off in maid new contract'; ST, July 21) set me thinking. I could not help but wonder if the day will come when some union can address the problem of long working hours in Singapore. This is especially true of executives, managers and senior managers.<br>A friend told me she recently worked 24-hour days when there were events in her company. I am sure this is not unheard of. I have also heard of marketing people working way past midnight. I have also heard the lament of accountants who have worked 36 hours continuously. And we have read about doctors who often have no time to visit the loo.<br>What about IT executives who often clock in 100 or more hours a week and are still expected to be on standby 24/7 including weekends and public holidays? Then there are 'after office hours' overseas conference calls that often go one till the wee hours of the morning, leaving people with little and perhaps no sleep.<br>Employers of maids are advised to give them eight hours of sleep every day. How many Singaporean workers have such a luxury every day?<br>On top of long working hours, there is overseas travel to deal with - often at last minute notice. It is not uncommon to hear of workers who are at home only one week in every month.<br>[b]I have read with wonder that Singaporeans are encouraged to procreate. How can this happen when spouses have such little time to see each other and little or even no time for themselves? </strong><br>Many employers - I am talking about big multinationals here - do not compensate staff with additional days off when they work their weekends away, sometimes for many weekends continuously.<br>When I read articles about work-life balance, I take it with a pinch of salt. I know it will not happen here. Our labour laws protect workers but little - pregnant and non-pregnant ones alike. The onus is up to the employer to search his conscience whether making 'slaves' out of his employees is justifiable.<br><br>Elizabeth Ng Boon Kwan (Mrs)<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>//applause !<br><br>Sometimes I feel being a foreigner in SG is better than being a local.<br>At least some govenment body cares about my existance, comfort and life.<br><br></div>
