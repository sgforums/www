            <div class='col-md body'>The malay population is rapidly increasing..true, but they are a bunch of dumb f*ck people. I've come across many malay families where the dad is either jobless or a lowly-paid worker (many who are ex-convicts) and the mom is a full-time housewife. Most of the time, they're uneducated and they don't even know what a simple investment is.<br><br>They can't even speak english; including the kids. What a disgrace. My 90yo grandma could speak better english than 'em and yes, she knows what investments are all about; albeit in general.<br><br>If so, where do they find the money to support the whole family with only the dad being the sole breadwinner?<br><br>that's why I say they do not have the means, yet they're so stubborn.<br><br>i wonder what their children will grow up to become.<br><br>most probably those low-class mats and minahs.<br>oh.. did i say they're a bunch of good-for-nothings wasting the earth's natural resources?<br><br>of coursel I do not stereotype.

Even the PRCs are picking it up.<br><br>btw, ya talkin abt fulfilling responsiblities? You are not even able to support yourself; much less your family. So why the hell did you even wanna f*ck time and again and pop out 4 or 5 kids? Do they ever think of the consequences? You call this fulfilling your responsiblity? Use your brain alright?<br><br>i digress.<br><br>Records have shown fights/riots or even lil' troubles/arguements, etc are caused by the 'em. Read terrorism.<br><br>Honest living? Think again. at least 50% of drug-abusers are malays and that's a fact. Read Malaysia. Robberies, and stuff.<br><br>a lil' spark will cause an uproar regarding caricatures of a holy figure. But then again, which bloody sh*t actually condone violence in order to make a stand?<br>what a digrace!<br><br>and yes.. i see lots of useless good-for-nothing mats and minahs out on the streets portraying their fashion flop statements. Think yellow polo tee and green jeans. OMG! What a laughing stock! haha. No wonder they're the worst- dressed among the lot.<br><br>They think pork is dirty and smelly; but the chinese eats pork; therefore they said the chinese are dirty and smelly.<br><br>You eat chinese food in a malay (sector) of a hawker centre, the malay hawkers would throw away the bowls of the Chinese hawker. (because it has pork and is dirty and smelly.)<br><br>They view indians as 'bangalas' who are dirty and smelly too and they think they are the most prim and proper.<br><br>You call this racial harmony? It's just a smokescreen; don't be fooled.<br>Natural law states that humans are selfish. (Look up on 'Thomas Hobbes')<br><br>and which bloody crap sh*t teaches you to kill all who ain't islam? who bloody copies (similarly) to the bible? Which bloody sh*t teaches you that one day, the whole world must be of one religion?<br><br>oh, gettin' a lil' 'nostalgic'.. no wonder v. few actually got promoted in NS. and every single malay ain't allowed in one of the camp base (where there're high-end  operation and secret and stuff). That's a rule we must conform to.<br><br>i'm not against muslims; but they're against the whole world, as if the whole world owes 'em a living. You know..
