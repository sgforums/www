            <div class='col-md body'>This is a very delicate balancing act.<br><br>We cannot not let them in. Face it. If they don't do the jobs here, the factories would move there instead. We have to upgrade our skills(sounds familiar, i know) and cut our costs of living here (still think the cost of a HDB flat is too high).<br><br>As to having more Chinese or keeping the percentage constant, well, Chinese are the largest racial group of Singapore, so by keeping the numbers stable, the population of Singapore is more likely to be stable, a simple numbers game. Secondly, just look around southeast asia. You can draw a straight line when you have a graph of the ratio of Chinese in the population and the economic growth of the country. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Singaporeans and people in many developed countries ARE following their biological instincts by refusing to have children in a bid to ease the population size and the strain on our limited resources(water, fossil fuels food etc). To keep on reproducing at a greater rate while limited resources are running dangerously low  is in fact insanity.<br><br>And does he think the foreigners are stupid? Any country whose's citizens are mostly refusing to have children shows the lack of confidence in the country's future, and it can also be seen as a symptom of some underlying social /economic problems.<br><br>And many foreigners will be put off by the prospect of their offspring having to serve national service.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me say something honestly,n perhaps is a cruel fact to the PAP government.That is,even for foreign emigrates here,they are only treating this country as a "temporary shelter".Why?<br><br>The reason is simple,after they migrate to here,they will realise from communicating with the local ppl n personal experience here that Singapore,is not a great country afterall.Our politics are chaotic n dictatorial,Lou Lee is already old n senile,Lou Goh is only pro at boot-licking(oh,and playing golf n drink red wine,but boot-licking still his primary skill <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ).As for young Lee,he is a plant from green house n sooooo fragile(sar young,sar young. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ).<br><br>And when comes to economic,our economy growth is also restricted due to the fact that our country is small.But then small still nvm,it is our political policy that kills the economy.Example like bringing in too many foreigners(we are only a small island country god damnit <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> ),unflowing currency due to the fact that our money all lock up in CPF,serve NS n after that need to do "reservist"(alamak),living cost are damn high due to the fact that our PAP government is "money Suckers",n our salary remain the same n yet working hours prolonged.<br><br>Let me ask u all,from the above factors,will u like to live in Singapore n become "PAP" slaves if u are foreigner emigrates?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally think that most of the local malay community are pretty friendly compared to malaysian's malays where they are racist towards all races except their own (first hand experience).<br><br>I have several malay friends who can even speak chinese and hokkien, while 3rd generation chinese nowadays can't even understand basic malay, other than drill commands and the national anthem. I admit im one of those chinese  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The general attitude of chinese in my age group is -you don't disturb me, i don't disturb you- in fact while hanging out at the void deck or at the park with friends, once in awhile there would be a few malay chaps playing the guitar or more commonly soccer.
