              <h1>Russia to sign security pacts with Georgia regions</h1>
              <p>Russia will sign pacts with Georgia's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and
                  South Ossetia on Thursday to increase security cooperation and
                  strengthen their de-facto frontiers, a Kremlin official said. Russia
                  defied Western protests and recognised the two regions as independent
                  states last year after a brief war with Georgia that was sparked when
                  Tbilisi tried to regain control of South Ossetia. "The signing of the
                  agreements is a logical continuation of joint efforts by our states to
                  form a legal basis for bilateral relations," the Kremlin official, who
                  spoke on condition his name was not used, said on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The border
                  and security agreements are expected to be complemented with another
                  treaty,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> which will allow Russia to set up army and navy bases in
                  Abkhazia and South Ossetia that will host up to 7,600 troops. </strong></span>The
                  Kremlin official said that under the pacts, Russia will train Abkhazian
                  and Ossetian border guards and "help in general building up the
                  national border authorities of the two regions".</p>

              <p>Your claim that China will not allow North Korea to attack South Korea is laughable, as China could not even stop the North Koreans from conducting a nuclear bomb test that came as a surprise even to China in May 2009.</p>
              <p>For the first time in 50 years, China and Russia joined the UN Security Council to agree to tough sanctions to be imposed onto North Korea.</p>

              <p>Without the US presence in Japan and South Korea, it will surely lead these two countries to find their own nuclear balance to the obvious threats from North Korea.</p>
              <p>Will China and the rest of Asia accept Japan nuclear program, when the Right Wing in Japanese Politics are still in control and have prevented Japan from making any formal apology to the crimes committed against Asians in WW-2 ?</p>

              <p>Patents belong to the Company - if you have the capacity to takeover the Company, the patent is yours for the taking.</p>
              <p>This was the reason for China's corporation taking over of some well know US brand names in consumer products - as seen in Lenovo paying US$1.7 Billion to takeover IBM to use the IBM ThinkPad brand; and Qingdao Haier Co failed attempt to takeover Maytag with an offer of US$1.3 Billion; and China's TCL acquiring the television operations of Thomson SA who is also a multinational electronics manufacturer based in France that also owns the RCA brand.</p>
              <p>With the help of the various high tech manufacturers from Europe and USA opening modern manufacturing facilities in China - all of which provide training and equipment that bring Chinese technicians into the New Electronic Age - it will allow China to take a technological leap forward.</p>
              <p>China's universities and research institute will no longer need to make overseas trips to spy and steal technologies, as they are now manufactured in China.</p>
              <p>It will need Chinese flexibility and intelligence to use this new found access to develop new research into higher technologies with the help of her younger generations returning from overseas universities.</p>
              <p>The technological progress made todate can be observed by the confident public statements made of China's ambition to send a man to the moon in 2010, establish a moon station by 2020 or 2030, and a manned space journey to Mars in the future.</p>
              <p>All these have been a success of China's use of foreign investment as a stepping stone to develop and modernised her industrial base since she opened her doors to a global economy in the late 1970s.</p>
              <p>After almost 40 years of dependence on foreign MNCs, has Singapore achieve the same technological advancement that allow ourselves to develop our own creative technologies ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chapter 11 protects the business as a going concern - and allow the business that is poorly managed to be reorganized and managed by the Courts through a Trustee or bankruptcy administrator.</p>
              <p>Chapter 11 protects a business that has a plan for revival to be kept alive so as to be in a position to repay the debtors.</p>
              <p>Chapter 11 protects the Shareholders of a Corporation from losing their personal assets by making a difference between the assets of the corporation and that of the shareholders.</p>
              <p>Chapter 11 protects the Equity Security Holders and allow them to vote on the plan of reorganization and may file a proof of interest instead of a proof of claim.</p>

              <p><br><span style="color: #3366ff;">Did USA attack South Vietnam, or did the South Vietnamese Government of Ngo Dinh Diem asked the US to help defend against the North Vietnamese military aggression and subversion ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">North Vietnam had attacked the Laotian Government after a freely elected Laotian Government defeated the Communist Pathet Lao Party, and had subsequently invited the USA to help Laos to defend herself against the North Vietnamese.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Russia and China aided North Vietnam support to the Pathet Lao who then overthrew the Laotian Government that was friendly to the USA.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">China and Russia supported North Vietnam's war efforts in South Vietnam, that blatantly violated the sovereignty and independence of Laos and Cambodia.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">In the process, both China and Russia are complicit in North Vietnam attacking the integrity of Laos and Cambodia.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">China supported the Malayan Communist Party, the Communist Party of Thailand, the Communist PKK of Indonesia and the Communist Party of Philippines to overthrow the legitimate governments of these respective countries.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">These insurrections supported by funds and material hardwares had resulted in military confrontation of various scales, leading to death and destruction.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Is China not a party to attack the neutral countries in this region ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">China invaded Vietnam to teach Vietnam a lesson as Vietnam had attacked the Pol Pot Government of Cambodia - both attacked neutral and sovereign countries.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">China attacked India in a dispute over the territories in the Himalayans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">China was directly involved in supporting North Korea's unprovoked attack on South Korea, and China's military was directly involved in a counter-attack, when the North Koreans were nearly defeated by the UN forces led by the US.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">In sum total, the USA was only involve in the Vietnam War and became involved when the North Vietnamese openly became aggressive and forced the South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem to appeal for US involvement.</span></p>

              <p>North Korea had ignored China and went ahead to conduct a nuclear test during the last week of May 2009.</p>
              <p>For the first time in 50 years of China's relationship with North Korea, it resulted in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/05/25/2580513.htm">China condemns North Korea nuclear test. </a></p>

              <p>Interesting dialogue:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PM Chou En Lai: So perhaps we can ask you to write it in your memoirs since you have it now in your minutes. [laughter] I was speechless confronted with such a situation. It was impossible for me to say anything. But because Nehru insistently wanted to seize hold of Kashmir and Jammu, during the interval of the first Geneva Conference, 1954, I went to visit India. It was my first visit, and in that visit Nehru kept<br>on asking me if I knew where he came from. Then he told me he was from Kashmir, which therefore proved Kashmir was Indian territory!</p>
              <p>And he insisted on getting me to visit Kashmir, and I resisted him. But Khrushchev was very obedient and he visited that territory; it was also during his first visit to India, in 1955.</p>
              <p>So that is what is called politics. But in our view it is only intrigue, small tricks. It is not open and above-board political activity. India cannot be considered a small country but still stoops to such tricks. A small country could perhaps win at doing such things, though perhaps some small nations would have more backbone than that. You are not<br>so familiar with Nehru?</p>
              <p>Dr. Kissinger: I met him once.</p>
              <p>PM Chou: Only once.</p>
              <p>Dr. Kissinger: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But I must say that until well into the 1960’s I had always accepted the view that in the Sino-Indian War you had attacked. </strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It was not until I visit India in 1962 and talked to Khrishna Menon that I suddenly realized they had been bringing pressure on you. </strong></span></span>I have never been an admirer of Indian policy.</p>
              <p>PM Chou: So you hold a minority opinion among the upper strata of the U.S.</p>
              <p>Dr. Kissinger: Yes.</p>
