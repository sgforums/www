              <p> </p>
              <p>Another paradigm I want to establish is a difference between <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>two
                                      kinds of civilizations</strong></span>, which means a difference between two kinds
                                      of governments in them. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Asiatic Civilizations, which I call Class B
                                      Civilizations, generally do not attempt to deal with individuals or
                                      with the problems of individuals; they leave interpersonal
                                      relationships to the local or kinship community.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Class A Civilizations including Classical Civilization, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>our own
                                      Western Civilization,</strong></span> or the first Chinese or Sinic Civilization,
                                      whose dates are 1800 B.C. to 400 A.D. In class A Civilizations,
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> although the civilization begins as an area of common culture made
                                      up of communities, there is a long term trend to destroy and break
                                      down those communities.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The way I would like to express this would be -- and I used to
                                      draw it on the blackboard -- by saying that all civilizations start
                                      out as aggregations of communities. Those communities are generally
                                      of two types, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>either local, such as parishes, neighborhoods,
                                      villages, or manors; or kinships, families, clans, and so
                                      forth.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The communities from which Classical Civilization came were
                                      clans, kinship groups; the communities from which Western
                                      Civilization came were local villages and manors. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lucky
                                      civilizations, such as Chinese Civilizations over the past 1500
                                      years, generally have communities which are both kinship and
                                      local.</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>Another paradigm I want to establish is a difference between <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>two kinds of civilizations</strong></span>, which means a difference between two kinds of governments in them. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Asiatic Civilizations, which I call Class B Civilizations, generally do not attempt to deal with individuals or with the problems of individuals; they leave interpersonal relationships to the local or kinship community.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Class A Civilizations including Classical Civilization, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>our own Western Civilization,</strong></span> or the first Chinese or Sinic Civilization, whose dates are 1800 B.C. to 400 A.D. In class A Civilizations, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>although the civilization begins as an area of common culture made up of communities, there is a long term trend to destroy and break down those communities.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The way I would like to express this would be -- and I used to draw it on the blackboard -- by saying that all civilizations start out as aggregations of communities. Those communities are generally of two types, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>either local, such as parishes, neighborhoods, villages, or manors; or kinships, families, clans, and so forth.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The communities from which Classical Civilization came were clans, kinship groups; the communities from which Western Civilization came were local villages and manors. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lucky civilizations, such as Chinese Civilizations over the past 1500 years, generally have communities which are both kinship and local.</strong></span></span></p>
