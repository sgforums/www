              <p>MY MISTAKE.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>You confused classical civilisation with western civilisation.</p>
              <p>They are distinct and different civilisations, although one of the main sources that influenced the development of western civilisation is classical civilisation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Western Civilization began, as all civilizations do,
              in a period of cultural mixture. In this particular case it was a
              mixture resulting from the barbarian invasions which destroyed
              Classical Civilization in the period 350-700. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>By creating a new culture
              from the various elements offered from the barbarian tribes, the Roman
              world, the Saracen world, and above all the Jewish world
              (Christianity), Western Civilization became a new society.</strong></span></p>
              <p>This society became a civilization when it became
              organized, in the period 700-970, so that there was accumulation of
              capital and the beginnings of the investment of this capital in new
              methods of production.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>These new methods are associated with a change
              from infantry forces to mounted warriors in defense, from manpower (and
              thus slavery) to animal power in energy use, from the scratch plow and
              two-field, fallow agricultural technology of Mediterranean Europe to
              the eight-oxen, gang plow and three-field system of the Germanic
              peoples, and from the centralized, state-centered political orientation
              of the Roman world to the decentralized, private-power feudal network
              of the medieval world.</strong></span></p>
              <p>In the new system a small number of men,
              equipped and trained to fight, received dues and services from the
              overwhelming majority of men who were expected to till the soil. From
              this inequitable but effective defensive system emerged an inequitable
              distribution of political power and, in turn, an inequitable
              distribution of the social economic income.</p>
              <p>This, in time, resulted in
              an accumulation of capital, which, by giving rise to demand for luxury
              goods of remote origin, began to shift the whole economic emphasis of
              the society from its earlier organization in self-sufficient agrarian
              units (manors) to commercial interchange, economic specialization, and,
              by the thirteenth century, to an entirely new pattern of society with
              towns, a bourgeois class, spreading literacy, growing freedom of
              alternative social choices, and new, often disturbing, thoughts.</p>
              <p>From all this came the first period of expansion
              of Western Civilization, covering the years 970-1270. At the end of
              this period, the organization of society was becoming a petrified
              collection of vested interests, investment was decreasing, and the rate
              of expansion was beginning to fall.</p>
              <p>Accordingly, Western Civilization,
              for the first time, entered upon the Age of Conflict. This period, the
              time of the Hundred Years' War, the Black Death, the great heresies,
              and severe class conflicts, lasted from about 1270 to 1420. By the end
              of it, efforts were arising from England and Burgundy to conquer the
              eve of Western Civilization. But, just at that moment, a new Age of
              Expansion, using a new organization of society which circumvented the
              old vested interests of the feudal-manorial system, began.</p>
              <p>This new Age of Expansion, frequently called the
              period of commercial capitalism, lasted from about 1440 to about 1680.
              The real impetus to economic expansion during the period came from
              efforts to obtain profits by the interchange of goods, especially
              semi-luxury or luxury goods, over long distances. In time, this system
              of commercial capitalism became petrified into a structure of vested
              interests in which profits were sought by imposing restrictions on the
              production or interchange of goods rather than by encouraging these
              activities.</p>
              <p>This new vested-interest structure, usually called
              mercantilism, became such a burden on economic activities that the rate
              of expansion of economic life declined and even gave rise to a period
              of economic decline in the decades immediately following 1690. The
              class struggles and imperialist wars engendered by this Age of Conflict
              are sometimes called the Second Hundred Years' War. The wars continued
              until 1815, and the class struggles even later. As a result of the
              former, France by 1810 had conquered most of the eve of Western
              Civilization.</p>
              <p>But here, just as had occurred in 1420 when England had
              also conquered part of the core of the civilization toward the latter
              portion of an Age of Conflict, the victory was made meaningless because
              a new period of expansion began. Just as commercial capitalism had
              circumvented the petrified institution of the feudal-manorial system
              (chivalry) after 1440, so industrial capitalism circumvented the
              petrified institution of commercial capitalism (mercantilism) after
              1820.</p>
              <p>The new Age of Expansion which made Napoleon's
              military-political victory of 1810 impossible to maintain had begun in
              England long before. It appeared as the Agricultural Revolution about
              1725 and as the Industrial Revolution about 1775, but it did not get
              started as a great burst of expansion until after 1820. Once started,
              it moved forward with an impetus such as the world had never seen
              before, and it looked as if Western Civilization might cover the whole
              globe.</p>
              <p>The dates of this third Age of Expansion might be fixed at
              1770-1929, following upon the second Age of Conflict of 1690-1815. The
              social organization which was at the center of this new development
              might be called "industrial capitalism." In the course of the last
              decade of the nineteenth century, it began to become a structure of
              vested interests to which we might give the name "monopoly capitalism."
              As early, perhaps, as 1890, certain aspects of a new Age of Conflict,
              the third in Western Civilization, began to appear, especially in the
              core area, with a revival of imperialism, of class struggle, of violent
              warfare, and of irrationalities.</p>
              <p>By 1930 it was clear that Western Civilization was
              again in an Age of Conflict; by 1942 a semi-peripheral state, Germany,
              had conquered much of the core of the civilization. That effort was
              defeated by calling into the fray a peripheral state (the United
              States) and another, outside civilization (the Soviet society). It is
              not yet clear whether Western Civilization will continue along the path
              marked by so many earlier civilizations, or whether it will be able to
              reorganize itself sufficiently to enter upon a new, fourth, Age of
              Expansion.</p>
              <p>If the former occurs, this Age of Conflict will undoubtedly
              continue with the fourfold characteristics of class struggle, war,
              irrationality, and declining progress. In this case, we shall
              undoubtedly get a Universal Empire in which the United States will rule
              most of Western Civilization. This will be followed, as in other
              civilizations, by a period of decay and ultimately, as the civilization
              grows weaker, by invasions and the total destruction of Western
              culture.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, if Western Civilization is able to
              reorganize itself and enters upon a fourth Age of Expansion, the
              ability of Western Civilization to survive and go on to increasing
              prosperity and power will be bright. Leaving aside this hypothetical
              future, it would appear thus that Western Civilization, in
              approximately fifteen hundred years, has passed through eight periods,
              thus:</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>     The two possibilities which lie in the future can be listed as follows:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>     Reorganization                         Continuation of the Process</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>     3D.     Fourth Expansion, 1944-               5.  Universal Empire (the United States)</p>
              <p>                                        6.  Decay</p>
              <p>                                        7.  Invasion (end of the civilization)</p>
