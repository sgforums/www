              <p>Well it appears that discussions on why the <span>USA</span> is printing money is all over the map. Let me clue
                                  you into why its happening: the Obama administration is doing a
                                  power grab: pure and simple. They are doing what Obama’s chief of
                                  staff Rahm Emanual said, “Never let a good crisis go to waste!” The
                                  deficits are <span>NOT</span> from the <span>BUSH</span> administration; he only over spent by $456 Billion
                                  <span>USD</span>; the Obama administration is on tract to
                                  overspend by $2 <span>TRILLION USD</span>! You can’t blame
                                  that on the previous administration. Obama is purely trying to
                                  nationalize everything he can get his hands on: banks, insurance
                                  co, autos, student loans, mortgages, etc. This is fascism in its
                                  purest form. Don’t confuse fascism with Nazism. One is the
                                  formation of production, the other is a political formation.</p>
              <p>However, my real point is that the <span>USA</span> is
                                  moving head long towards fascism with the <span>SCOTUS</span> (Supreme Court of the US) denying an appeal to
                                  stay the Chrysler/Fiat deal. This is the first indication that even
                                  the US’s highest court can be intimidated by the Obama White House.
                                  This deal shows that “black letter law” can be subverted by
                                  upturning the entire bankruptcy law in the <span>USA</span> on its ear. While this inaction by the <span>SCOTUS</span> went unreported by the world’s media, it shows
                                  that the “rule of law” is no longer important in the US court
                                  system. It is the beginning of the slow erosion of the <span>USA</span>’s moral high road position. How can we, the
                                  <span>USA</span>, point our finger at any other nation
                                  that nationalizes its private industry, devalues its currency, and
                                  runs haphazard over its own “rule of law.”</p>
              <p>It happens slowly just like it did in Germany in the 30’s. Watch
                                  3 things in the <span>USA</span> to find out it will turn
                                  out:<br> 1) Does the Obama administration continue to nationalize
                                  industries?<br> 2) How does the US Treasury long term bond auction fare this
                                  week?<br> 3) Does the public opinion turn against Obama as he continues to
                                  deficit spend?</p>
              <p>Only a more fiscally conservative party campaigning against the
                                  Obama Democratic Congress and a big win in 2010 will slow or begin
                                  to turn the <span>USA</span> back from their move towards
                                  collectivism.</p>
              <p>Good discussions.</p>

              <p><strong>"The opponents include a trio of Indiana pension plans, consumer groups and individuals with product-related lawsuits."</strong></p>
              <p>Is it not the duty of the Supreme court to protect the rights of US people and ensure the decision does not violates the constitution ?</p>
              <p>Judicial restraint has been the current MO. yes ?</p>
              <p>Would you rather Chrysler goes into liquidation just to benefit a handful whom are out to get a better deal ?</p>
              <p>And it's not the spendings.. but the POLICIES of Bush Administrations that's causing a hugh stink right now.</p>
              <p>And I don't think Obama is a fascist. During uncertain time.. it is important to have a strong leader .  Unlike other Socialist states.. the Obama intervention comes with an exit clause.</p>

              <p><br>Way i see it, Obama's spending this paper money because he has to plug up the holes left behind by the Bush Administration.</p>
              <p>That's one thing i see as the problem with the American's 8 years presidential term. You're encouraged to only make sure the problem doesn't explode within your presidential term and leave the mess to be mopped by the next upcoming President.</p>
              <p>One thing i noticed about Americans is that they tend to throw Socialism and Facism as if it's some sort of vulgar insult and self explanatory. While i can understand this for Facism, i really don't see why Socialism can somehow be so dirty a term.</p>
              <p>But currently the way i see it, Obama has to resort to facist/socialist policies. The private sector is going out of control and there needs to be more government intervention to stop it from these corporations from ruining America. The private sector is not going to regulate themselves, there is no profit in doing that.</p>
              <p>We believe that only governments could become corrupt and power hungry, ignoring the well being of their country. Why is it that we think that corporations would not become the same? It's easier for them no? They have no responsibility whatsoever to the people.</p>

              <p>Does Singapore have a choice in not selling Tuas Power Plant, when Singapore is buying up Australia's Optus, Belgium's Belgacom, China's Eastern Airline, and shipyards in the USA - (one of which builds and maintain US naval vessels) ?</p>
              <p>Rio Tinto is a business entity that is licensed to extract minerals that form part of the nature's heritage of Australia - can one sell away the license to allow a foreign nation to extract the natural wealth of a nation ?</p>
              <p><br>If what you say is correct that - China is only able to get Third Rate Assets with her Sovereign Fund - it is surprising that these Third Rate Assets that China purchased has resulted in profit of US$10 Billion for the financial year ending 2008, when all the Singapore's talented skills manage to lose US$100 Billion for the same period. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, Europe and Japan may have more years of experience in financial markets than China, and both also have many more years of experience in industry and commerce as both have even invaded and colonised parts of China.</p>
              <p>Yet, despite all the years of advance experience - how did it happen that both were left behind by China in a short span of 20 years after China open herself to the global market economy ?</p>
              <p>Despite the decades of European and Japanese fiscal experience - both were badly strung by the recent global financial meltdown, while China remained well buffered from the "violent storm" ?</p>
              <p>If the lack of experience can handicap China, surely it will also make her more cautious to learn and consider all options before making any daring departure from the established practices ?</p>
              <p>China did it during the move to break away from the Socialist Economic Model - do not under-estimate the potential of the Chinese when they put their minds to solve problems that threaten their financial, military or political positions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we accept your premise that China's "lack in experience" is to be scorn - how are you ever going to justify the lack of experience of  the other Singapore political parties ambitions to challenge and take over the PAP to form the next Government ?</p>

              <p>And if what i've been reading is accurate, the way the urban setting in America is designed forces one to use cars to get around.</p>
              <p>But i guess the quickest solution now to cut down on domestic gas consumption is to impose a gas tax.   Don't see how that's gonna happen though, i think Americans might really prefer to fight another war rather than give up on their cars.</p>
