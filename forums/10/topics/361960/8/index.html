              <p>Hello? If you dont know anything in economics, then you'd better keep yourself away from the printing money thing, ok?</p>
              <p>The money market would not allow US (basically any country) to do that, if more money comes up, the money will be cheaper, regardless your money is worldwide or not...</p>
              <p>Just go and study how US$ and Euro work, ok? Come on nah...</p>

              <p>by  F. William  Engdahl</p>
              <div class="articleAuthorName">June 10, 2009</div>
              <div class="articleAuthorName"><br></div>
              <div class="articleAuthorName">
              <p>Increasingly a deep divide within the world of
                              globalization is emerging which will have the most profound
                              significance for the future of G7 nations’ economic and political
                              stability.</p>
              <p>The divide is between those nations which are still embedded
                              within the dollar system, including countries in the Eurozone, versus
                              those emerging economies—especially the BRIC—Brazil, Russia, India,
                              China—where new economic markets and regions are rapidly replacing
                              their over-dependence on the United States as prime export market and
                              prime source for investment finance. The long-term consequences will be
                              an aggravation of the trend of the United States as a political and
                              economic superpower in terminal decline, while dynamic new economic
                              zones, initially mainly of regional importance, will arise.</p>
              <p>The one great asset which nations like China,
                              Indonesia, India and Brazil bring to the emerging divide is the one
                              greatest long-term economic deficit or liability of the older
                              industrialized world, USA, UK, Germany and the EU generally. That is
                              their demographic advantage.</p>
              <p>With the exception of Russia, all the growth
                              economies possess young, dynamic and growing populations. Interesting
                              to recall is that the hidden story of the pre-1914 German ‘economic
                              miracle’ was based on a similar ‘secret’—rapid and dynamic young and
                              growing population, while that of Great Britain and France was stagnant
                              or in decline after the British Great Depression of 1873 which led to
                              huge emigration of population to the USA.</p>
              <p>It’s no accident that the leading political elites
                              of the G7 argue that the greatest threat globally is the rapid birth
                              rate in developing countries. Translated from their euphemism, they
                              really mean the greatest threat to their continued dominance of world
                              affairs is population expansion in emerging economies, as new
                              contenders inevitably rise.</p>
              <p><strong>New growth regions emerging </strong></p>
              <p>Almost naturally in the past eighteen months, once
                              the initial shock of the worst financial and economic shock since the
                              1930’s began to subside, China and its immediate trading partners along
                              with the other high-growth emerging economies, began looking for new
                              alternatives to the dying dollar system.</p>
              <p>The present crisis is no short-term epiphenomenon as
                              Ben Bernanke, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner or Barack Obama would
                              wish us to believe. It is the reflection of more than 65 years of
                              defective US economic policy, a defect which reached epidemic
                              proportions after the decision to abandon the gold exchange standard in
                              1971. Let’s be clear , that gold standard as well as its predecessors
                              was no magic economic panacea. But the break by Nixon in August 1971
                              allowed Washington to embark on a de facto financial imperialist policy
                              which ruined much of the world economy in its ravages of the past
                              thirty eight years.</p>
              <p>Today the contrast between declining G7 economies
                              and emerging dynamic high-population growth economies could not be
                              clearer. The G7 nations from USA to Germany to Italy are choking in
                              public debt, ranging from 80% of GDP in the United States to well over
                              100% in Italy and a staggering 199% in Japan. Only Zimbabwe with 218%
                              debt to GDP tops that. Germany has a ratio of 77%.</p>
              <p>By contrast, of the emerging dynamic high-growth
                              countries, only India has significant public debt, a legacy of the
                              British colonial era, of 58% GDP. Brazil, despite a severe debt crisis
                              in the 1980’s, today has a public debt to GDP level of a very
                              manageable 45%, while Indonesia, one of the fast-growing newly emerging
                              economies, has 34%.</p>
              <p>South Korea with a high domestic savings culture
                              has a mere 28% debt ratio and China a mere 18% debt to GDP level.
                              Russia, which used the recent boom in oil and gas revenues to pay down
                              its foreign and IMF debts, while the country has severe demographic
                              problems, has a public debt to GDP as of 2008 data of 6%. It has also
                              slowly rebuilt foreign exchange reserves after the crisis last year to
                              a level of $404 billion this month, making its reserves the third
                              largest in the world.</p>
              <p>So, with the economies of the USA and EU caught in
                              the jaws of a twin scissors-like crises between growing public debt and
                              declining population growth rates to service that debt long-term, the
                              emerging economies of Asia and Eurasia as well as Brazil in South
                              America are booming, precisely because they enjoy the twin assets of
                              low public debt to GDP ratios combined with dynamic growing
                              populations.</p>
              <p>In China, India, Indonesia, Brazil economic growth
                              continues to advance significantly. Governments are not buried under a
                              mountain of debt and citizens remain optimistic about their future.
                              This divergence, between the once rich and the once poor, will mark a
                              geopolitical shift in the pivot of world history when viewed
                              retrospectively by future economic historians.</p>
              <p><strong>Caught in the blades of a twin crisis </strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The most notable aspect of the crisis is the
                              thorough discrediting of western academic economists, including every
                              single winner of the Economics Nobel Prize. Their grandiose theories
                              justifying their laissez faire ‘free market’ economic model of
                              globalization has been proven fatally wrong, in effect a transparent
                              promotion gimmick to justify the process of one-sided globalization,
                              little more. They have been exposed, to use the terms of one of my
                              favourite children’s stories by the Danish writer H.C. Andersen, like
                              the Emperor with no clothes.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The dollar system their world had been based on
                              since Bretton Woods in 1944, is undergoing a death agony. Every measure
                              advocated to date by two US Administrations—Bush and now Obama—as well
                              as the other G7 governments has amounted to giving heavy and even
                              heavier doses of financial chemotherapy to a dying patient. The ever
                              higher doses of taxpayer bailout to maintain a failed financial and
                              banking model on artificial life support is merely worsening the
                              underlying health of the US economy.</p>
              <p>The record US financial bailouts since September
                              2008, a span of a mere ten months, have brought the US Federal debt
                              from some 60% to a whopping 80% of GDP. Private US household debt is
                              now above a record 100% of GDP, significantly worse than in the bad
                              recession year 1974 when it was a mere 40%.</p>
              <p>More alarming, for any prospect of growing out of
                              the US economic downturn, the long-awaited phenomenon of demographics
                              has slowly begun to impact. In the coming 1-3 years the impact of Baby
                              Boom generation retirees in record numbers will hit.</p>
              <p>They will be
                              forced to draw down their public Social Security retirement from the
                              Government as well as selling their private 401k and similar stock and
                              bond investments in order to live in retirement. In economic terms they
                              will become a net drain on the US pubic finances whereas rising
                              unemployment among younger workers whose taxed earnings are needed to
                              pay into the Social Security fund, will aggravate the US public debt
                              level rapidly to Italy or even Japan or Zimbabwe levels in coming
                              years. Unemployed workers do not pay taxes. They draw on state benefits
                              instead.</p>
              <p>In April, India's car sales were 4.2 percent higher
                              than they were a year prior. Retail sales rose 15 percent in China in
                              the first quarter of 2009. China is likely to grow at 7 or 8 percent
                              this year, India at 6 percent and Indonesia at 4 percent.</p>
              <p>By contrast, even using badly flawed official data,
                              the US economy contracted at an annual rate of 6.1 percent last
                              quarter, Europe by 9.6 percent and Japan by a frightening 15 percent,
                              something that rivals the 1930s.</p>
              <p>In the West, plus G7 member Japan, banks are
                              overleveraged and thus dysfunctional, governments paralyzed with debt,
                              and consumers are rebuilding their huge debt burdens. America is having
                              trouble selling its public debt at attractive prices. The last three
                              Treasury auctions have gone badly. Its largest state, California, is
                              veering toward total fiscal collapse. The current fiscal year US budget
                              deficit is going to surpass 13 percent of GDP, a level last seen during
                              World War II.</p>
              <p>By contrast emerging-market banks are largely
                              healthy and profitable. Every Indian bank, government and private,
                              posted profits in the last quarter of 2008. The governments are in good
                              fiscal shape. China has the world’s largest foreign currency reserves,
                              $2 trillion in reserves, and a budget deficit less than 3 percent of
                              GDP. Brazil is now posting a current account surplus. Indonesia has
                              reduced its debt from 100 percent of GDP nine years ago to 34 percent
                              today.</p>
              <p>Unlike in the West - where governments have run out
                              of money or creative new ideas and are now praying that their medicine
                              will work - these countries still have options. Only a year ago, their
                              chief concern was an overheated economy and inflation. Brazil has cut
                              its interest rate substantially, but only to 10.25 percent, which means
                              it can drop it further if things deteriorate even more.</p>
              <p>The mood in many of these countries remains
                              surprisingly upbeat. Their currencies are appreciating against the
                              dollar because the markets see them as having better fiscal discipline
                              as well as better long-term growth prospects than the United States.
                              Their bonds are rising. This combination of indicators, all pointing in
                              the same direction, is unprecedented.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The United States remains the richest and most
                              powerful country in the world. Its military spans the globe. Even if

                          of the Soviet Union in the 1970s now says that the US has been on its

              <p><strong>NZZ: Mr. Todd, you write that America is economically,
                          militarily, and ideologically too weak to actually control the world.
                          This would gladden many anti-Americans. But how is this anything but
                          the wishful thinking of an intellectual who is the product of the
                          French US critical tradition?</strong></p>
              <p>ET: This is neither wishful thinking nor anti-Americanism. Why would
                          I have been so prominently criticised by the left? The French career
                          anti-American paper "Le Monde diplomatique", was the only major paper
                          that remained conspicuously silent on my book. The over-estimation of
                          America is fundamental to these people. It is on this topic that they
                          agree with the American ultra-conservatives: the former to demonize,
                          the latter to aggrandize.</p>
              <p><strong>You on the other hand can be accused of underestimating the United States.</strong></p>

              <p>America is so big.. ofcors has to get around by car lah. Urban public transport is available but only in city area where population is dense.</p>
              <p>Imposing a petroluem tax will speed up the alternative fuel development... but the gahmen must help push the changes lor.</p>

              <p>That Seekingalpha article is old alredy.. now the US economy is recovering loh.....</p>
              <p>Click read <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Fed-survey-sees-signs-apf-15492268.html">Recession is Easing</a> latest news ok ?</p>
              <p>Balance of trade?.. now why would US want a balance of trade ? With the current import of low cost foreign goods.. Americans are enjoying the uplift in the quality of life. This trade imbalance is something the average citizens don't give a hoot about.</p>
              <p>The only common complain average Joe likes to bitch about is the stupid oil prices. And this will perhaps go away in 20 yrs.</p>

              <p>What does NS have to do with reducing military spending? We're paid peanuts to do it anyway. Besides, i find it pretty decent in character building it's not like we're made to salute LKY's picture in the morning and said Heil Lee Kuan Yew before 5BX in the morning.  </p>
              <p>It's more representative of a problem if your military is the biggest employer no ? Considering that the military is at the same time the most useless contribution to society as well as its most dangerous asset. The more you spend on guns the more tempted you are to use it, especially when you've got the biggest one around.  </p>
              <p>Not talking about moving between cities. It's more of the way urban planning is done, i think the suburban culture along with the extensive infrastructure to support it (trash collection, electricity, water pipelines) is the most wasteful of all.</p>
              <p>Meh, for a country that preaches so much about the free market it sure has problems obeying its own creed.</p>
