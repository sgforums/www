              <p>Other countries are buying large amount of americans bonds and most are holding their large part of US dollars too. So do you think countries in all the world wants US dollars to go down, if US goes down, all go down. That is why China had warned US not to lower it currency before agreeing to buy their low cost Fed bonds.</p>

              <p>Yes,we are free to roam(for now),but can we change whatever decisions that our PAP government has made or decide?Can we go on street protest?</p>
              <p>When those blood sucking PAP want to raise electricity fee or transport fee,can we stop them?</p>
              <p>When the PAP decide that all banks should implement surcharge on those ppl who bank saving are below $500 a month,can we stop them?</p>
              <p>Just look at ERP,which initial purpose was to replace ALS.Now not only Orchard road are charging,the ERPs are everywhere now!!!!</p>
              <p>And when those stingy PAP decide to give only 2 cents discount on busfare,can we make them change their mind n give us more discount?</p>
              <p>In the West n American,although the government also implement some unwelcome policy,but atleast,they wont go too far.And if their ppl protest,the government might sometimes withdraw their decisions.</p>
              <p>I am not saying Westerners or Americans are good,coz in every countries,there are always good n bad ppl.But the thing is,Western democracy politics prove to be by far the most effective governing system.Our PAP Losers+retards n those Chinese Communist Pigs politicians are too stupid to deny that!! </p>

Weekly basis is going to make a lots of people especially in the HR admin and even bank work harders, this increase cost and such cost will bring down salary/bonus of staff.

Why take the stress of governing no resource state, old aging population that depend on FDI. And also, get criticise and cursed by peoples like most of you here. He dun have to deserve such thing if he just walk away happily. But as a gal, I understand the man, he got guts and a never die attitude, even we young gals have to admire that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whether he makes wise or poor decision, get cursed or kicked or critised even with F words, he goes on with what he built and make sure that he takes good care of it, protect it, nurture it and growth with it. In a human progression perspective, he is not wrong, doing what a man of honor is make to do. The same as a man who built his house and family, by hooks or by crooks, he will give his life to protect it, that is what I call a True Man. If he gives up, he will be label as coward and good for nothing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We therefore, like it or not, should be glad that we got a fighter leader in our country. Take it or leave it, he stands tall and watch over Singapore without fail.</p>

              <p>Yes, he certainly watch over Singaporeans - not to protect us, but to ensure that we work to make his own ambitious and vain plans succeed - without our voices or our ideals being considered.</p>
              <p>Only one voice, one plan, one dream - ONLY HIS counts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you seriously believe that Singapore cannot be what it is today without LKY or the PAP ?</p>
              <p>You belong to the generation that have been brainwashed by PAP propaganda - which LKY had learnt so well while working in the Japanese Propaganda Department during WW2.</p>
              <p>Since Stamford Raffles founding of Singapore in 1819, Singapore had thrived as one of the jewels in Asia, and had rivalled Hong Kong as a trading post.</p>
              <p>Entrepot trade had always been a part of Singapore, and those living in Singapore under the British Colonial Government were working in a spirit of 'Free Enterprise' - without any interference or competition from those in Government.</p>
              <p>The people living in Singapore had learnt to diversify and change with the times as Singapore grew from a small colonial outpost into a major trading center, and had evolved to become a tempting target for Japan to zero in to grab Singapore for herself.</p>
              <p>Was LKY and the PAP so brilliant in their ability to identify the necessity to change and diversify from the traditional Entrepot Trade, or has that not been a characteristic of those living in Singapore since 1819  - to constantly evolve to be relevant ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With or without LKY and the PAP, in the 1950s - after WW-2, Singapore was already embarking on private industrialisation that made new beginnings in manufacturing with private capital, as was with Hong Kong during the same period, which saw the rise in Trade Unionism.</p>
              <p>With LKY and the PAP, the industrialisation of Singapore involved the massive borrowing of international funds from Asian Development Bank and Japanese Aid.</p>
              <p>It also saw the death of private enterprise in Singapore - as the Singapore Government competed with Private Capital in consumer products, as well as in medium and heavy industries.</p>
              <p>From the famed F&amp;N softdrinks to Singapore Turf Club, from private shipyards to private bus companies, from privately owned supermarkets to private banking, from newsprints to publications - all were taken over as State operated Statutory Boards later converted as private enterprise that are basically Government Linked Companies - with Government funds to compete with private capital.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These takeovers were made possible by the shrewd use of a Parliament dominated by one Party given a free hand to make the many changes to the Singapore Constitution - by passing new laws to allow Public Money to be used to takeover Private Enterprise, and all disguised as 'Economies of Scale' to save on limited national resources.</p>
              <p>But was this done for the interest of Singapore and Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>The Cambridge educated and mono-lingual English speaking LKY - who could not even speak in his native Hakka dialect - was shunned by the private business community, who had financially supported the Political Parties formed by Chinese educated and bi-lingual Singaporeans - during the late 1950s through the 1960s.</p>
              <p>This had moved LKY to see the <strong>political threat of Private Capital</strong>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, LKY and his family could have withdrawn from Public Office after controlling Singapore since 1957, and rewarding himself and his family with million dollar annual wages PLUS pension since Singapore entered the 21st Century.</p>
              <p>Why do they not withdraw from Public Office - despite the shameful debacle in the loss of more then US$100 BILLION in public monies due to poor controls and stupid executive decisions ?</p>
              <p>Is it due to the simplistic reason of protecting Singapore, or protecting themselves -by preventing any follow-up government that can be formed by an Alternative Party that will very likely investigate all that have transpired so secretively in 52 years of absolute and monopolistic exercise in unchecked political power ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You must be having one drink too many in your empty bar, to become deluded that LKY is fighting for Singaporeans ?</p>

              <p>Did he build Singapore for Singaporeans, or for himself ?</p>
              <p>Did he fight for Singapore and Singaporeans during the darkest hour of the Japanese Occupation, or was he a mere survivalist and worked as a translator for the Japanese Propaganda Group ?</p>
              <p><br>While he worked with the Japanese Occupation Government in Singapore, there were other Singaporeans and Malayans - who fought against the Japanese Occupation Forces in Malaya, Singapore, Borneo and Indonesia.</p>
              <p>The real fighters during WW-2 did not collaborate with the Japanese, but took the risks to fight the occupation force</p>

              <p>Yes, he certainly watch over Singaporeans - not to protect us, but to ensure that we work to make his own ambitious and vain plans succeed - without our voices or our ideals being considered.</p>
              <p>Only one voice, one plan, one dream - ONLY HIS counts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you seriously believe that Singapore cannot be what it is today without LKY or the PAP ?</p>
              <p>You belong to the generation that have been brainwashed by PAP propaganda - which LKY had learnt so well while working in the Japanese Propaganda Department during WW2.</p>
              <p>Since Stamford Raffles founding of Singapore in 1819, Singapore had thrived as one of the jewels in Asia, and had rivalled Hong Kong as a trading post.</p>
              <p>Entrepot trade had always been a part of Singapore, and those living in Singapore under the British Colonial Government were working in a spirit of 'Free Enterprise' - without any interference or competition from those in Government.</p>
              <p>The people living in Singapore had learnt to diversify and change with the times as Singapore grew from a small colonial outpost into a major trading center, and had evolved to become a tempting target for Japan to zero in to grab Singapore for herself.</p>
              <p>Was LKY and the PAP so brilliant in their ability to identify the necessity to change and diversify from the traditional Entrepot Trade, or has that not been a characteristic of those living in Singapore since 1819  - to constantly evolve to be relevant ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With or without LKY and the PAP, in the 1950s - after WW-2, Singapore was already embarking on private industrialisation that made new beginnings in manufacturing with private capital, as was with Hong Kong during the same period, which saw the rise in Trade Unionism.</p>
              <p>With LKY and the PAP, the industrialisation of Singapore involved the massive borrowing of international funds from Asian Development Bank and Japanese Aid.</p>
              <p>It also saw the death of private enterprise in Singapore - as the Singapore Government competed with Private Capital in consumer products, as well as in medium and heavy industries.</p>
              <p>From the famed F&amp;N softdrinks to Singapore Turf Club, from private shipyards to private bus companies, from privately owned supermarkets to private banking, from newsprints to publications - all were taken over as State operated Statutory Boards later converted as private enterprise that are basically Government Linked Companies - with Government funds to compete with private capital.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These takeovers were made possible by the shrewd use of a Parliament dominated by one Party given a free hand to make the many changes to the Singapore Constitution - by passing new laws to allow Public Money to be used to takeover Private Enterprise, and all disguised as 'Economies of Scale' to save on limited national resources.</p>
              <p>But was this done for the interest of Singapore and Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>The Cambridge educated and mono-lingual English speaking LKY - who could not even speak in his native Hakka dialect - was shunned by the private business community, who had financially supported the Political Parties formed by Chinese educated and bi-lingual Singaporeans - during the late 1950s through the 1960s.</p>
              <p>This had moved LKY to see the <strong>political threat of Private Capital</strong>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, LKY and his family could have withdrawn from Public Office after controlling Singapore since 1957, and rewarding himself and his family with million dollar annual wages PLUS pension since Singapore entered the 21st Century.</p>
              <p>Why do they not withdraw from Public Office - despite the shameful debacle in the loss of more then US$100 BILLION in public monies due to poor controls and stupid executive decisions ?</p>
              <p>Is it due to the simplistic reason of protecting Singapore, or protecting themselves -by preventing any follow-up government that can be formed by an Alternative Party that will very likely investigate all that have transpired so secretively in 52 years of absolute and monopolistic exercise in unchecked political power ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You must be having one drink too many in your empty bar, to become deluded that LKY is fighting for Singaporeans ?</p>

              <p>Have you watch survivor series on the TV. Even best friend do betray each other so as to stay on the game, and if you think that is coward, it is not, it is called survivor of the strongest or fittest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In behavorial science, our behavior is subject to influences and enivroment changes. As the only few young men of that time that can do the translation, I believe that is the key to his survivor, or else long long the japs would had killed all able body young men. He is infact very smart, knowing that even the mighty British empire also cannot beat the Jap, why should he carry on and fight. Rather he should stay alife and helps those in need secretly. And during such time, he can start to plan his life and learn his lesson about being occupied.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All these events help him with experiences to govern a country, he saw the agony of defeat and being colonised, therefore he wants NSmen, he invested in arms to protect us, all these is because he suffered thru.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All young people including me do make mistakes in our live, when i was a young teen, i even do shoplifting, get caught too. But life is not about mistakes, it is about lesson learnt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can you imagine if there is No LKY here and we are under malaysia or indonesia?? just imagine...</p>
