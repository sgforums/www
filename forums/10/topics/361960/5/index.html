              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Simple viscious cycle.</p>
              <p>USA invest in manufacturing facilities in China, bring money over to China where Chinese workers earn their wages paid by US investors - US Dollar stay in China.</p>
              <p>These US investment may or may not be equity shareholders in the manufacturing plants, and may simply be investment to upgrade manufacturing equipment to help meet US quality standards, and in return obtain lower cost for manufactured products.</p>
              <p>China makes the goods that USA will buy, and more US dollar flow to China to pay for these manufactured goods - US Dollar stay in China.</p>
              <p>USA buys more attractively priced China manufactured products based on US standards - more US dollar flow in and stay in China.</p>
              <p>This has led to an unbalanced trade between China and USA, where the USA buys more from China, then China can buy from the USA.</p>
              <p>At present, money only flow in one direction - with China having a huge net gain every year, and the USA having a huge net loss.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, USA is going broke from this unbalanced trade payments - which is worsened by the stupidity in George W Bush's war agenda in Iraq, and the inattention paid to shorten the war to fight the Talibans and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>With two wars running at the same time, this is bankrupting the US Treasury.</p>
              <p>China has to support the US financial market and prevent the US Dollar from losing its value.</p>
              <p>This is in China's own interest, as she is holding a large amount of US Dollar from the annual positive trade balance that it has with the USA.</p>
              <p>To keep the US Dollar afloat, China has to continuously buy US Treasury Bonds and inject some of the accumulated US Dollar back into USA.</p>
              <p>How many Boeing aircrafts can China continue to buy to return the huge amount of the US Dollars that she has accumulated from the annual trade surplus that continue to grow geometrically every year ?</p>
              <p>China can only pray that the US Treasury Bonds will also be supported by other Governments and investors, so that these Bonds will not become worthless paper.</p>
              <p>The other alternative is for China to slowly sell the US Dollar in the international currency exchange, but only in small volumes that do not affect the exchange rate and create losses in the daily currency trading activities designed to reduce the amount of US Dollar in their possession.</p>

              <p>Thank you, Catknight, and others for the kind words about America; however, as an American that has traveled the world, we are no longer the nation to be envied or modeled. With the election of Obama, and I believe that people get the government they elect, the USA will soon pass into history as it becomes more and more fascist. Many think the USA is becoming socialistic, but history has never shown an example of a democracy becoming socialistic. Democracies become fascist; monarchies/totalitarian governments become socialistic. I hate to say it, but watch over the next 18 months as the US Government takes over more and more of the American economy under the guise of "solving the crisis." We Americans have become lethargic and lazy; we now depend on the "Government" for 1 out of every 5 dollars; we were even chastised by the Russian newspaper, Pravda, as becoming (their mistake) socialistic.</p>
              <p>I will leave the USA before the 2012 elections and try to get an immigrants VISA to SG. Your city/state/country still has the ideals that I think can make freedom work, but it too must be guarded against allowing too much government intervention.</p>
              <p>Thank you for allowing me to join and read your forums. I will be back and read more of this interesting web site over the next few days/weeks. Good luck with your dreams, SG.</p>

              <p>USA are always knocking on their own heads, if I understand from my social history study,  from lieut Col North to watergate cases, USA are alway  a double agents crook, the world see it, formerly they also supported the Taliban against the Russian, and now, they goes against the Taliban, why?? Must be US of A didn't take care of them or live up to their promises. US of A has alway wanted to be the world policeman, but the different with a norm policeman is that US of A wanted something out of their policeman work whereas a normal one just do it for the peace of the society. USA likes to create their own war, otherwise they cannot justify the high taxation and also, cannot prove that their forces and weapons are nos 1, be the big brother and people start buying their weapons, which is the biggest business with or without recession.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>China population is more than half of USA, its economy is at an infant stage growing faster than ever. Peoples there are just like the USA in the 1945 when the war was over, getting richer and economy booming, they are hungry for technology, english, electronic stuffs, LCD, computer, books, car, houses, press water toilets, etc etc..as Sony chairman said, "Selling LCDTV to the Chinese is enough already",  the Chinese are no more looking for bread and opiums, and with a population more than 1/2 of USA, can u imagine the market,...1.3 billion, if u sell a pencil at just $1, and all buy it, you are a billionair liao...that is the market we are talking about. Today china 8% GDP growth is not on export, it on domestic only, just imagine if USA recover and the world goes up again, the next tidal waves in China will be tremedous, anytime over 10% GDP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And surprisingly, USA brokers are selling China equity like hot cake, these insitution that underwrite it are surprisingly, AIG, Citibank and all other rescued by Obama and the Fed.</p>

              <p>Angel, I think you are right. China is like the USA after WWII, and unfortunately, the USA is now like Europe. We are doomed to become a much weaker, less important economic power, and less effective in promoting democracy. So will China step in the shoes left by the USA-vacuum? Probably, but what will they export? What will they promote?</p>
              <p>The old Soviet Union went away since it could not "centrally plan" their economy and those if its satellites. China can "centrally plan" as long as what Angel says doesn't take place: the growth of the Chinese middle class. When this happens China will not be able to contain the demands and aspirations of its more demanding population and change will come to China like it did for the old USSR; however, I don't believe the USA will be around to help out.</p>
              <p>It will be interesting to see how China deals with the growing economic power they are becoming while still trying to stay a collectivist-state. Central planning simply has limits to its effectiveness.</p>
