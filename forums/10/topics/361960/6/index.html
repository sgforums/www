              <p>There are other alternatives for China to convert her excessive holdings of US Dollars into other currencies as well as holding more gold - which the World is now seeing <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.financialsense.com/fsu/editorials/willie/2009/0205.html">Gold disconnect from US Dollar. </a></p>
              <p>Whatever China does, she will have to do it cautiously so as not to undermine further the shaky market confidence in the US Dollar.</p>
              <p>China is not the only country holding huge amounts of US Dollar, as the Oil producing countries are holding similar large amounts as well - since the US Dollar has been the currency of choice used in oil trades.</p>

              <p>Can the USA continue to print more "banana US Dollar" to sustain a falling US Dollar that China is dumping ?</p>
              <p>The best that the USA can do is to seek the support of other countries with surplus funds to support the US Dollar for the sake of mutual interests - and these countries will include Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Australia, the EU countries, and the UK.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">If China can stand on her own two feet, that means, demand in China has increased and the USA can sell to them much more that the US can sell to them at the moment and money will flow from China to the USA.</span></p>

              <p>If China can stand on her own two feet by growing domestic demands and allowing USA to sell to China - it will mean China is committing the same mistake that USA has made.</p>
              <p>For China to be able to stand on her own feet, she will have to grow her own domestic market to the extent that her domestic economy will insulate China from any earth-shaking events outside China.</p>

              <p>How does this help China to solve her problems with the huge amount of worthless US Dollars in China's possession ? </p>
              <p>For a start, China and all other countries are beginning to look at alternative trade arrangements.</p>
              <p>As recently seen, China is discussing with Malaysia to use either the Yuan or the Ringgit for their bilateral trade - even as Malaysia is a small trading partner with China.</p>

              <p>For many years, China has been resisting calls for her to liberalise the exchange rate for the Yuan - and for all you know the present circumstances that China has been caught in, could have been an elaborate plot by the USA to force China to play by market economy rules if China wants to benefit from a global market economy.</p>

              <p><br> Just be happy u have a job now. Weekly basis is going to make a
              lots of people especially in the HR admin and even bank work
              harders, this increase cost and such cost will bring down
              salary/bonus of staff. Beside, monthly helps individual to control
              and plan better financially.</p>

              <p>True. Somehow i agree with you. Its no big deal just one of my wish from a long list of wishes.</p>
              <p>Though i dont think its a much harder work for the HR etc cause by going weekly, the daily pay will be fixed thus easier to claculate NS pay, unpaid leave etc. And with a fix weekly salary, it is easier to pay employees thru their bank account coz the amount is fixed. Imagine a fixed monthly pay of $2500. To calculate daily pay is more tedious as diff months have diff no of days. If its a fixed weekly salary of $600 then its easier. Get what i mean?</p>

              <p>It is no secret, and the credit crunch is due entirely to the huge bad debts caused by the US Banks in their greed to generate 'sales' by lending to those who have no ability to pay. These 'bad debts' are then repackage to be sold as 'derivative financial instruments' to other banks across the globe.</p>
              <p>The printing of the money is merely to 'jump start' the economic crisis of confidence and get the economy running again - as was done in the Great Depressions of the 1930s.</p>

              <p> "Cannot do anything" and "cannot do much" is somewhere between nothing and something.</p>
              <p>Between both ends - the space available is matter of perception and perspective from where you, me and those in authority in China and the other countries stand.</p>
              <p>USA cannot hold the world to ransom, when the World move in concert either to rescue the US financial system, or to abandon it for a different model - it reflects the many options available that waits for some country to take the lead role.</p>

              <p>When the Chinese decide to take on the role as a major global player given her present established financial status, China can provide the leadership role that is shunned by the Japanese or a disjointed EU.</p>
              <p>The RMB can be made to be an attractive 'reserve currency' if it complies with steps that can generate international confidence in the currency.</p>
              <p>Do not under-estimate the will of China and her Government - they have shown that when they make up their minds to head in some directions, they will achieve what they had set up to do - even if it takes some effort to modify their political ideology.</p>

              <p>Do you think that China got a lousy deal in buying Tuas Power Plant paying for it with the worthless US Dollar to Temasek ?</p>
              <p>Which is more worthless - Tuas Power Plant, or the US Dollar from the huge cash hoard of US Dollar that China has ?</p>
              <p>With so much US Dollars - how many sovereign assets are there available for China to takeover and in which countries that are willing to sell ?</p>
              <p>They will buy what is available and do it sensibly - note that even as Singapore Soveregin Fund has lost US$100 Billion by end-2008, China was able to come out with US$10 Billion profit for the same period.</p>

              Well it appears that discussions on why the USA is printing money is all over the map. Let me clue you into why its happening: the Obama administration is doing a power grab: pure and simple. They are doing what Obama's chief of staff Rahm Emanual said, "Never let a good crisis go to waste!" The deficits are NOT from the BUSH administration; he only over spent by $456 Billion USD; the Obama administration is on tract to overspend by $2 TRILLION USD! You can't blame that on the previous administration. Obama is purely trying to nationalize everything he can get his hands on: banks, insurance co, autos, student loans, mortgages, etc. This is fascism in its purest form. Don't confuse fascism with Nazism. One is the formation of production, the other is a political formation.
              
              However, my real point is that the USA is moving head long towards fascism with the SCOTUS (Supreme Court of the US) denying an appeal to stay the Chrysler/Fiat deal. This is the first indication that even the US's highest court can be intimidated by the Obama White House. This deal shows that "black letter law" can be subverted by upturning the entire bankruptcy law in the USA on its ear. While this inaction by the SCOTUS went unreported by the world's media, it shows that the "rule of law" is no longer important in the US court system. It is the beginning of the slow erosion of the USA's moral high road position. How can we, the USA, point our finger at any other nation that nationalizes its private industry, devalues its currency, and runs haphazard over its own "rule of law."
              
              It happens slowly just like it did in Germany in the 30's. Watch 3 things in the USA to find out it will turn out:
              1) Does the Obama administration continue to nationalize industries?
              2) How does the US Treasury long term bond auction fare this week?
              3) Does the public opinion turn against Obama as he continues to deficit spend?
              
              Only a more fiscally conservative party campaigning against the Obama Democratic Congress and a big win in 2010 will slow or begin to turn the USA back from their move towards collectivism.
              
              Good discussions.
