              <p><strong><span>EU Elections, Peru Riots, and More!</span></strong></p>
              <p>Some interesting things are going on in the world right now. The EU
                      is beginning to lean more to the right, South American citizenry is
                      rebelling against their US-backed governments, and the economic crisis
                      isn’t getting any better.</p>
              <p>What could this all mean? All of these three
                      things seem so different, but they do have a connection – the rise and
                      fall of nations. In economics, one of the primary principals that is
                      taught and engrained into every student is that over time, everything
                      eventually has to be balanced.</p>
              <p>That is to say that everything
                      eventually returns to its natural equilibrium that cannot be exactly
                      calculated nor predicted. Drawing a parallel between that concept and
                      politics, it can be said that those states that become too big
                      eventually dwindle down to become on par with the rest of the world and
                      those that are too small catch a break a get a chance to rise up a bit
                      and become stronger.</p>
              <div>
              <p class="rtcutp"><a style="display: none;" href="http://www.russiatoday.com/About_Us/Blogs/With_words_we_govern_men___Disraeli.html?fullstory">Read more</a></p>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;">
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I am talking about the decline of the United States as a world power
                      and a sole superpower at the helm of world politics and the world
                      economy. </strong></span></p>
              <p>The aforementioned recent occurrences are the last indicators
                      that should be needed to show that the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> United States is facing its
                      final years of world dominance as a leader of the Western world and an
                      unchecked power that states would need to deal with in order to
                      accomplish anything in international politics. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Before I continue, I
                      would like to say that I am not mocking this occurrence, nor am I
                      rejoicing at it.</p>
              <p>It is simply a reality that most refuse to acknowledge
                      because most of the world has been dependant on the United States and
                      those that live within its borders are so used to being a part of the
                      most secure and strong nation on Earth at this time.</p>
              <h3>Latin America</h3>
              <p>Let’s begin analyzing the evidence from South America. Peru is
                      seeing more and more protests coming from the indigenous people whose
                      land is being taken in order to harvest hydrocarbons and other
                      minerals.</p>
              <p>Protests from indigenous people in South and Central America
                      would all be routine, but it is happening more and more often,
                      frequently accompanied by violent clashes with the police.</p>
              <p>Ecuador
                      recently announced that it is no longer going to work with the World
                      Bank nor will it repay its loans borrowed from this institution. All of
                      this is indicative of an emboldened South America.</p>
              <p>For nearly two hundred years the United States has been following
                      the Monroe doctrine that states that America will view as acts of
                      aggression European efforts to further colonize Latin America.</p>
              <p>Well,
                      this basically translates to today that any nation wishing to move in
                      to Latin America to expand their influence will automatically infringe
                      upon America’s sphere of influence and the USA’s national interests
                      abroad.</p>
              <p>Usually, Latin American governments would quickly crack down on
                      protests or sacrifice their national interests so that the top elite
                      would benefit financially off of what otherwise is inconvenient for the
                      general population.</p>
              <p>Today, with the United States facing a grave
                      economic crisis and its military stretched and tied up, Latin America
                      is able to begin shaking off the shackles placed upon them by the World
                      Bank and repressive governments.</p>
              <p>The events in Peru and Ecuador are
                      probing shots into whether United States still has a firm hold on the
                      Latino states. So far, the United States has not responded with any
                      weight to these occurrences and seems to have somewhat forgotten about
                      it due to its Western Hemisphere dominance aspirations, maybe taking
                      its power over the South and Central Americas for granted.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>However, the
                      declining influence of the US in South America looks to be a reality. </strong></span>Washington-friendly Latin American politicians are losing control over
                      their populations and the North American superpower is putting its
                      priorities elsewhere in the world.</p>
              <h3>EU’s Swinging Right</h3>
              <p>European Union’s citizens have voted and have indicated that they
                      are becoming more conservative. All across the board, majority of EU’s
                      member states have become center-right. Most importantly England, the
                      last of the EU’s major member states has turned conservative leaving no
                      leftists to counter Europe’s right bound direction.</p>
              <p>What does this
                      off-center right mean for Europe and its member states?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It means that
                      Europe is going to grow even wearier of getting involved in aggressive
                      US international politics and will become more focused on its internal
                      problems rather than attempt to be the biggest and the baddest kid on
                      the block.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Most of the EU’s citizens are fed up with the influx of immigrants
                      from the Middle East and North Africa and would like to see their
                      cultural values preserved.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Immigration is a good indicator of a country
                      being appealing and stable. However, when a traditions-centered Europe
                      is threatened by an extremely large influx of immigrants, most
                      Europeans begin to want to protect their heritage and their country
                      from being overrun by another culture, effectively pushing out the
                      native Europeans from their neighborhoods due to increased crime and
                      overpopulation of certain areas by immigrants.</p>
              <p>For Washington, it means that<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Europe will be harder to persuade to
                      back America in its aspirations to be the dominant superpower. </strong></span>Europe
                      will be freer to choose for itself who it works with and how it
                      conducts its political affairs. One recent prime example would be the
                      South Stream vs. Nabucco ordeal.</p>
              <p>For Europe, it makes more sense to
                      work with Russia on South Stream. However, the United States would like
                      Nabucco to be built because US companies would then get a cut of the
                      cash and have something that binds the two sides of the Atlantic
                      together – creating a lasting relationship whether the EU wants it or
                      not.</p>
              <p>However, with EU swinging right off center, it becomes evident
                      that the Obama administration is putting their priorities elsewhere.
                      However, a right-swung Europe is not in the current administration’s
                      best interest, for it would leave the US fending for itself and having
                      to (gasp!) bargain with the EU in order to receive Europe’s cooperation
                      in the international arena.</p>
              <h3>The Conclusion</h3>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;">President Obama looks to be extremely focused on the internal politics
                      of the United States. Can’t blame him.</div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;"><br></div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;">After all, he promised voters
                      change and that he would pull the country out of the downward-spiraling
                      economy. Obama’s efforts to change the direction of the economic
                      indicators are disappointing even to himself, as CNN recently reported.
                      However, there is a lot of change, but not in favor of the United
                      States. In a situation where resources are scarce, any political leader
                      would have to prioritize.</div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;"><br></div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Obama administration has no choice but to
                      commit America’s resources to battling the economic downturn, pulling
                      troops out of Iraq, settling its affairs in Afghanistan, and yet still
                      keeping a hold on the Middle East. </strong></span></div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br></strong></span></div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Next on the priority list would be
                      countering Russia’s growing influence on its near abroad, keeping
                      Europe close, combating China’s increasing power in its near abroad,
                      and finally keeping its grip on the Western Hemisphere as outlined by
                      the Monroe doctrine. </strong></span></div>
              <div class="rtcut" style="display: block;"><br></div>
              <p>Certain things have to be dropped from the list above. In hard
                      economic times, nations have to sacrifice some of their national
                      interests and international aspirations in order to keep afloat. In the
                      movie “American Gangster”, when Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) travels
                      to Vietnam to buy cocaine at the source for his growing drug empire,
                      the Vietnamese General says, “It's not in my best interest to say this
                      Frank, but quitting while you're ahead, is not the same as quitting.”</p>

              <p>Take my advice.</p>
              <p>The more cocky you are, the more you want to dominate, the more you want to give dictates, the more resistance and hatred you will generate in the world.</p>

              <p>Right or Wrong - firstly, you must be commended for the first ever response that reflect some attempt at exercising your grey matter - compared to your daily dose of frivolous comments in every thread to make your nuisance in the SgForum to be of some relevance.</p>
              <p>Before WW2 - did the Jap called "asians a sick man of the east" - or were the Japs referring to China as the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_man_of_Asia">‘Sick Man of Asia’ </a>during the end days of the Qing Dynasty ?</p>
              <p>It was during the Manchu period of the Qing China that China was being invaded and carved up by the Western Powers and Japan ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are the mentality of Asians still being dependent on the West - or USA in particular ?</p>
              <p>Economically, the USA and the West remains the techonology innovators, even as China is fast catching up, while South Korea and Japan ability is limited only in terms of funding the research that will lead to technological innovations that can rival the West.</p>
              <p>Asian countries maybe dependent of the West or USA for such technological input into their industrial or commercial plans - most countries will use such a co-operation as a stepping stone.</p>
              <p>The learning curve for the various Asian countries will depend on the quality of their manpower in terms of education that leads to technological skills, mental flexibility and creativity.</p>
              <p>Countries like China, Japan, South Korea - and even India - are dependent on the West and USA for their market size and their ability to absorb the high tech and high quality products designed and produced in the sweat shop of these Asian countries.</p>
              <p>As much as Asian countries are dependent on the West and the USA - they are as dependent on Asian countries to produce the required products at far cheaper costs than they can produce themselves.</p>
              <p>Singapore's size make it necessary to treat the world as the Market for our produce.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Defense matters, South Korea, Japan and Singapore depend on the USA to play a role in the "balance of power" in the region, as the individual countries will not have the military might to stand up against any ambitious drive from Russian and China.</p>
              <p>Singapore have no choice but to depend on the  USA for the supply of the battle tested military hardware so as to tap into the vast military capability in strategic and tactical training</p>

              <p>Right or Wrong - firstly, you must be commended for the first ever response that reflect some attempt at exercising your grey matter - compared to your daily dose of frivolous comments in every thread to make your nuisance in the SgForum to be of some relevance.</p>
              <p>Before WW2 - did the Jap called "asians a sick man of the east" - or were the Japs referring to China as the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_man_of_Asia">‘Sick Man of Asia’ </a>during the end days of the Qing Dynasty ?</p>
              <p>It was during the Manchu period of the Qing China that China was being invaded and carved up by the Western Powers and Japan ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are the mentality of Asians still being dependent on the West - or USA in particular ?</p>
              <p>Economically, the USA and the West remains the techonology innovators, even as China is fast catching up, while South Korea and Japan ability is limited only in terms of funding the research that will lead to technological innovations that can rival the West.</p>
              <p>Asian countries maybe dependent of the West or USA for such technological input into their industrial or commercial plans - most countries will use such a co-operation as a stepping stone.</p>
              <p>The learning curve for the various Asian countries will depend on the quality of their manpower in terms of education that leads to technological skills, mental flexibility and creativity.</p>
              <p>Countries like China, Japan, South Korea - and even India - are dependent on the West and USA for their market size and their ability to absorb the high tech and high quality products designed and produced in the sweat shop of these Asian countries.</p>
              <p>As much as Asian countries are dependent on the West and the USA - they are as dependent on Asian countries to produce the required products at far cheaper costs than they can produce themselves.</p>
              <p>Singapore's size make it necessary to treat the world as the Market for our produce.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Defense matters, South Korea, Japan and Singapore depend on the USA to play a role in the "balance of power" in the region, as the individual countries will not have the military might to stand up against any ambitious drive from Russian and China.</p>
              <p>Singapore have no choice but to depend on the  USA for the supply of the battle tested military hardware so as to tap into the vast military capability in strategic and tactical training</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>In an electoral registered Singaporean voters, do you know how many people actually voted for the PAP - even when they boasted that they received 66.6% of the valid votes ?</p>
              <p>Only one-third of the registered electorates had participated in the 2006 election, which is about one million out of the registered list of three million voters.</p>
              <p>The election system and the "political arrangements" in Singapore has been designed to handicap the other political parties and to prevent any party from being able to reach out to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Rules such as HDB void decks not being allowed to be used by any political parties - except by the PAP is already one way to cut grass-root contacts.</p>
              <p>Financial contributions to political parties are clearly designed to scare away any big supporters from the business community, or from private wealth.</p>
              <p>GRC system is another way to stretch the resources of the other political parties that already have their foundations weakened by the other rules.</p>

              <p>Singapore is also suffering from the movement of jobs to lower cost centers, and is facing similar cyclical situation as those advanced economies in the West and USA.</p>
              <p>The advantage that Singapore has over these advanced countries is that Singapore can claim our size will limit our ability to play a responsible role in contributing to the global affairs - like the USA and Europe in their direct involvement to combat world disorder in Yugoslavia, Albania, Afghanistan, Iraq, Korean Peninsular and Africa.</p>
              <p>These advanced countries will have to find the financial resources to fund their global role as well as to develop their economies and maintain social development.</p>
              <p>Compared to the Singapore Government being paid top dollar for the Singapore Talent employed as Ministers - the governments of these advanced countries have done a remarkable job considering the extent of their many responsibilities and commitment to look after their internal and external communitieis.</p>

              <p>After WW2, without the US presence and protective umbrella given to Japan - do you think that Asia will be calm and peaceful if Japan is allowed to have a free hand to develop its military and invest actively in military technologies for her own defense ?</p>
              <p>The citizens of Japan that actually "hate" the presence of the US army in Japan are those few activists that are given high profile in a small photo on the front page of their "daily shimbun". The larger population prefer the US military presence that will allow Japan to continue its present status of not having a high profile military.</p>
              <p>The citizens are happy that instead of diverting vast amount of monies into military research and hardware, the major parts of their national budget has gone into civilian development in education, social health schemes, infrastructure, industrial and economic development.</p>
              <p>The ones given the highest profile are the Okinawan residents who have to share the limited space on Okinawa island with the US military - and the Okinawa people do not consider themselves as Japanese.</p>

              <p>It was the politics of the 60s when the USA was involved in the Vietnam War - and it was part of the surge of Communist ideology across the globe that painted the picture of the Domino Theory being real.</p>
              <p>From the revolution of Latin America funded by the Soviet Union, to the wars in the Middle-east with Soviet support, to the messily concluded ambitious Communist plans of North Korea to unify the Korean Peninsular with direct involvement from China, and the war of subversion in Malaya and Brunei, to the Communist insurrections in the Luzon Peninsular, to the Communist guerilla wars to overthrow the Government of South Vietnam - these was the picture of Communist expansionism across the globe.</p>
              <p>The US involvement in South Vietnam had to happen if it did not wish to see Thailand, Cambodia, Malaya, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei, Philippines falling like dominoes to the Communist plan of world domination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It will be a surprise for you - as it was for me - to find out that not the entire population of North Vietnam was supportive of Ho Chi Minh and the Communist Party that swept into power after the defeat of the French in Dien Bien Phu in North Vietnam.</p>
              <p>The Communist Party had to embark on a continuous struggle to keep its population in a constant state of war by embarking on a surreptious war against the legititmate government of South Vietnam that was recognised by the UN.</p>
              <p>During the Vietnam War, the North Vietnamese had already violated the neutrality and sovereignty of Laos and Cambodia as the Ho Chi Minh trail had been carved into these countries - to form a backdoor entrance for the supply and movement of troops and military equipment to attack South Vietnam.</p>
              <p>US involvement did not happen overnight and was made at the request of the legitimate government of South Vietnam appealing for international help against North Vietnamese military aggression.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The USA was not involved in the Malayan campaign against the Malayan Communist Party led by Chin Peng, as the British Colonial Government and the British Military controlling the situation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Indonesia, President Sukarno had attacked Malaysia and was supported by China who was as much against the formation of Malaysia as a neo-Colonialist plan to hold on to the colonies.</p>
              <p>Indonesia's invasion of East Timor was part of President Sukarno's ambition of a larger Indonesian empire and was not a result of US instigation - (could this even be possible when the US was supporting UK during the Confrontation ? ).</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB62/">When the authoritarian government in Portugal was overthrown in 1974, it had encouraged the growth of nationalist movements in East Timor calling for independence from Lisbon. Indonesia had initially supported these nationalist movements but succumbed to its own ambitions to make East Timor the twenty-seventh province of Indonesia. </a></p>
              <p>Was the USA directly involved in Indonesia's plans to invade East Timor ?</p>
              <p>If it had, why did the US create sanctions against Indonesia after East Timor was invaded and annexed by Indonesian military ? </p>
              <p>In fact, the US Government had accused Indonesia of mis-using US military aid and equipment given to Indonesia to wean her from Communist influence </p>
              <p> The USA had no choice but to subvert the Indonesian Governmetn under Sukarno for his attempt to destabilise Southeast Asia with the help of China.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the Philippines, the fight agains the Communist Party of the Philippines was very much a local affair, with military hardware and training provided by the US government on the request of the Philippine Government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>USA attacked more countries in this region - Southeast Asia ?</p>
