On the other hand, do you want Indonesian-Malays or Malaysian Malays to be imported to Singapore ? India  and China are experiencing strong economic growth and more are getting educated and hungry for a better paying jobs. I can't say the same for our neighbours. Besides i wouldn't know if they want to come here. Our neighbouring countries, Malaysia in particular has always been emphasizing that the Malays in Singapore are marginalised etc. This goes down well with them despite the majority of them are living in poverty. Ironical isn't it.</div>
