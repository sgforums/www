It's something no government can prevent and the bottomline is that people will still put themselves first. Sure there will be loyal stayers but the world is so dynamic that there will be changes to the country's social make-up that one cannot avoid it. In today's world, its either you accept it or get left behind. Race is not an issue as I believe that the country will take in the brightest, smartest and most hardworking</div>

Keep it coming as Singaporean need to know how minorities feel about this issue.<br><br>Question now is how un-Singaporean will Singapore get ?<br><br>I last heard patriotic songs like "One Nation-One People-One Singapore..."<br><br>What B*S*it!!!  I guess garment agree that is a stupid song indeed....<br><br>So they decided to replaced with "A City of Possibilities"...whatever happened to the word "Nation"? Won't Nike's slogan do just as well for S'pore Inc ?<br><br>Oh, they might as well change the pledge from "We the Citizen of Singapore" to "We the Residence of Singapore" since the government boards and ministries had replaced "Singapore Citizen" classification with "Singapore Residence".<br><br>As a matter of fact, "Singapore-Citizen" is just a legal term used as a cheap source of military manpower and a source of joke by FT here.<br><br>However, I am pretty sure there is one thing that any Singaporean male welcome is the change in ENLISTMENT ACT (CHAPTER 93) by replacing the term "citizen of Singapore " with "residence of Singapore".....now that will be interesting... </span></div>

Foreigners are needed to power our economy because we lack the skilled manpower who are able to fill the vacant jobs in the biomedical industries, as well as the semi-skilled and unkilled workers willing to accept the kind of low wages foreign workers are willing to work for. Without foreign workers we will lose out in competitiveness and our economy will stagnate.<br><br>If Singaporeans want a job, they have to be able to fill a job vacancy at competitive rates. If you want a higher pay, you have to offer something the foreign workers cannot do.<br></div>
