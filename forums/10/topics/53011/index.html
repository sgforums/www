            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday, a "joker" ambassador tries to make himself famous by saying some nonsensical and tactless speech in front of the media. He's famous now, but it will bring him trouble.<br><br>The latter's name is Mr Parameswaran (not the Parameswara who fled from Temasek to Malacca during ancient times), Malaysia High Commissioner to SIngapore.<br><br>The MFA of Singapore says he "sucks" as a diplomat. I say he doen't fit to be one at all. <strong>A diplomat is always neutral at all times. A diplomat should be a friendly, guest envoy staying at a host nation.</strong><br><br>No wonder the Malaysian media compained that the Malaysia's "goodwilled" reputation is damaged "by SIngapore" (indirectly).<br><br>I think he should check what the word "diplomat" means in the Oxford Dictionary. It meant "a tactful person".<br><br>Maybe he would also want to check up his Malaysian history of the Residential System in Perak, of why the stupidity as well as tactlessness of one British official, named J W W Birch (I call this guy *B*i*t*c*h* as he deserves to die), died in Perak while serving his post in a foreign land. Birch was killed by angry Perak malays while having his shower at a small public bath.<br><br>Now, Mr Parameswaran having to check all public toilets before he goes in or elese he may not be able to finish his "business" during his fit.<br><br>There may be no Left or Right-wingers in Singapore, but there are definitely hard-core loyalists and nationalists in Singapore.[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A letter from former Singapore High Commissioner to Malaysia (ST, July 26).<br><br><span style="color: brown;"><strong><span class="large">Attack by KL envoy uncalled for </span></strong><br>I REFER to the article, 'Singapore 'overreacted', says diplomat'<br><br>Malaysian High Commissioner N. Parameswaran claims that his remarks at the Singapore Press Club luncheon, at which I was also present, were taken out of context.<br><br>The fact of the matter is that the High Commissioner chose to abuse the privilege extended to him by the Chair to launch a vitriolic attack against a person who was not present to defend himself. This was uncalled for.<br><br>I am saddened by his action. High Commissioner Parameswaran has embarrassed many of his friends, including myself, who extended our hand of friendship to him.<br><br>If a diplomat faces operational difficulties in the host country, the normal thing to do is to resolve them by going through proper channels. This is what diplomacy is all about. An outburst in the press hardly helps matters. In fact, it makes matters worse.<br><strong><br>K.
