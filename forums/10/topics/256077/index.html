            <div class='col-md body'>Ministers make all autocratic decisions by saying yes or no to works essentially done by others based on prior studies and proposal papers done by others and they call themselves talents.<br><br>They cannot even create vibrancy through accommodating diversities of views and opinions and do not allow MPs to object to anything or major changes like 30% jumps to their own million-dollar salaries or allow a vote to be taken to increase their own salaries. The whip is getting ready to stop any MPs from objecting to any policies or laws being passed.<br><br>So under such circumstances there is no role or decisions or contribution or value-adding that can be made by a speaker and his assistant speakers? For that kind of mundane works without any line duties or role citizens have to pay speaker $50 plus K per sitting (after bonus and life-long pension is added)?<br><br>If there is any work to be done by the speaker they would often by done by the respective personnel in ministries and departments or someone else.<br><br>So clearly he only has to watch the proceedings and take some notes without the need to recommend decisions or make suggestions or changes.<br><br>So really there is no need for speaker to be highly qualified or that talented. All that is needed is someone who understand basic meeting procedures and able to comment on such duties. It is all the more mundane if decisions in parliaments are done by all the others.<br><br>If government is to advertise there will be many more qualified people who could exercise greater competence whose asking pay will be less than $2,000-$5,000 per session. The hangman in Changi too is paid per session of $200. No hanging no pay.<br><br>So it is just a wayang kulit and do not pay too much regard to so-called talents as all these are hype and self-aggrandizement.<br><br>May be his difference from a hangman is he only exercises the time guillotine.<br><br>To make wages variable, all must start from top down as the top are the most padded. Then Singapore can withstand recessions and compete once again.<br><br>To keep up with globalisation, ministers say citizens must not be afraid to trim their own fat wages and let foreigners come in to help them.<br><br>Why can't ministers start from the top mundane or sinecure jobs like these or at least make their wages variable like the Changi hangman so that the whole country will become competitive once again.</div>

Simple isn't it for NWC whether benefiting private sector's employees or not does not matter as long as the ministers could use NWC to legitimise or legalize their own salary increases.<br><br>That is the main reason why throughout the 1970s-present NWC only benefited the public sector and ministers and not the 80% ordinary workers in the private sector.<br><br>Minister Teo Chee Hean conveniently failed to mention in his recent recommendations of wage increases to the public sector's that the wages of incumbent in the public sector like CEOs, GMs, managers, teachers, police, principals, etc are easily three times of equivalent grade in private sector.</div>
