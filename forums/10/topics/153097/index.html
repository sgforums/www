So my question is why is there this big differentiation in the case of the sports school?<br><br>On the other hand, the sports school wants to groom the locals to represent Singapore, but aren't today's PRs future citizens of Singapore if they feel that this is the place for them?<br><br>PRs love to live in Singapore because the place is good, safe and clean with many career opportunities. These are the key factors that keep PRs committed to Singapore.<br><br>If they like it, they can apply to become Singapore citizens. The Singapore government doesn't force anyone to become citizens.<br><br>Singapore has done a lot to attract foreign talents as far as the work force is concerned. But in sports, I feel there is still a lot more to be done. The process to upgrade a student's pass to that of a permanent resident and then become a Singapore citizen should be the same.<br><br>Encourage sporting talents to come to Singapore. Please revise the fees for permanent residents to match those for Singapore citizens.<br><br>Suresh Potluri<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why doesn't any citizen want to be a sportsman in Singapore?<br><br>Because the pay is so farking LOW! Sportsmen's wages are nowhere near those of Wayne Rooney. How are they going to survive when the cost of living in Singapore is so HIGH? Those FTs are nobodies in their own countries, so they have no choice but to come to Singapore if they are to make it big. The strength of our dollar vis-a-vis their respective currencies ensures that they can live comfortably here.<br><br>Most Singaporeans would rather get an engineering or business degree, and look down even on those who major in Literature. Don't expect them to be keen on an athletic career.</div>
