            <div class='col-md body'>It is a genius idea to propose charging higher  water price  to international clientele in Spore (ships, airports, aircraft and resorts). ''profits can be shared equitably'' by SG and MY !!This was proposed by a former Ambassdor of<br>MY ,Datuk DEVA M. RIDZAM,a former ambassador to the European Union, Belgium and Luxembourg (2000-2005) and to Cambodia (1991-1996).<br><br>1.<strong><a href="http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Monday/Columns/20070521081641/Article/index_html" rel="nofollow">Opinion: Saying goodbye to past stresses and strains by<br>DEVA M. RIDZAM</a></strong>--www.nst.com.my 21.05.2007<br><blockquote>....The second challenge is how both sides can resolve outstanding issues, in particular the price of water to Singapore. It is a commercial contract.<br><br>This is a straightforward case of what is a fair price between "a willing seller and a willing buyer", after taking into consideration MalaysiaÂ’s needs before meeting SingaporeÂ’s additional domestic water requirements.<br><br>In other words, Malaysia will honour the existing contract relating to the volume of water to be supplied to Singapore for its legitimate domestic needs, but at a new "fair price".<br><br>Malaysians remain sore that the price revision has not been agreed to. As a result, Mal-aysians continue to pay a heavy price, measured in hundreds of millions of ringgit in lost revenues.<br><br>The water trade is a clear example of interdependence involving costs and benefits to both sides. Our countries must be prepared to pay a fair price and bear acceptable costs and focus on the long term as well as the ups and downs of the moment. Only then can a new deal be worked out.<br><br>Malaysians and Singaporeans continue to be concerned that acrimony between their countries remains a stumbling block to better relations.<br><br>Beyond SingaporeÂ’s domestic need, additional water supply can be made available to service its international customers (ships, airports, aircraft and resorts). But this should be on a different basis.<br><br>Malaysia can, for example, consider allocating a specified volume of water and charging a true market price for SingaporeÂ’s international clientele. In this regard, there may be room for a joint venture whose profits can be shared equitably.....</blockquote>2.<strong><a href="http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Friday/Letters/20070525075716/Article" rel="nofollow">Water agreements: ItÂ’s not simply a matter of water price,By : SHIVAKUMAR NAIR for Singapore High Commission Kuala Lumpur </a></strong><br><blockquote>DATUK Deva M. Ridzam, in his commentary, "Saying goodbye to past stresses and strains" (NST, May 21), made assertions on the water issue which are fundamentally inaccurate.<br>Ridzam wrongly stated that the 1961 and 1962 agreements between the Johor government and the Singapore City Council ("the Water Agreements") are "commercial contracts" between Singapore and Malaysia.<br><br>On the contrary, the water agreements are not ordinary or "commercial" agreements.<br><br>These are binding international agreements duly confirmed and guaranteed by both the Malaysian and Singapore governments in the Separation Agreement that established Singapore as a sovereign state in 1965, and registered at the United Nations.<br><br>Both countries are, therefore, bound by international treaty obligations to honour observance of the water agreements and neither side can unilaterally vary their terms and conditions.<br>Ridzam was thus mistaken to describe the price of water under the water agreements as "a straightforward case of what is a fair price between Â‘a willing seller and a willing buyerÂ’".<br><br>Johor is bound by the water agreements to sell water to Singapore at a specified price.<br><br>The agreements provide a mechanism for the price to be reviewed and for disputes to be resolved through the process of arbitration.<br><br>Singapore has made clear its willingness to resolve the matter through arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the agreements.<br><br>Therefore, it is not simply a matter of price; rather, it is how the agreement on the new price is reached by both sides.<br></blockquote>3.SG is treated like younger bro again!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually this idea may be considered or study more closely to modify the benefit to be indirectly benefit the region, help to provide positive spillover.<br><br>We are being viewed as a country that takes and never give, when we Give there is always motive.<br><br>Over the last 20 years our income and exceeded our neighbour countries. Instead of buying favour like giving "old military ship" or money to clean up their system. It might be a good idea to add incentive to encourage the positive growth of Singapore where else the regional neighbour are eating sour grapes.<br><br>I just think that In the long run we know that prosperity need to share. Income need to distributed. Or else today is water, tomorrow is Sand, We are already spending money on externalities for Fresh Air.  What's next? .......Radiation clean up.</div>
