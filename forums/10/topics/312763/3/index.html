              <p>If you see the situation from a broader perspective, you can see some positive effects of DPRK's behaviour over the years.</p>
              <p>USA was getting cocky after its victory in Iraq in 2003 and ready to smash more countries.</p>
              <p>But DPRK moved to stir up trouble.</p>
              <p>This made USA think twice before acting on others.</p>
              <p>I regard this as a positive move.</p>
              <p>Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have been killed since USA invaded it, so whatever calming effect DPRK's confrontation with USA had on its aggressiveness is welcome in my view.</p>

              <p>Honestly, its just nuclear blackmail on the international level.  Kim is just lucky he is geographically located between China and South Korea, a politically sensitive region between US-Sino relations.</p>

              <p>every country has the right to build up its military.Who's military power is best in the world ,it's US.Why ppl don't blame them ,or just get used to it.</p>
              <p>And about the transparency.I think somehow military stuff are confidential.and even tell ,what they build ,and how they spend the money ,it's nothing useful.Tell u china ,us ,and a lot of big country got nuclear warhead .what's use ,u can do anything about it.We should face it,the nuclear weapon is spread in the world.Ppl use that as a deterence ,no one will really use that.</p>
              <p>And look at the history. How many wars in the world involved with us.gulf ,videnam,n.korea.iraq ,arfghanistan.I think china never really want to raise any war.The big thing for china ,is taiwan issue.I cannot see when it can be solved .</p>
              <p>And the real reason ,western country afraid of china is communication barriar.China is not keen to introduce himself to the world.Maybe Olympic is a chance.</p>
              <p>US is the world police, he piss off a lot of country,he do not pay the UN fees.He raise problem in iraq.Some day he will pay for it.Maybe through war,or more possiblity for economic crackdown.</p>

              <p>Deng Xiao Peng:</p>
              <p><em>China is aware of its responsibilities as a permanent member of the
              Security Council of the United Nations. Everyone can trust China in two
              respects. </em></p>
              <p><em><strong>First, China adheres to principles.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>Second, China means what
              it says.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>We do not play political games, nor do we engage in the play
              of words.</em></p>
              <p><em> I personally love to play bridge, but China does not like to
              play political cards. </em></p>
              <p><em>This is not only the case today, but was also the
              case during the period since the founding of the People's Republic in
              1949 when Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai were leading the
              country. </em></p>
              <p><em>This is why so many friends around the world trust us. </em></p>
              <p><em>We
              understand the circumstances in many countries, particularly Third
              World countries. </em></p>
              <p><em>China's foreign policy is consistent and can be summed
              up in three sentences. </em></p>
              <p><em><strong>First, we oppose hegemonism.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong> Second, we
              safeguard world peace.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong> Third, we are eager to strengthen unity and
              cooperation, or what might be termed 'union and cooperation', with
              other Third World countries.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>The reason I lay special emphasis on the
              Third World is that opposition to hegemonism and safeguarding world
              peace are of special significance to the Third World. </em></p>
              <p><em><strong>Who are the
              victims of hegemonism?</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>Is it the United States or the Soviet Union? No,
              it is the United States and the Soviet Union that practise hegemonism,
              so they are not the victims. Neither are developed countries such as
              Japan, Canada, and countries in Europe and Oceania the victims. Eastern
              Europe suffers a little. If world peace is disrupted, who will be the
              first to become victims? Actually, there has been no peace since the
              end of World War II.</em></p>
              <p><em> Although no major wars have been fought, minor
              ones have continued. </em></p>
              <p><em><strong>Where are the minor wars fought? In the Third
              World! </strong></em></p>
              <p><em>It is the superpowers that practise hegemonism and sow discord. </em></p>
              <p><em>They are the ones with their hands in that arena! For many years, the
              superpowers have cashed in on conflicts between Third World countries
              in order to achieve their objectives.</em></p>
              <p><em> Although the Third World itself
              faces various problems, it is the Third World countries and their
              peoples that become the real victims. </em></p>
              <p><em>For this reason it must be the
              Third World that is the genuine and primary force for safeguarding
              world peace and opposing hegemonism, because this concern immediately
              affects Third World countries. This follows necessarily because of the

              <p>USA should fuck off Asia.</p>
              <p>They are the greatest threat to peace now in my view.</p>
              <p>This is clear from the invasion of Iraq.</p>

              <p><br>Did I say China was a threat? I said they are a military challenge.  Do NOT twist my words. It is something I sorely dislike.  A military challenge may not necessarily constitute a "threat."  Just like in SG, we view China's military build up to be a regional security challenge as well, it does NOT mean we view China suspiciously as a threat.</p>
              <p>I did not say US is a the world police either, that was Rokkie.  I do not see US as a world police, but recognize that they play a critical part in ensuring regional stability.  Refer to my previous posts as to why.</p>
              <p>You can oppose US foreign policy all you like, but you are sitting in front of the computer posting anti-US sentiments simply because you are reaping the benefits of US foreign policy.  Where do you think the internet originated from? </p>
              <p>Frankly speaking, I'd rather be under so called US "hegemony" than a Chinese one, if you even know the meaning of this term you've been blatantly throwing about, in the context of international relations.  The US military is not THAT strong to be able coerce everybody in world into submitting to their policies.  The fact that DPRK stands defiant <strong>emphasizes</strong> that.  So is the US truly a global "hegemony" as you claim?  The EU, China, and Russia can easily compete against the US's military strength.  The United States is not able to dominate on a global level against these rising super powers at once is it?</p>
              <p>Without a strong military presence in the pacific, it will be China who MIGHT become the regional hegemony.  With a military rapid building up, and an industrial capability thats attracting low-cost production to China, it will soon be able to impose unfavorable trade arrangements to South East Asia for natural resources.  Asia does not need hegemonies, it needs multilateralism, multiple powers that check each others dominance.</p>
              <p>Despite US's military edge in the region, we haven't been forced or coerced into any unfavorable arrangements have we?  So where's the "hegemony?"</p>

              <p>Rokkie, SG and US are not an alliance, military or political.  Again, check your facts.</p>
              <p>We benefit from mutual cooperation, thats all. NATO is a military alliance that includes US, not Singapore.  Singapore is part of the FPDA which isn't even an alliance, and doesn't include the USA.   So how did we become an "Ally"?</p>
              <p><strong>If</strong> Singapore's economy <strong>depends</strong> on the US, and we <strong>need</strong> coverage from the US, shouldn't the US be in the position to "treat us unfairly" since we "need" them for so many things? But are we?</p>
              <p>So which are the countries that are being "treated unfairly" by the US? Did they Need or Depend on the US for anything?  Or on the other hand, did they antagonize the US by building nuclear arms?</p>
