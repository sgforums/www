              <p>The pioneers of old gave up their safety, their comfort and

                                      make that new world strong and free, an example to the world.</p>
              <p>Some would say that those struggles are all over--that all the
                                      horizons have been explored--that all the battles have been won--
                                      that there is no longer an American frontier.And we stand today on
                                      the edge of a New Frontier , a frontier of unknown opportunities
                                      and perils.</p>
              <p><br> Beyond that frontier are the uncharted areas of science and space,
                                      unsolved problems of peace and war, unconquered pockets of
                                      ignorance and prejudice,I am asking each of you to be pioneers
                                      towards that New Frontier.</p>
              <p>My call is to the young in heart, regardless of age</p>
              <p><br> Can we carry through in an age where we will witness not only new
                                      breakthroughs in weapons of destruction--but also a race for
                                      mastery of the sky and the rain, the ocean and the tides, the far
                                      side of space and the inside of men's minds?</p>
              <p><br> All mankind waits upon our decision. A whole world looks to see
                                      what we will do. And we cannot fail their trust, and we cannot fail

              <p><br>I don't agree US is not hegemon because he did not coerce the world.The world is comprised of many country ,not one country ruled by US.Every country got it's own culture and history ,and they are proud of it. US is a hegemon because,he often treat himself as a super super power,nowadays the international affair is through dialog and discussion,Why US attack Iraq and Afghanstan without concession of UN.</p>
              <p>I listen to US pop music ,and movie.I respect him,but i don't get used to his over estimation for himself.</p>

              <p>how about other country's interest,just like in the gang movie ,the boss don't like someone else ,and decide to beat him up,u think that's a bully or just because is good for the boss' interest,u think it's fair.I think most country of the world don't like US.Look at the western country ,only england align with him,because they are the big brother and family  member of US.France ,german, all get their own interest.Most of the muslim world don't welcome US.When bush go there ,there are always a lot of protestants.</p>
              <p>World is becoming multipolarity,US always want to act like a boss ,and guarranty his boss status.But that's definitely will change,some one predict that US economy will defer in the future.Because their economy has saturated,u don't see any new increasing point.And the rest of the world is catching up,through reformation and build ,modern economy model.</p>

              <p>CFR can be considered to reflect the views of the political elite in the USA.</p>
              <p>It was originally set up to coordinate policies with its british counterpart, the RIIA.</p>
              <p><em>Chatham House had close institutional relations with a number of other
                  similar organizations, especially in the Dominions. </em></p>
              <p><em> It also has a
                  parallel organization, which was regarded as a branch, in New
                  York.  </em></p>
              <p><em><strong>This latter, the Council on Foreign Relations, was not
                  founded by the American group that attended the meeting at the Hotel
                  Majestic in 1919, but was taken over almost entirely by that group
                  immediately after its founding in 1919.</strong>  </em></p>
              <p><em>This group was made up of
                  the experts on the American delegation to the Peace Conference who were
                  most closely associated with J.P. Morgan and Company. </em></p>
              <p><em> The Morgan
                  bank has never made any real effort to conceal its position in regard
                  to the Council on Foreign Relations.  The list of officers and
                  board of directors are printed in every issue of </em><em>Foreign Affairs
                  and have always been loaded with partners, associates, and employees of
                  J.P. Morgan and Company.  </em></p>
              <p><em><strong>According to Stephen King-Hall, the RIIA
                  agreed to regard the Council on Foreign Relations as its American
                  branch.  </strong>The relationship between the two has always been very
                  close.  For example, the publications of one are available at
                  reduced prices to the members of the other;  they frequently sent
                  gifts of books to each other (the Council, for example, giving the
                  Institute a seventy-five-volume set of the </em><em>Foreign Relations of the United States
                  in 1933);  and there is considerable personal contact between the
                  officers of the two (Toynbee, for example, left the manuscript of
                  Volumes 7-9 of </em><em>A Study of History in the Council's vault during the recent war)...</em></p>

              <p>Well, your friend's definition of the Taliban is somewhat twisted.  A lot of people have trouble understanding what the Taliban really is. </p>
              <p>The Taliban Regime, was the de-facto government of Afghanistan until the US led invasion.  Think of it sort of like the Nazi party.  It was a ideologically motivated movement, that become a regime after becoming the dominant power.</p>
              <p>The US attacked the Taliban when it refused to hand over Osama Bin Laden after the events of September 11th.  The Taliban openly challenged the US to bring evidence that the Osama was responsible for the events of September 11th  or they would not hand over Osama Bin Laden.</p>
              <p>During their government, the Taliban frustrated UN aid and NGOs efforts in providing relief to the Afghan people.</p>
              <p>They were responsible for ethnic massacres of Shia tribes.</p>
              <p>If you ask me, I'd say the Afghans are definitely happier now.  At least they don't get killed for being a Shia.</p>
