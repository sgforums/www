              4,500 by 2012, according to the article US Nuclear Forces, 2008
              published on Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists March/April, 2008.<br><br>From
              10,000 to 5,400, the reduction seems very significant. The National
              Nuclear Security Administration thus claimed this sent a signal to the
              world that the U.S. government has been committed to reduction of the
              nuclear weapon stockpile.<br><br>But what are behind the beautiful
              figures? Let us see what had been reduced and what are still remain in
              the US nuclear weapon arsenal. Most of the 5,000 warheads removed from
              its arsenal just underwent a change of status...</span></em></p>

              <p>If you see the situation from a broader perspective, you can see some positive effects of DPRK's behaviour over the years.</p>
              <p>USA was getting cocky after its victory in Iraq in 2003 and ready to smash more countries.</p>
              <p>But DPRK moved to stir up trouble.</p>
              <p>This made USA think twice before acting on others.</p>
              <p>I regard this as a positive move.</p>
              <p>Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have been killed since USA invaded it, so whatever calming effect DPRK's confrontation with USA had on its aggressiveness is welcome in my view.</p>
