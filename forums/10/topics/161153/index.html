Vote: (1/2/3)<br><br>(PGPI-7) Has the government demonstrated leadeship qualities such as the following:-i<br><br>(1) Passion,<br>(2) Ability to Motivate followers,<br>(3) Ability to get people to work with coordination and apply knowledge.<br>(4) Ability to Translate goals and objectives into implementation processes to accomplish goals e.g. bring about competitiveness, technology start-ups and jobs etc.<br>(5) Invest monies and perform tasks with Accountability and Transparency<br>(6) Collective leadership by core team to make major decisions,<br>Vote: (1/2/3)<br><br>(PGPI-8 ) Has the government made adequate efforts to lower its costs of essential government services e.g. medical, utilities, housing, transportation, education, etc, etc Vote: (1/2/3)<br><br>(POPI-9) Have government succeeded in efficiently executed major projects e.g. MRTs, infrastructureal developments, Growth Triangle, IR within cost/time targets.<br><br>(PGPI-10) Is there any significant relaxation of controls over the intellectual space ?<br><br>(PGPI-11) Are there sufficient and effective implementation of safe Work site practices after the previous major safety accidents e.g. Hotel New World collapse, Nicol Highway Collapse ?<br><br>(PGPI-12) Has government delivered the promised Swiss standard of living?<br><br>(PGPI-13) Has government succeeded in its widely publicised "Asset enhancement scheme"?<br><br>(PGPI-14) Has government succeeded in getting citizens to invest in Unit trust investment?<br><br>(PGPI-15) Has government maintained a desirable strategic Foreign relation consistent with its overall interest in a hostile environment for matured and balanced national wellbeing and security e.g. based on people-to-people relation and social and cultural mutual respect.<br><br>(PGPI-16) Has the government succeeded in its economic restructuring to a knowledge-based value-adding technology-driven model?<br><br>(PGPI-17) Has government while seeking to avoid welfarism gone to the other extreme with its tax-and-recover-all-cost-up-to-market-value high-cost policies e.g. Double-charging on lands (paid for by taxes) or triple charges on vehicles (retaining excise duty, after COE and ERP)<br><br>(PGPI-18 ) Has the Meritocratic education policy over-emphasised on the education of elites while neglecting development of broad-based practical education and practical knowledge application and entrepreneurship.<br><br>(PGPI-19) Is the government on the way to realizing its vision of Reaching World Cup soccer league within the 2010 deadline?<br><br>(PGPI-20) Has government succeeded in preserving the values or growth of the citizens' retirements through the CPF scheme?<br><br>(PGPI-21) Has government become obsessed with paying the highest salaries to its own number while neglecting nurturing integrity, honesty, values, humility, accountability?<br><br>(PGPI-22) Is there sufficient accountability and transparency in respect of investments of citizens' monies in overseas investments.<br><br>(PGPI-23) Has the government succeeded in improving the standards of living of its citizens as a result of wage-restructuring for its public sector introduced under the Goh Keng Swee Doctrine?<br><br>(PGPI-24) Has the government taken sufficient steps to nurture the domestic sector of economy while promoting foreign talents and investments.<br><br>Is a system of benchmarking the minister's salaries to the highest paid bosses or CEOs in the private sector based on apple-to-apple comparison?<br><br>(PGPI-25) Has government's entry into business brought about greater economic competitiveness, vibrancy or entrepreneurship to the economy?<br><br>(PGPI-26) Is there any sincerity or progress in building a more cosmopolitan and inclusive society?<br><br>NOTE: On 12.11.2005 Today's Newspaper carried an article on page 6: "New "Satisfaction";; Index for service which states:<br><br>"A BENCHMARK to evaluate service standards in the retail and F&amp;B sectors will be established by the end of next year.<br><br>The Workforce Development Agency says it will call for proposals on the national service indicator by next month..."<br><br>It looks like WDA has still not yet put up a more neutral and objective government performance index despite the past publications of presumed performance indices.</div>

If hands are up, yes one may get sued or ISD but that will depend on how one puts up the hands. I think we can do it like Gandhi; do not threaten but say ..sir I think what you do is not so right, can you please try another way...<br><br>If hands are down, still we will get suing and ISD not immediately but more in the future. Remember Rummel's Law which says that a government tends to murder its people offering the least resistance to its actions.<br><br>Then forever more suing and more ISD for every slightest hand-up. Good government does not drop from heaven. It is fought for by the people with sweats and sacrifice - but today do we have people with hands up ? So hands up say please.</div>

We can examine here why and where it has gone wrong.<br><br>So there is no end to your calling people anti-government to arouse more antagonism. Government are servants of the people and must always be above board and serve them as customers and answerable to all shortcomings and people's grouses right or wrong.<br><br>Just look at the facts about Singapore society today. Has government tried to serve the people and improve its service quality?  If it does not and always tries to deny them their views and suggestions, then perpetually there will be problems and distrusts. So far the fundamental problems are still not recognized by the government.<br><br>If you are in the top 10% you are doing fine and will find the system supportive of whatever you are doing. But I am asking you to look at the overall picture not just from the top 10% or the government perspective.</div>

I am not anti-government but I am definitely pro-Singapore. The rest I leave it to facts as posted.

I criticize many government policies (anyone can search and read my postings) but I also disagree with Robert on some issues. I agree with him about the government's double charging but I disagree with him about the dangers of racism and the sedition laws.<br><br>I think what Salman means is that we ought to be cautious if someone agrees or disagrees with us completely. Similarly someone who completely agrees or disagrees with the government is likely to be biased one way or the other. Even spouses disagree on politics.<br><br>Put forth your arguments though...that's the purpose of this forum, isn't it?</div>
