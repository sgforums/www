Do I want that? No because their investments, salaries and losses are getting bigger than the returns and though I'm called a "shareholder" (actually a very small one), I get only pathetic goodies but I get to foot their pay and losses and they enjoy it (and  never suffer losses for their blunders). In the long run, it's pretty clear who will sure to be well-off and who's not. I want a government that makes my money work hard for me and earn me a decent return. I don't want a government that makes me work hard to pay them and don't earn me good returns but losses.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>
