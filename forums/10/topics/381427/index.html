              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Wednesday, 29 October 2008, 10:37 am | 3,149 views </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Gerald Giam / Senior Writer</span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I happened to sit next to an older relative at a wedding dinner recently, when our conversation turned to politics.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span lang="EN-GB"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span lang="EN-GB">My relative wondered why I had not followed my parents to </span><span lang="EN-GB">Australia</span><span lang="EN-GB">, and mused that he was considering moving there too. When I asked why, he cited the fear of political instability in </span><span lang="EN-GB">Singapore</span><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span lang="EN-GB">That remark surprised me since </span><span lang="EN-GB">Singapore</span><span lang="EN-GB"> is seen by many to be one of the most politically stable countries in </span><span lang="EN-GB">Asia</span><span lang="EN-GB">. We have had no change of government – violent or otherwise – since 1959.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span lang="EN-GB">When probed further, my uncle said he feared the opposition taking over in a freak election. I assured him that given the current state of the opposition, the PAP government will not be under any threat of losing an election within his lifetime. More importantly, I told him I trust </span><span lang="EN-GB">Singapore</span><span lang="EN-GB"> voters to be wise enough not to vote a lousy party into power.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">He countered by pointing out that even when the opposition had fielded “criminals” and slipper-wearing candidates, they were still able to garner 20 to 30% of the vote.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span lang="EN-GB"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I explained, from my limited knowledge of electoral sociology, that in every election, there will be at least 20% of voters who are hardcore oppositionists and will vote for anyone who ran against the ruling party candidate. In Sembawang GRC where I live, 23% still voted for the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) team <em>sans</em> party chief Chee Soon Juan, even though it was running against a relatively strong PAP team helmed by the likable and Chinese-speaking Health Minister, Khaw Boon Wan. That was the largest margin of victory for the PAP in that election.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span lang="EN-GB"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span lang="EN-GB">However the gulf between 23% and 50% — the latter being the percentage necessary to win a seat outright — is huge. Even in the most closely contested constituency of Aljunied GRC in the 2006 General Election, the PAP’s 55% win against the Workers’ Party would be considered a landslide in most other democracies. Consider the </span><span lang="EN-GB">UK</span><span lang="EN-GB">’s Labour Party, which won the 2005 election with just 35% of the popular vote. Put in this perspective, the PAP’s 66.6% overall percentage in 2006 was a blowout victory.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span lang="EN-GB">My uncle admires the PAP for what they have achieved, not just for </span></strong><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Singapore</span></strong><strong><span lang="EN-GB">, but for him personally. Growing up in a one-room flat, and now living in a private apartment, he has seen a dramatic improvement in his standard of living over the past 40 years. He reserved stinging criticism for some of his peers who “live in bungalows” and are still so ungrateful as to grumble about the government.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span lang="EN-GB">I cautioned him that past performance is no guarantee of future success, as investors always say.</span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"> <strong>Just because the PAP has governed well in the past, does not mean that it will continue to do so for eternity. My uncle agreed that no country has had a particular party govern forever.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong></strong></span><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span lang="EN-GB">In the short term however, he was supremely confident that the PAP’s recruitment process will ensure that only top-notch candidates are presented in each election. In contrast, he said, the opposition was happy to take anyone who had a degree and was willing to pay the election deposit, even if they had no “track record”.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span lang="EN-GB">“What is your definition of a track record?” I asked him. Many of the new PAP MPs don’t exactly have a very long resume either. Nevertheless, he was sure that with the many interviews they had undergone with party leaders, coupled with the background checks, PAP candidates would definitely meet the necessary criteria for political leadership.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span lang="EN-GB">I asked him if he would consider voting for a non-PAP candidate if he or she were more “qualified” than the PAP candidate.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span lang="EN-GB">After initially saying he would, he later reasoned that it would be impossible for an opposition candidate to be as qualified as his PAP opponent. Firstly, the PAP’s recruitment process would throw up only the best men in the country. Secondly, anyone worth their salt, who genuinely desired to serve the people and make </span></span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span lang="EN-GB">Singapore</span></span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span lang="EN-GB"> a better place would join the PAP instead of the opposition.</span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span lang="EN-GB">He was of the view that a capable person would be “out of his mind” to join the opposition, and that people who joined the opposition did so only out of self-interest or ulterior motives. Why else would someone want to oppose such an “excellent” government? Apparently, joining the opposition in and of itself indicated a character flaw.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span lang="EN-GB">He dismissed the possibility that some principled individuals joined the opposition because they could not see themselves joining the PAP due to fundamental disagreements with the latter’s style of governance. He also did not see the price many opposition members paid for their political beliefs as worthy of much respect.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our heated discussion went on and on. In the end it was time to go home and we had to agree to disagree.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span lang="EN-GB"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What the opposition fails to see</span></span></strong></p>

              why bother with the election as some forumers here admit that Singapore is not and wish not to be acknowledge as a democratic country you should do well without general election.
              The general election is  a tool to legitimize those already in rule and to masquerade Singapore as a democratic country which it obviously NOT.
