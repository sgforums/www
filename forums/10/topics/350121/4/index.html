              <p>An explanation, but not enough clarity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>100 million shares exists.</p>
              <p>Only 10 million shares changed hand, at 10cts per share. The highest price rose to was $1.00.</p>
              <p>The owners, eg ABC, of these 10 million shares quickly sold it at $1 per share.</p>
              <p>Immediately the new owners, eg DEF, of these 10million shares saw the price drop to 10cts. They lost 90cts to a share IF THEY SELL now.</p>
              <p>Q: Where did the 90cts per share went?</p>
              <p>Ans: It went to ABC when they BOUGHT from ABC. Money 'dont disappear'. It goes into someone else pocket WHEN a transaction occurs. Is this so hard to understand?</p>
              <p>Q2: What about the other 90 million share?</p>
              <p>Ans: It was'nt sold. There was NO transaction. It's value is 10cts now. It's in the 'asset value' range now and use for record purpose, such as balance sheets or collateral for loans.</p>
              <p>Q3. How can a share that rose to $1 from 10cts drop down back to 10cts?</p>
              <p>Ans: TRANSACTIONS. BUY &amp; SELLING of stocks. Heavy buying or selling cause the VALUE to rise or fall. Stocks prices DON'T JUST rise or fall on their own MAGICALLY OR  AT THE SNAP OF FINGERS.</p>

              <p>let me try.</p>
              <p>firstly i want to clarify that i am talking about fixed income instruments with coupons, ie treasury notes and bonds. treasury bills have tenures less than 1 year and therefore usually do not pay a coupon. it is this coupon payments that will affect the value of the bond.</p>
              <p>a bond is valued by 1) the present value of the future maturity amount + 2) the present value of the coupons.</p>
              <p>lets take a 10 year $1000000 bond yielding 5% when interest rates are 5% ( this means the bond is selling at par). this bond pays interest annually.</p>
              <p>the present value of the bond when interest rates are 5% is =</p>
              <p>5000 (1- (1.05)^ -10)              100000</p>
              <p>________________      +     ________             (divided by)</p>
              <p>           .05                               (1.05)^10</p>
              <p>= 38608.675 ( present value of future coupons) + 61391.325 (present value of maturity amount)</p>
              <p>= $100000</p>
              <p>Now lets take this same 10 year $100000 bond yielding 5% when interest rates are 1%. this bond also pays interest annually.</p>
              <p>the present value of the bond when interest rates are 1% is =</p>
              <p>5000 ( 1 - ( 1.01)^-10)         100000</p>
              <p>________________      +   ______             (divided by)</p>
              <p>           .01                            (1.01)^10</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>= 47356.523 (present value of future coupons) + 90528.695 (present value of maturity amount)</p>
              <p>= $137885.219</p>
              <p>So we can see from this simple exercise that when interest rates are lower, bonds that have a higher interest rate than that of the current interest rates would sell at a premium, rather than a discount.</p>
              <p>of course there are other issues that come into the pricing, including but not limited to, the duration, convexity, effect of time on a bond's price, as well as market supply and demand. what i am trying to show you is purely the academic way of calculation.</p>

              <p><br>Have to take time to digest this ... But as I said earlier ... I am referring to T Bills ..</p>
              <p>But its still correct that China will not want their money to appreciate as it lessen their returns when changed back their investments to yuan . </p>
              <p>To bonds , even if they are selling at a higher price US based price , their returns will be lower when yuan appreciate. </p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 1:</span></p>
              <p>When one pledges the shares as collateral for loan, eg

              <p> </p>
              <p>Ans: Hirer has it.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>When shares are pledges as COLLATERAL, and hirer defaults, WHO
              OWNS the COLLATERAL and is responsible for it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ans: The sucker - BANK.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 3:</span></p>
              <p>Did money 'disappeared'?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ans: It sure disappeared! From the bank, but only to the
              defaulting hirer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Question 4:</p>
              <p>Why does the central bank needs to pump 'liquidity' into the
              bank for the 'presumed loss'?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ans: Because the sucker bank had not SOLD the worthless share,
              it still has a 'book value' of $1.7M to it. And at the
              end of the day, when the accounts must be balance as per 'mark to
              market' value, it shows $1.7M 'loss', so Central. Bank injects
              $$ to make up for the short fall.</p>
              <p>The bank shouid sell the damn share and accept the loss, which
              they don't, and thus bankers go on their knees and beg
              for bailout funds, hoping the stock market will shot up
              again. Who pays for the bailout funds? Dumb taxpayers, caused
              banks dont wanna accept their losses and stop funding stockmarket
              operations(casino) </p>
              <p>Told yer stock market is a casino dump, and dumber folks still
               accepts stock market 'value' in this current day and age.
              They better raise capital thru other means. Go for long term true
              investments and live on dividends by all means. But if you are the
              kind that watches the stock movement day by day, hell, you are a
              gambler.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Spare the goobletalk and cut straight to the clarified point
              please. The only 'virtual' money there is are hell notes and linden
              notes from 2nd life.com ( but even that has a value - make an
              internet transfer of $1000 real money to buy eg a virtual
              property there, and when you go to the bank in the real world to
              draw money, your bank account is lighter by $1000 'rea;' money
              - the money went into the pockets of 2nd life site

              <p class="textBodyBlack">Congressmen criticized the generosity of the bailout for counterparties, and one lawmaker said AIG had to be bailed out because otherwise it was "going to bring down Europe."</p>

              <p>Nationalizing banks or insurers is, for me, just a catch phrase which is nothing more than a bailout. After all, did Gordon Brown not say the UK government's stake in RBS was just a temporary measure - which is widely regarded as nationalization in the UK - with the ultimate aim of restoring ownership in private hands when the recession is over?</p>
              <p>Fact of the matter is, the argument can take both ways. If you let AIG fail, the short-term ramifications on financial markets and the insurance conglomerates will be disastrous, not to mention the inevitable calamity awaiting millions worldwide with direct exposure to such firms. The knock-on here will have major macro- and microeconomic impact that could potentially hurt the US and global economies even further.</p>
              <p>However, if that's good enough reason to bail out such firms, where will this end? Will there come a day when the US government will need to bail out McDonald's and Coca-Cola with taxpayers' money too?</p>
              <p>I certainly don't think the US government is trying to prop up the credits market - ask anyone in the industry and they'd tell you it's not likely things will go back to what it once were even when a recovery eventually comes along.</p>
              <p>CDS, just like any other financial instruments, are reflective of market sentiments and the large spreads you have witnessed lately is indicative of the turbulent times you live in - no government in the world (just as how Central Banks worldwide have not been able to do much to restore liquidity to their financial systems) would be foolish enough to think they could actually do much to prop up the markets by targetting CDS alone.</p>
              <p>Personally, having traded credit products in the past, I'm glad I'm no longer in this business now given the environment we are in...</p>

              <p>Last week, the Business Times ran an article justifying the fight to keep AIG private by stating the interests of the numerous insurance policy holders and the combined amount of money in these funds. Can't remember the exact number but I think the amount nears something like US$9.6 trillion dollars.</p>
              <p>I am wondering however, would these interests be compromised even if AIG was nationalised? Is this really the issue at hand? Or is it the credit default swaps market the government is trying to prop up while trying their best to keep low?</p>

              <p><br>I think the issue would be that if AIG was nationalised tax payers' money would have to be used to pay those 9.6 trillion dollars. A lot of those policy holders aren't even American.</p>
              <p>So potentially if AIG is nationalised, Americans tax money would also have to pay for the insurance for these foreign policy holders as well.</p>
              <p>I'm thinking that's the scenario they want to avoid.</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unless of course they print US$ to pay the 9.6 trillion dollars... sure American tax payers pay but so does the rest of the world, considering how big the external debt is.</span></p>
