              <p class="textBodyBlack"><strong>American International Group</strong> should be allowed to go bankrupt because keeping it and other sick financials alive on government support risks ruining the US economy, legendary investor Jim Rogers told CNBC Tuesday.</p>

              , whose $61.66 billion fourth-quarter loss was the largest ever for a US company, received $30 billion more in government funds Monday. The insurer's financial health hasn't improved despite getting as much as $150 billion from the government last year.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">"Suppose AIG goes bankrupt, it is better that AIG goes bankrupt and we have a horrible two or three years than that the whole US goes bankrupt," Rogers said. "AIG has trillions of dollars of obligations, let them fail, let the courts sort it out and start over. Otherwise we'll never start over."</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">On Monday, <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/id/29465061/"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">CEO Edward Liddy told CNBC</span></span></strong></a> that the insurer is far more stable and secure than it was last fall but acknowledged that it was "difficult to say" if AIG will need even more money from the government in the future.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack"> </p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Bailing out the banks is going to increase the debt spiral and finally cause the destruction of the world's biggest economy, Rogers said.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">"I think it's astonishing, they're ruining the US economy, they're ruining the US government, they're ruining the US central bank and they're ruining the US dollar," he said.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">"You are watching something in front of our eyes, very historically, which is basically the destruction of New York as a financial center and the destruction of America as the world's most powerful country."</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Japan's economic "lost decade" was caused by trying to bail out the banks, and the West risks running out of money if it doesn't let the bad banks fail now, Rogers warned.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Systemic risk is going to be the same in 10 months, 5 years of 10 years if the fundamental problem is not solved, he added.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">"The idea that you have too much debt, too much borrowing and too much consumption and you're going to solve that problem with more debt, more consumption and more borrowing? These people are nuts."</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Wall Street and the City of London are going to be "disastrous" for years, like in the 1950s and 1960s, and in 30 years, finance will "dry up and wither away" as we are entering a "long period of hard times," he said.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">"Power is shifting now from the money shifters, the guys who trade paper and money, to people who produce real goods. What you should do is become a farmer, or start a farming network," Rogers said.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack"> </p>

              <h1>Govt moves to aid AIG yet again; when will it end?</h1>
              <p><cite class="vcard">By JEANNINE AVERSA and IEVA M. AUGSTUMS, AP Business Writers                    <span class="fn org">Jeannine Aversa And Ieva M. Augstums, Ap Business Writers</span> </cite> <abbr class="timedate" title="2009-03-02T15:39:19-0800">Mon Mar 2, 6:39 pm ET</abbr></p>
              <p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090302/ap_on_bi_ge/aig_rescue/print">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090302/ap_on_bi_ge/aig_rescue/print</a></p>
              <p>WASHINGTON – A new definition of desperate times: Even as the government threw a stunning new $30 billion lifeline to <span id="lw_1236041215_0" class="yshortcuts">American International Group</span> on Monday, the beleaguered insurance giant confirmed it had lost more
              than twice that much, $62 billion, in a single three-month period.</p>
              <p>And
              many more billions of federal dollars are almost sure to be shoveled
              into the company for a simple reason: Officials fear its collapse would
              cripple financial markets in the U.S. and around the world.</p>
              <p>The
              source of trouble for AIG, which has 74 million customers worldwide and
              operations in more than 130 countries, is its business insuring
              mortgage-backed securities and other debt against default. That
              business imploded once the credit crisis struck with force.</p>
              <p>The government has now made four separate efforts to save the company, totaling more than $170 billion.</p>
              <p>AIG
              is so big and sprawling, so intertwined with institutions around the
              globe, that its downfall could set off a vicious chain reaction.
              Upheaval on such a global scale would plunge the U.S. economy deeper
              into recession, drive up unemployment and stifle hopes for an economic
              rebound any time soon.</p>
              <p>The company
              provides life, property and other insurance offerings, with 30 million
              policyholders in the United States alone. It also provides
              asset-management services and airplane leases.</p>
              <p>Its <span id="lw_1236041215_1" class="yshortcuts">International Lease Finance Corp</span>.,
              which leases jets to airlines, has been up for sale and was thought to
              be one of the insurer's jewels. But falling travel demand has forced
              airlines to shrink fleets.</p>
              <p>AIG's businesses also are linked to mutual funds, annuities and other retirement products held by many Americans.</p>
              <p>"Given the <span id="lw_1236041215_2" class="yshortcuts">systemic risk</span> AIG continues to pose and the fragility of markets today, the potential
              cost to the economy and the taxpayer of government inaction would be
              extremely high," the <span id="lw_1236041215_3" class="yshortcuts">Treasury Department</span> and the <span id="lw_1236041215_4" class="yshortcuts">Federal Reserve</span> said in a joint statement Monday.</p>
              <p>Turning
              AIG into a smaller, more viable company, "will take time and possibly
              further government support," the Treasury and the Fed acknowledged.</p>
              <p>Indeed,
              many analysts say the United States will eventually be forced to funnel
              billions more into the company, which the government seized control of
              last year. And they say AIG has become a seemingly bottomless money pit
              that poses a cautionary tale about the effectiveness of U.S. bailouts.</p>
              <p>Mark Williams, professor of finance and economics at <span id="lw_1236041215_5" class="yshortcuts">Boston University</span> and a former <span id="lw_1236041215_6" class="yshortcuts">Federal Reserve bank examiner</span>, said he thinks at least $200 billion more will have to be extended to AIG.</p>
              <p>"AIG
              is holding the U.S. government hostage at gunpoint," Williams said.
              "The government can't cut its losses because it is too far into AIG. It
              has no choice but to keep on pumping money into the company."</p>
              <p>Said Terry Connelly, dean of Golden Gate University's Ageno School of Business in <span id="lw_1236041215_7" class="yshortcuts">San Francisco</span>:
              "If AIG fails, the taxpayer wearing his or her other hats — the worker,
              the student loan payer, the car buyer, the homeowner — will suffer even
              more."</p>
              <p>"What's going on now is the
              government is shifting from a tough-love lender to a little more
              friendly equity investor," Connelly said.</p>
              <p>At
              the White House, press secretary Robert Gibbs said, "We're focused on
              taking the steps necessary to restructure AIG so that it, in the long
              run, no longer poses the type of systemic threat that it poses right
              now."</p>
              <p>Under the <span id="lw_1236041215_8" class="yshortcuts">new deal</span>,
              the government revamped its rescue package, saying it will give AIG an
              additional $30 billion money on an "as needed" basis. AIG's bailout now
              totals around $173 billion.</p>
              <p>The
              American public already is angry about using taxpayer money to bankroll
              a string of big financial company bailouts — including <span id="lw_1236041215_9" class="yshortcuts">Citigroup</span>, <span id="lw_1236041215_10" class="yshortcuts">Bank of America</span> and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p>
              <p>Lawmakers also have expressed skepticism over the rescue strategies of the new Obama administration.</p>
              <p>"There are still too many unanswered questions about how AIG spent"
              some of the rescue money the government has already put up, said <span id="lw_1236041215_11" class="yshortcuts">Rep. Elijah Cummings</span>, D-Md., a member of the <span id="lw_1236041215_12" class="yshortcuts">House Committee</span> on Oversight and Government Reform.</p>
              <p>Doubting investors have cut the company's share price to 45 cents.</p>
              <p>Among its biggest problems: It can't find buyers for pieces of its company — such as Asia-based <span id="lw_1236041215_13" class="yshortcuts">American International Assurance Co</span>. and <span id="lw_1236041215_14" class="yshortcuts">American Life Insurance Co</span>.,
              which operates in 50 countries — that it hoped to sell to repay the
              government. As of Feb. 13, AIG had sold interests in nine businesses.</p>
              <p>The additional $30 billion credit line AIG received Monday will come from the government's $700 billion financial bailout pot.</p>
              <p>In an interview on NBC's "Today" show, AIG Chairman and Chief
              Executive Edward Liddy said: "The new $30 billion is a standby line.
              It's not necessarily something that we think we'll have to draw on
              right away."</p>
              <p>But Liddy, who joined AIG after its initial bailout and is
              being paid an annual salary of $1, backed off earlier statements about
              paying back taxpayers in full within two years.</p>
              <p>The government announcement came as AIG, once the world's
              largest insurer, reported it lost $61.7 billion in the fourth quarter
              of last year, the biggest quarterly loss in U.S. corporate history.</p>
              <p>The revamped package also reduces interest payments AIG has to
              pay on government loans. The Treasury will exchange its existing $40
              billion in AIG stock for <span id="lw_1236041215_15" class="yshortcuts">preferred shares</span> with revised terms that more closely resemble common equity.</p>

              <p>1How many hundreds of million of people with policies would be directly affected by having their policies terminated and money absolutely gone?</p>
              <p>2.How many insurance agents and staff would become jobless?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps Jim Rogers was correct? Is it worth saving AIG, compared to the billion other companies and people who could make better use of bail out funds?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AIG's funds are actually depositors money from which it is used to play the stock markets and derivaties in order to pay off the high interests and returns for policies bought.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The stock market is close to dead. AIG's invested policy holder's fund may now be close to nothing. Which was why it need taxpayers' bailout fund, to pay off policies holders whose insurance policy had matured.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think of the hundreds of millions who bought policies. Would the bailout funds be enough to pay off even the annual obligations of matured policies?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At least banks don't have maturity dates on deposits, and even if they do, are generally smaller in interest returns than AIG or insurance companies. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Saving banks is ok. There are hardly bank runs. But AIG is not a bank. It is worse. It has to automatically pay out on its maturity of policies or accidents. Can US taxpayer continue on paying indefinately? Or tell AIG customers sorry, the way they had told Lehman Brothers' customers sorry?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm with Jim Rogers on this.    </p>

              <p><br>I am refering to coupons ... so its T Bills ..</p>
              <p>In in the nutshell, my point is that its not in china favour for yuan to appreciate against USD but not for the reason Mr Andrew said as that is a unlikely possibility.</p>
