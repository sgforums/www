              <p>Jim Rogers is right and I agree with him <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">BUT</span></strong> it is too late for the U.S. Government to stop bailing this insurer out halfway. Remember that they have injected over $100,000,000,000 into that company so far. Giving up on AIG means that $100,000,000,000 will be immediately wiped out. What could Obama explain to the American people? A more severe crisis of confidence will follow and chaos will spread even further.</p>

              <p>Lehmann Brothers was allowed to go bankrupt, causing millions (or probably billions) lost. You can also go imagine up a lot of scenarios on how many will get affected as well.</p>

              <p>i don't quite agree.</p>
              <p>one of the factors governing the price of a T-bill or any plain vanilla fixed income instrument is the promised yield attached to the bond. assuming that china purchased their bonds over the past few years, they could very well offload their bonds now at a premium rather than at a discount, simply because of current interest rates.</p>
              <p>and i'm under the impression that china keeps its currency low because of its export status, especially to the US.</p>

              Government to stop bailing this insurer out halfway. Remember that
              they have injected over $100,000,000,000 into that company so far.
              Giving up on AIG means that $100,000,000,000 will be immediately
              wiped out. What could Obama explain to the American people? A more

              <p>one of the factors governing the price of a T-bill or any plain

              <p>It does not make any sense to throw good money after bad, especially the technically bankrupt AIG, of course.</p>
              <p>I believe both Bush and now Obama might have wanted to nationalize AIG so bad but he is facing political challenges:</p>
              <p>1. America's standpoint is always free market and liberalization. Nationalization would badly harm its stature as the world centre of capitalism. But I don't think they can avoid it in the end.</p>
              <p>2. Taxpayers' money are at stake here.</p>
              <p>3. The stock markets will be badly battered, affecting the wealth of the American people in turn.</p>

              <p><br>I think this was discussed about during an interview regarding why England isn't nationalizing all its banks despite the stituation.</p>
              <p>The problem is the government are fully aware of how badly the insitutions are doing, if they chose to nationalize them the government would have to assume responsibility for the bad debts and toxic assets as well.</p>
              <p>The blackhole is so immense it would effectively bankrupt the country to pay it.</p>

              <p>Banks can be nationalized, simply because no sane person will want to withdraw their entire deposits. Where will they keep it where it can be safe?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With a democratic govt's guarantee on deposits, there is no fear that the govt cant pay depositors even if every wants back their money, simply because govt owns real resources - minerals and agriculture, which are necessary for humanity to survive and must pay for it, therefore as long as a country has resources,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>( or a non-resource country has collateral in the resource rich country ), money will always grow. $1 today to $100 tomorrow when more resources are dug out or produced for survival.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AIG or insurance companies MUST NOT be nationalized. They are nothing more than ponzi schemes where the bottom pays for the top with a pool of money, which is 'invested' (gambled) in the stock market (high class casino), to generate money to pay off depositors, as well as insurance claims.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think - buy a policy at $100 a month, but if an accident occurs the next month, your next of kin gets $1,000,000 in insurance claims. Where did the $999,900 came from?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ans: Policy holders pool of funds, new entrants who buy policy, and invested ( gambled) money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Banks do not payout $1,000,000 or hold any insurance claims, but insurance companies do. If nationalized, it may mean taxpayers will be paying for the claims. The AIG directors are probably laffing away after pocketing the policy holder's money, as well as other companies who benefited from AIG losses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Money do not disappear. It ALWAYS ends up in someone else's pocket. US taxpayers will be the suckers if AIG is nationalized.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>John Keynes did not say prop up failed companies, rather instead, govt spending to assist in the circulation of money to create further money. Giving to AIG is no keynesian theory, perhaps an Obama or Wall street theory.</p>

              <p>Financial stores of wealth do not correspond to physical caches of wealth in the same sense as a squirrel's cache of nuts. If I retire when I am sixty-five years old and expect to live for another twenty years off of my 'savings', there are no warehouses under lock and key filled with food, clothing, and fuel dedicated to my exclusive future use. If I go on eating, wearing clothes, and staying warm at night, it is because men and women get out their beds every morning and go to work and produce economic output, part of which they give to me.</p>
              <p>One person's savings is another person's consumption. While I am working I am effectively supporting the people who are not working, and when I retire (should such a day ever come) the people who are still working will, in turn, support me. Mutual support in complex economies is an objective physical reality which can be understood independent of any particular political ideology. Apart from some necessary amount of inventory real physical savings are in the built up infrastructure of society (in which I include the knowledge and skill of the men and women who are that societies brains and hands) and the resource base which supports that infrastructure. Since we build infrastructure in order to use it, the desire to store up value is really a desire to produce and sell as much stuff as we can in the present. When people are in the stores buying home theater systems, laptop computers, MP3 players, etc. then our 401K funds and pension funds are happy.</p>
              <p>This fundamental structural contradiction of our economic system, in which greater current resource consumption is made to appear as if it will result in greater future security, needs to be fixed. Financial/monetary reform alone is not an adequate solution to this problem. We need to make the objective fact of mutual support manifest in the daily operation of our economic system. Your suggestion of a plan to provide basic goods and services in the event of an economic crisis is a step in this direction but does not really address the long term functioning of a steady state economy. In a world in which constant productivity increases are no longer possible we can no longer count on Adam Smith's cooperation of greed.</p>

              <p>I believe it explains the problem more accurately then i ever could. Our current economic growth and supposedly prosperity is actually quite paper thin if 2 factors are affected - high population growth and cheap energy.</p>

              <p>AIG or insurance companies MUST NOT be nationalized. They are nothing more than ponzi schemes where the bottom pays for the top with a pool of money, which is 'invested' (gambled) in the stock market (high class casino), to generate money to pay off depositors, as well as insurance claims.</p>
              <p> Think - buy a policy at $100 a month, but if an accident occurs the next month, your next of kin gets $1,000,000 in insurance claims. Where did the $999,900 came from?</p>

              <p>To me insurance is like 4D. U can ask someone buy 4D for a few dollars but if they win they end up with thousands. How it works is the probability of u getting an accident unintentionally is lower than the odds u r getting. The 999900 comes from the other people who pay insurance and never get into any accident. In fact they even get an additional 1,000,000 in profit from people who never get into any accidents for adjusting the funding of the people.</p>

              <p>Lehmann Brothers was allowed to go bankrupt, causing millions (or probably billions) lost. You can also go imagine up a lot of scenarios on how many will get affected as well.</p>

              <p>The value of an object, however can fluctuate greatly in time. These "values" is equivalent to money. A person with a million dollars buy a million dollar house. His total assets is still a million dollar. If the house value drops to 30,000. His assets is only 30,000.</p>
              <p>The problem is a lot of objects, such as companies shares and houses suddenly have their value reduced tremendously in tis period of time. Tis reduction in value corresponding to a real loss in wealth.</p>
              <p>Of course someone will say tat the builder of the houses still has the money of 1 million dollars. However before he sell the house, there is a total value of a 1 million house and 1 million dollar. After the crisis it becomes 1 million dollars and 30,000 house. There is still a loss in total "value" of the combined items.</p>
