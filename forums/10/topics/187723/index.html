            <div class='col-md body'>There's OpenOffice.. which is free. It is adopted by schools and government both in US and Asia. EU even specify OpenOffice as the default document exchange standard.<br><br>On contrary, there is no standardization on Microsoft. It's just popular... and ridiculously expensive..

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, MINDEF has already switched to OpenOffice, so I don't see why the rest of the ministries can't follow suit. Perhaps the issue is just that of unfamiliarity. Most people are already used to MS Office, so it might be a bit troublesome to switch to OpenOffice. Imagine the number of people who would need to be re-trained to use OpenOffice!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I REFER to the reply from the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA), on the use of the OpenDocument Format (ODF) for all government documents ('Suggested document format not practical'; ST, April 19).<br><br>It is surprising that IDA said that 'the Microsoft Office suite is used widely by PC users. Therefore, it is not practical for the Government to adopt OpenDocument as the only standard'. How many of these PC users are using 'unofficially obtained' Microsoft Office suite? Why is it 'not practical'? Is the standard lacking something?<br><br>As this is an open standard, the National IT Standards Committee could help input additional requirements so as to make it useful for the whole world.<br><br>I expect technical leadership to come from IDA through actively encouraging the use of openly published and globally standardised file formats, not generalisations.<br><br>The ODF has already been adopted as the standard for all government documents by the US state of Massachusetts and many others around the world. Singapore can be a standards setter and leader in this area as well.<br><br>We are observing 25 years of IT leadership and are rolling out the IN2015 vision. Is this vision going to be vendor-centric? Or will it be bold and forward-looking, with no more taxpayers' money spent on proprietary standards?<br><br>Harish Pillay<br>President,<br>Linux Users' Group (Singapore)<br></div>
