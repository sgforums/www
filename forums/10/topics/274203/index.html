            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Friends,<br><br>I like to present a wonder solution I accidenterly come up last night.<br><br>In support for the call to provide jobs for the old people, I would like to suggest my solution to employ any old people. Yes any.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>the only condition is that they willing to take up the job. Yes, you heard it. Real , decent job!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Listen and I'll tell you how i intend to achieve this.<br><br>My plan is unbiased and all encompassing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Any old people can apply.<br><br>They can possess any degree - Bachelor of Rocketry, Microbiology, Neuclear physics, Atom physics, Super computerology, etc...  I even accept applicants who possess Masters degrees - MBA, MSc,  double majors and what nots.<br><br>And no one is left behind. Even PhDs of all sorts welcomed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>As you know, getting old can make job security a worry. Fear not! With my plan, if successfully implemented, All old people will be secured a job. Yes, this is possible! You are not dreaming!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I hope to start a fastfood chain.  Once I expand to 200 franchises, I can estimatedly employ 1000 old people from any walks of life, even Doctorates.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I am glad to announce, I intend to offer 501-701 dollars per month! of salary to old people who applied. Real cash!  Like this, they can live with dignity and earn a decent salary and enjoy their old age.  Surely $501-$701 a month is enough to survive in singapore?  dun you think?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>But there might just be 1 obstacle. Will the old people apply and accept my job offers? real, decent jobs. My plan cannot guarantee success if they too choosey to accept such a decent job offer. I hope they not so choosey.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>So, there you have it lady and gentleman,<br>the master plan to ensure no old people is left jobless.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>So easy right you think? But dun forget, it took me 2.5 hours to cum up this solid plan. I can only call it a stroke of genius.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>What you guys think har?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I only sec 3.5 passed. hope my solution is solid solid.<br><br>very much thank you for reading.<br>Miss Lim Sian Tong<br>Upper Gooni Road<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A tricky question. In theory, if we had a bustling local service industry etc., we would be able to employ a wide spectrum of people. The trouble comes, is that whether or not the companies can offer a salary that will allow the people to make ends meet.<br><br>I am no genius in this, but I fear that the reality is, many people will find themselves out of work by age 40 if they didn't manage to find their way into the financial sector, and I have no clue as to how to solve their employment problems. The days where manufacturing would solve all our problems is over. I personally wouldn't recommend people going into the manufacturing sector for the long term either for partly those reasons.</div>

Cleaner... no I should say sanitary specialists.<br>We certainly should be able to require more sanitary specialists like clean the void decks, generally very clean so not physically very taxing, flexi-hours and no need fulltime. Just can do part time. Like a freelance specialist. The new age new generation of work - sanitary specialist. They can even ride on hightech machines to do the cleaning. little physical required.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>In addition, as more FT and casino tourists flock in, new cabs will be required. As long as under 70+ and eye ok, can make an interesting career change to become a proud cabby.  Tell tourists the singapore story tapping on your 20-60 years of life long work experience.<br><br>So, at least 2 jobs can be created to cater to the desire of older workers competiting in this highly competitive new singapore.<br><br>Everyone will receive a job as long as they qualify and willingness to take up these jobs is key to their employability. Its not that jobs cannot be created. Its not difficult to create jobs, as you can see.<br><br>I am now exploring ways to teach these older workers how to be self-employed working as massage men and women who go door to door to earn a living. Like this what a wonderful life! no worry about jobs and money. Its just what kind of job and what income level. job seekers must not be choosey .   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I hope technically, I have solved the job creation problem. But this is onl my humber opinion. thanks for reading.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
