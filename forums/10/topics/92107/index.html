            <div class='col-md body'>The premise for a pre-paid service is to allow people who have trouble paying for their electricity to control their use. It allows people to see how much use of the electricity they have left, and to budget it to last.<br><br>For example, they might forgo switching the air-conditioner on if they have only a few credits left for the lights.

MPs also wary of encouraging welfarism<br><br>By Alexis Hooi<br><br>JOBLESS for almost six months, former air-con mechanic Jamil Aumany became desperate as the bills piled up.<br><br>Relieved to receive some help, Mr jamil Aumany, 41, father of three, makes less than $600 a month. -- MUGILAN RAJASEGARAN<br><br>The father of three turned to his Member of Parliament last December for help. And Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong GRC) gave him three utility vouchers, each worth $30.<br><br>Said Mr Jamil, 41: 'I didn't know there were such vouchers at that time. It was my wife's sister-in-law who told me about it. The amount wasn't much, but at least it made me worry less.'<br><br>Like him, few of the needy seem aware of these vouchers, set to expire on Thursday.<br><br>But Singapore Power is extending their validity to March next year, said its spokesman yesterday. As of last month, about 11,240 vouchers, worth $337,200, have still not been given away.<br><br>They represent about 70 per cent of the 16,800 first made available for the needy by SingPower last July. The vouchers, worth $504,000 in total, are a one-off gift for families suffering from the economic downturn and Sars outbreak last year.<br><br>Their distribution is left to the discretion of MPs or the areas' grassroots advisers.<br><br>Each of the 84 constituencies here received 200.<br><br>Dr Ong has given out all. As for the big pile left unused, he said there was a problem with overpublicising the scheme, because it 'encourages welfarism in a way'.<br><br>'People who get the vouchers are those who are seriously in financial problem,' he said.<br><br>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar GRC) had given out over 80 per cent. He too warned against encouraging a crutch mentality.<br><br>He said: 'We shouldn't be waving a red flag for this, telling everyone that there's this help available. It's quite a process to go through to get the vouchers. A person with dignity won't do it unless he's in genuine trouble.'<br><br>Madam Cynthia Phua (Aljunied GRC) said she had given out more than half.<br><br>In most cases, the families sought help only after their power was cut and their grassroots organisations recommended that they seek aid.<br><br>Madam Phua said: 'It's important to realise that this is a favour from SingPower and there are more than enough vouchers to go around.' She added that not all who had their power cut were in deep financial trouble. Some chose to pay off other expenses first.<br><br>The SingPower spokesman said on average, about 3,000 homes every month are without power because of arrears.<br><br>'However, if the customer appeals for assistance because of hardship, we would offer instalment payment plans, thus avoiding disconnection action. It is only when the customer defaults on the instalment plans that disconnection action is taken,' she added.<br><br>She also said most of the homes could make some payment and had power restored.<br><br>When asked if SingPower would consider inserting flyers with the bills for homes in arrears - informing them of such vouchers - its spokesman said it would 'explore further on how we can reach out to the hardship cases'.<br><br>Meanwhile, Mr Jamil said he would seek more of the vouchers now that he knows so many are still available.<br><br>He makes less than $600 a month from part-time work. And he worries that the lights in his three-room Housing Board flat in Bukit Batok may go out. Said the father of three aged 15, 11 and six: 'No steady job and no money to pay for expenses, what else can I do?'<br><br></div>
