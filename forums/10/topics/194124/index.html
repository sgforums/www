            <div class='col-md body'>Gary Mathews is superintendent of Williamsburg-James City County Public Schools.<br><br>A lesson or two on Singapore's school system<br>June 8, 2006<br><br>"For the whole conduct of life is based on this: that what we admire in others we want to do ourselves." - Quintilian, Roman Rhetorician<br><br>Socked away between Malaysia and Indonesia in Southeast Asia is the island nation of Singapore, home to approximately 4.4 million people. With a literacy rate of 93 percent, life expectancy of 85 years for women and 79 years for men, and a diverse population of mainly Chinese, Malay and Indian, this diverse nation of Buddhists, Muslims, Taoists, Hindus, and Christians provides international lessons worthy of consideration in the education community and the community-at-large.<br><br>With a highly developed and successful free-market economy, Singapore enjoys a remarkably open and  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> corruption-free <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  environment, stable prices, and a per capita Gross Domestic Product equal to that of the four largest West European countries. And as I have been consuming current discussion of math and science achievement in the United States, it is apparent that one nation leads in both math and science in the latest round of international comparisons: Singapore.<br><br>Known as The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, this assessment of fourth- and eighth-graders around the world surfaces Singapore as the world's leader in both subjects at both grade levels.<br><br>In fourth-grade math, the topics tested are numbers, geometric shapes and measures, and data display. Eighth-graders are tested on numbers, algebra, geometry, data display, and probability.<br><br>In fourth-grade science, the topics tested are life science, physical science, and earth science, whereas eighth-graders grapple with biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science.<br><br>So what do educators and citizens of Singapore do that we can think further about here? Try in-depth learning and the courage and wisdom to invest in teachers' pay and professional development.<br><br>What are we to take from this international leader in both math and science?<br><br>First, consider in-depth learning. From what I can glean from reading accounts in the professional literature, students in Singapore's elementary school math classes do not spend a lot of time working on a lot of problems of the same kind, e.g., adding two three-digit numbers with regrouping 25 times.<br><br>Rather, these students work on but a few of these kinds of problems, giving way to oral and written explanation of what "regrouping" means. Reports of Singapore classrooms find students often engaged in "metacognition," i.e., "thinking about thinking," be it in math, science, or other disciplines. Apparently, learning-for-understanding reigns supreme. There's a potential lesson here.<br><br>Second, consider Singapore's investment in its teachers. To become a teacher, one must earn a college degree with a major in a recognized discipline such as math, science, history, language, or the like. In doing so, it is accepted that those who teach children must be well-steeped in core knowledge. But it does not stop there. It is also accepted that those who teach children must have knowledge of how to effectively transfer knowledge and skills to their young charges. Thus, a fifth year enrolled in the National Education Institute is required of Singapore's teachers as they learn about and hone their classroom skills.<br><br>Not only is this fifth year paid for by the government, these teachers-in-training are also provided with the same salary as a first-year teacher. Talk about respect!<br><br>Can it get any better? In Singapore, yes. Indeed, as many have pointed out, first-year teachers are paid more than lawyers, doctors, and engineers. Even with all of our critics, there's a potential lesson here as well.<br><br>Finally, despite the need for a strong military, which Singapore does enjoy, it has increased spending for schools every year since the 1960s. Education, in rhetoric and deed, is Number One.<br><br>What we admire in others we want to do ourselves, indeed.</div>

With a literacy rate of 93 percent, life expectancy of 85 years for women and 79 years for men, and a diverse population of mainly Chinese, Malay and Indian, this diverse nation of Buddhists, Muslims, Taoists, Hindus, and Christians provides international lessons worthy of consideration in the education community and the community-at-large.<br><br>With a highly developed and successful free-market economy, Singapore enjoys a remarkably open and  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> corruption-free <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  environment, stable prices, and a per capita Gross Domestic Product equal to that of the four largest West European countries. And as I have been consuming current discussion of math and science achievement in the United States, it is apparent that one nation leads in both math and science in the latest round of international comparisons: Singapore.<br><br>Known as The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, this assessment of fourth- and eighth-graders around the world surfaces Singapore as the world's leader in both subjects at both grade levels.<br><br>In fourth-grade math, the topics tested are numbers, geometric shapes and measures, and data display. Eighth-graders are tested on numbers, algebra, geometry, data display, and probability.<br><br>In fourth-grade science, the topics tested are life science, physical science, and earth science, whereas eighth-graders grapple with biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science.<br><br>So what do educators and citizens of Singapore do that we can think further about here? Try in-depth learning and the courage and wisdom to invest in teachers' pay and professional development.<br><br>What are we to take from this international leader in both math and science?<br><br>First, consider in-depth learning. From what I can glean from reading accounts in the professional literature, students in Singapore's elementary school math classes do not spend a lot of time working on a lot of problems of the same kind, e.g., adding two three-digit numbers with regrouping 25 times.<br><br>Rather, these students work on but a few of these kinds of problems, giving way to oral and written explanation of what "regrouping" means. Reports of Singapore classrooms find students often engaged in "metacognition," i.e., "thinking about thinking," be it in math, science, or other disciplines. Apparently, learning-for-understanding reigns supreme. There's a potential lesson here.<br><br>Second, consider Singapore's investment in its teachers. To become a teacher, one must earn a college degree with a major in a recognized discipline such as math, science, history, language, or the like. In doing so, it is accepted that those who teach children must be well-steeped in core knowledge. But it does not stop there. It is also accepted that those who teach children must have knowledge of how to effectively transfer knowledge and skills to their young charges. Thus, a fifth year enrolled in the National Education Institute is required of Singapore's teachers as they learn about and hone their classroom skills.<br><br>Not only is this fifth year paid for by the government, these teachers-in-training are also provided with the same salary as a first-year teacher. Talk about respect!<br><br>Can it get any better? In Singapore, yes. Indeed, as many have pointed out, first-year teachers are paid more than lawyers, doctors, and engineers. Even with all of our critics, there's a potential lesson here as well.<br><br>Finally, despite the need for a strong military, which Singapore does enjoy, it has increased spending for schools every year since the 1960s. Education, in rhetoric and deed, is Number One.<br><br>What we admire in others we want to do ourselves, indeed.</div></blockquote>Perhaps that is the case, but I am under the impression that foreigners tend to do better after education, education not in Singapore.</div>
