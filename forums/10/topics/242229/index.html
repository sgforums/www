            <div class='col-md body'>Published March 13, 2007<br><br>Govt can keep land it got for $4.2m: Court<br><br>Developer had sought return of land acquired in 1983 and now worth an estimated $100m<br><br>(SINGAPORE) The government does not have to return a $100 million plot of land to a property developer for the $4.2 million it paid the company to acquire the site in 1983, the Court of Appeal has ruled.<br><br>Teng Fuh Holdings claimed it had suffered a great injustice because nothing had been done with the land since the government acquired it some 24 years ago.<br><br>Teng Fuh also said the land was zoned industrial when it was acquired but re-zoned residential in the 1993 Kallang Development Guide Plan, showing bad faith.<br><br>The developer said it did not know about the re-zoning until 2004 when it first appealed for the land to be returned.<br><br>The land, acquired for general redevelopment, is at 20-22 Geylang Road. It is now estimated to be worth about $100 million.<br><br>Teng Fuh was awarded $4.2 million compensation based on the market value of the land in 1973 - 10 years before the actual transaction. Teng Fuh has remained a tenant, paying rent of more than $21,000 a month. It is estimated to have paid more than $5.6 million in rent over the years.<br><br>The Appeal Court dismissed Teng Fuh's application on Friday, saying it was out of time. The application should have been made six months from the time it was declared in 1983 that the land was to be acquired for a public purpose, the court said.<br><br>Teng Fuh also did not account for the delay as it had 'the interest, the knowledge and the means to have acquired the information' to make its application 'long before' doing so in September 2005, the court said.<br><br>The re-zoning of the land under the 1993 guide plan was public information and accessible to anyone who wanted to know, it said. As Teng Fuh is 'actively engaged in property development', it 'should be aware' that land use zoning is 'liable to change' when 'land usage needs and planning policies change'.<br><br>The court said that had the application been made in time, Teng Fuh's action would have 'merited serious consideration'.<br><br>The court noted that the Urban Redevelopment Authority had not explained why the land was not redeveloped or why it was re-zoned. The collector of land revenue could have done more to explain what the land was intended for when it was acquired, when this was intended to take place, whether there were any subsequent changes to the plans, and if so, what the current plans are.<br><br>This prolonged inaction, if not explained, could constitute an arguable case of reasonable suspicion that the land was not needed for general redevelopment when acquired in 1983, the court said.<br><br>Teng Fuh was represented by Tan Kay Kheng and Aw Charmian of Wong Partnership.</div>

There is a time limit beyond which you cannot bring an action. If someone made an illegal turning and knocked you down on the road, you have 3 years to sue under tort. It's 5 years for contract. For other issues, the time window is different. If you lose a case in court, you have to appeal within weeks.

This case has nothing to tort or contract. As the court pointed out, the plaintiff could have challenged the government to show cause as to why they had to acquire their land within 6 months of the notice, but they did not.<br><br>The judge clearly disapproved of the prolonged inaction on the part of the government, which indeed suggests that the relevant authorities had abused its powers under the Act. I agree that there is a prima facie case which the government should explain. Since the plaintiff cannot legitimately raise the issue now that they have run out of time (and the court is right in this decision), Opposition Party MPs should raise this in another court, the Parliament.<br><br>Will the Opposition Party MPs do their job for once?

As I have mentioned in my previous post, I agree the prolonged inaction of the authorities in this case is suspicious and they should be taken to task. I await to hear the Opposition Party raise this in Parliament.<br><br>However, you are trying to tarnish the entire land acquisition system with one dubious case. Land acquired by the government is remunerated at the market rate according to law.<br><br>If the private landowner had not done anything on the land apart from a few coconut trees, obviously the market rate for the land will be low. Once the land has been acquired and the government has developed infrastructure around it, built an MRT station next to it and surrounded it with schools, shopping malls, sports complexes and polyclinics; no doubt the value of the land will rise. It is not wrong to sell the land at the new market price to developers. It would not be responsible to sell it at the old price when millions of taxpayers money have been spent to improve the infrastructure. The monies paid out to the government can then be used for other public projects. Ultimately, the government's funds are taxpayers' money as well.</div>

That is why the plaintiff's lawyers should have made representation challenging the government to show cause as to why acquisition was necessary, its purpose and future plans. That ties the government down. They cannot sit on it thereafter for years and they cannot then re-zone it to residential land (which is more valuable) after having assured the court that it was meant for general use.<br><br>In fact, the judge went so far as to suggest what the plaintiff should have done:<br><br>"The court noted that the Urban Redevelopment Authority had not explained why the land was not redeveloped or why it was re-zoned.

If a big piece of land is being acquired by the government, wouldn't you consult your lawyers to fight it in the courts until all legal avenues are exhausted? If the plaintiff had consulted lawyers at the time, they were given poor advice and they can well sue their lawyers for compensation.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kilua:</div><div class="quote_body">It also raises a future point.

They must show cause as to why the land was needed (that's why you need to get a lawyer to fight it). The compensation scheme has also changed now. The government also has to consider not just the value of the land but also the future potential of the land in determining compensation. Such a case is therefore unlikely to recur in future land acquisitions.</div>
