            <div class='col-md body'>This is written on behalf of a friend who is doing a project. (currently a summary)<br><br>A government is a group of people representing the interests of the majority of the people living in a country. This group of people translates their beliefs in the general interest of the majority and protects the welfare of the majority. They assign rules to regulate the majority such that these legislations will prevent the majority of the people from events which deplores the interest of the majority of the people.<br><br>A democracy is a way of governance by allowing the people to select their representatives through voting whom they believed will represent their interests best.<br><br>In Singapore, the country faces a dangerous political situation where there is insufficient competition in the political arena to lend the people their voices to. Walkovers has become so common such that the ruling party has a firm control and are not checked by the people. Opposition is made up by the people, and the people cannot rely on the opposition to make up their numbers with nobody joining them.<br><br>Opposition does prohibit growth to a certain extent, but it also perpetuates alternative solutions to any given situations albeit it may not be proven as a better solution.<br><br>Some people oppose for the sake of opposition. Some people oppose because they believe the solution is not workable or the solution does not protect the general interests of the people. Some people oppose because they feel there is a need for a better alternative to safeguard more interests. Opposition can be revered, it can be rewarding and it could be disastrous.<br><br>The ruling party in Singapore seemed content with the proposition that upgrading was their plan, their manifestos and that their opposition should not be duplicating their idea. However, the Government is supposed to improve the lives of the people and it could start with upgrading. Restricting the opposition from following their footsteps seemed to send the signal that the people's vote condemned them from improvements.<br><br>So the political situation stagnated with the lack of growth within the Opposition. The new political party formed by the members of different opposition political party are not helping either. They questioned the motives of the Government, they questioned the actions by the Government and they seemed content with politcally bashing their opponents with questions than offering statements or solutions. They asked where the money had gone. They asked where are the returns from the projects the Government had invested. They did not ask what the people really wanted.<br><br>The opposition should countercheck the measures and actions of the ruling party. This is understandable. They should also make suggestions to improve the country. The new political party should also understand the fact there is no use crying over spilled milk. Their focus should be on the correction of wrong methods and offer new methods.<br><br>The ruling party could not prevent the people from joining the opposition but the opposition could not force them into. Singaporeans are the ones who should decide they should improve the political situation or move into another era of political stagnation.<br><br>(Incomplete article)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My opinion. The ruling party has always suggested that the people or the oppositions (as suggested in your article) propose good plans to improve Singapore. But no offence... As most of us already know how 'tricky' or not trust worthy our 'ruling' is.... With the current power in hand, they could easily take the plans... Roll them into actions and take credits for things... Stupid as it may sound, but this is just how they usually work from the way I see it today... Never what the truth is... Just how they wanna place the 'black &amp; white' in the respective locations....</div>
