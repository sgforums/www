Sms FLAME to 76699.  99 cents per sms sent/rcvd</blockquote>This is NOT the first time that I've seen SMSes like this.  And honestly, besides being annoyed, I am also shocked and concerned with the content of the smses. According to one of Singtel's Customer Service Officers, these Third Party Content Providers (official term used to describe them), have their own database of numbers, where they would randomly send smses to.<br><br>Naturally, my first concern is, "How did they get my number??"  I am SURE I did not suscribe to this "advertising" service.  Its fine that Singtel or other Telco send a few of these smses regarding offers and deals. Thats OKAY!<br><br>But to recieve a blatantly suggestive sms?  Again, according to Singtel Operators, they informed me that they do not have control over the contents of these Third Party Content Providers.  I agree, that they need not have control over the contents of these providers.  But shouldn't SOMEONE be monitoring their content?  And what action can be taken against this kind of SMS spam?  Hey, at least we got spam blockers for emails right?<br><br>My other concern is the reciepient sms that have such content.  What if they are under the age of 18?  There is no statement in the sms that says "users under 18 must seek parental consent " is there?  Wouldn't this put our youths at risk from sex predators?<br><br>Finally, the sms does not contain any information that identifies the service provider.  I had to call up Singtel to ask them to find out who on earth sent me this sms.  I was informed again by Singtel operators, that the SMS SHOULD HAVE contained the company name of the service provider, AND an office number.  Yet it does not.<br><br>I appreciate Singtel's Customer Service Officer for helping track down the company.  And I think they did a good job given their limited powers.<br><br>Question is now, is there a way the government can look into companies such as Mtouch Pte Ltd, (the source of the sms)?  Most importantly, monitor and remove inappropriate content.  Suggesting a SEXY encounter to someone who is under 18 or perhaps even younger is definitely INAPPROPRIATE!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's third party, so Singtel can't do anything to them.<br><br>Also, there's no such thing as spam blocking feature for SMS. Just ignore it.<br><br>If I am not wrong, the showing of under 18 warning is not compulsory yet. It won't be in effect until at least next year.<br><br>The fact that no company name was published and no office number suggests that it may not be sent by the third party (Mtouche). Someone could have gotten your phone number and played a prank on you.<br><br>Another thing is that Mtouche don't do such things.<br><br><a href="http://www.mtouche.com/partners-corporate-clients.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.mtouche.com/partners-corporate-clients.jsp</a><br><br>It could be purely a prank.<br><br>Either that, it could be <a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com/showthread.php?referrerid=&amp;t=1088150" rel="nofollow">this</a></div>
