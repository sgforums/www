Will drown), build muscles (go gym) nor have extra $$$ to pay ($100 can only subsidise at 30% rate, participant pays the rest): I.e. to deceive statisticians that S$100 in subsidies had been transfered when indeed none of this was practical or even applicable to use???!!!<br>Sports council should answer: in what activity can a wheel chair bound elderly use the S$100 for any form of therapy???!! Perhaps ending ones life by falling into the swimming pool might be one's only choice.<br>With a <a style="color: #005688;" href="http://m.todayonline.com/singapore/singapores-population-growth-slows-0">citizen population of 3.31million and a PR population of 530,000</a>, with the exclusion of children from receiving active SG benefits of S$100/pax, the total budget for the ActiveSG programme ought to be &gt;&gt;$300million (<a style="color: #005688;" href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/dr-vivian-balakrishnan-addresses-yog-budget-rally-195633119.html">almost equalling YOG <br>final budget of S$387 Million, almost 4x the original budget of $104M</a>).<br><br>So did the Singapore sports council intentionally over estimate the withdrawal of ActiveSG credits, or is there a conspiracy to rig gini coefficient results for Singapore by categorising ActiveSG credits as redistributive 'subsidies' to the poor'; hopefully, the Minister/ cronies' pocket is not where the unused portion of the &gt;&gt;$300million goes.<br><br><strong>Perhaps all unused ActiveSG credits if left UNUSED at the end of their validity period (ends Dec 2015) should NOT be forfeited but instead transfered to each individuals medisave account since health is the ultimate beneficiary of exercise/ a healthy lifestyle.</strong><br>Otherwise, these credits could also be valid in perpetuatity (some Singaporeans are based abroad for extended durations), but also usable for healthy lifestyle related activities organised by PA (at community centres) or by SAFRA, so as to make the ActiveSG credits usable across ALL government related rights institutions and statutory bodies (Sports council establishments are too few and too widely spaced/ subject to congestion). In addition, gahmen doctor prescribed/ endorsed physical therapy sessions for handicapped/ frail/ elderly should also be claimable under ActiveSG scheme if the gahmen values the health of all (those too sick to do therapy should be allowed to spend ActiveSG credits on polyclinic/ hospital use: I.e. those with terminal illness, severe handicaps etc). The 30% activity funding limit should also be removed.<br><br>More thought and accessibility to the funds needs to be implemented if the fund is to realise the noble ideal of improved health, otherwise, suspicions will arise if ActiveSG credits are yet another statistical political ponzi scheme, aiding the poor with the unobtainable, to mislead the world/ lay public by deceptively smoothering the severe inequality problem by systematically miscalculating the gini coefficient.<br><br><br>

I am sure more people will be encouraged to do sports when they find it easier to tap this benefit.<br>Swee Bee Lan (Ms)<br>Copyright © 2014 Singapore Press Holdings.
