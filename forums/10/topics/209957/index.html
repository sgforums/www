Â“It is shocking.Â”<br><br>Â“A childÂ’s physical and psychological growth cannot be accelerated. It changes in biological time, not at electrical speed. Childhood is not a race.Â”<br><br>The experts condemned BritainÂ’s increasingly Â“target-drivenÂ” education system and urged the government to recognize childrenÂ’s need for more time and space to develop, demanding an urgent public debate on child-rearing in the 21st century.<br><br>Award-winning childrenÂ’s author Michael Morpurgo, who also signed the letter, said there was a Â“drip, drip, drip effectÂ” of academic pressure and marketing which was killing childhood.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s gradually soaking like a poison into the culture,Â” he told BBC radio. Â“There is less room for reading, for dreaming, for music, for drama, for art, and simply for playing.Â”</span><br><br></div>
