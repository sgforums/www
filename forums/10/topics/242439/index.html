            <div class='col-md body'>The pay of cabinet ministers has always been a topic of debate. Currently, the salary of cabinet ministers is pegged to that of several top professionals in Singapore. Some object to it on the grounds that the work of ministers is different from that of a lawyer or a banker. Whilst that is true to some extent, we have to compensate our ministers who are drawn from these disciplines which pay top dollars to their best workers. For the continued prosperity of Singapore, we cannot expect any less than the best of these professionals.<br><br>Pegging ministers' salaries to local top professionals will reflect the performance of the economy and local salaries. Perhaps in addition to that, we can also peg their salaries to those of cabinet ministers in Hong Kong, our closest competitor in the region. After all, Singaporeans have to remain wage competitive and that applies across the spectrum.<br><br>Ministers do not have to worry about a salary cut. In 2002, Tung Chee Hwa earned an annual salary of US$625,641 compared to Goh Chok Tong who earned US$600,000. <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/east/06/24/Hongkong.cabinet/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/east/06/24/Hongkong.cabinet/index.html</a> Given that the pay is fairly comparable, ministers do not have to fear a drop in income. On the other hand, pegging their salaries to those of our closest competitor will ensure that our ministers do not price Singapore out of the market.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Minsiters justify their high pay as they peg their salaries to those in private sector. Therefore, as is with the practice in the private sector, poor performance should see a Minsiter fired or demoted or pay-cut.

Government officials are under alot more pressure to perform. The competition for their jobs is intense with a new batch of bright young graduates from top Ivy League and Oxbridge Universities every year. If they fail to perform, they are out. The expectations of a top government official is as high, if not higher than any CEO in the private sector.<br><br><blockquote>How to evaluate talents and performances of ministers/officers and terminate services of any one found non-performing or failing to meet expectation without being affected by cronism or protectionalism.[/b]</blockquote>Performance evaluation is open and transparent. Key performance indicators are agreed upon at the beginning of each work year and they have to be objective and measurable. Promotions depend on these assessments, which are open to review. Prove your allegations of 'protectionism and cronyism'. Singapore has been regularly voted the cleanest government in Asia by PERC, a Hong Kong-based institution.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by robertteh:<br>[b In the event of losses in investments by private sector bosses/business owner CEOs, these bosses/CEOs will suffer losses or even get the sack, how do our ministers account for failure in economic restructuring as announced over last three recessions.[/b]</blockquote>No, I do not agree with 'failure of restructuring'. On the contrary, the economy is being transformed very successfully to embrace high-value industries n aerospace, biomedical sciences, water technology and precision engineering. It is precisely the success of economic restructuring that causes low-skilled Singaporeans to face structural unemployment.<br><br>Singapore's economy is plugged into the world market. With our main export market in the US and our economy being export driven, a recession in the US or global economy will hit us. Having a recession does not mean a failure of the government. In fact, we can expect a recession pretty soon in view of the weakening US property market. It is how we handle a recession that demonstrates the strength of government.<br><br><blockquote>How to offset the generous life-long annuities over 25-30 years' retirements in the actual benchmarked talent-retaining and anti-corruption market-driven salaries to be paid to ministers/officers.[/b]</blockquote>Minister pensions are related to the years of service and their performance and salary scales whilst in office, similar to that in Hong Kong and other goverbments. Top commercial firms also provide generous retirement benefits and golden handshakes for their top employees. If we want the best, we have to compete for the talent.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by robertteh:<br>In the voting of their own salaries, will the PAP MPs or at least the executive MPs abstain from voting?[/b]</blockquote>MPs and ministers are elected by Singaporeans. And I say that if Singaporeans do not agree with the pay of ministers, let them campaign in the Opposition Party camps during election and take away a GRC from the ruling party, provided they can persuade Singaporeans to their view.<br><br>I believe the majority of Singaporeans agree that we should pay good wages to attract the best talents into the government. However, I do agree that the wages we pay must not drive Singapore uncompetitive and therefore it will be good to peg it to the salary of Hong Kong cabinet ministers as well. Ministers in Hong Kong also receive generous allowances and some have government housing thrown in as well. These perks should also be considered in the assessment.<br><br></div>
