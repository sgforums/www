              <br> <strong>Singapore Dollar to Drop 7.5% on Slump, Goldman Says </strong>
              <br>
              <br> March 19 (Bloomberg) -- <strong>The Singapore dollar is likely to drop 7.5 percent to S$1.64 versus the greenback over the next three months as a deteriorating economy prompts the central bank to favor a weaker currency, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. </strong>
              <br>
              <br> The bank cut its estimate from S$1.56 and revised its 2009 gross domestic product growth forecast to minus 8 percent, double the pace of contraction previously projected, Hong Kong- based economist <a href="http://www.cantbustme.com/surf.php?q=aHR0cDovL3NlYXJjaC5ibG9vbWJlcmcuY29tL3NlYXJjaD9xPUVub2NoK0Z1bmcmIzM4O3NpdGU9d25ld3MmIzM4O2NsaWVudD13bmV3cyYjMzg7cHJveHlzdHlsZXNoZWV0PXduZXdzJiMzODtvdXRwdXQ9eG1sX25vX2R0ZCYjMzg7aWU9VVRGLTgmIzM4O29lPVVURi04JiMzODtmaWx0ZXI9cCYjMzg7Z2V0ZmllbGRzPXdubmlzJiMzODtzb3J0PWRhdGU6RDpTOmQx##38;sort=date:D:S:d1">Enoch Fung</a> wrote in a report published today.
              <br>
              <br> â€œWe are factoring in a more protracted downturn into our GDP growth forecast,â€� Fung said. â€œ<strong>The Monetary Authority of Singapore is likely to weaken the SGD by shifting the policy band lower at their next scheduled meeting in April.â€� </strong>
              <br>
              <br> Goldman lowered its 12-month forecast for the currency to S$1.58 from S$1.52. The Singapore dollar recently traded at S$1.5166 against the U.S. currency.
              <br>
              <br> The city-stateâ€™s currency has declined 4.9 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a 10 percent slide in the Korean won, the worst performer among Asiaâ€™s 10 most-active currencies excluding the yen.
              <br>
              <br> A quarterly survey by Singaporeâ€™s central bank earlier this week saw economists forecasting a 4.9 percent contraction in the economy this year, compared with a prediction for 1 percent decline earlier. Minister Mentor <a href="http://www.cantbustme.com/surf.php?q=aHR0cDovL3NlYXJjaC5ibG9vbWJlcmcuY29tL3NlYXJjaD9xPUxlZStLdWFuK1lldyYjMzg7c2l0ZT13bmV3cyYjMzg7Y2xpZW50PXduZXdzJiMzODtwcm94eXN0eWxlc2hlZXQ9d25ld3MmIzM4O291dHB1dD14bWxfbm9fZHRkJiMzODtpZT1VVEYtOCYjMzg7b2U9VVRGLTgmIzM4O2ZpbHRlcj1wJiMzODtnZXRmaWVsZHM9d25uaXMmIzM4O3NvcnQ9ZGF0ZTpEOlM6ZDE=##38;sort=date:D:S:d1">Lee Kuan Yew</a> predicts the economy may shrink as much as 10 percent this year should exports continue to plunge, versus a government projection for a 5 percent contraction.
              <br> <strong>
              <br> Highest Exposure </strong>
              <br>
              <br> â€œSingapore has one of the highest exposures to weakness in external demand because of its high ratio of exports to GDP and the high portion of export-driven demand,â€� Fung said.
              <br> <strong>
              <br> UBS AG, the worldâ€™s second-largest currency trader, and HSBC Holdings Plc also said Singaporeâ€™s central bank will seek a weaker currency at its April policy review. The cityâ€™s dollar may fall to S$1.63 in three months, and rebound to S$1.60 by year-end,</strong> Nizam Idris, a Singapore-based currency strategist at UBS, wrote in a research report yesterday.
              <br>
              <br> Singaporeâ€™s economy will contract 9 percent this year and the central bank â€œwill probably announce a one-off depreciation of its nominal trade-weighted exchange rate when it next meets on April 9 and this is likely to be in the order of 2 percent or so,â€� wrote Robert Prior-Wandesforde, a senior economist at HSBC in Singapore, in a report today.
              <br> <strong>
              <br> Jobless Rate </strong>
              <br>
              <br> The unemployment rate rose to 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008, from 2.2 percent in the previous three months, the Ministry of Manpower reported on March 16. <u><strong>The jobless rate will rise to 7 percent in 2010, hurting private consumption further, Goldmanâ€™s Fung wrote in his note. </strong></u>
              <br>
              <br> Singaporeâ€™s central bank conducts its monetary policy by guiding the local dollar within an undisclosed band of trade- weighted currencies of <a href="http://www.cantbustme.com/surf.php?q=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibG9vbWJlcmcuY29tL2FwcHMvcXVvdGU/dGlja2VyPURYWTpJTkQ=">major trading partners</a>. It holds its monetary policy meeting twice yearly.
              <br>
              <br> The Monetary Authority of Singapore adopted a faster currency appreciation in October 2007, announced a one-off strengthening in April 2008 and stopped favoring gains in October last year.

              <p>Wednesday, 18 March 2009</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Singapore
                      will be Southeast Asia's weakest economy, shrinking nearly 5 per cent
                      this year</strong></span>, while Thailand faces its worst recession in 11 years,
                      reflecting a collapse in exports across Asia, a Reuters poll shows.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The Philippines and Indonesia will
                      be the only economies in Southeast Asia to record growth this year but
                      that growth will be sharply slower than in previous years with
                      Indonesia hit by falling prices of commodities, the bulk of its exports.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore's
                      gross domestic product, or the value of all goods and services
                      produced, is set to shrink 4.9 per cent in 2009</strong></span>, according to the
                      median forecast of the Reuters quarterly poll.<br><br>It would be the
                      city-state's worst-ever economic slump and mark a sharp a turnaround
                      after averaging 6.4 per cent annual growth over the past five years.
                      But analysts foresee it rebounding 3.9 per cent in 2010 as fiscal
                      stimulus kicks in.<br><br>In contrast, Southeast Asia's biggest
                      economy, Indonesia, is poised to expand by 4 per cent this year, and
                      5.1 per cent in 2010, as exports contribute only about a third of GDP,
                      making it much less dependent on trade than its neighbours.<br><br>Still,
                      the growth forecast is well down from a 4.8 per cent estimate in a poll
                      three months ago. Weak exports and falling commodities prices weigh on
                      growth, and analysts said the government needs to take further steps to
                      support the economy on top of last month's US$6.1 billion (S$9.31
                      billion) fiscal stimulus package.<br><br>In Malaysia and Thailand,
                      demand is hurt by crumbling exports. Thailand's economy is set to
                      shrink 1.5 per cent this year while Malaysia will see a 1.2 per cent
                      contraction. The poll forecast Malaysia would pick up slightly next
                      year, with GDP growing 2.8 per cent while Thailand is set for a 2.9 per
                      cent expansion in 2010.<br><br>The forecast that the economy will
                      shrink 1.5 per cent this year reverses a 2.8 per cent growth forecast
                      three months ago and an actual 2.6 per cent expansion in 2008.<br><br>For
                      the Philippines, the poll forecast the economy to expand by just 2.3
                      per cent this year, lower than a 3.3 per cent growth estimate in a
                      similar poll in December and below government expectations for at least
                      3.7 per cent growth, as a deepening global recession chokes exports and
                      slows remittance inflows.<br><a href="http://business.inquirer.net/money/breakingnews/view/20090318-194807/Singapore-fares-worst"><br>http://business.inquirer.net/money/breakingnews</a></p>

              																	145% of GDP, Singapore has been especially hard hit by the collapse in global

              																	more critical attention. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Earlier this month the Straits Times reported that 
              																	GIC's assets, often roughly estimated at US$300 billion, had fallen by around 
              																	25% off their peak of last year. </strong></span><br> <br> The state-controlled newspaper quoted the senior Lee saying that GIC had 
              																	invested "too early" when it took stakes in early 2008 in Swiss investment bank 
              																	UBS and now diminished US banking giant Citibank. Until a recent preferred to

              																	<br> <br> Singaporean eyebrows also rose earlier this year when Temasek chief executive 
              																	officer Ho Ching, the wife of Prime Minister Lee, announced she would step down 
              																	from her post in October and be replaced with an Australian national. Temasek 
              																	executives have said that her resignation is not related to the investment 
              																	company's recent financial performance, which in historical terms has tanked.
              																	<br> <br> The sovereign fund shed 31% of assets' value between April and November 2008, 
              																	driving its portfolio down to US$127 billion, according to a Ministry of 
              																	Finance report made to parliament. Some analysts expect even worse when the 
              																	sovereign fund announces its total annual results, expected in the weeks ahead. 
              																	<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The senior Lee was quoted saying in the local press that there was "no equal" 
              																	inside Temasek to the outside Australian national candidate appointed to the 
              																	post, but later backtracked on the comment. </strong></span><br> <br> The mentor minister's flip-flop about Temasek's top management capabilities 
              																	struck some as odd, considering the sovereign fund had until recently claimed 
              																	to have earned an average 18% in total annual shareholder returns. It's notable 
              																	in retrospect that the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in a 2006 report, 
              																	inquired Temasek managers whether they "took into account the impact of its 
              																	investment on the overall economy's exposure to sectors and countries".
              																	<br> <br> Temasek officials responded that the outward expansion was done "cautiously and 
              																	selectively, overseen by an independent board". Authorities also told the IMF 
              																	then that "disclosing further information on GIC's operations and financial 
              																	position was difficult because of strategic reasons, but underscored that such 
              																	investments were largely in liquid assets and undertaken with sufficient 
              																	internal oversight".
              																	<br> <br> The IMF said in an August 2008 report that GIC's and Temasek's operations "do 
              																	not appear to undercut the formulation or conduct of domestic policies", though 
              																	this assessment was made before government officials revealed the extent of 
              																	their recent losses.
              																	<br> <br> <strong>Pension questions</strong><br> Opposition politician and political scientist James Gomez, for one, believes 
              																	that the mounting crisis has exposed flaws in the government's economic 
              																	management. He says that while Temasek's and GIC's losses have not overtly 
              																	affected the day-to-day lives of most Singaporeans, they could eventually 
              																	impact on the Central Provident Fund (CPF), a state-run compulsory social 
              																	security program.
              																	<br> <br> The CPF board has consistently said it only <a id="KonaLink4" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KC20Ae02.html#"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">invests</span></span></a> funds in "risk-free" 
              																	government bonds and bank deposits, but both opposition and PAP politicians 
              																	have contradicted those claims. Opposition politicians, including Low Thia 
              																	Khiang, have questioned whether the funds paid into the <a id="KonaLink5" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KC20Ae02.html#"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="border-bottom: 1px solid green; color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static; background-color: transparent;">CPF</span></span></a> actually provide a 
              																	de facto cheap source of finance for GIC in particular to invest abroad.
              																	<br> <br> GIC officially acknowledges that it invests overseas some of the proceeds 
              																	raised from government bonds. However, the government does not publicly release 
              																	information on assets held abroad or data on the position of the consolidated 
              																	public sector, according to the IMF. That's historically raised criticisms that 
              																	could intensify in the months ahead as the economy weakens. Opposition MP Low 
              																	was quoted in the Straits Times in September 2007 asking in parliament whether 
              																	the "government short-changes Singaporeans by giving CPF members 3.5% of the 
              																	interest rate while the GIC makes 9% and pockets the balance of 5.5%".
              																	<br> <br> Gomez says that because there is no clear evidence to show that CPF funds have 
              																	disappeared with GIC's and Temasek's recent losses, there has not yet been a 
              																	public reaction against the two <a id="KonaLink6" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KC20Ae02.html#"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">investment </span><span class="kLink" style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">funds</span></span></a>' management. However, he 
              																	contends there is a growing "disquiet" about the various mechanisms the 
              																	government has since 2007 put in place to delay CPF disbursements to the 
              																	population, including a rise in the minimum retirement age.
              																	<br> <br> Those measures are a reflection, some believe, of the CPF's weak financial 
              																	position, which analysts say has been hampered by a pro-business government 
              																	policy in recent years to substantially reduce employers' payments into the 
              																	scheme. The IMF said in 2006 that "steps are needed to increase <a id="KonaLink7" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KC20Ae02.html#"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">income</span></span></a> replacement rates for retirees relying on their [CPF] savings". It's not 
              																	apparent - three years later and amid the country's worst ever economic crisis 
              																	- that those recommended steps have been taken.
              																	<br> <br> There are other areas of potential popular agitation, including a nagging 
              																	perception, expressed on blogs and among the political opposition, that top 
              																	government officials are grossly overpaid. In April 2007, ministers received a 
              																	60% pay hike, bumping their pay to an average of US$1.2 million per year. Prime 
              																	Minister Lee's salary jumped at the time to the Singapore dollar equivalent of 
              																	US$2 million. The official pay hikes were justified by a compensation system 
              																	created in 1994 by the senior Lee, then premier, that pegged top officials' 
              																	salaries to what they might earn at the same level in the private sector.
              																	<br> <br> Then, the senior Lee strongly defended the hefty pay hikes, warning the 
              																	previous month that without them "your jobs will be in peril, your security at 
              																	risk and our women will become maids in other people's countries". With the 
              																	global downturn, at least the first of those dire warnings has come a cropper 
              																	for many Singaporeans, though there are no indications yet government 
              																	ministers' salaries will be cut back in line with rising global discontent over 
              																	perceived corruption in top level corporate compensation packages.
              																	<br> <br> Prime Minister Lee has responded to the mounting economic crisis through 
              																	vigorous fiscal pump priming. The government's 2009 budget entails fiscal 
              																	measures, including a heavy dose of off-budget loan guarantees, which amount to 
              																	8% of GDP, the largest such percentage in Asia. Underscoring the potential 
              																	depth of Singapore's crisis, the fiscal package is nearly twice the amount as a 
              																	percentage of GDP the government mobilized in the wake of the 1997-98 Asian 
              																	financial crisis. Half of the fiscal cash is expected to be injected into the 
              																	economy this year, according to Credit Suisse.
              																	<br> <br> Whether this will be enough to keep rising social discontent from morphing into 
              																	calls for political change and greater government transparency is still 
              																	unclear. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Opposition politician Gomez contends that most Singaporeans are "too 
              																	fearful too express their desire for political change" in light of the 
              																	government's notoriously harsh handling of its critics, including the use of 
              																	crippling defamation suits to bankrupt opposition politicians. </strong></span><br> <br> He believes that the government's fiscal strategy amounts to "cash handouts to 
              																	mitigate criticism", which, he concedes could still work in Singapore's 
              																	materialistic society. But Singapore's wealth has recently greatly diminished, 
              																	perhaps more than many realize, and as the global economic crisis bites deeper 
              																	at home, it's possible that desperate Singaporeans look to pin the blame on 
              																	Lee's government.
