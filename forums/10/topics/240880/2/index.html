            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>Yes indeed, you have quite a point there; why weren't there any incidences in the early 80s?? Maybe, people were well making a good living and then life was more precious??? Unlike now, where a lot of people are living hand-to-mouth and then some are basically crawling along and can barely put food on their tables?<br><br>Could it be so??? And if so... WHY??? </strong></blockquote>The reason no ''death'' was reported in the 80s is there was a clamp down on news about SMRT death..... 1st death happen in Bishan in the late 80s. Woman walk into the tunnel..... kept quite because the govt or SMRT scare more copycat....... therefore, the press were told not to put such death on the main page...... nowadays, with handphones and internet..... you can't 'cover' such matters anymore..... thats why it seems like alot of ppl are dying.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Maybe, people were well making a good living and then life was more precious???</strong></blockquote>I don't remember my family ''making good living'' in the 80s. We just make do. Perhars not big screen TV, no big house, no cars loan or credit cards.... means less stress. Having food ont the table and a 20'' TV is good enough when I'm a kid.....</div>
