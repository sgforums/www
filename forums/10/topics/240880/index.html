An SMRT spokesman said this was because the panels would not effectively eliminate suicide attempts as people could still climb over them.<br><br>However, the LTA's main concern was that the costs associated with installing the panels might have to be borne by commuters in the form of higher fares.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am one of those who do not agree with implementing barriers for SMRT train stations.<br><br>This concept of barrier-less overhead stations is derived from european and western societies, where most have a substantially large network of metro stations above ground. In such a case, introducing a protective barrier to prevent people from 'accidentally' falling onto the tracks will not be cost effective.<br><br>People die everyday, and throwing themselves in front of a train is probably not new in countries like UK and USA. Yet their societies have not seen fit to erect protective barriers to deter would-be suicides.<br><br>In retrospect, placing a barrier may limit the number of people who conveniently use SMRT as a means of committing suicide, but it doesn't take away the intention.<br><br>It was miraculous that in the initial years of operation, SMRT did not already suffer from such incidents. The recent spat of copycat suicides is just something unavoidable.<br><br>If we go back several years, i recall a Mercedes Benz that somehow jumped off the road, plowed through the fencing and ended up on the SMRT train tracks at Lentor, right in the path of an oncoming train. On that occasion, civic- mindedness saved the day when fellow road-users 'rescued' the driver from the car while others ran ahead of the advancing train to warn the pilot.<br><br>Ironically, the driver was later arrested on suspicion of drink-driving (or was it drugs-related?).<br><br>In that incident, sufficient barriers were erected, yet such a freak catastrophe occured.<br><br>Can we safely say barriers will solve all our problems?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All I can say it is odd that the MRT has been in service since the 80's and these incidents have only occured in more recent times. Perhaps the solution is beyond these barrier panels and the onus should be passenger's own caution.<br><br>However, it is a ridiculous notion that the cost of barrier panels to be borne by the passengers. In every year the SMRT makes a profit, do they redistribute this surplus back to passengers? A company, much less a GLC should be not guaranteed a profit year-on-year. It is ridiculous to put the consumers in a position to guarantee profits for these GLCs. Any cost, especially that towards safety, should be borne wholly and soley by SMRT.<br><br>They already made substanial retained earnings over the years. That should more than cover the cost of the panels.</div>

Glass panels like those of underground stations or those build a feet apart from one another, leaving space for the door opening?<br><br>Either of those requires lots and lots of money. On top of that, who will guarantee that glass panel would stop accidents like those from happening?<br><br>Carried out at night? How many train stations are there in Singapore?

It has also already been said that the cost of building such barrier in our existing stations is high. and whether is it effective in deterring such accidents is another story. look at it this way, if u build a barrier, u will need to aircon the whole station because there will be not enough airflow inside the station.<br><br>anyone who studies econs or do business will know that it is really expensive to build aircon and facilities into our exisiting stations. That is why u see that NEL has woodleigh station build on it, even though it is nt opened and nobody lives in the surrounding. but as the govt foresees that there will be development around the stations in the next few years, this station will be viable and critical. if the station is not build and only a few years later dey build it, it would be much more expensive~<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Look at it this way lah:<br><br>We have been fortunate all these years to avoid all these incidents, but the recent spike is disturbing.<br><br>But I think the logic is as follows, if there's no barrier it's only a matter of time, no matter how much education, before somebody ends up on the track.<br><br>The barrier is just that: a safety net. The foolproofness of your barrier is dependent on how much you are willing to build... a full system or just the blocking one like in Hongkong (I am more for the latter in the meantime)?<br><br>As for suicides, can't really stop them... but I think our main concern is avoiding those deaths and injuries that come from stupidity or carelessness and what have you not... if we can stop these then why not?<br><br>As for the costs... I wonder if it's really that expensive or that we are not being creative enough or just plain lazy. Any kind of barrier would be better then none... even those ugly makeshift bannisters with chains or what have you not...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If totally enclose from the track, mean there's automated door like those underground station one. They can install station by station, not necessary overnight all station must have. if totally enclosed, safer and got air-con shiok shiok some more.<br><br>Build can build, but lay chey lah. See they want to build only a not, need to install the metal works and rewire the circuits, reload the software, test the system, debug and...........<br><br>So if they start working after the last train around 12.30am, there have about 5.5 hrs to completed , everything, and get ready for the 1st passenger to take the train, if got problem, hoh sey liao everybody take bus.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BillyBong:</div><div class="quote_body">I am one of those who do not agree with implementing barriers for SMRT train stations.<br><br>This concept of barrier-less overhead stations is derived from european and western societies, where most have a substantially large network of metro stations above ground. In such a case, introducing a protective barrier to prevent people from 'accidentally' falling onto the tracks will not be cost effective.<br><br>People die everyday, and throwing themselves in front of a train is probably not new in countries like UK and USA. Yet their societies have not seen fit to erect protective barriers to deter would-be suicides.<br><br>In retrospect, placing a barrier may limit the number of people who conveniently use SMRT as a means of committing suicide, but it doesn't take away the intention.<br><br>It was miraculous that in the initial years of operation, SMRT did not already suffer from such incidents. The recent spat of copycat suicides is just something unavoidable.<br><br>If we go back several years, i recall a Mercedes Benz that somehow jumped off the road, plowed through the fencing and ended up on the SMRT train tracks at Lentor, right in the path of an oncoming train. On that occasion, civic- mindedness saved the day when fellow road-users 'rescued' the driver from the car while others ran ahead of the advancing train to warn the pilot.<br><br>Ironically, the driver was later arrested on suspicion of drink-driving (or was it drugs-related?).<br><br>In that incident, sufficient barriers were erected, yet such a freak catastrophe occured.<br><br>Can we safely say barriers will solve all our problems? </div></blockquote>Even in London, the Underground stations in the city do not have screens between the platform and the tracks. A terrorist could place a globe filled with anthrax spores on the tracks and infect the whole city when the train runs it over and scatters the virus. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>However, having barriers at above-ground stations like those underground ones may mean having to spend more on air conditioning.
