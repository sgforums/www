            <div class='col-md body'>Sept 15, 2005<br>Probe launched into charity for the blind<br><br>By Theresa Tan<br><br>THE troubles that have been brewing at the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped (SAVH) since late last year have finally boiled over.<br><br>The Commissioner of Charities has started an inquiry into the governance and financial management of the charity, which provides financial aid, counselling and other services to about 2,500 beneficiaries.<br><br>While investigations take place, a task force from the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) will take 'executive responsibilities' over its operations, an NCSS statement said yesterday.<br><br>Yesterday's developments come seven months after SAVH's right to collect tax-exempt donations, or Institution of Public Character (IPC) status, was suspended by the NCSS 'to protect public interest'.<br><br>The NCSS did so because it had problems with SAVH's governance and management systems - which seemed to have persisted.<br><br>NCSS president Gerard Ee told The Straits Times last night that the SAVH board admitted it had issues to address, but lacked resources to do so. At a meeting with Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS), and Mr Ee yesterday, it asked for NCSS staff to help out.<br><br>Mr Ee took pains to say that what was happening at SAVH is not a repeat of the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) saga, which led to the en bloc resignation of the NKF board, its former chief executive T.T. Durai, and a full-scale investigation by the authorities.<br><br>The SAVH's 13-member board, led by Ms Lyn Loh, and staff members stay. Mr Ee, who is also the interim chairman of the NKF, said: 'The task force will put in controls and do some tidying up, but the board will continue to function. The task force can't override the board.'<br><br>Senior NCSS staff, such as its director of service development Tina Hung, will be seconded for six months 'for a start' from Monday.<br><br>The SAVH board has also asked former NCSS president Robert Loh and former MP S. Vasoo to be part of a new advisory committee.<br><br>Last night, board members either hung up when contacted by phone or remained uncontactable.<br><br>Asked about signs of financial mismanagement, Mr Ee said: 'If there was evidence of fraud, it will not be the Commissioner of Charities that we are calling in.'<br><br>While the charity's IPC status remains suspended, the NCSS will continue to fund it through the Community Chest.<br><br>Since January, the NCSS has conducted two audits on the charity and even called in independent auditors KPMG last month. KPMG found some 'shortcomings'.<br><br>Mr Ee declined to elaborate on these, but clearly, what troubles the NCSS - which funds the bulk of almost $2 million needed to run its services - is the spate of resignations since last August.<br><br>The SAVH board has changed composition at least twice. The effectiveness of its operations has also been called in question after key staff quit in quick succession, leading to complaints from the blind community, sources say.<br><br>SAVH members were also flummoxed when it joined hands with its breakaway faction, the Independent Society of the Blind (ISB), in May. The ISB was booted out of the NCSS in 1996 for not meeting criteria such as having sound financial management and a good track record.<br><br></div>
