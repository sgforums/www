              <p><strong>Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore forces foreigners to become citizens</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 13.1944px; color: #333333;">Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>In Singapore's state controlled newspaper the Straits Times online edition of Sept 9, 2010, there is the shocking story, "SM clarifies PR (permanent residence) renewal". <br><br>Lee Kuan Yew's Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, who does not have any full time position, but whose job it appears is to make periodical speeches which take his fancy, for which by the way, he is paid $3.7 million dollars a year, is reported to have said "In the past we could just give you permanent residence without taking up Singapore citizenship. Moving forward, we are going to approach some of them to take up Singapore citizenship. If they don't then their PRs (Singapore permanent residence) will not be renewed"!<br><br>Only in Singapore where nepotism and corruption rules with draconian punishment for critics in a fear ridden society will a man who has no full time government position, and nothing to do, is paid $3.7 million dollars a year, but that story is for some other day. <br><br>But coming back to this story of forcing people to becomes Singapore citizens, what this man is saying is that Singapore is going to force people to become citizens. If you don't want to be a citizen, you would be booted out. They are not going to allow you to work there unless you become their citizen!<br><br>Frankly this is the first time I have ever heard any country doing this, and it smacks of desperation. Mostly it is the other way round. People living in foreign countries may like it and apply for citizenship. The host country would accept qualified applicants and reject others. Citizenship should be at the request of the applicant, not the country forcing you to be one!<br><br>No country, not even Iraq or Afghanistan who have seen an exodus of people escaping the war, have forced anyone to become their citizens. This threat by Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore upon foreigners is not only desperate, it is pathetic. <br><br>Of course you know why they have stooped so low. Singapore's name has been internationally discredited as a country that hangs teenagers with the highest execution rate in the world. A place that brutally beats petty criminals (they call it "caning"). A one party state with no rule of law, and where defamation court actions is the preferred instrument to destroy political opponents. <br><br>As a result, the city state with a greatly limited land area of only 16 miles by 26 miles, has the lowest fertility rate in the world, the lowest marriage rates and a population which has been found to the unhappiest in the world. It also has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, with between 1 and 2 people taking their lives daily, the preferred method being jumping off the ubiquitous high rise apartments or by jumping onto oncoming trains and being crushed. <br><br>So it is not surprising that no one wants to become a citizen of the country preferring to spend some time there to earn some money and get the Hell out of there. <br><br>Of course there is this blog that further aggravates the situation for those in power in the island, as well as the Internet which on a daily basis tells it as it is. <br><br>Finally, this man Goh Chok Tong should realise that even if anyone became a citizen of that Alice in Wonderland island, having succumbed to the threats of deportation, what sort of citizens would they become? Not very good ones, I don't think. <br><br>I suppose I should finish by saying you can take a horse to water, you cannot make him drink. <br><br><em>Gopalan Nair</em></span></p>

              <p>that is not the point....The point is that it is a useless strategy because you can't control people to have dual citizenship....people can still retired overseas....</p>
              <p>For example the half a million newly Indians........they can still retired in India as a Sg citizen so long as they declared Indian origin. They fly back to Sg once every 2 years for a period of 2 months than fly back to India.</p>
              <p>Their children match make their bride from India. continue to strengthen their ties with India generation thru generation.</p>

              <p><strong>Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore forces foreigners to become citizens</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; color: #333333;">Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>In Singapore's state controlled newspaper the Straits Times online edition of Sept 9, 2010, there is the shocking story, "SM clarifies PR (permanent residence) renewal". <br><br>Lee Kuan Yew's Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, who does not have any full time position, but whose job it appears is to make periodical speeches which take his fancy, for which by the way, he is paid $3.7 million dollars a year, is reported to have said "In the past we could just give you permanent residence without taking up Singapore citizenship. Moving forward, we are going to approach some of them to take up Singapore citizenship. If they don't then their PRs (Singapore permanent residence) will not be renewed"!<br><br>Only in Singapore where nepotism and corruption rules with draconian punishment for critics in a fear ridden society will a man who has no full time government position, and nothing to do, is paid $3.7 million dollars a year, but that story is for some other day. <br><br>But coming back to this story of forcing people to becomes Singapore citizens, what this man is saying is that Singapore is going to force people to become citizens. If you don't want to be a citizen, you would be booted out. They are not going to allow you to work there unless you become their citizen!<br><br>Frankly this is the first time I have ever heard any country doing this, and it smacks of desperation. Mostly it is the other way round. People living in foreign countries may like it and apply for citizenship. The host country would accept qualified applicants and reject others. Citizenship should be at the request of the applicant, not the country forcing you to be one!<br><br>No country, not even Iraq or Afghanistan who have seen an exodus of people escaping the war, have forced anyone to become their citizens. This threat by Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore upon foreigners is not only desperate, it is pathetic. <br><br>Of course you know why they have stooped so low. Singapore's name has been internationally discredited as a country that hangs teenagers with the highest execution rate in the world. A place that brutally beats petty criminals (they call it "caning"). A one party state with no rule of law, and where defamation court actions is the preferred instrument to destroy political opponents. <br><br>As a result, the city state with a greatly limited land area of only 16 miles by 26 miles, has the lowest fertility rate in the world, the lowest marriage rates and a population which has been found to the unhappiest in the world. It also has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, with between 1 and 2 people taking their lives daily, the preferred method being jumping off the ubiquitous high rise apartments or by jumping onto oncoming trains and being crushed. <br><br>So it is not surprising that no one wants to become a citizen of the country preferring to spend some time there to earn some money and get the Hell out of there. <br><br>Of course there is this blog that further aggravates the situation for those in power in the island, as well as the Internet which on a daily basis tells it as it is. <br><br>Finally, this man Goh Chok Tong should realise that even if anyone became a citizen of that Alice in Wonderland island, having succumbed to the threats of deportation, what sort of citizens would they become? Not very good ones, I don't think. <br><br>I suppose I should finish by saying you can take a horse to water, you cannot make him drink. <br><br><em>Gopalan Nair</em></span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>It doesn't look nice to reject PR renewal for people who refuse to become singaporean. It is like telling the world that singapore is not an ideal place to live.<br>They should tighten the criteria to renew PR.<br>If the PR feel insecure, either convert or take the risk of not having their PR renewed.</p></div>
