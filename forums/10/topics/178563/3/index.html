So if having a fan to cool you when you're hot is a luxury, doesn't it logically follow that an airconditioner that does the same thing more expediently is more so of a luxury?<br><br>Sometimes you have to stop to think before you jump to conclusions, it does help, really.<br><br>If I have a daughter, and she wants to watch america's next top model at 11pm with friends, so be it. If she wants to watch Lost at 2am with strangers, we have to see the context. If she is in hostel and the male strangers are  her fellow hostelites whom she does not talk to, nor know their names, is there any crime in that?<br><br>If she runs into a stranger's house to watch tv, then its is her bad upbringing and her parents must teach her not to run into peoples' house to use their tv.<br><br>If she is conducting shady business (prostitution, social escort, massage) and watches tv in hotel rooms with her clients, once again, it is the poor upbringing by her parents. If you've gone out to meet more people, you'd realise that people don't simply watch tv in dogdy situations with strangers. There is no need to cirminalise everything.<br><br>You might as well make it illegal for me to hold and kiss my gf in public as I may be outraging her modesty! Let's go one step further! Let's outlaw ALL contact, physical or otherwise, between different genders!<br><br>Those viet gals who are here on tourist pass should conduct their "tourists" activity rather than make money at bars and pubs. The authorities refuse to believe that the viet gals spent such a substantial amount of money just to come to sg to enjoy our more expensive drinks and our wonderful company! If so, how come the local women are complaining about the lousy company local men make?<br><br>Sometimes instead of seeing things on the surface, you should try thinking deeper and finding out how different event correlate. You should teach that to your extremist friends too.</div>

Your current discussions would have a lot more impact if forumers would not oppose you just because they hate you.<br><br>People usually give a point of view and substantiate their claims the way honeybunz and robertteh does. You simply produce a statement and challenge others to falsify it. This gives you a "heads i win tails you lose" scenario for you. If they manage to falsify your statement, you claim they are agitated and hence you struck a chord. If they fail to falsify your statement, you claim that you are right. All this without substantiating your statements.<br><br>That is one major reason why many find it frustrating and hopeless to discuss issues with you.<br><br>I am nobody to teach you how to lead your life, but perhaps you can still gain credibility if you try to substantiate your statements.</div>
