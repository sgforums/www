              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>With the <a style="box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: #5a9ddc;" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/cabinet-reshuffle-4g-leaders-now-helming-two-thirds-of-ministries">Cabinet reshuffle on Tuesday (April 24)</a>, Mr Chan, 48, will relinquish his role as Minister in the Prime Minister's Office.</p>

              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>An appointment at MTI would help round out his experience, they said.</p>

"In a way, the new role at MTI is an extension of the work in NTUC to ensure that our working people can continue to benefit from good jobs and our businesses can have the opportunities to become more competitive," he said.</p>
