              <p><br>It is a damn good thing LKY got independence for us ! Are you crazy? Do you want to under Malaysia forever? My Malaysian friends are complaining about the racial discrimination and unfair disadvantage they face as a minority and you say LKY used Msia to gain independence? He may have done it but in the end, it benefitted all of us. Yes, a lot of PRC people, yes real estate price gone up, NS waste of time and yes no media freedom and our salary very low.</p>
              <p>But realise this, we would have been much much worse than before had we still been in Malaysia federation. No MRT, No Orchard Road, No Geylang, No Marina Sands, No Sentosa, No good standard education, etc, etc. Today we are one of the richest society in Asia no thanks to LKY. Although he has taken a lot of civil liberties from us, I have to credit LKY for developing the backwater island into a powerhouse economy in the region. No easy feat.</p>

If you dun do anything, 30 years from now, you will come back and said "Opposition not very strong" again. Isn't it Lame?</p>

              <p>Since it is an obvious fact that candidates from Opposition parties are not good enough to challenge and bring about any real change to the political scene in Singapore, I would like to make a suggestion to fix it.</p>
              <p>REPLACE THE CANDIDATES FROM THE OPPOSITION PARTIES WITH MORE CAPABLE AND CHARISMATIC CANDIDATES AND LEADERS</p>
              <p>Especially when there are many rebels and traitors who are dying to witness any form of revolutionary change within their pathetic lifespan, they can start by preparing their favorite parties with capable and charismatic candidates and vote out or rid the useless and incapable candidates and leaders to form a strong opposition body that is worthy of gathering real votes from the people. (NOT DONATION VOTES GIVEN OUT OF SYMPATHY)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>VOTES MUST BE EARNED THROUGH MERITS, AND SO FAR THE OPPOSITION PARTIES HAVE FALLEN EXTREMELY SHORT OF THE CURRENT RULING PARTY.</p>

I ASK U ALL THIS: GET ME A PARTY WHO CAN DO BETTER THAN THE PAP. not the half-ass parties we see who come and go in the elections. wanna vote them out? go on. i would like to see who does it better than theh pp in governing this island. cant find any? or just those small 'part-time' parties who campaign for awhile, denounce pap lah blah blah, but have no goddamn idea either on what they want for singapore. Criticising the PAP jus because u have a personal grudge against the leader is not more than a mere, loousy excuse. so what if pap was a bit controlling? something's gotta give right? no stringent rules? wanna see gum all over the damn buses and MRT? wanna have to pray first before crossing the 'hell' road? or drive in roads congested 24/7? achieving 7th in global rankings for goerning efficiency and being the richest country in south-east asia was no piece of cake. sure, lee kuan yew was a hypocrite, a 'racist' and a very, very blunt man. but did that make him a terrible ruler? 'oh, look! an imporverished singapore! just what LEE kuan yew and his PAP did! wow! a super corrupt system! let's bribe my way outta this shall we?' i just dont get it. what exactly are the 'terrible' flaws the PAP have? terrible corruption? over-oppression? racism? poverty? nope. so what exactly is wrong with PAP? 'vote out pap and save singapore'? oh please. save such useless words will ya? think u can do a better job? go ahead, i would like to see u do it.</p></div>

              <p>u need to complain......feedback is important for u.if your laksa u paid $3 has no hums in it......would u sit down n not complain??!!!!of course anyone would complain....and anyone  would still complain if laksa has only $3 miserable stake looking hums in laksa!</p>
              <p>until PAP does a good job......expect people who might post whats really happening to singaporeans to the world via internet,foreign newspapers,embassies,foreign prime ministers office,foreign presidents office etc etc....pap isnt dealing with uneducated peasants or robots in the 21st century!!!perhaps pap could have done it in the 20th century where getting info was rather difficult.nowadays info on whats happening gets emailed along with picturesof what happened 5 mins ago 50,000km away.</p>

Problem is, WHAT I CANT UNDERSTAND IS, as of now, there are NO capable parties around! Vote PAP out now? what then? Collective ruling? vote in a useless group of jokers who recently decided they could rule but have NO idea on going about ruling singapore? SAVE SINGAPORE now? i sincerely dont think so. with the elections coming up, i wait to see which party will stick around after losing the elections(PAP always wins, of course). fact here is, power cant be grabbed easily. u rise up out of nowhere and want support from a dacdes-old ruling party? look at hitler. look at the PRC. look at the US presidents like McCain. u guys honestly think these ppl got their positions overnight? McCain recently is running for presidency again, campaigning for month after month even when Obama won and no one seriously gave a damn about McCain. PERSEVERANCE. Any of our so-called 'opposition' have that one quality? they come and go like the wind, and ppl thus know they have no damn idea on good governing, so what happens? PAP has no strong opposition, and Singaporeans then turn on PAP, criticising them of siphoning and keeping a 'communist' hold on power. seriously, if PAP were doing a TERRIBLE job, Singapore would be in decline economically and socially. is Singapore facing that state?</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>in what way exactly does PAP thumb the parties down? suppress their rallies? impose strict censorship on them? doesnt seem like it. as i said, our opposition just doesnt have the backbone to stand up and fight. u guys honestly think obama had it easy? fighting against the republicans, against A WHITE candidate, against a strongly supported republican government? and yet, HE DIDNT BACK DOWN. again, the pap doesnt suppress opposition. please. its that our opposition doesnt have the determination to stand up to the challenge. in reality, they are happy with the way things are, reluctant to bring in "change", as Obama put it. singapore currently has no strong, determined opposition party. so, which is why i say, if theres is no strong opposition currently, there is no point in saying that we should vote PAP out, is there? P.S. name one way PAP has 'suppressed' alternative parties, or rather, it seems that after the elections, they disappear. </p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>FYI: if u didnt read the papers carefully enough, LKY and gang only sued ppl who published false claims about him, get it? theres no need to be afraid of LKY zzz =.= obama didnt criticise Bush and gang, did he? did obama claim bush was a bloody rapist? LKY and gang doesnt prosecute anyone at will, silly, he only sued those who called him a criminal! the speaker's corner is empty because no one wants to listen for a 'change'. ppl think LKY sued for the fun of it to oppress opposition cos those bloody losers who got sued twisted their story around and accused LKY of being oppressive by suing them. guess what? they didnt include the part on why they got sued, what they were call ing LKY in the first place. LKY being oppressive is a mere myth spread by those opposition losers who couldnt get over being punished for calling LKY someone he wasnt. u call your boss a fucked-up rapist and see if he doesnt sue u. go ahead.</p></div>
