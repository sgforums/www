              <p><br>Blindness is just a state of handicap and I don't see what's so low, inferior or unacceptable about it, and it is certainly childish if anyone imagined labelling another person as a "blind" person would somehow makes them feel bad about themselves.</p>
              <p>Don't you know that there are many blind people who are more useful and capable than you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You should be ashamed of yourself for looking down upon blind people and mocking their handicap.</p>
              <p>But then again, I would say that's just the way how you were brought up. Poor upbringing produces low-quality society failures who will only end up being a liability to the country.</p>

              <p>Nice self-consolation barking from Fcukpap and Aceone10, I can
              see that both of you are quite bitter and miserable from your
              pathetic replies. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>The fact is, I do not need to add anymore injury to the insults
              that I have already given both of you.</p>
              <p>Looking at both of your agitated replies, I must have been so
              spot on and struck both of you at the right spots. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Don't feel bad at yourselves if you missed me in your replies or
              felt the need recycle some of my replies back at me.</p>
              <p>Because I don't feel bad at all. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Feel free to contribute more to this topic, and don't be afraid

              <p>it tears my heart apart to say tha looking at the idiot politicians running, except for a very very very few, the MIW are the better people at the moment... and calling these self-serving assholes the better people, shows the sad state of affairs of the bigger idiots in the opposition</p>

              <p><br>Who in the right state of mind would want to join the opposition. There is little transparency, no shadow cabinet.... how do you expect opposition to garner facts to backup any statements which if not possible to be proven in the court of law, face the possibility of a lawsuit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What can they do except come up with antics? You get a very good engineer but provide him toys 'r' us screws and bolts and expect him to build a car? He'll be monkeying for sure as its not possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All they can do is complain about what the general people are not happy about.... aside for being monkeys.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It tears your heart to see the sad state of politics in Singapore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It tears my heart to realise that Singaporeans are afraid of change.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think if it continues that way perhaps migration is a good option to Singaporeans considering most of them are skilled.</p>
