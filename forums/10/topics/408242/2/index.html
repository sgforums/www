              <p>Well thanks for your confirmation of what my post has mentioned.  You are really low in IQ.</p>
              <p>Cant blame you for your poor foresight.  You are just another blind citizen who probably singing marikita and hanging flag in August.</p>
              <p>Dont drive your believed down to my throat and brag just like another "I know it all and better then you" typical Sgrean.  How well and far can you see? as much as your window allowed?</p>
              <p>Happy for you for your satisfaction, but you dont know me, so stop disgrace yourself  by telling me to be satisfied and not to blame the past and blar blar blar.. You're just a little boy to me and what you posted, frankly speaking, are meaningless but a leak of your side of an ugly arrogant sgrean who can swim in a swimming pool and never see the danger of a sea storm.</p>

              <p>bitching, mourning, blaming, cursing, swearing.....looks like this is all about you, if you have nothing else in life that you are satisfied with. </p>
              <p>If the old man is that important, when his lie ruins your life, I can sympathize with you.</p>
              <p>There is always storm out there, part of nature, part of life. But when there is a storm at the sea, you can swim in a swimming pool, haha, can you swim or not?</p>

              <p>Both of you be it guy or gal.  Think you guys need glasses if you dont have it already.  Show me a post of mine that claimed I support opposition! Where? Show me a post of mine that I urge everyone to oppose for the purpose of opposing?</p>
              <p>Am I gunning for support of my view? Both of you are really off topics and especially sgdiehard.  You want to take me on? Typing offensive words is easy but I'm not wasting time on a prak like you.  How much respect do you have in your life? I doubt you have any.  Also, I'm not interested to know and you dont have to prake.  Even if I'm a whiner, so what to you? You have an issue? By the way, improved on your reading and if you dont understand, the magic word is ask.  Dont assume you know where the point aimed at as you are not the writer.</p>
              <p>From the post of Parn and as though I'm going for the next general election.  Ha what a joke... Please dont talk to me about "dog" when you are a gal, as my dictionary for you is only "doggie" but I cant marikita with a gal like u.  Keep it for sgdiehard.  You both make a perfect dumb.  You too need to improve in your reading. My previous post stated "you are just another blind citizen" did I say all citizen are blind? </p>
              <p>How many forumer here support opposition for the purpose of supporting and vise versa for the government?  My point of view is all this are the blind citizen, which cannot strike a balance. So gal gal, read first, ask for better understanding before you shoot like a whore.</p>

              <p>Guess what somebody is trying to say is, if you kill and imprison lots of innocent to attain your power and position, it doesn't matter, so long as that he/she has food at his/her table. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the Nazis or the Japs had won WW2, they killed millions of innocent civilians to get to where they did now, everybody has a good life in Singapore under the Japs, those millions of innocents who died under the hands of the axis is irrelevant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What matters most is food at his/her table? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Both of you be it guy or gal.  Think you guys need glasses if you dont have it already.  Show me a post of mine that claimed I support opposition! Where? Show me a post of mine that I urge everyone to oppose for the purpose of opposing?</p>
              <p>Am I gunning for support of my view? Both of you are really off topics and especially sgdiehard.  You want to take me on? Typing offensive words is easy but I'm not wasting time on a prak like you.  How much respect do you have in your life? I doubt you have any.  Also, I'm not interested to know and you dont have to prake.  Even if I'm a whiner, so what to you? You have an issue? By the way, improved on your reading and if you dont understand, the magic word is ask.  Dont assume you know where the point aimed at as you are not the writer.</p>
              <p>From the post of Parn and as though I'm going for the next general election.  Ha what a joke... Please dont talk to me about "dog" when you are a gal, as my dictionary for you is only "doggie" but I cant marikita with a gal like u.  Keep it for sgdiehard.  You both make a perfect dumb.  You too need to improve in your reading. My previous post stated "you are just another blind citizen" did I say all citizen are blind? </p>
              <p>How many forumer here support opposition for the purpose of supporting and vise versa for the government?  My point of view is all this are the blind citizen, which cannot strike a balance. So gal gal, read first, ask for better understanding before you shoot like a whore.</p>
