            <div class='col-md body'>what i can't stand is they are so willing to add more hardship to Singaporeans (70%+ live in HDB flats), say its for the good of the country. THEN they up their own salaries to between $1,000,000 - $3,000,000  A YEAR and say "sorry, we cannot work for anything less". So basically 70% of Singaporeans should sacrifice while the ministers can enjoy life without hardship (less than $1,000,000 a year = hardship???). Ridiculous.<br></div>
