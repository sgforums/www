Follow your heart.</div>

Ask yourself where your interest lies and seek the right path(JC/Poly). Take into consideration of what type of jobs/responsibilities for your path (you may like to check out the online job search/ Straits Times/ career book/ talk to poly or JC personnel/ discuss with your school teacher to further understand).<br><br>I have friend who study where his interest is, but he dun like the type of work in the real world. He realised it only after he started working.  Right now, he is working in a job that is not related/relevant to his studies. Kinda of wasted his years of study <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with Centurion -- you always have the first 3 months to 'try try' and get a feel of JC life in general, + a quick look around the specific college. if you <span style="font-style: italic;">really really </span>can't decide, i suggest you take a peek 'round poly as well... used to crash classes (the bigger lecture groups only, <span style="font-style: italic;">hor</span>) where i had friends.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>but ultimately i guess it's what <strong>feels</strong> right for you --&gt; success is more defined by what you are good ar doing rather than what you are supposed to be good at doing!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It depends whether your place personal satisfaction with your job in life higher than the money you can earn.Sometimes, following your heart may not give you a steady income in our straitlaced economy.For others, they are at their happiest when they have financial security.<br><br>Poly or A levels..Its your choice.The cultures are different.I may be biased but the poly route is more geared towards very serious business-minded people whereas the JC crowd mainly place an emphasis on the more bigger picture..at least for people who take up Arts.They might shy away from the rigid system and are able to think more critically about issues which bother them.The good thing about poly is that it helps to you to stand on your two feet, in terms of study and research.Its like a watered down version of university.<br><br>Ask around.Do not base your decision on just a few sources.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like most of the above have already said. Trying out JC for the 1st three months is a good idea. For one, it gives you a feel of how JC life is like, and second, most JC students would agree that their 1st three months was the best a most fun time of their JC. So even if you feel like JC's not the place for you, at least you get to know more ppl and have fun.<br><br></div>
