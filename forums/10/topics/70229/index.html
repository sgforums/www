            <div class='col-md body'>personally i'm against it , totally. like what someone said it might lead to animal sex which is possible, and i really don't  like the fact that one day my son might grow up gay, not because he is one, but because some gay friend give him the impression that its ok to be gay and everyone should be which is the case for some people right now. But i think the govt should legalise it and let the people choose for ourselves what we're going to do about it, what we need is a level playing field for everyone if we're to be judged by our merits not by our religion\sexual preference\age\sex</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hehe guess this homosexuality thingy is very common now.. personally i do not voilently object to it...... i feel tat its becoming a trend.. teenagers do this to like seek attention or to find out more abt themselves or even to be different to stand out.. ... up bring plays also plays a big part in this.. most of the ppl i know who are not straight normally become straight when the "trend" dies out.. or when they are not in the company of their not straight friends.. i know a few who are straight now but was not a few years back.. well....guess if singapore wanna legalise it it would  create a huge stir in the religious grps.... besides i think the older generation will be the first the object to it....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>Our system and society IS NOT ready for this.</strong></blockquote>True. One could argue that marriages are no big deal, for example, when orthodox marriages (guy/girl) are held, noone cares, apart from the bride/groom and their families and friends, as well as the hotel (moslty hotels/function rooms) people who are present... or the church in which they are wed. Even though a marriage could have been held yesterday, I would not know about it because I am unrelated to the people, thus, the masses wont be offended by same sex marriages because most of them wont know about it, marriages are not really made public, like American Idol.<br><br>However, if we did have gay marriages, there would be a stigma in this society, people will find it weird and strange. If let unchecked we could have inter-sexual-orientation conflict. Also some marriages are covered on the news, e.g. i remember watching a canine marriage between 2 dogs, what a wase of time. So imagine, if we had a gay marriage, it might be covered. There would be protests from church goers at the church where the marriage is held, there would also be discontent by people who stay at the hotels where the marriage function dinner is held.<br><br>My point: As others have pointed out. Gay marriages are not ready to be had, because of repurcussions that could arise from them. MArriages are more public than "gay clubs at night" and "2 men walking along Orchard embracing each other". Marriages are more public than we think.</div>
