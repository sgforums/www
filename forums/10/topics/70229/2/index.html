I find that a refreshing occurrence, a saving of breath from the constant demonisation. unfortunately, no Christian so far seems to be suggesting such a move, or minister by the count (htne, our ministers dun usually suggest anything real useful, sigh). as far as it seems to me, juz like the cases of capital punnishment, our conservatist Asian mindset is at work here, and what's more strong than a cause supposedly supported by non-Asian religious beliefs?<br><br>the  dissappointed pikamaster<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dare to Disturb the Universe</span></div>

Those pple who are strong in heart will turn out to be like Phillip Lee. however, others may turn into murdererers, bandits, kidnappers, molesters, robbers, drug addicts and drug traffickers. n those are much worse.<br><br>I agree with Devil's Advocate that Homos are people who need help, and badly, maybe some kind of therapy or something. For I believe, that deep down inside they will feel insecure, and not merely because of pple's social stigma (like i have mentioned b4, SG is a VERY CONSERVATIVE Asian society), like a person with Down's Syndrome or a person with Cancer. To exclude them merely adds fuel to the fire. I believe that all this present hullaboo stems from the following:<br><br>1) some slightly more extremist pple don a fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible's words on homosexuality. tot hem, because Homosexuality is a sin as bad as Murder, homosexuals shoulld be considered as criminals, and unfit for society. these pple forget that God wanted them to help these pple reform.<br><br>2) the social stigma turns on biological defense mechanisms in the homosexuals, which causes them to start agitating for their "rights".<br><br>3) politicians like George Bush, to further their own popularity, pound in much rhetoric about the Sanctity of Marriage and how it must be kept, and start suggesting laws that explicity define homosexuality as a crime, worsening the situation. in SG, we have a wonderful constitution that guarantees pple basic freedoms unless they "infringe on national interests, security or <strong>public morality</strong>". As seems to be the legal custom here, these three restrictions are not clearly defined, and become the much-hyped "OB markers".<br><br>the arixion</div>

I mean if you go to Thailand, a lot of people I had seen had uncommon sexual preferences... If people are more strict about this issue, less support are given to these group, then in the end lesser people will turn out to be "abnormal". Of course one might argue that it maybe because people are more open and display their preferences publicly, however I still feel that the number had increased because there is support for such behavior.<br><br>Of course people may be born as abnormal with XXY chrom. However even as such, these people still have a choice to lead normal or abnormal lives. Personally I know of a few sissy people who still get married and give birth to babies. This is also the case for girls who are extremely tomboyish.<br><br>Another issue is, if these gay couple are allowed to adopt children, will they set as a bad example for these children ? I mean most likely that child, if it is a male, will end up to be gay too.<br><br>Question is, is it good for society to have more gays and lesbians or more normal people ?<br><br></div>

However, they Â‘mayÂ’ only lack in one aspect, they do not contribute to the growing population ie 0 birth rate. However, they do make up by starting a family and adopting orphan kids or babies. Thus, stimulating the demand and supply for kids or babies, if there is sufficient gay families, there can be a decent demand for orphans or babies. Thus, benefiting the society as orphans can live together in a foster home with a gay family as the society does not need to pay for the needs and welfare for the orphans anymore(<span style="color: darkblue;">less strain on the governmentÂ’s budget on expenditure, thus a tiny reduction in taxes</span>). Chances are, these orphan kids will be brought up happier and have a brighter prospect of being more productive.(<span style="color: indigo;">Increased benefit to society and less of a nuisance to society if orphans are brought up in a halfway house</span>)<br><br>- Through these simple reasons (thereÂ’s more complicated economic terms which I prefer not to go into, so its pretty much in layman and logical reasonings) one can <span style="color: violet;">deduct that gay people are just as beneficial to the society as normal people. </span><br><br>Like I said, love is blind...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what i think..<br><br>Its a matter of freedom for individuals.. maybe even talking about human rights.. i do not think its right.. to the point that if there is going to be a rally outside parliament building on this one i will join in.. culture or not i think such homo behaviour have been around for ages.. and yet this has not been really "banned" and homo's made to conform.. the general consensus is that most are rather indifferent. To the point that, there are no anti-gay/ lesbian policies to discourange this sort of thing. not long ago, GCT said that they are gays working in govt.. so what does this say? i think govt here and abroad are afraid of crossing that line to ban it altogether and maybe even knowing that establishing such bans will not be useful all the same... also knowing that such acts are not really going to kill anyone and make people lesser in anyway.. maybe the population policies wont work anymore but still its not like ethnic cleansing crimes..<br><br>last word.. no no no no for me..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have read all the comments on this topic and I am just shocked by the ignorance and intolarance some people have towards gays and lesbians in society. Some of you talk about how 'society' cannot accept it, but who is deciding this? You?<br><br>In Singapore we are proud to say we are multiracial and multicultural yet a simple idea of acceptance and respect for diversty and people seem to be lacking. Is it right for anyone to place judgement on what goes on in the bedrooms of anyone. How if I said that I dont like the fact that some snore while they sleep and we as 'society' should stop this by reforming them, by putting them on the medical table and carve a bigger nostrail for the snorers so that they can be like 'us'.<br><br>Who are you to say that one should not do something because you dont like it. Have gays and lesbians harm you in anyway? Have they hurt your sense of identity? (maybe you are a closet then) The problem I have with the commentors (some of them) is that you all need to understand that the whole concept of being multicultural is that we accept everyone and respect their way of life.<br><br>I think if SG does not find ways to accept ALL people equally (be it skin colour or sexual orientation), we are going to be an oppressive society like the States. What is so scary about gay marriages? Personally I do not know. All I know is that if my gay friends were to get married, I will celebrate they joy and love.<br><br>All religions preach of love and peace, yet people like you, the hate starters, the gay bashers, the self righteous and 'civilised' bunch, are killing the others who just want to be equally accepted in society and are struggling to be heard, where years of senseless fear and discrimination has created a world filled with selfish firestarters.<br><br>Preech love not hate. Personally, those who truely condamn gay marriages should be the ones selected to be resocialised to respect and love again. Dont talk about how society does not accept it. Activism should start at the individual level, so make it clear do u accept it or not, because I am part of society and I do accept gay marriages and I do not want to be part of your hateful scam.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SgGlobalist</strong> , u are right to say that change starts from the individual.<br><br>but we cannot ignore the fact that THIS society needs more information to balance the centuries of deeply entrenched homophobic discourse.<br><br><strong>it is unfair of u to accuse people who are addressing the complexities of this situation of participating in a "hateful scam".</strong><br><br>and are u sure all religion preaches unconditional love and acceptance?<br><br>christianity is overtly hostile to homosexuality, as is islam. christianity, i would venture, wasn't always so... but how it came to be is best left to another discussion... its a long, tedious history.<br><br>confucian-taoism is homophobic as well. again, long, tedious history best left to another discussion...<br><br>theravada buddhism offers a more nuanced view towards sex and sexuality, but i've never heard it said out loud today that they unconditionally accept homosexuality. why? cultural cross-fertilization... that's why...<br><br>in this modern rojak globalised world, beliefs have been mixing and matching in a most bizarre manner for over 200 years... and one aspect that has permeated every culture and religion in the process, is homophobia.<br><br>and this is not an automatic, self-evident process... powerful ideologies were at work all this while.<br><br>i am one who believes that the modern notion of sexuality and sexual norms are not natural categories, but artificial constructs. unfortunately, constructs become concrete over time for many pple.<br><br>until we can properly understand that, i don't think "universal love" is a compelling enough argument to change the opinions of minds who had always believed that they are correct in denouncing homosexuality.<br></div>
