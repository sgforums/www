              <p><strong>Helping low-wage workers top Govt priorty: PM  <br></strong> <br>HELPING low-wage workers to earn more through training and upgrading is a top Government priority, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong pledged on Thursday.</p>
              <p>He said the trade unions are very seized by this issue and the Government is paying a lot of attention to these workers to help them catch up with the others.</p>
              <p>'I know many unionists are concerned about these workers, because their incomes have not increased as much as others, or may even have stagnated,' he told some 1,500 trade union members in his May Day Rally address at Downtown East on Thursday morning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> <br>'This is a top priority for the Government; in fact, we are doing many things to help them.'</p>
              <p>These include providing more opportunities for training and upgrading and investing more in the Continuing Education and Training (CET) programme.</p>
              <p>Also in place is the Workfare Income Supplement, from which some $300 million has been given out to some 300,000 low-wage workers this year to raise their income and CPF savings. It is also a way to encourage employers to hire locals.</p>
              <p>The National Trade Union Congress (NTUC) is also doing its part by helping workers to upgrade their skills, and casual and contract workers to secure CPF, medical benefits and training.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee said the Government is giving its full backing and support to these efforts and NTUC chief Lim Swee Say is personally leading many of them.</p>
              <p>While these measures may not produce instant results, in the long-term, they are the most effective ways to help low-wage workers, he added.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee said he recently met the NTUC Central Committee which was 'very seized with this issue' and wanted to know what more could be done to address the low-wage workers issue.</p>
              <p>Acknowledging that is not an easy problem to solve, PM Lee said countries around the world are also grappling with it.</p>
              <p>There are no short cuts. Having a minimum wage or shutting out foreign workers will not work, he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Most S'poreans are doing well</strong><br>PM Lee also urged the people to see the issue in context. He said the majority of Singaporeans are doing well and household incomes across the board have increased.</p>
              <p>Singapore's jobless is at a very low rate of 2.9 per cent, while the employment rate is at record highs. More Singaporeans are employed than ever before, despite all the foreign workers here.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee noted that especially good progress has been made among older workers aged 55 to 64, with 74 per cent of the men in age group still working. This is among the highest level in the world, he said.</p>
              <p>Research and innovation to attract new projects<br>The Government will improve the lives of all by developing the abilities and talents of Singaproeans to the fullest.</p>
              <p>It will complement this by building new upstream capabilities through research and innovation to attract new activities and projects, and upgrade and transform our economy.</p>
              <p>It will invest in education to equip the young generation to do well and stress quality education for every child.</p>
              <p>In the long-term, this is the best way to minimise the problem of low-wage workers, said Mr Lee.</p>
              <p>Citing ITE graduates as an example, PM said they are in demand, with 93 per cent of them finding jobs within six months, and drawing good starting salaries of around $1,400, on average.</p>
              <p>'This is the way to grow our economy, create more jobs and opportunities, and improve the lives of all workers,' said Mr Lee.</p>
              <p>'Not just highly qualified and educated workers, but all collars - from cleaners and security guards to technical and professional staff. Not just young workers, but all ages - from new job entrants, to mid-career and mature workers. Not just local workers, but all nationalities - from Singaporeans to others who are here to help us reach our goals.'<br> </p>

              <p><strong>PM Lee cautions S'poreans to prepare for economic slowdown<br>By Dominique Loh, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 01 May 2008 1808 hrs</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE : Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has cautioned Singaporeans to be prepared for a slowing economy in the next few quarters.</p>
              <p>Speaking in Malay, Mandarin and English at the May Day Rally, Mr Lee told workers that Singapore's economy may have done well so far in 2008, but developments in the US economy may still have an impact on the country.</p>
              <p>A boisterous and cheerful crowd greeted the prime minister, as he joined more than 1,500 workers to celebrate Labour Day. But amidst the happy mood was a stark reminder of the challenges ahead.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee said the US sub-prime crisis has spread through its banking system and beyond. While the immediate danger is over, there is still the ripple effect. He painted three scenarios of how the US economy might affect Singapore.</p>
              <p>The first scenario is a mild recession but with growth at the end of the year. Second, if the US problems persist, it'll slow Singapore's growth as well, even going into 2009. The third scenario is a severe US downturn which most analysts agree is unlikely to happen.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee believes the first two scenarios are more likely.</p>
              <p>"For this year, we can still achieve a 4-6 percent growth which MTI (Ministry of Trade and Industry) has projected. But remember, the 4-6 percent (growth) is for the whole year. The first quarter was good, (but for the) second, third and fourth quarters, prepare for a slowdown (which) may last into next year. This is one major uncertainty affecting our economy," said the prime minister.</p>
              <p>"Employers and workers have to bear this in mind when you negotiate your CAs (collective agreements) this year. You have to ensure that any built-in wage increases are sustainable and if the companies are still doing well, reward the workers with higher variable bonuses, and keep it flexible," he added.</p>
              <p>Another concern is the rising cost of living.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee said the government had just given out the first instalment of Growth Dividends to some 2.4 million Singaporeans. The second payment is due in October.</p>
              <p>Overall, each household can expect some S$5,000 to cope with the rising costs.</p>
              <p>On the issue of foreign labour, PM Lee said foreign workers are willing to work longer hours to keep the airport, factories and hotels open 24 hours a day throughout the year. And that gives Singapore a more competitive edge. And he added that keeping foreign workers away is not the answer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It's because we have the foreign workers here, that's why our economy has grown, that's why the employers, ...companies are here, and that's why Singaporeans have jobs. You send away the foreign workers,... a few hundred thousand (of them), Singaporeans (won't) go into those jobs, the companies will close or leave. I think the Singaporeans unemployment will go up, and hardship will go up," said PM Lee.</p>
              <p>For those who have difficulty finding jobs, Mr Lee said there are many schemes to help them get employed. For example, the Workfare Income Supplement gave out S$300 million this year, benefiting some 300,000 low-wage workers.</p>
              <p>More jobs are also on the horizon, with some 10,000 available at the Marina Bay Integrated Resort. - CNA /ls</p>

              <p>Can there be an independent body to have all information access to the claims stated in the newspapers?</p>
              <p>Can Opposition be allowed access to all the information with full transparency for employment related information?</p>
              <p>Some of my friends want to know:</p>
              <p>1. What is the source of the information and how accurate is the information? How can this be proven to be accurate? that means, not that ah Harry say accurate means accurate. It has to be scientifically accurate, beyond any reasonable doubt.</p>
              <p>2. The news reported that the unemployment rate got worse but could not pinpoint or prove clearly beyond reasonable doubt the reason and it suspected it was due to housewives coming back to workplace.</p>
              <p>Why suspect? why no proof? What if someone else suspect other things?</p>
              <p>3. More than 55% of all all jobs created went to foreigners.  What are all these kinds of jobs that locals are not able to do?</p>
              <p>4. Of the jobs poreans occupying, how many in the statistics are partime jobs ? short term contract jobs of 1 to 3 months?</p>
              <p>5. Are students taken into employment statistics? remember last time, we were told if asked your occupation, students told to say student.</p>
