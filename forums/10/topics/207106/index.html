This would most certainly make handout distributions more equitable.<br><br>However, is this truly necessary? You left out the other part of how the government distributes their handouts, which I think is the more important one. "(ii) Your Assessable Income for the Year of Assessment 2005". This is more accurate in identifying those who really requires these transfer payments. How about putting a larger percentage of the distribution priority on received annual income? Or what about, say, family size or income-per-capita? Wouldn't that be more accurate?</div>

So, it wouldn't make much sense to transfer the handouts equally to everyone, that not only defeats the purpose but also brings the government budget into deficit for no apparent reason.</div>
