Especially about how the electorate is partially to blame for the demise of a significant opposition representation in parliament.<br><br>Ironically, your appreciation of a well thought-out and non-abusive argument is exactly what the likes of JB, Chee and Seow failed to grasp. If only they could have controlled themselves in public discourse and not be carried away to the extent of saying some pretty stupid (perhaps not factually wrong all the time, but certainly stupid) things that just begged for a lawsuit, perhaps they would still have a political career. It is a case of trying to win a battle but ending up losing the war. It's a lack of wisdom that can in vulgar terms be described as stupidity.<br><br>The opposition politicians who know how to pick their battles are the ones who are still in the game. When David is fighting a political behemoth 10 times the size of Goliath, it's no longer about trying to win every fight that comes your way; it's about playing the game right so at the end of the day, you still have a tomorrow to fight for the longterm cause of having a viable opposition. And believe, it is a very longterm cause. They can ill afford to lose any more troops to lawsuits which result from stupid words and behavior.<br><br>I look forward to another well-thought out, calm and objective rebuttal. That's political discourse.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by patriot:</div><div class="quote_body">The opposition politicians who know how to pick their battles are the ones who are still in the game. When David is fighting a political behemoth 10 times the size of Goliath, it's no longer about trying to win every fight that comes your way; it's about playing the game right so at the end of the day, you still have a tomorrow to fight for the longterm cause of having a viable opposition. And believe, it is a very longterm cause. They can ill afford to lose any more troops to lawsuits which result from stupid words and behavior.<br></div></blockquote>That Low and Chiam are still in the parliament could be attributed to their tenacity and skill in balancing on the thin line of voicing opposition to PAP policies, while not crossing any overly sensitive boundaries (OB markers) resulting in the revoking of whatever scant tolerance that is in place for them.<br><br>But what did they achieve beyond their struggling survival? At the end of the day, their presence serves only to give credence to the facade of Singaporean democracy. Their influence in the parliament is essentially nothing.<br><br>This, is the reason why the kids gloves are on when the PAP deals with the two Â– even the ex-PM chips in a praise or two for them occasionally, in recognition for them knowing of their proper place.<br><br>The full ferocity of the PAP fell upon the likes of Seow, Tang, and Chee (at the beginning of his career) because they represented a possible threat. They are not only persons of intelligence Â– more importantly they are charismatic speakers. Most important of all Â– they have ambition and seek to produce that which is taboo Â– not just a niche in the parliament, but a real, effective political alternative to the PAP.<br><br>ItÂ’s not just about picking battles, itÂ’s about what one represents and strives to be. To capture the hearts of the people it is not enough that one hides in shadows, and debate occasionally when there are Â‘safeÂ’ battles to engage.<br><br>While I do respect the two for their efforts and the sacrifices they made, it is still my firm belief that neither Low nor Chiam have what it takes to capture the imagination of the people.<br><br>They do not inspire, they do not captivate. They lack the essential qualities to become an alternative leader, and it is because of this that they are never subjected to the venom and the scale of the attacks that was directed at the three.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by patriot:</div><div class="quote_body">It is perfectlly natural for an institution to defend itself when it see s a threat. Fortress PAP is no different. If they see a horde of babarians (which is an accurate term to discribe the behavior of a certain oppostion politician) coming to attack their fort, their walls are only gonna get higher and thicker and their boulders are only gonna get heavier and more formidable. And in the political landcape in Singapore, the towers of Fortress PAP are very high and their boulders are extremely heavy.</div></blockquote>I agree that it is completely normal for the PAP to retaliate against challengers.<br><br>That which was alarming, was the extent and the severity which rules are bent to achieve political domination. That which was shocking, was the willingness to bent the rules at the drop of a hat.<br><br>Observers of the process of equating the party with the nation might feel uneasy. Observers of the practice of equating national resources as party resources might be worried. Observers, who noticed that accountability of the party existing only within the party and not the people, might question the impartiality and dependability of the PAPÂ’s system of self-checks.<br><br>In other words, what which is worrying is not the fact that the PAP fights back when challenged.<br><br>That which is worrying is the methods that were used.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong>So if an individual is unhappy with the way the PAP runs Singapore and wants to do something about it besides b*itch about it at kopi tiams and Internet forums, then he'd better think seriously about his approach. Would he want to attack the fort from the outside or affect change from the inside? He'd have to ask himself which would be more effective.</strong></blockquote>Change from the inside?<br><br>What I feel is desperately needed, is not so much a change to the PAP, but a change to the political equation here.<br><br>By and large, the PAP is a good team that has done a great job of building up Singapore into what it is today. They have a system of meritocracy that while not being perfect is still a good functional model where ability are recognized and rewarded. They have a system of governance that is mostly corruption free, and very efficient.<br><br>What I feel that is very important for Singapore is an independent party (or more) functioning both as a check and balance, as well as a political alternative.<br><br>Why an independent audit? There is a very good reason why corporations are subjected to frequent audits by external, independent auditors Â– self checks have a long history of failure in the face of the human trait of protecting self interests.<br><br>As for the cultivation of a political alternative, it is again a fact of history that there has never been a perfect government that remained good forever. Sadly, the odds are very much against one ever appearing.<br><br>The presence of a political alternative gives the people the true democratic power that we now lack Â– the ability to choose the stewards to run our country, the ability to seize back power and transfer it Â– when a party performs badly and loses the faith of the people.<br><br>The cultivation of a political alternative is a labor requiring the will and the support of the people. Even then, it will take time. To hope for a political alternative to spring out miraculously from nothing when things go bad Â– It's a lack of wisdom that can in vulgar terms be described as stupidity.<br></div>
