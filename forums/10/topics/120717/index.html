            <div class='col-md body'>One of the reasons y soll many anti-pap ppl here:<br><br>Associated Press<br>&gt; Singapore Inflation Hits Poor Hard<br>&gt; Tuesday March 15, 1:40 am ET<br>&gt; Singapore Inflation Hits Lower Income Residents<br>&gt;<br>&gt; SINGAPORE (AP) -- Poorer Singaporeans were hardest hit by inflation<br>&gt; last year, according to figures released by the Statistics Department<br>&gt; on Tuesday.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; According to the department, the consumer price index for the poorest<br>&gt; 20 percent of Singapore rose 2.3 percent in 2004, against an average<br>&gt; increase of 1.7 percent for all households.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; For the middle 60 percent of households by income, prices rose 1.5<br>&gt; percent last year, while the top 20 percent experienced a 0.3 percent<br>&gt; increase in their cost of living.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The government said the main contributors to the increase in the<br>&gt; Consumer price index for all income groups were more expensive<br>&gt; cigarettes, cooked food, petrol, newspapers, as well as higher<br>&gt; tuition fees paid to foreign universities.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "The price increases for the middle 60 percent and higher 20 percent<br>&gt; income groups were partially moderated by lower car prices and<br>&gt; government levy on foreign maids, as well as cheaper accommodation,"<br>&gt; the department said.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Singapore's consumer price index was 0.5 percent in 2003.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This maybe another reason:<br><br>Mellanie Hewlitt<br>Singapore Review<br>10 Jan 2005<br><br>JOB MARKET IMPERFECTIONS? LIVE WITH IT!!!<br><br>An analysis of Labor Department data by EPI found that in 2002, 18.1<br>per cent<br>of the long-term unemployed had college degrees, up from 14 per cent<br>in 2000.<br>Similarly, 20.1 per cent were from the executive, professional and<br>managerial<br>category, compared with 14.2 per cent in 2000.<br><br>With no viable solutions available from Singapore's highly paid<br>ministers, the<br>only respite to the current economic gloom is a quick recovery and<br>turn around<br>of the US economy. Otherwise Singapore's next batch of PHD and MBA<br>scholars<br>will have employment selling char kway teow or flipping burgers in<br>Mac-Donald's.<br><br>In the 12 July 2003 issue of the Straits Times, Lydia Lim's article<br>reads; "SLOWLY but surely, reality is sinking in in the psyches of<br>out-of-work",<br>"NIGHT SHIFT? NO PROBLEM", "FROM CORPORATE BANKER TO DIAPER CHANGER".<br>More recently in the 9 Jan 2005 issue of the Straits Times,<br>"She gave up $10,000 a month bank job" and "He graduated to selling<br>prata"<br>(attached below)<br>http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages/?msg=63929.1<br><br>Reading between the lines, it seems that local papers are endorsing<br>this dismal<br>state and telling readers and Singaporeans to accept and live with<br>this<br>imperfect situation.<br><br>The startling fact is that even with a supposedly rosy economy,<br>soaring<br>unemployment rates amongst Singaporeans remain above 4.5%. There is<br>an over<br>supply of middle management professionals who are now forced to<br>compete for<br>lower tiered jobs with fresh graduates and non-graduates.<br><br>It seems that the recovering economy that is much touted by local<br>government<br>controled papers have not translated into reduced unemployment rates<br>for local<br>Singaporeans. There are already many examples of overqualified<br>professionals<br>who are forced into menial enterprise. Many become cab-drivers or<br>hawkers to<br>tide over the bad times. Did these professionals spend years in<br>university just<br>to be security guards, hawkers or cab drivers?<br><br>From an economic perspective, education is a scarce resource and<br>there is huge<br>amount of wastage in terms of unutilised skills and talents.<br><br>What is even more amusing is the latest attempt by the local papers<br>and mass<br>media, to glorify such cases (see 12 Jan 2003 issue of the New<br>Paper "From<br>banking man (earning five-digit monthly pay) to Golden Mile nasi<br>lemak man<br>Why"). See also the 9 Jan 2005 issue of the Straits Times, "She gave<br>up $10,000<br>a month bank job" and "He graduated to selling prata" (attached below)<br><br>Does the current system work, or is it making an already bad<br>unemployment<br>situation, even worse? Only in Singapore do we have a government that<br>is so<br>engrossed with the accumulation of paper qualifications, that they<br>have long<br>since forgotten the original objective behind the education system,<br>and have<br>instead identified the means as an end to itself.<br><br>In their blind pursuit of their version of a utopian society,<br>educational<br>elitetism takes center stage above all else, eclipsing the actual<br>needs of the<br>labour market itself. The distortions in the demand and supply chain<br>is most<br>acute in industries that are dominated by State Owned Entities and<br>Government<br>Linked Companies who are also affectionately known by locals<br>as "Scholar Havens"<br><br>This growing number of graduates employed in menial labour is not<br>something to<br>be proud of. It is a sign that the system is not putting scarce and<br>valuable<br>resource to good use. What is even more appalling is that instead of<br>acknowledging this defect exists in the system and looking for<br>solutions to<br>address the problem, policy makers and local papers are telling<br>unemployed<br>professionals and graduates to "live with it".<br><br>Unemployed professionals are told that it is "imperative for those<br>out of work<br>to follow the lead of their more enlightened counterparts, who dared<br>to say:<br>Social status be damned, I need a job." This totally avoids the crux<br>of the<br>problem!<br><br>The underlying issue here is that due to the inability of the<br>domestic economy<br>to generate higher echelon jobs, and a very weak employment market,<br>graduates<br>(and Professionals) are often unable to find jobs in positions that<br>they were<br>academically trained for.<br><br>This is not a failing on the part of the individual, but rather a<br>failing on<br>the part of the system, and yes, ultimately the government. And a<br>necessary<br>step in addressing this defect is to acknowledge that it exists and<br>needs to be<br>fixed.<br><br>But then again, in Singapore it is far easier to change a person's<br>mindset and<br>expectations, instead of finding an actual solution to a worsening<br>problem. And<br>policy makers here have elected the easier and more convenient route.</div>
