            <div class='col-md body'>This is ridiculous to say the least. 4 words for the way our beloved gov. is doing things...Big Mouth,Small Balls.<br><br>If you wanna take centre-stage in the world, please be ready to accept the cultures which others follow.Frankly...why go about all this yellow ribbon project bullshit to give ex-offenders another chance when they are not willing to give others a chance. I mean from my perspective is that, if you create trouble in a foreign land, tt's the problem between you and tt country. By debarring this group of activists from entry, the scenario is this:" You go to M'sia to buy chewing gum, the media there sees you, and recongnizes you as a S'porean as you drove there. But they film you buying, and then thats it. You eat the gum and spit out. Later when you cross the border, custom/police arrest you, say they saw on TV that you buys chewing gum which is not allowed." Makes sense? I certainly doubt it.<br><br>Anyway...just alittle curious, any of these accreditied activtist held protests in the little square they provide at Suntec. Why didn't the PM,Minister of Foreign Affairs go up and give a few words to the world press to highlight and help them understand out stand. It makes a helluva difference for some top dog in SPF with a couple of pips on the shoulders to talk to the masses and someone such as the PM or Minister of Foreign Affairs to come up to issue a public statement of clarification to educate the world press and help them see from "our" perspective.I mean to the world press, even if you're the commissioner of the police, so what? You're just the big fish in the small puddle of water, even if ask the CDF to make statement also liddat wat.<br><br>It is actually in my view totally inappoporiate for military and LE personal to give statements to the world press,as every word they say can and will be nit-picked and fogged to create new meaning.Look at Iraq, you don't see American or Coalition troops and officers below the grade of BG, unless they are the unit's spoke's person and have been given a script by higher up to say no more then this to the public. Can't that ang mo chap when given his 2 minutes of fame simply give the media 2 words to questions which they can nit-pick, fog up and re-interprest, the 2 words being "No Comments"which reflect professionalism in terms of OPSEC and also protects your own ass from being torn infront of the world!!!The lesser you say, the lesser can go wrong...don't you guys agree?</div>

All the preparations makes us look good? No i dont think so if its just a one time effort to "paint a beautiful picture."<br><br>Sometimes i wonder when i hear abt the IMF news on tv...Since when are we such a great city. Does the govt try to improve this and that here and there genuinely to improve our lives. A big fat NO here again..<br><br>Just hate all this show going on. Proud of that.

            <div class='col-md body'>then Singapore shouldn't even host the IMF event...if the govt thinks it can apply its 'uniquely singapore' style of treatment like it does to suppress its citizens and micro manage every speckle of details to the whole wide world,  they must soberly wake up. singapore is not there yet or fit enough to change the tradition or how these events are being held. If protestors are part and parcel of the game and they are there for the sake of making their voices heard and engaging decision makers, would barring them discourage further protests in the future even if it was held at a different venue? those highly paid but inexperienced elites organizing this 4 million 'smiles' campaign must be so high up their horse thinking that Singapore is such an exemplary model of a fine city, a great democracy, a vibrant place that we must lay down the red carpet and sweep all skeletons underneath... but think about it, even the supposed parliament sessions today is like a staged event where the ruling party have the control and all final say. Debate all they want, you can just see ministers dozing off because whatever noise is being made, the outcomes are already determined. they must be thinking all other discussions in the world are held this way? But what's the use of a mock up parliament farce? E.g. where's all the excitment of watching a parliament today then say in the 80's with JBJ? alas, he was last spotted in some documentaries as a frail old man with a sore voice peddling books by the MRT station because he got sued till his pants dropped...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by pipipopo:</div><div class="quote_body">To all those i diots who support riots and against the decision made by SPF,<br><br>if a riot break out and property damaged...both foreign owned and sg owned...who pay? all those who agree with IMF should pay....not me coz i support SPF's decisioon...wise indeed!</div></blockquote></div>
