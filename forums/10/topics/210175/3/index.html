Ai Kia, mai sng"<br>English;"Want to play, don't be afraid. Afraid, then don't play."<br><br>==========================================<br>Singapore Assailed for Barring Activists<br><br>By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA<br>Associated Press Writer<br><br>SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore breached an agreement by barring at least two dozen activists from entering the country to attend the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the institutions said Thursday.<br><br>"We're very displeased with the current state of affairs," said Kevin Shaw Kellems, senior adviser to World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz. "There was not an indication until late in the game that there was going to be a problem."<br><br><strong>The dispute highlighted tension between Singapore's strict controls on politics and expression, and efforts by the IMF and the World Bank to be more open to the views of grassroots groups that have accused them of <span style="color: red;">elitism</span>. It also threatened to taint Singapore's efforts as host of the Washington-based groups to showcase its economy and hospitality on a global stage.</strong><br><br>Singaporean authorities said the city-state was "aware of its obligations under the MOU (memorandum of understanding) and would continue to honor them."<br><br>"However, the MOU also obliges Singapore to take all necessary measures for the safe passage of all persons in and out of Singapore and for their personal security and the safety of their property and the property of the organizations and delegations," a government statement said.<br><br>Singaporean police had earlier said 28 activists would not be allowed entry for the IMF and World Bank meetings on Monday and Tuesday, but the government said Thursday the number was 27.<br><br>Singapore said the activists had been involved in "disruptive activities" in other nations. They did not identify the activists, but said some had participated in anti-globalization protests that turned violent in Seattle, Italy and Mexico.<br><br>Kellems said the IMF and the World Bank had accredited the activists, and that Singapore's rationale for denying entry was unclear.<br><br>Latest News<br>Singapore Assailed for Barring Activists<br><br>"I see on-the-record comments from various (Singaporean) officials on various days," he said at a news conference.<br><br>"You may have seen some of the flavor of those comments; words like 'security,' words like 'undesirable,' words like 'troublemaker,' that sort of general characterization, but never have I seen a consistent coherent explanation," Kellems said.<br><br>He read a statement accusing Singapore of violating a Sept. 23, 2003, agreement on the attendance of accredited activists at the meetings, and he urged Singapore to let them come.<br><br>"We work with these representatives of civil societies, and we value their role - even when we disagree with what they say," the statement said.<br><br>Some foreign activists already in Singapore for the meetings said they planned to boycott some official events in protest.<br><br>"It's such a shame that Singapore hasn't opened its arms to everyday people who just want to talk about the World Bank meetings and state their cases," said Sandy Krawitz, spokeswoman for South Africa-based ActionAid International.<br><br>Singapore banned outdoor demonstrations during the IMF-World Bank meetings, saying they could lead to violence and damage to property. It set aside an indoor area where activists can gather to express their views.<br><br>In Indonesia, media said the government will allow activists to gather on Batam island, a short ferry ride from Singapore.<br><br>[/b]</div>
