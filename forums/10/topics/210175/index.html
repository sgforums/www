"There was not an indication until late in the game that there was going to be a problem."<br><br>The dispute highlighted tension between Singapore's strict controls on politics and expression, and efforts by the IMF and the World Bank to be more open to the views of grassroots groups that have accused them of elitism. It also threatened to taint Singapore's efforts as host of the Washington-based groups to showcase its economy and hospitality on a global stage.<br><br>Singaporean police had said the activists would not be allowed entry for the IMF and World Bank meetings on Monday and Tuesday because they had been involved in "disruptive activities" in other nations. They did not identify the activists, but said some had participated in anti-globalization protests that turned violent in Seattle, Italy and Mexico.<br><br>Kellems, however, said the IMF and the World Bank had accredited the activists, and that Singapore's rationale for denying entry was unclear.<br><br>"There's insufficient clarity. I see on-the-record comments from various (Singaporean) officials on various days," he said at a news conference at the convention center where the meetings will be held.<br><br>"You may have seen some of the flavor of those comments; words like 'security,' words like 'undesirable,' words like 'troublemaker,' that sort of general characterization, but never have I seen a consistent coherent explanation," Kellems said.<br><br>The World Bank official read a statement accusing Singapore of violating a Sept. 23, 2003, agreement on the attendance of accredited activists at the meetings, and he urged Singapore to let them come.<br><br>"We work with these representatives of civil societies, and we value their role - even when we disagree with what they say," the statement said.<br><br>Singapore's police said it objected to the accreditation of the activists for the meetings, The Straits Times newspaper reported.<br><br>"If they decide to come to Singapore, we will assess their suitability to enter Singapore subject to a set of security criteria," a police statement said. "If they meet the criteria, they will be allowed into Singapore."<br><br>Singapore's police said it deported two Filipino activists and one Indian activist who arrived at the airport but were not accredited.<br><br>"Following interviews, and after full consideration of the circumstances, it was decided that the three persons should be deported as it was assessed that they posed a potential security and public order threat to the annual meetings," a police statement said.<br><br>The Filipino activists were China Leah Ramos of the Jubilee South and Global Call to Action Against Poverty, and Bobbie Diciembre of the Freedom from Debt Coalition. Marivic Raquiza, another Filipino activist, said her colleagues were interrogated and detained for five hours and slept in an airport barracks before deportation.<br><br>The European Union urged Singapore to allow accredited activists into the country for the conference of the IMF and World Bank.<br><br>"The (EU) presidency attaches great importance to an open and constructive dialogue between civil society and the World Bank institutions," said a statement issued by Finland, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency.<br><br>Singapore banned outdoor demonstrations during the IMF-World Bank meetings, saying they could lead to violence and damage to property. It set aside an indoor area where activists can gather to express their views.<br><br>In Indonesia, media said the government will allow activists to gather on Batam island, a short ferry ride from Singapore.<br><br></div>

It has warned that some 28 activists from eight civil society organisations could be turned away, even though they have been accredited by the World Bank for meetings starting today.<br><br>A top World Bank official disagreed with this approach yesterday.<br><br>Excluding activists who have been "cleared" by their respective governments was a "breach" of a memorandum of understanding that Singapore signed with the World Bank three years ago, said Kevin Kellems, senior advisor to the president of World Bank Group in a statement.<br><br>"We work with these representatives of civil society and we value their role even when we disagree with what they say.<br><br>"These individuals have been cleared by their respective home governments and should not be excluded from our annual meetings.<br><br>"We continue to urge the Government of Singapore to let them participate by assuring expeditious entry procedures including the issuance of visas Â… for any observers and other persons Â… who are accredited to or invited by the organisers to be present for the meeting," said Mr Kellems, who is also the acting vice-president for external affairs at the World Bank.<br><br>Responding to Mr Kellem's remarks, a government spokesperson from the organising committee said: "We have just heard about it and are looking into it."<br><br>The Singapore police are firm on turning away anyone who could pose a "security and law and order threat".<br><br>Activists have been known to participate in violent protests before and some of them had threatened "vigorous action" in Singapore during the International Monetary Fund IMF-World Bank meet.<br><br>The activists will be interviewed before authorities decide whether to let them in or turn them back.<br><br>Three foreigners have been denied entry at Changi Airport since Tuesday.<br><br>Two Filipino activists Â— a man and a woman Â— were put on planes back to Manila after being quizzed for more than five hours by immigration officers. Chona Leah Ramos of anti-globalisation group Jubilee South and Bobby Diciembre of Freedom from Debt Coalition were on their way to Batam for an anti-IMF-World Bank forum, Filipino news website INQ7.net reported.<br><br>A third person, an Indian male activist, was rejected yesterday after arriving from India at 7am. At press time, the authorities were still trying to arrange his flight back.<br><br>"Following interviews, and after full consideration of the circumstances, it was decided that the three persons should be deported as it was assessed that they posed a potential security and public order threat to the Annual Meetings," police spokeswoman Grace Ting said.<br><br>The trio are not accredited by the World Bank and are not part of the 28 people whom the police have raised objection on accreditation, she added. - TODAY/sh<br></div>
