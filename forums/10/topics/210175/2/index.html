            <div class='col-md body'>The whole IMF things is stupid and embarressing. Suntec City is a fortress. It's a joke. All on the pretext that Singapore is a 'terrorist' target. I really find that hard to believe. By the way where are all this 16,000 delegates??? All i keep seeing are men in blue uniforms walking around aimlessly in Suntec City looking bored. These whole meeting is a public relation failure. The Singapore press keeps harping about the invisible delegates! I dont see any of the foreign press covering the meetings anywhere else. The government has to be accountable for the S$100million invested on this whole 1 week blooper. Whose head is going to roll here for wasting public funds??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If the purpose of hosting this event was to aggressively sell  Singapore's image to the world, then I think the PR work was not well done.<br><br>Maybe it all started out as a bright marketing idea years back when the agreement was signed, but the policies that were created following that conflicted with their objective; there was no follow-through.<br><br>I think the government could have afforded a more lex policy on civil group entry and demonstrations.  Make an effort to create an assembly that allowed for some peaceful protests and meetings.  This would have been the political and PR coup that they were trying to achieve.<br><br>Now they're doing it the usual way - 100% shut down no exceptions allowed.  While us locals are used to this method and swallow it without much protest, it won't hold up to global scrutiny.<br><br>Of course a peaceful demonstration sounds like the dream scenario and realistically speaking, we don't live in a perfect world. This notion might be just wishful thinking, a far-flung ideal.  But if they don't even TRY to achieve this, then what is the purpose of hosting this meeting?<br><br>At the very least, show that you are magnanimously allowing certain groups in, or allowing certain events to take place.  Be creative and promote what was done, not allow people to highlight what hasn't been done.<br><br>Anyway, the only winner out of this meeting is the IMF/World Bank.  They have their cake and get to eat it too!   Finally, a meeting without the pesky protestors, and they even get to come out of the event looking like a tree-loving hero - campaigning for the civil groups' entry-  while the S'pore host gets all the blame <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Who says the ideal scenario can never happen? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello everyone this is my first post into the SGforums.<br><br>I'd like you to consider what investors consider when looking at Singapore for potential as an investment.  As an investor you are looking to minimize your risk and increase your productivity. So far from these actions of our govn what kind of conclusions can you draw? I've made several broad ones for consideration.<br><br>1) Singapore govn cares about peace and the protection of the general well being of businesses and companies. (sometimes to the detriment of it's people but that covered in point 2)<br><br>2) Disruptive and antagonistic forces have no real recourse in Singapore. When was the last time you heard of an unhappy union going on strike? (and suceeding? To my knowledge the last time a strike was attempted the leader of the strike got thrown out of Singapore and the offending company got a smack on the wrist by a certain puppet master) In Singapore thats impossible with our current method of wrist slapping the company and persecuting the people. unions have no real power to apply pressure to companies to look for the well fare of the working people.<br><br>This recent rash of renagading on their previous agreement with hte IMF and WB to allow peaceful demonstrations and etc simply sends out the message that the govn has it's act together and knows how to tame/control it's people and that we're a safe country for you to invest in cause we'll never experience any civil unrest which might threaten your company.<br><br>Anyway these are my thoughts on the matter. Sure the IMF and WB may complain and whine about not having any demonstrators and Singapore may seem to be reconsidering but if they are serious about wooing investors they need to give an impression of a govn in such complete and thorough control that we are a 'safe bet' by investors.<br><br>Id like to stress these are my personal opinions and although I'm looking at it from the Govn perspective I don't agree with their methods at all. My thoughts may not necessarily flow coherently but I hope you consider them before continuing. That is all.....<br></div>
