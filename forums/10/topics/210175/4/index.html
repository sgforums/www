            <div class='col-md body'>If mass protests were allowed, then property would be damaged and lives possibly at stake. Guess what? This incident will be remembered and PAP will lose a lot of votes the next election.<br><br>Why?<br><br>1) Damages the credence of PAP in upholding law and order.<br>2) Any protests are unprecedented in our modern history. If our people can't do so, likewise for foreigners.<br>3) Foreign investors will surely get a shock and reconsider their stance on S'pore<br>4) Badly affect S'pore's image as a "squeaky clean" country and affect tourism.<br><br>and lots more reasons.<br><br>There may be a lot of us here who yearn to see the rare "turbulence" but it may not be a favourable scenario in our case. Singapore, compared to the rest of the world, is perceived very differently, albeit a safe state with obedient citizens. If mass riots happen in Seattle, life goes on as per normal but if it happens here, it would badly affect our international standing.<br><br>All this, no thanks to our kiasee govt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well.. who says that IMF can only be held in a purposeful and meaningful manner ONLY IF activists are allowed in the country? Just because violent protests AND activitsts had always been a part of previous IMF, doesn't mean that it is successful ONLY if this happens.<br><br>With regard to the swimming analogy, I would say that just because cavemen used to swim naked way before swimming costumes were invented, and cos u wanna wear a swimming costume (which serves NOTHING but protect your modesty which is really a hazy concept anyway), then u shouldnt swim.<br><br><strong>I agree w the part that transparency on the part of the govt can help issues. </strong>However, if we allow activists in, who have given police VALID reasons to stop their entry in, simply because we are hosting the IMF, then I will look down on the government who allows some outside entity to compromise the safety in the country.<br><br>Come on, our country has had a reputation for being anal and uncompromising for a lONG long time. Is this surprising this happened? No it isnt. And you know it isnt because cynical Singaporeans are just waiting for something to foul up , so you can jump on it. AND you know what? Do you seriously think savvy politicians and world leaders are not aware of this when they decide to hold the IMF in Singapore?<br><br>Like chocoB says, this is a win-win situation for them, as far as they are concerned.<br><br></div>
