If protestors are part and parcel of the game and they are there for the sake of making their voices heard and engaging decision makers, would barring them discourage further protests in the future even if it was held at a different venue? those highly paid but inexperienced elites organizing this 4 million 'smiles' campaign must be so high up their horse thinking that Singapore is such an exemplary model of a fine city, a great democracy, a vibrant place that we must lay down the red carpet and sweep all skeletons underneath... but think about it, even the supposed parliament sessions today is like a staged event where the ruling party have the control and all final say. Debate all they want, you can just see ministers dozing off because whatever noise is being made, the outcomes are already determined. they must be thinking all other discussions in the world are held this way? But what's the use of a mock up parliament farce? E.g. where's all the excitment of watching a parliament today then say in the 80's with JBJ? alas, he was last spotted in some documentaries as a frail old man with a sore voice peddling books by the MRT station because he got sued till his pants dropped...<br><br></div></blockquote>wahh...your thinking is the same as mine <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  if so problematic might as well dont host....save so much trouble for it...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

If one migrates, he/she has to consider lots of factors. If things are as simple as your "chicken rice" analogy, every democratic govt in the world would have 100% pro-votes. I don't like this govt but I'm still in their system. Sometimes one does not have a choice.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well of course I know that migration is not an easy process.... But if you don't like to eat from the current chicken rice stall, you <strong>have to make an effort </strong>to walk around the foodcourt, search for another stall that fits your taste better... you can't just stand right in front of the chicken rice stall and wait, hoping that sooner or later, some other people will buy over the stall and sell something that u like to eat....<br><br>On the other hand, if you feel that it is soooo hard to walk around the food court or change to another stall, and that you have no choice but to stick to the current chicken rice stall, then all you have to do is to leave the cucumbers aside and eat the rest of the chicken rice....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So...your point is that you guys want the protests, demonstrations and potential violence to go on?<br><br>I have a question: Can't the IMF/WB just keep they bloody mouths SHUT and stop asking for so many things? I mean, come on! We give you such a good place to host your meeting in, with so much security; what more do you want?<br><br>If you want to face the protestors then why not go to Batam after your meetings and settle it there yourself? Not in Singapore, dammit. I don't want to be stuck in a traffic jam because 22 people are sitting at the road junction having a hunger strike.<br><br>And anti-government Sgforumers, what exactly do you want?<br><br>My life in SG is peaceful and good enough, thanks. I have a flat to live in, a car to drive, a wonderful PC, a monthly salary. I can go to the movies anytime I want when I am free, and I can walk along the streets at night without fear of being mugged.<br><br>Freakass, not that i disagree with you, but your analogy sounds stupid. Comparing the politics of singapore with your food preferences is silly. You think migration is as easy as buying food from the malay stall?</div>
