And so what if we increase the minimum downpayment? It still means that only the relatively rich can afford to buy cars... which is the same situation as now... you can't have the best of both worlds.... you want cars to be affordable and yet control the car population in Singapore?<br><br>I still think conquering Asia is still the best idea....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>people cannot change stores just as they like. if you think in terms of a patrons, your analogy can apply to FT. they can have chicken rice, but when they get sated of swallowing too much cucumber, they can springboard to other stores serving fish n chips and western food. for employees working in the chicken rice store, if they suffer from low salary and high debts to pay, they have no choice but to stick with the existing ruthless and tyranical boss. and don't forget, they built the store and are entitled to a stake in the chicken rice business. unless the employees can come together to think of ways to make life more livable, what else can they do? you see, not many are as garang as harry lee; as he was trained by the israeli army, and not bookish scholars who wear coke bottle glasses. so he drives taxi and moonlight to ferry prostitutes in the hope to get more money and go perth. many cannot lah.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by freakass:</div><div class="quote_body">It's the same... If you don't like your chicken rice to come with cucumber, then eat at another chicken rice stall tht sells chicken rice without cucumber.. However, if you choose to stick to the current chicken rice stall, then just eat quietly and leave the cucumbers aside....</div></blockquote></div>

YOU DO NOT KEEP ON EATING CHICKEN RICE FROM THAT STALL, FILL UP YOUR STOMACH, AND THEN TURN AROUND TO CRITICIZE THE STALL OWNER TIME AFTER TIME AGAIN.... Afterall, you made the choice to eat from the chicken rice stall... Others may find it nice, but if you don't, please please please eat elsewhere...** [/b]</blockquote>Freakass, The Government - u mean the Lee dynasty which is true..they brought us from fishing village to a modern city. But it is not going to bring us to the global world class city where citizens can have free thoughts and expression. This kills innovations and creativity, make us forever like kid and puppy.<br><br>Critising the Govenrment action doesn't mean us unloyal to our homeland ..vice versa...supporting everything w/o thinking doesn't make anyone pro-PAP citizen. Try living in an opposition ward. Maybe Singapore shud get rid of all those who had been so enchanted with obliging with policies..all the "YES" man (citizens &amp; politicans alike) in order to bred a new generation of Singaporean.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually...now that the SAF wants to go 3G, and they need thinking soldiers, the SPF also hopping on 3G bandwagon, its pretty natural for us to want to think. Why does the Govt. wanna be at the pinnacle of technology, and be 3G when they aren't letting us the citizens be 3G which consists of a thinking citizen who are given the opportunity to think and make decisions themselves without having the need to seek approval and get permits from the Govt.</div>
