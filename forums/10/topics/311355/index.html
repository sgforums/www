            <div class='col-md body'><p>News:<br>http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080316/ap_on_re_as/china_tibet<br><br>The demon is out killing again.  They are the worse of all evils, according to the words of a highly reputable tibetan monk.<br><br>I think beijing is in deep shit, the tibetan picked the right time.  It's just five months to the olympics.  And if United States wants to show some integrity and principles, they should do something.  All olympics participants should boycott the game in beijing.  I think human lives is more important than plain vain trophies.<br><br>The olympics fire is set to pass through tibet. Fat hope that they can get the torch even across the border to sichuan.<br><br>The hope for Tibetan now, according to the abovementioned monk is to sort help from neighbouring countries that maintained small but highly effective armies.  I guess he is referred to Nepal and India.<br><br>The interests of China to occupy Tibet is both for economics and political reasons. The undergrounds of Tibet is rich with resources, including the largest copper reserves compared to entire China and huge Gold Mines.  Also tourism in Tibet will bring fortune to China.<br><br>For political reason, China needs Tibet as a buffer against India and other countries with direct land access to China. Mountaineous terrains is a condition for excellent strategic formation for any army deployment.<br><br>But look at what the China has took away.  They destroyed the one of the world richest cultural heritage.  Thousands of years of ancient heritage and culture preserved and guarded by the Tibetan were destroyed along with their lives.<br><br>I think China has disintegrated the world Chinese population.  I am ashamed to be a Chinese but I comfort myself that I am not a China Chinese (is Singapore Chinese any better?).  So you see, China Chinese has made other Chinese around the world not to recognize them as motherland.  I would fight for the Tibetan if there is call for it against the China Chinese or China Communist Chinese (CCC)<br><br>In future please remember to put an adjective prior to the word Chinese to qualify.<br><br>Just beware of CCC in the future.  They have big ambition to dominate the world.  Both by economic and military threat.  Just remember this.<br><br>How many people in this world has sinned and reserved themselves a hot place in Hell.  Only for few decades of wealth, fame and power that is just a blink of an eye, they made their names stink for centuries.  People will erect monuments for them not to be admired but to let future generations throw stones at.<br><br>China Chinese will take Mao Ze Dong as hero, because they have been brain washed since the day they were born.  But we know what kind of devil he is.  Your judgement may not be in your lifetime, but the truth will somehow be revealed and written in the books of history.<br><br>What kind of government will impose harsh policy on child birth.  They made many China Chinese committed sins of killing with abortions and killing baby girls if they wanted a boy, in the past.  Now, if you give birth to two kids, you can kiss goodbye to any promotion in your job.  Again, wouldn't people opt for abortion.<br><br>All these sound very scary.  Don't these sound very devil, demon and satanic.  I would believe that Mao Ze Dong was actually the emanation of satan.  Because satan knew the potential and power of china's influence in the world.  therefore he made himself the leader and hero and lay the seeds to sharp and develop future satans.<br><br>I appeal to the leaders of India, Nepal and other neighbouring countries of Tibetan to form an alliance and lay a helping hand to the Tibetan for humanitarian reasons or for the sake of their future national security.</p></div>

              <p>let's see.</p>
              <p>Tibet is part of China. People in Tibet rioted. The government reacts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If this happened anywhere else, I think we would all be condeming the rebels right now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, for the last time, I urge everyone to do some research on how the Tibetian empire was before the Chinese took over. Believe me, you didn't want to live there.</p>

Coz almost every ethnic and government has leaders that want to suppress the separatist or opposition.<br>US government has killed millions of foreigner in "anti-terrorist" war and also a lot of red indians during the invasion to red indian continent, so every american should feel ashamed of this.<br>Likewise, since Mas selamat is bad, then everyone of his ethnic should also feel ashamed.</p></div>
