            <div class='col-md body'>I understand from married friends and colleagues that it is indeed too expensive to have babies/children in Singapore. Other than monetary concern, a few of them feel that having babies/children without giving ample care, love, attention, etc (both husband &amp; wife work) is very irresponsible &amp; regretful as a parent. I think the birth rate will increase in the short term due to the rebates &amp; incentives announce by the gov, but not in the long term.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

The work will be so stressful and there is a need for both parents to work resulting in the child being neglected at his early stages of life (1 - 3) years of age. According to Erikson, this will cause the child to develop mistrust and it can have implementations of how he perceives the world and people around him when he grows up.<br><br>I will rather spare myself and the child the pain by not bringing him into this place</div>

Will have to change their mindset</div></blockquote>Last time people got married, had children and then think about how to feed and bring up their children. They strived, work hard, got rice eat rice no rice eat porridge. Never worried about divorce. If spouse died of accident, single parent also brought up many children. They were not so educated but got confidence and they took the responsibilities.<br><br>Now, people are more educated, so strive for money first, buy car, then get married, then see got enough money and time or not to bring up children, ....then see got childcare center nearby or not....or in-laws or mother can look after or not......If divorced then children suffer because single parent cannot bring up children. No confidence or don't want the responsibilities? Scared drain on their finances = make money for self only? not even for own children, selfish?<br><br>Can the mindset be changed? I don't know, but it certainly reflects on each individual's  upbringing.</div>
