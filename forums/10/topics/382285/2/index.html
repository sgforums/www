              <p>In the 60s to the 70s, our standard of spoken english was minimal, and service staff were much worse than the PRCs, and spoke in dialects. At least the commies speak mandarin, one chinese lingo.</p>
              <p>One day, they may dominate our world, but till that day arrives, the commercial lingo had and still is english, not french, not jap, not german, not malay, not mandarin. </p>
              <p>However, no matter how much one can remain open to avoid discrimination, the fact is that the foundation and prosperity of Singapore was built upon one common lingo call English, which united us all.</p>
              <p>Hell if I am going to give allowance to the commies, if they wish to earn money here, more so as frontline staff. to get uppity and turn their noses on one of our greatest resource - tourists.</p>
              <p>Our fathers had worked hard to study and speak comprehensible english, and made our paying guests feel comfortable and welcomed here - french, spanish, etc, europeans who understood the common commercial lingo of english and parted with cash to keep us employed and our economy humming.</p>
              <p>The commies best buck up. Infact, I'm proposing frontline companies serving our paying guests either pays more for english speakers, or fund their staff to improve their non-existant english lingo, or at the least speak comprehensible Singlish ( Companies, dont even think of touching our society's funds to help the commies make money at our employment opportunity's expense )</p>
              <p>Failing which, we, as well as our resource -tourists, MUST list down which servicing company they had been failed in communication, and black list these companies! Enough of the complaints. Action must be taken before our country loses more tourist and revenue! </p>

              <p>A French man, a Japanese,  a Ghanian, a Thai, a Finn, a Norwegian, a Vietnamese, a Korean, a Brazilian, an Indian, a Balinese, a Myanmese, a Pakistani - each has a heritage that it can carry with pride in its psyche that it can offer in its mother tongue.</p>
              <p>What does a X-rated Fraudulent English speaking Chinese Singaporean have in its  hollow psyche - when it has no ability to speak nor understand its ethnic dialect, nor has it the facility to even speak or listen to understand Mandarin as an ethnic Chinese - what can a X-rated Fraud possibly be ?</p>
              <p>Is it any surprise that a hollow being must seek the spotlight, to grab all the required attention for its insatiable need to make its grand performance ?</p>

              <p>Nothing could be further from the truth. Convents and mission schools didn't exist for elites; they took in orphans and children from poor families. And there were certainly plenty of commoners who studied there. The general command of spoken English was not as terrible as you make it out to be.</p>
              <p>It's atrocious service to turn away customers in the manner that has often been outlined, just because you can't speak the same language. It's not just tourists who get frustrated - expatriates and non-Mandarin-speaking Singaporeans are affected too.</p>
              <p>There are definitely English language classes in schools in China, and the students who arrive here have adequate knowledge although they aren't comfortable with using it often. So, what are these buffoons with no EQ (and lacking the common sense to get another colleague's help) doing in our stores?</p>

              <p>If education was only for those who were rich - how did LKY and his Kwa G.C managed to graduate from Raffles Institution during the pre-independence period before they went to Cambridge - (considering that LKY's father was only a "bill collector" working at Shell Petroleum) ?</p>
              <p>Were LKY and his Kwa G.C. serving the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">thieving british overlords</span></em>" ?</p>

              <p>Now, considering that LKY was known to be working as a Japanese Interpreter during WW-2, what should we think about such a character who will work with the Japanese to interprete English into Japanese, and then after the war to serve the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">thieving british overlords</span></em>" - simply to advance his own education - again at the expense of ordinary Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>The X-rated Fraud should be congratulated for such clear thinking, but will it dare to stand by what it has stated so clearly, and make an attempt to reach further then its pseudo-intellect dare to bring - even as it will dare to over-reach itself over most other issues that it develops with its hot gas ?</p>
              <p>Does this need any "twisted thinking" which a X-rated Fraud will not allow itself to even consider, as it can only defecate each time when it tries hard with its proven pseudo-intellect ?</p>

              <p>It is pathetic that the X-rated Fraud will Double-XX itself with its fraudulent claim at "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">no look down on people's command of engrish</span></em>"  - when the statement is clearly an attempt to ridicule those whom the X-rated Fraud will also claim to associate itself with as - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">my brothers and sisters- fellow citizens in my homeland of equals</span></em>".</p>
              <p>Such deception and hypocrisy is no longer surprising, and is a daily act of defecation expected from a pseudo-intellect who is besotted with its piece of plagiarized "Turd".</p>
              <p>The resident X-rated Fraud is afterall, another member from the Turd community, and has close affinity with the pseudo-Bavarian Hog from the Country of Origin known as Shit-land.</p>
              <p>It is not surprising that so many fraudulent characters come from Shit-land, when both have the same fraudulent characteristics - one exhibiting proudly its pseudo-intellect, and the other proudly exhibiting its pseudo-Bavarian status as a Hog.</p>
              <p>Both have the same fetish for "turd", and will allow themselves to be deluded by the importance of the "turd" in their lives - which explains for their desparate acts to hang on to it, as their dear lives depend on the hot gas that their precious "turd" produce to give them their characteristic hot gassed life.</p>
              <p>It should not be a surprise for anyone to find that it is not such an impossible task to knock the hot gas out of the strident words used in the challenges that these Frauds will attempt to scare others with, or lull anyone to drop concern for one's security.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the pseudo-intellect of a X-rated Fraud <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">will digress expertly</span></strong> in its usual characteristic ways to distract from its own deceit and dishonesty - as it had admitted twice even in this reply that has now been quoted.</p>

              <p>2. My friend's grandmother forced herself to learn/speak/think Japanese during the Japanese occupying days of Taiwan. On her deathbed, she spoke Japanese. </p>
              <p>3. One of my friends from Hongkong forced herself to speak nothing but English during her stay in Australia. This is an immense effort given that there are a lot of hongkies there, and she could have just gotten herself into a hongkie clique and cantonese-ed all the way to graduation.</p>
              <p>To be fair, we Singaporeans do not speak perfect Queen's English ourselves, and yet we criticize other people's English just because we are slightly better. </p>

              <p>Has any international city seen a change in population make-up that everywhere one turn to, the same foreign national type will be seen ?</p>
              <p>There is a level of tolerance to a surge in tourist arrivals, not a surge of permanent or semi-permanent settlers that are here for economic gain over the citizens, and to make their wealth from our needs.</p>
              <p>Are the same opportunities available to ordinary Singaporeans in the country of origins where these foreigners come from - when these are so easily made available to them ?</p>
              <p>Even in ASEAN countries, national legislations will bar certain trades from foreigners including member ASEAN countries, yet Singapore will freely allow foreigners to be in the retail sector to tap on Singaporean's feeding fever.</p>

              <p>Considering that so many Chinese - young and old - were reported to be serious in wanting to contribute to a successful Beijing Olympic, and had responded to a nation wide campaign to learn English - surely you cannot make a generalised conclusion based on your experience with those "Chinese nationals who refuse to speak English to a Malay" in Singapore ?</p>

              <p class="header"><span class="update"><span>SINGAPORE : Work permit holders in the retail, food &amp; beverage, and hotel sectors will need to pass an English language proficiency test from the third quarter of next year in order to qualify for skilled levy status. <br><br>This was announced by Minister of State for Manpower, Trade and Industry Lee Yi Shyan at the graduation of the first batch of foreign workers from a basic English course organised by the Migrant Workers Centre. <br><br>Wayne Huang is one of the 40 graduates of the basic English course. <br><br>The 29-year-old native from China, who is an assistant housekeeper at Hilton Hotel, said "practice makes perfect". <br><br>Come the third quarter of next year, the service industry will see more workers like Mr Huang. <br><br>Mr Lee said that employees would increasingly need to be able to communicate in English to be effective in their jobs. <br><br>He said: "We want to encourage employers to look at it as building a more productive workforce, comprising both local and foreign workers. So if they look at it from that point of view, and if they look at how much better service they can provide, that should incentivise them to send the workers for the programme." <br><br>Employers will enjoy cost savings from the lower skilled workers levy which stands at S$150 a month compared to the unskilled levy of S$240. <br><br>The CEO of NTUC Learning Hub, Zee Yoong Kang, said the hub is anticipating a two to three times increase in demand for English classes and is prepared to meet the demand by increasing its pool of teachers. <br><br>Mr Zee said: "We have 80 trainers and we intend to increase the group to more than 100." <br><br>Some 500 migrant workers are currently being taught basic English at the Learning Hub. - CNA/ms <br></span></span></p>

              <p>This is not a joke but something that we must seriously think for the future of this country. Unlike cities like New York that have their big father USA or Hong Kong that have big mother China. We dont have oil nor mines like the Aussie.</p>
              <p>God gives us no oil or mines but brians...so that what we have. Dont listen to the crap that human is assets. Look at Penang and they are stilll in the 60s of Singapore. We can become Penang again.</p>
              <p>Chinese are doing what we done in manufacturing in the past. They are learning extremely fast and we are teaching them in Shouzhou and elsewhere of our Singapore software...</p>
              <p>The American are teaching them, the Japanese are teaching them...the world are teaching them. They are of the same race as of most of Singaporean. Why make you think they cannot surpass us? Maybe it is only a matter of time.</p>
              <p>If we cannot as Singaporean draw a decent salary in our own country and our living standard or GDP starts declining..than we should say goodbye to Singapore and welcome Penang. Most Penang Malaysian left their island and work in Singapore. Dont ever think it is fun and glorious to be expatriate, I am working in China and I too draw a well pay salary but I distaste living away from my home and family!</p>
              <p>I have seen how the Korean had setup industries in Qingdao, Yantai and Dalian but these cities dont benefit because they are only be explored for theiir cheap labour. So will Siingapore if we take on those dirty and low pay manufacturing companies t. So what can we offer for our future....????</p>
