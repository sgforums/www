            <div class='col-md body'>Straits Times<br>Watershed change<br>Popular digital media is eroding a reliable ally that has traditionally helped garner support for the government.<br>By Seah Chiang Nee, littlespeck.com<br>Oct 20, 2007<br><br>THE 162-year-old Straits Times has been giving ground to the fast-speed digital media, drawing some advice from a concerned Lee Kuan Yew on how it can fight back.<br><br>The editors are told: DonÂ’t compete on breaking the news; be first with the background and the analysis. Â“The ones with high credibility will stay in business,Â” Lee said.<br><br>This is the only way the print media in Singapore, which is stagnating, could stay in the contest.<br><br>It is good advice, if they can Â– or are allowed to Â– carry it out.<br><br>(In his National Day message, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said SingaporeÂ’s newspapers were Â“under siegeÂ” from the digital media.)<br><br>The elder Lee's comments came in a recent interview with a US columnist on the spreading influence of the Internet on the worldÂ’s newspaper readers.<br><br>But in the West where newspapers are in sharper decline, it is regarded as an industry and technological shift, but in Singapore it is something more.<br><br>For its leaders, it represents an erosion of a reliable long-time ally that has traditionally helped to garner support for the government.<br><br>In the past, Minister Mentor Lee had used state television and controlled newspapers as a means to win hearts and minds against the communists, race chauvinists and other enemies. Today, it promotes his policies.<br><br>This hold is now loosening as young people turn more and more to the faster and interactive news delivered by 24-hour TV channels and Internet information and discussion sites.<br><br>This is gradually prying loose his partyÂ’s hold onto its trusting communicating link with his people.<br><br>The mainstream media is predictable and under control; the Internet is not; it has a mind of its own and often promotes alternative, if not opposing, views.<br><br>He is right to be concerned about the future Â– for two reasons.<br><br>First, the switch away from print to multimedia is likely to accelerate as more people (currently about two-thirds of the population) gain access to the Internet.<br><br>Second, the sales decline of the Straits Times is worse than Â“stagnantÂ” when measured against the recent surge in population.<br><br>Last week, it reported that sales for the past year had fallen 0.8% to 381,354 copies.<br><br>Despite its near market monopoly and SingaporeÂ’s increased use of English, the downward trend over the years has been sharper when calculated on a per capita basis.<br><br>Between 1998 and 2007, circulation fell by 2.7% even as the population surged by a record 34%.<br><br>ST daily circulation per 100,000 people:<br>1998: 11,220 copies.<br>2007: 8,140 copies.<br><br>This is a per person drop of 17.5% but this has to take into consideration that a segment of Singaporeans (albeit declining significantly) read only Chinese and other vernacular papers.<br><br>Media observers say it could be much worse if the ST had to face an erstwhile rival competing in the same market.<br><br>The government has protected its monopoly by not issuing a rival publisher to compete in the broadsheet market that could threaten its monopoly.<br><br>Despite the long-term threat, Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) Â– which owns the ST and eight other newspapers Â– is far from being a sunset company.<br><br>Last week, it announced an 18.1% rise in annual profits, or S$506.2mil (RM1.1bil), but with one-thirds (this was wrongly stated as two-thirds in the Star report. Apologies) of revenue coming from properties and other investments.<br><br>Non-newspapers will continue to fuel profits. Meanwhile, it plans to guard its newspaper franchise by going multimedia Â– and regional.<br><br>Â“The ground underneath SPH is shifting, so over the years the company has resorted to selling assets to pay dividends,Â” said henryling, a stock market commentator.<br><br>Â“It is not creating value but eating up value.Â”<br><br>The digital threat has not come only from cable TV and the Internet news sites.<br><br>A wide range of market analyses and institutional data that were once released only through newspapers is now freely available online.<br><br>Â“This means people now do not need to depend on newspapers for crucial information,Â” said a blogger.<br><br>At one time, people would queue to buy an evening newspaper just to find out the latest 4-D result.<br><br>Today, it is available free of charge with a click of the computer mouse.<br><br>With a history of 162 years, the ST has experience and resources and a depth of history that few institutions in Singapore possess. It was launched in 1845, barely 26 years after Sir Stamford Raffles landed on the island.<br><br>Its biggest strength lies in advertisement, especially classifieds, and demand is soaring because of the current economic boom.<br><br>Being the only morning national gives it a virtual licence to print money on advertisements; when markets are active, the money just rolls in.<br><br>Even this strength is not without challenge from classified sites like Craigslist Singapore, where sellers offer a wide range of products.<br><br>Singaporeans can find online marketplaces for everything, ranging from cars to property, from hobbies to jobs, said blogger mrbrown.<br><br>This has prompted SPH to move into this small but rapidly growing online classified business.<br><br>Will the Straits Times still be around 20 years from now? I believe it will.<br><br>State icons donÂ’t die but it will probably take a different form as it adopts new technology to deliver and explain the news.<br><br>A better delivery of content is part of the solution.<br><br>The crux as MM Lee suggested lies in re-adapting its editorial priorities to write fast analyses of the news Â– with credibility.<br><br>That presupposes a freer hand to do so, something that could be encouraged by a further relaxation of control on newspapers. But thatÂ’s another story.<br><br>so long as it is the only mainstream media, it can ignore all challenges</div>
