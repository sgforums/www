Just 2 days ago, I was on board a bus 21. I didnt bring my ez link card and had to use coins instead. So I put in 60 cents in the money box(Student fare). The bus driver insisted that I pay adult fare as I did not have an Ez link card. SO I argued back at the driver insisting that a student did not have to pay adult fare. The driver shot back and said that what proof had I got. Then he stop the bus and shouted to the passengers that I was in the wrong and that I was trying to create trouble for him blah blah...Then to my surprise, the passengers(mainly ah cheks) came to my rescue <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> They scolded the driver and told him to drive on and said that I am clearly a student. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> They told me not to be scared of the bus driver, and encouraged me not to listen to the driver. All the passengers were supportive of me except for this uncouth malay bastard who was seated in the front. He sided the driver and said I was the cause for all this unnecessary delay. He continued to berate me throughout the journey and somehow he ended up calling another woman a "cheebye"....What an uneducated fellow <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> I should have taken down the bus driver name and lodge a report <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

Even if he is in a bad mood, that gives him no excuses for his bad behaviour.
