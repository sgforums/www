              <p>Hmm...I was wondering if it is too hard to ask for a political debate between the PAP and the Opp parties?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a petition managed to catch the public attention as a whole...it will look embrassing for the PAP to reject a public debate. And I don't think it is too hard to ask, for the parties to debate on a national level and address the issue of the country as a whole, not in a town.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The opposition parties need to be more daring...debate on national issues, and not about the lift upgrade issues once again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can the opposition even address national issues like international relation, trade issues, economy in general and so on?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So perhaps we can start a public petition when the next election is approaching?</p>

              <h2>Dow Jones seen to appeal Singapore ruling</h2>
              <div id="floating-target" class="clearfix">
              <p><strong><a href="http://markets.ft.com/tearsheets/performance.asp?s=us:DJ">Dow Jones</a></strong> is expected to appeal a defamation ruling by a Singapore supreme court
                  judge against the Far Eastern Economic Review that was brought by two
                  of the city-state’s top officials, potentially setting the stage for a
                  legal showdown in Hong Kong, where the monthly magazine is based.</p>
              <p>Although
                  the Singapore courts have not yet held a hearing to assess damages,
                  Feer has no assets in Singapore that could be seized. If Lee Hsien
                  Loong, the Singapore prime minister, and Lee Kuan Yew, his father and
                  former prime minister, decide to collect damages, they would have to go
                  to the Hong Kong courts.</p>
              <p>If that happens, Feer will seek to
                  prevent enforcement of the Singapore judgment in Hong Kong. One of the
                  arguments they plan to make against enforcement will involve a
                  challenge to the impartiality of the Singapore judicial system.</p>
              <p>The
                  looming legal battle comes as the Singapore government this month sued
                  the Asian edition of the Wall Street Journal, another Dow Jones
                  publication, for contempt of court after it published editorial
                  comments that “impugn the impartiality, intergrity and independence of
                  the Singapore judiciary,” according to Walter Woon, the city-state’s
                  attorney general.</p>
              <p>“Our editorial pages have a history of
                  defending free speech and free markets, while providing a forum for a
                  diverse range of views. We will continue to defend our right to fulfill
                  our mission and fully intend to contest the contempt proceedings
                  brought against us by the Attorney-General of Singapore,” Dow Jones
                  said on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Woo Bih Li, a supreme court judge, ruled this week that Feer had defamed the Lees in an 2006 article.</p>
              <p>The
                  judge held that the article in which Chee Juan Soon, an opposition
                  politician, compared the government to a local charity that had engaged
                  in mismanagement constituted “defamation by implication.”</p>
              <p>Feer
                  argued that the article amounted to fair comment, but the judge
                  dismissed the defence and said it did not apply in Singapore.</p>
              <p>“It
                  is notable that court has determined that the public interest privilege
                  that is available in the UK and other commonwealth countries, is not
                  applicable in Singapore,” said Dow Jones. Singapore, a former British
                  colony, bases its legal system on that of the UK.</p>
              <p>Mr Woon told
                  Reuters this week that the Journal had previously “accused our judges
                  of being biased” and “this smacks to me of an ideological campaign.”</p>
              <p>Singapore’s
                  government and leaders have sued other leading foreign publications for
                  defamation, saying the suits are necessary to protect the country’s
                  reputation for integrity.</p>
