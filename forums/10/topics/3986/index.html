            <div class='col-md body'>Those malays in malaysia can say watever they want. As a country who is economically stable and have ultra low crime rates...we can just stay home and laugh off their 'barking'. Also we have a mega defence force to quell any minor rebelious behaviour opposite the crossway. If malaysia wants to go to war with us...they know themselves they will get their ass kicked and they will start calling for jihad and all that shit losers do.<br><br>As singaporeans we can just laugh and watch those childish and immature people talking nonsense about us. Ultimately they managed to convince only themselves. And forever roll around in bitterness and anger. So much stress that they start having sex with their own daughters.<br><br>their military...dont need to say...even stupid people can walk into their camps and makan their weapons...and this happen so recently that the laughter over here is still heard.<br><br>Woman in malaysia kena rape need to have 4 muslim men of reputable character to witness be4 they can press any charges. I ask you...which woman kena rape got 4 men with good character watching and dont do anything?<br><br>so let them handle themselves and lets not bother ourselves with those trival matters. Even mahatir is complaining say the malays in malaysia are lazy and uncompetitive.<br><br>Name me one muslim country in the world which is not backward? or has proper medical facilities...or good education(recognised worldwide)? As long as these people refuse to give up tradition and move with the times...they can continue fighing verbal wars over tudong issues, and water treaties that they themselves sign and later say not fair to malaysia.<br><br>Lets all not give a damn about them.</div>
