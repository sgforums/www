            <div class='col-md body'>well, you were complaining that the government did not take care of its citizens.  Now it is proven that you are wrong.  It takes care of its citizens through employment in the public plus GLC and higher salaries there.<br><br>The private sector is open to globalisation of labour and the country has always been pro-business (you should have learnt this hard fact during the last recession).  Do you believe that the country should be anti-business instead?<br><br>Labour protection laws in other countries are normally bent.  Otherwise, businesses simply relocate out causing a hollowing out of the economy.  Singapore cannot afford it.<br><br>over time and in the future, singapore might develop into a situation that (a) the public sector and GLC remain the largest and getting larger, (b) the public sector and GLC pay a general level of salary which is higher than that in the private sector.  Another impetus to develop a unique unified Singaporean identity?  The main hurdle to this is that children nowadays are too easily distracted from their studies and unwilling to work hard.<br><br>the above is a bit of my opinion.<br></div>
