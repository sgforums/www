Although in terms of employment  in general,<br>PRs sometimes advantage over citizens and sometimes the other way round,<br>the key thing that differentiates the two, based on my personal thinking, is<br>as citizen you are luckier.  You get to serve NS while PRs continue to slog.<br><br>You get to get involved in field exercises and sometimes overseas exercises.<br>Challenging and some form of risk involved but you have insurance right? Every now and then get called up for duty.  Not easy you know. PRs are unfortunate in this aspect. They cannot serve unless volunteer??? (i just guessing lah).<br><br>So, while you get the privilege to protect the Resident community, that means the PRs, the PRs do not get this Privilege and Honor and Opportunity to do so.<br><br>citizens are lucky. You get to slog in the commercial world only 2 years or more later than the PRs who jumps straight into slogdom.<br><br>citizens are privileged indeed.<br><br>btw, how the come i still do not see any of you know how many citizens are employed or unemployed and of all jobs created how many went to locals and what are these jobs?<br><br>you dunno oso ar?<br><br>you lousy lah.  like this also dunno.

Don't confuse people by pouring  sotong ink .<br><br>To ask and question the job creation report is merely a commonsense , logical thinking way to understand the facts clearly. Its also a citizen's concern. I challenge anyone to tell me that this is illegal and wrong.  come.<br><br>If what you say is true,<br><br>why no news ever report the exact number of citizens employed , unemployed and how many jobs created are occupied by PRs and FTs?<br><br>Why ?<br><br>What is the Rationale behind this ?<br><br>Why no sgrean demand the truth? Is being paymaster brings with it the power to put on a leash and muzzle? How united?<br><br>Why you quote the ONline citizen?  Havent you heard?<br><br>What is the age of your stats?<br><br>What is the current stat?<br><br>How can you proof how accurate is the stat (altho I must say it is accurate for obvious reasons). This is talking from a technical perspective.<br><br>Again,  WHY the news only say how many jobs created and missed out , time and time and time and time and time again,<br><br>of the jobs created:<br>1.  How many occupied by non PR, non FT.<br>2. How many occupied by PR<br>3. How many occupied by your fellow sgreans?<br><br></div></blockquote>Online Citizen stats can be calculated from statistics Singapore. You want you can calculate. I've merely took other's calculations. If you really want to confirm whether it is correct, you can slowly take statistics from the Singapore Statistics website and calculate it yourself.. If you have bothered to check the dates, you would have realised that it is updated till Sept 07.<br><br>The rest of your questions does not follow the goal of this thread: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the Employment rate of CITIZENS? </span> And Not why the news only say how many jobs created and missed. I have merely answered with respect to your thread title. And the news is always fscrewed up, always leaning towards the government. However, the available data are always in public for you to do deeper analysis.<br><br>Suppose the Singapore Statistics website gives accurate value, does it matter if many jobs did not go to Singaporeans? More than 96% of the citizens are employed, with only &lt;4% unemployed. =&gt; About 46k Singaporeans at the maximum who are unemployed. Bear in mind that in economics, workers still finding jobs are considered unemployed. There are always some workers finding jobs and some quitting their jobs, hence the unemployment rate will seldom be 0.<br><br>Again, with regards to statistics, supposed 100% of all PRs and foreigners are employed, then for the whole economy, we could break down as follows:<br><br>880k foreigners (non-residents) employed<br>500k PRs employed<br>1204k Singaporeans employed and 46k unemployed<br><br>If you truly want to find out how many Singaporeans are employed, you could always take the statistics at the end of 2006 and compare with 2007. The difference in the number of Singaporeans employed, difference in number of PRs and difference in number of foreigners could then show you how many of the 172400 jobs are taken up by Singaporeans.<br><br>Bear in mind the above calculations are taking into account 100% employment of non-residents and PRs. Do you seriously think there is 100% employment for them?</div>
