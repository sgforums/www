              <p><strong>How the IMF Props Up the Bankrupt Dollar System</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">One of the crucial pillars of support for today's Dollar System is
                  Washington's control of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The way this
                  actually works is carefully disguised, behind a facade of technocrats and
                  economic theory of free market ideology. </span>In reality, the IMF is a modern era
                  collection agency for the Dollar Empire. It collects its tribute, through
                  major international banks, who use the dollars to further extend the power of
                  American financial and corporate hegemony, in effect the driving motor of what
                  is globalization. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Ironically, though the IMF is a main prop of the Dollar System, it's nominally
                  headed by a European, today a German, Horst Koehler, and before him, by a
                  Frenchman, Michel Camdessus. The real power is carefully concealed behind the
                  facade. Under the constitution of the IMF, no major decision is possible
                  without 85% support of the board of directors. The United States, which
                  drafted the original IMF charter at Bretton Woods New Hampshire in 1944, made
                  sure it had the decisive veto control with an 18% vote share. That veto
                  remains to today. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Insiders know well that the IMF is run by Washington.</span> It is
                  no accident that its headquarters is also there. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The IMF was originally created in the 1944 Bretton Woods New Hampshire
                  international monetary conference, called by President Roosevelt to set up a
                  postwar monetary and trade system. It was intended as a fund to support
                  stability of currencies and trade of the postwar European allied countries. At
                  that time Washington held the vast bulk of world gold reserves and expected to
                  lend dollars to rebuild Europe. The original IMF idea was to pool a share of
                  reserves of member states, which any single state could then borrow, in event
                  of a short term payments crisis, to stabilize their currency. Ten years after
                  the Great Depression, the major industrial nations, including
                  the USA, were concerned with creation of a stable, growing Europe, not least as an export
                  market for US products. The first member to borrow was Great Britain after the
                  war. The last European state was Italy in 1977. </span></p>
              <h3><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The IMF is retooled in 1980s</span></h3>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Since 1977, no European or G7 country has gone to the IMF to borrow. Instead
                  they have borrowed from private banks or issued state debt. They know all too
                  well how destructive the IMF conditions are. By the end of the 1970s some
                  people were suggesting the IMF had outlived its role, much as some argue with
                  NATO after the end of the Cold War. Washington had other ideas for the IMF however. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The role of the IMF changed dramatically in the early 1980s, under US
                  pressure.</span> Instead of serving as a stabilizing fund for industrial countries of
                  Europe or Japan, the IMF became the decisive agency controlling economic
                  policy of underdeveloped countries. What evolved since the first Latin
                  American debt crises of the early 1980s, was an entirely<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> new role for the IMF
                  to act as policeman to collect dollar loans for private New York and
                  international banks.</span> The IMF became the driving motor for what came to be
                  called "globalization." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">After the first oil price rise of 400% in the 1970s, many developing
                  countries such as Brazil, Argentina, or most of Africa, borrowed heavily to
                  finance needed oil imports, or trade deficits. They borrowed dollars from
                  major international banks operating in the London Eurodollar market. London
                  was the center for, in effect, the recycling of the large sums of petrodollars
                  from Arab OPEC countries to US and other major banks. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The major banks took the new oil dollars and immediately relent them at a nice
                  profit, to countries like Argentina or Egypt. Before the 1970s Argentina had
                  been a fast-growing economy developing modern industry, agriculture and a
                  rising standard of living for its people. It had almost no foreign debt. Ten
                  years later, the country was under control of the IMF and foreign banks. The
                  US changed the rules, in the process creating the debt crisis. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">In October 1979, a dramatic shock occurred for the debtor countries. Overnight
                  their cheap dollar loans cost them 300% more interest charge. Paul Volcker of
                  the Federal Reserve Bank in the US, unilaterally changed US interest policy to
                  force the dollar higher against other currencies. The effect was to raise US
                  interest rates 300% and rates in the London bank market by even more. The bank
                  loans to Argentina and other countries had been made in "floating" rate
                  agreements. If the key international rate in the London bank market, LIBOR,
                  was low, Argentina would pay a low rate on its dollar loans. But when it
                  suddenly rose 300% in 1979-1980, many countries suddenly faced a payments
                  crisis. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">It took until 1982 for the crisis to reach default level. At that point,
                  Washington demanded the IMF be brought in to police a debt collection process
                  on developing debtor nations. This came to be called the Third World Debt
                  Crisis. The impression was created that countries like Argentina were guilty
                  for mismanagement. In reality, whatever political corruption may have existed
                  in the debtor countries, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the corruption of the IMF system and the petrodollar
                  recycling was far greater.</span> The Volcker interest rate shock completed the
                  package of destruction of living standards on behalf of dollar debts. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">How did the IMF act in the third world debt crisis? Here is where it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">becomes
                  clear that the role of the IMF was to support the dollar hegemony of the
                  United States, and not to help poor countries get through a temporary debt
                  problem.</span> </span></p>
              <h3><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The 'Washington Consensus'</span></h3>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The IMF has been described by some as a tool of neo-colonialism. That is too
                  mild, as 19th Century British or European colonialism, however harsh, never
                  managed to accomplish the extent of devastation and destruction of health and
                  living standards the IMF has done since the 1970s. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The IMF operates as a supranational agency to take control over helpless
                  debtor states, to impose economic policies that force the country ever deeper
                  into debt, while opening the market to foreign, often US capital and global
                  corporate exploitation. The fact that debtor countries never get out of their
                  dollar debt, only deeper in, is deliberate. IMF policy in fact insures this.
                  The dollar debt is a major prop of the dollar system and of private
                  international banks. When that debt is repaid, banks lose power and credit
                  contracts. So long as debt grows, bank credit can grow, the paradox of modern
                  banking. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The tip-off that the real purpose of the IMF is quite different from its
                  public claims, is that despite repeated proof of the destructiveness of its
                  policies, called "conditionalities," the IMF has never changed the method it
                  uses in a target country. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">There is a reason for that.</span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Take Argentina as a case in point. In early 2002 Argentina defaulted on
                  repaying $141 billion in foreign dollar debt. One of the most devastating
                  economic collapses in modern history ensued. The IMF was crucial. In early
                  2000 Argentina had turned to the IMF for emergency credit to prevent a
                  collapse of its currency, then fixed to the strong US dollar. As the dollar
                  rose, Argentina found its exports trade collapsing. The country went into
                  recession. The IMF stepped in with a $48 billion "rescue" package. But there
                  were conditions. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">First the government had to agree to severe IMF-dictated cuts in government
                  spending before it would get any money. State subsidies on food for low income
                  were ended, triggering food riots. Interest rates exploded in a vain effort to
                  convince foreign banks and bondholders to not sell. That only worsened the
                  economic depression. State companies were forced to privatize to raise money
                  and "promote free market" liberalization. The Buenos Aires water system was
                  sold for pennies to Enron, as was a pipeline going from Argentina to Chile. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Washington insisted all the while that Argentina hold to its fixed currency
                  value, arguing that the trust of foreign bondholders and creditors was the
                  priority. Meanwhile the country sank into its worst depression in memory, as
                  millions lost jobs, and bank accounts were in the final stage frozen, so
                  ordinary citizens could not even draw savings for life necessities. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">What exactly does the IMF do when it comes into a crisis country that asks for
                  emergency lending to overcome a debt or currency crisis? The IMF always uses
                  the same program, regardless of whether it is Russia or Argentina, Zimbabwe or
                  South Korea, all very different cultures, economies and situations. The IMF
                  demands are often referred to as the Washington Consensus, the name given in
                  1990 by a US economist and IMF backer, John Williamson, to describe the IMF
                  method of attack. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">IMF medicine almost always includes demands to privatize state industries, to
                  slash public spending even on health and education, devalue the national
                  currency against the dollar, and open the country to free flow of
                  international capital-both in and, especially, out. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">First the IMF demands the government in question sign a secret Memorandum of
                  Understanding with the IMF, in which it agrees to a list of
                  "conditionalities", the pre-condition for getting any penny of IMF aid. Under
                  today's globalized free capital markets, banks do not invest in a country that
                  does not have the IMF seal of approval. So the IMF role is far more than
                  giving some emergency loan. It determines if a country gets any money from any
                  source at all-World Bank, private banks and other. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The conditions of an IMF deal are always the same. Privatization of state
                  industries is top on the list. The effect of privatization with a cheap Peso
                  or Rouble currency is that foreign dollar investors are able to buy up the
                  prime assets of a country dirt cheap. Often the politicians involved in the
                  country get corrupted by the lure of under-the-table deals in privatizing
                  their national assets. Foreign multinationals can grab profitable mining, oil,
                  or other national treasures with their dollars. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The case of the Yeltsin government in Russia is classic, with dollar
                  billionaires emerging overnight on the looting of national assets via
                  IMF-dictated privatization. The Clinton Administration backed the process
                  fully. They knew it turned Russia into a dollar zone, and that was the intent. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The second demand of the IMF is that a country liberalize, that is open, its
                  financial and banking markets to foreign investors. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This allows high-profile
                  speculators like George Soros or Citibank or Credit Suisse to come into a
                  country, run up asset prices in a speculation, take huge profits, as in
                  Thailand in the mid-1990s, and quickly sell, then exit with huge gains, as
                  the local economy collapses behind them. Then Western multinationals can come
                  in after, and take prime assets at very low cost.</span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">This is what happened to Asia in the 1990s. The IMF and US Treasury, which
                  actually determines US IMF policy, began strong pressure on the fast-growing
                  East Asia "Tiger" economies in 1993, to remove national controls on capital
                  flows. They argued it would help Asia get large sums of money to invest. What
                  it did was give US pension funds and big banks a huge new market for
                  speculation. Too much money flowed in, and an unhealthy real estate bubble
                  grew. It burst when Soros and other US speculators deliberately pulled the
                  plug in 1997, triggering the Asia crisis. The end result was that for the
                  first time, Asian economies were forced to turn to the IMF to be rescued. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">But the IMF did not "rescue" any Asian economy in 1998. It rescued
                  international banks and hedge fund speculators. In Indonesia, the IMF demanded
                  the government raise interest rates to 80%, on the argument that would keep
                  foreign investors from leaving, and stabilize the situation. In fact, as
                  critics like Joseph Stiglitz charged at the time, the IMF interest rate
                  demands guaranteed a full-blown collapse of the Indonesian and other Asian
                  banking systems. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Once the IMF got control of South Korea, one of the strongest industrial
                  economies in the world, it demanded breakup of large industry conglomerates,
                  charging "corruption" and "crony capitalism." In fact, Washington hoped to
                  weaken a growing competitor and open the door for US companies like GM or Ford
                  to take over. In part it worked, until Korea and other regional economies were
                  strong enough to re-impose national controls. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Malaysia openly defied the IMF
                  demands and imposed currency controls during the crisis. The damage to
                  Malaysia was minimal as a result, a great embarrassment to the IMF.</span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The next step for IMF conditions, is the demand a country turn to
                  "market-based" domestic prices. This is code for eliminating government
                  subsidies or price controls. Often developing countries have state-subsidized
                  fuel or food or other necessities for their people. In 1998 the IMF demanded,
                  for example, that Indonesia remove state food subsidies for the poor. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The idea
                  of "market-based price" is itself a fiction. A market is man-made. The market
                  in Switzerland or Denmark or Japan is different from the market in Cuba or
                  Cameroon.</span> What the IMF is after is a slashing of state budgets to minimize the
                  state role in the economy and make a target country defenseless against
                  foreign takeover of its key assets. The government share in the fragile
                  economy is cut also, in order to insure foreign banks get their "pound of
                  flesh." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Finally the IMF demands the country devalue its currency, and massively, often
                  by 60-70% or more. Here the argument is that this will make its exports "more
                  competitive" and bring more income to repay the foreign dollar debts. This is
                  a crucial part of the IMF Washington Consensus medicine. If, say, Chile
                  devalues the Peso in half, or the Republic of Congo, it must export twice as
                  many tons of copper to earn the same dollar of export surplus. For the giant
                  multinationals in the industrial world, it means the cost of raw materials has
                  become cheaper by half. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Over the past twenty years since the IMF stepped in to play the major role in
                  reorganizing developing countries, world raw materials prices have been
                  dramatically depressed, even though demand has risen. The reason is that
                  countries of Africa, Latin America and elsewhere are mainly raw materials
                  exporters, and their commodities, like oil, are all exported in dollars. They
                  need to earn dollars to repay dollar debts. The IMF policies have driven their
                  raw material prices, measured in dollars, drastically lower. This has been
                  deliberate, but is never admitted. The IMF is an agency of American dollar
                  domination of the global economy, not an agency to help developing countries. </span></p>
              <h3><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The real IMF record</span></h3>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">None of this is exaggeration, unfortunately. IMF defenders claim that "market
                  liberalization" has resulted in major economic growth over the past 20 years
                  in developing countries. The reality is opposite. In a study done by Joseph
                  Stiglitz when he was at the World Bank, between 1989 and 1997 the GDP of every
                  country in the former Soviet Union had fallen to levels of 30% to 80% of that
                  before the collapse of state controls, with the sole exception of Poland. The
                  level in Russia was only 60% that in 1989. GDP had collapsed 40%, and
                  unemployment went from 2 million to 60 million. The rapid privatization
                  without adequate legal and institutional safeguards such as unemployment
                  insurance or health insurance, led to social catastrophe comparable to
                  wartime. IMF demands to free capital movement allowed new Russian dollar
                  oligarchs such as Berezovsky to plunder billions of dollars and put it into
                  secret bank accounts in Cyprus or Liechtenstein, while they bought luxury
                  villas in Monte Carlo.Â <a href="http://www.serendipity.li/hr/imf_and_dollar_system.htm#fn">[1]</a> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The IMF record in Africa is as outrageous and destructive. In Zimbabwe, the
                  IMF demanded the government privatize certain state companies and cut
                  subsidies on food, education and health care to get IMF aid. The government
                  complied with most demands, and then the IMF accused it of funding the war in
                  the Democratic Republic of Congo, using that as an excuse to deny giving
                  Zimbabwe loans. In Kenya the IMF earlier demanded that specific individuals be
                  named to the government of Moi, people friendly to Western interests.
                  Washington then charged these governments being "corrupt," which conveniently
                  blinds Western opinion from realizing the moral travesty taking place under
                  IMF auspices. </span></p>
              <h3><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Deeper in debt ...</span></h3>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Take the official World Bank debt statistics and it becomes obvious that the
                  IMF game is to support the dollar. The first debt crisis in the Third World
                  erupted in 1982. The IMF stepped in to "stabilize" the debt problem. Since
                  then, the foreign debts of developing countries have risen exponentially. In
                  Argentina, the earlier "success" of the IMF, foreign debt stood at $62 billion
                  in 1990. In 2000 it was $146 billion. Brazil's foreign debt has gone from $120
                  billion to $240 billion in the same time. Iran, isolated from the IMF system
                  by US sanctions, is one of the few developing countries which has managed to
                  reduce its foreign debt. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The total foreign dollar debt of all low and middle income countries rose from
                  $1.4 trillion in 1990 to $2.5 trillion in 2000, almost double.
                  In most cases, the unpayable interest costs on the debts were merely added to
                  the amount of principal owed foreign lenders, at compound interest rate, of
                  course. With compound interest charges often 10% to 15% per year, the debt
                  grows exponentially. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The result is a Ponzi debt pyramid, in which the more a country pays, the more
                  it owes. Bankers call it "interest capitalization." It is no different from
                  the plight of a poor shopkeeper debtor who is forced to turn to a mafia loan
                  shark to survive and ends up paying more and more at ever more interest, until
                  he is bankrupt and the mafia takes all his possessions. The IMF and banks know
                  only some 80% of Third World debts can ever be repaid. They care only about
                  the legal fiction and the ability to use the debt as a lever to grab assets
                  cheaply. According to the World Bank, between 1980 and 1986, for a group of
                  109 debtor countries, payment of interest alone to the creditors on foreign
                  debts totalled $326 billion. Repayment of principal on the same debts totalled
                  another $322 billion, for a combined capital flow out to the New York and
                  other creditor banks, in debt service, of $658 billions on an original debt of
                  $430 billion. Yet, despite this enormous effort, these 109 debtors still owed
                  the banks a sum of $882 billion in 1986. This was because of the pyramid
                  effect of compound interest, interest capitalization and Volcker's floating
                  rate policy. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">In 1990 the developing world repaid some $150 billion in interest on dollar
                  debt, three times all aid received. This was a huge boost to the dollar credit
                  system, which lends on the basis of assuming it will be repaid the entire $2.5
                  trillion third world debt. The IMF allows that myth to continue. Occupied Iraq
                  today must still "honor" billions in debts of the Hussein era, many to the
                  former Soviet Union, despite its devastated situation. Russia is still forced
                  to admit billions in debt from the Soviet era to Western agencies. Under the
                  IMF system, debt is more sacred than human life.Â <a href="http://www.serendipity.li/hr/imf_and_dollar_system.htm#fn">[2]</a> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The vicious trick in all IMF-led "debt restructuring," is that so long as a
                  debtor is able to pay interest on its loans, the creditor banks in New York or
                  London or elsewhere do not have to declare their loan in default. Even if they
                  know it never will be repaid, they treat it as if it were a fully good credit,
                  and use it as capital collateral for further bank lending. The banking system
                  of the dollar world is to a major degree propped up by the pyramid of
                  unpayable third world loans from Africa to Indonesia to Argentina to Croatia. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">There has been a dramatic slowdown in economic growth in developing economies
                  over the past two decades since the IMF was brought in to police the debtor
                  states in 1982. There is a direct link. In Latin America, if we take per
                  capita GDP growth, there was a growth of 75% between 1960 and 1980. In the
                  following 20 years to 2000, per capita GDP grew a mere 6%. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">In Sub-Sahara Africa, per capita GDP grew by 36% in the two decade period to
                  1980. Then, it fell by a staggering 15% the next two decades. According to the
                  World Bank itself, some 300 million Africans, almost half of the Continent,
                  survive on less than ? 0.65 a day. IMF-dictated cuts in national health care
                  have resulted in rising infant mortality across the Continent. In 2002 Malawi
                  underwent famine. It coincided with the April 2002 decision by the IMF to
                  suspend Malawi on allegations of "corruption." The IMF had ordered Malawi's
                  government to sell its grain reserves in order to repay a South African bank
                  loan of the National Food Reserve Agency. The IMF also ordered export of maize
                  to service debt, ignoring a developing famine crisis. The IMF piously denied
                  it played any role in the famine crisis however.Â <a href="http://www.serendipity.li/hr/imf_and_dollar_system.htm#fn">[3]</a> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">For Arab states, including Algeria, Morocco, GDP growth per capita swung from
                  a plus 175% between 1960-1980 to a minus 2% in the following two decades, a
                  staggering collapse. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">The only apparent exception to this negative trend is East Asia including
                  China. Here growth was faster between 1980 and 2000. But the reason is the
                  including of China, which saw a 400% increase in GDP and accounts for 83% of
                  the region's population. China has adamantly refused any dealings with the
                  IMF, and runs a controlled state-guided economy with full currency controls,
                  hardly an IMF model state. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Callisto MT,Georgia,Book Antiqua,Palatino,Times New Roman,Serif;">Globalization is a word used today, often without precision. If we use the
                  word globalization to refer to the entire process of IMF and WTO-led
                  neo-colonialism under the Dollar System, then it is a descriptive term. It
                  describes the creation of a global dollar imperium, a Pax Americana.
                  Establishment critics of the IMF system such as Joseph Stiglitz, himself a
                  former Clinton adviser and World Bank official, make accurate charges against
                  the IMF. They assume, however, that it is merely misguided policy that leads
                  to the problems. The entire IMF institution, along with the World Bank and
                  WTO, however, have been deliberately developed to advance this globalization
                  of the Dollar System, the second pillar of Pax Americana after the military
                  power. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is no mistaken policy, no result of bureaucratic blunders. That is
                  the crucial point to be understood. The IMF exists to support the Dollar
                  System.Â <a href="http://www.serendipity.li/hr/imf_and_dollar_system.htm#fn">[4]</a></span> </span></p>

              <p>the free market?</p>
              <p>back track?</p>
              <p>it's just a bunch of bankers and wankers talking about the market and the economy...</p>
              <p>politics is tied to it.. and you think for one moment the US is truly democratic, i've got a few used cars i can sell you... Dubbya got in through fraud.. but that's another matter...</p>
              <p>so.. again.. what has the market economy got to do with their democracy?</p>
              <p>Nixon lied.. Dubbya lied... but their political system is still there.. enshrined in their constitution...</p>
