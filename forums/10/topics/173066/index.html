            <div class='col-md body'>If government wants to avoid the pitfall of welfarism, it still can do so without totally denying citizens of some relief in extreme cases. Just define welfare in two parts:-<br><br>(1) Relief for Medicare and temporary unemployment.<br><br>Allocate 0.5 % (small amount of national reserve which will not result in welfare dependency) of annual tax monies to build up an endowmen fund within 5 years. When such an endowment fund reaches a sustainable sum use the interests to lower costs of medicare due to land and infrastructure charges which government need not charge as these are of one-time nature and have in any event been covered by citizens' taxes.<br><br>Define the objective of such relief scheme so that it will not become a welfare - say only to relieve citizens of high costs for period of unemployments up to 3 months to be paid back in 10 years' instalments or contributing of labor to community workfare scheme (construction or child care services etc to cut down dependence on foreign labor if still unemployed after 3 months.<br><br>(2) Unemployment assistance.<br><br>Plough back 5% of extraordinary earnings (exceptional gains and bonuses) from surpluses invested overseas projects which create employments only to benefit foreigners to a national unemployment endowment fund to help relief within capped quantum those affected by age, disablement, and longer unemployments after failing to secure jobs over 3 months who for physical or other approved reason is unable to serve out his community workfare scheme.</div>

Take China as an example. Although China has the world largest population, if we can sell our products to 10% of their people, we would be rich. However, my teacher says otherwise. It's true that China has the world largest population, but many of them live in the rural areas as well. Those who move out of the countryside to live and work in the city will not be able to afford the products. Thus, we can't say that by selling products to them, we will be rich.<br><br>There's also another factor of cost. As labour costs are lower over there, products tend to be cheaper. So, even if 10% of the population buys from you, your profit margins would be lowered.<br><br>The last factor is piracy. The piracy laws there are super lax. Anything and everything can be pirated. Profits margin again reduced. In the end, we may end up losing money.<br><br>What I think is that the government only see the advantages of China's and India's booming economy, yet never consider these factors. If they decide to invest more money in Singapore, they would have benefitted.</div>
