              like i said there are many factors to consider, not just financially. to each their own. some are well off to pay and pay and chose to stay. some are well off but unhappy at paying unnecessary things and choose to leave. others with other scenarios. 
              
              <br><br>
              good that you are contented and living happily here. but everyone has different goals and needs in life and so, there are people whose goals and needs will not be in line with yours and you can't blame them for that.

Loyalty is pledged to family, friends &amp; colleagues. And not to corrupted leaders. Pledging loyalty to countries is very subjective. You cannot blame others for being self centered in this aspect.</span></p>

And not to glorify the leaders who lead the organization. If a foreign country welcomes you and take you in as one of them and ensures a fair treatment to you, then that country will be the one whom you should pledge allegiance to. If a friend from an enemy country in order to protect you sacrifices his dignity, assets and possibly his life, don’t you think he is worth much more than a country who stresses that you must be loyal to it all the time expecting you to give and seldom return you?</span></p>

              <p>It is all starting from family and home. My family back in Indonesia has many problems too but all helping one another and the relative helping each other too. I can do anything for my mom and siblings if they ever need me. Neighbours for 20 years like big family. Here is so different.</p>
              <p>I won't say i'm loyal to my country Indonesia but I never think of giving up my citizenship because of my family. I'm a foreigner, your so called FT here but i don't feel any priviledge given to me. i do appreciate the opportunity given by your government to work here.</p>

              <p>Friend,</p>
              <p>In this forum, there are those who love Singapore, those who support and those who dislike the PAP, but there are a whole bunch of people who can't tell the difference between Singapore and PAP. They take every opportunity to run down Singapore thinking they are the true Singaporeans who know what is good for its people, and of couse there are some who run down other countries, like australia, hoping to give a balanced view.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">  </p>
              <p>Among this same bunch of people, many talk about migrating with no apparent considerations for their parents, their classmates, neighbors of 20 years, to them family means just their wives and children. These are the people who fit the category of cold people your sista met. Their presence only shows that there are all kinds of people in Singapore and they are free to speak what they like.</p>
              <p>You will also find that those against the FT policy would ridicule the PRC Chinese construction workers but kao tao to the angmoh expatriates. It makes you wonder who are the foreigners doing the jobs that no Singaporeans want to do and who are the FT who take away the jobs from Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Your company employs you cause you have something they want, so you deserve the job; Singapore allows you freedom in working here with your family staying and studying here, I am glad you appreciate it even if you don't consider it a priviledge.</p>
              <p>enjoy your stay.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png">   <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png">  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>as for me, I thought you are going to say that I would die working in Singapore, or have my job taken away by FT, but to think that I am still a kid in school,  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> , try again, give you a clue, I am between 20 and 60.

              <p>singapore is not a bad place to setup your own business, but of course, running it into profit is another issue. u cannot imagine just how much red tapes Oz' ATO has for businesses especially those IT contractors and consultants. plus the taxation and rules are rather stifling and oppressive.</p>
              <p>it is my long term plan to setup an office in SG in the near future to take advantage of the low business tax in SG but i definitely dont want my son to serve his NS.</p>
