              <p>With this piece, I’d like to attempt to approach the 377A issue from a
                                purely legal perspective, following the requirements of formal justice,
                                substantive justice, harm, internal coherence, Devlin’s idea of the
                                dominant morality, the pedigree test of Legal Positivism, and perhaps
                                an attempt to discern the common natural morality of Natural Law Theory.<br><br>To
                                approach a statute based law, we would first have to approach it from
                                its interpretation. The normal language of 377A offers no controversy,
                                and its purpose, clear. It is a provision in the Penal Code of
                                Singapore, to criminalize acts of a sexual nature between men, whether
                                in public or in private. However, no such provision exists between that
                                of women engaging in sexual acts with other women. It is argued that
                                two women cannot engage in any penetrative sexual activity. However, it
                                is a fact that two men can engage in non-penetrative sexual activity,
                                likewise, women can engage in penetrative sexual activity, the
                                specifics of which I would leave to the wonders of the internet and
                                imagination. <br><br>377A does not exist by itself in a vacuum. It
                                exists within the Penal Code, and should be taken within the context of
                                the other provisions. The rationale behind keeping 377A is
                                non-existent, murky at best. We do not know whether or not it is a
                                matter of public policy, a matter of harm, a matter of dominant public
                                morality, or all of the above. The parliamentary debates are less than
                                helpful, with the Nominated Members of Parliament on both sides
                                digressing into highly normative, persuasive, populist rhetoric, where
                                mistakes of fact and logically inconsistent principles abound. <br><br>What
                                is of note would be that the Penal Code reform is not solely based on
                                377A alone. Provisions criminalizing oral and anal sex are repealed, so
                                is the provision criminalizing adultery. The logical question one would
                                ask is therefore, why do we insist on keeping 377A? Anal and oral sex
                                are the primary sexual activities possible between homosexual males (in
                                addition to others), and likewise, if male homosexuality is morally
                                repugnant, is it really more so than adultery? Is there a common means
                                of qualifying and quantifying what is more moral than the other? If we
                                cannot answer these questions, how can, then we selectively choose
                                which provision to repeal over the other?<br><br>Furthermore, our Penal
                                Code is derived from its English ancestor. Now that the English have
                                abandoned 377A’s equivalent, what administrative reason do we have to
                                retain it? Furthermore, many Asian non-colonial societies have no such
                                provision. Are they really worse off?<br><br>With these in mind, I
                                would propose that the penal code, with the provision of 377A is no
                                longer internally coherent, nor reasonable. And thus, formal justice is
                                compromised with the retaining of such a provision.<br><br>Now, we will
                                then approach 377A by examining the possible substantial justice it is
                                trying to achieve, whether or not there are any extra-legal factors
                                behind its retaining. <br><br>One of the main reasons argued for the
                                retaining of 377A is that of public policy, more specifically, public
                                health. It is an undisputed fact that anal penetration is more likely
                                to result in skin and muscle wounds, leading to an exchange of bodily
                                fluids, and consequently, sexually transmitted diseases. However, this
                                is a non-issue, as the risk is uniform regardless of sexuality; a
                                heterosexual couple engaging in anal sex (legal) is under the same
                                amount of risk as a male homosexual couple engaging in anal sex.
                                Furthermore, anal sex, as mentioned above, is not the only sexual
                                activity carried out between male homosexual couples, and thus, this
                                point fails.<br><br>Secondly, it is argued that homosexuals are
                                hedonistic and promiscuous, unable to commit to stable monogamous
                                relationships. Therefore, retaining 377A would protect these very
                                homosexuals from their own acts. To answer this, statistical data would
                                be of great help. On an international scale, the most comprehensive
                                study to date on the effect of same-sex marriage / partnership on
                                heterosexual marriage and divorce rates was conducted looking at over
                                15 years of data from the Scandinavian countries. The study (later part
                                of a book), by researcher Darren Spedale, found that, 15 years after
                                Denmark had granted same-sex couples the rights of marriage, rates of
                                heterosexual marriage in those countries had gone up, and rates of
                                heterosexual divorce had gone down - contradicting the concept that
                                same-sex marriage would have a negative effect on traditional marriage.
                                (Darren Spedale, William Eskridge and Hans Ytterberg “Nordic Bliss?
                                Scandinavian Registered Partnerships and the Same-Sex Marriage Debate”,
                                Journals of Legal Scholarship: Issues in Legal Scholarship i.5, The
                                Berkeley Electronic Press, January 2004)<br><br>Such a study, however,
                                only concerns the effects of same-sex marriage on heterosexual
                                marriage. A study directly showing the statistics of same-sex marriages
                                themselves can be easily accessed from American reports. All U.S.
                                states submit monthly summaries of vital statistics on births, deaths,
                                marriages, and divorces to the U.S. Centre for Disease Control's
                                National Centre for Health Statistics (NCHS) who then prepares monthly
                                and yearly reports. The following statistics are based on that NCHS
                                material. Over three years have passed now since same-sex marriage was
                                legalized in Massachusetts and data from all of 2004 and 2005 are now
                                available. The current divorce trends in Massachusetts counter claims
                                of same-sex couples being infidel, hedonistic and promiscuous. In fact,
                                for several years now the Commonwealth has had the lowest divorce rate
                                of any state in the union. In 2004 the Massachusetts divorce rate, at
                                2.2 per 1,000 residents per year, was considerably lower than the U.S.
                                national average rate for that year, 3.8 per 1,000 and close to the
                                national average of 2.0 back in 1940. In the first two years of
                                same-sex marriage in the Bay State, the rate of divorce showed a steady
                                decline making it likely that Massachusetts will continue to have the
                                lowest divorce rate in the nation.<br><br>The conservative "red states"
                                that have taken aggressive action against same-sex marriage, have not
                                done nearly as well during the two year period of legal same-sex
                                marriage in Massachusetts. The preliminary data from 2004 and 2005—from
                                the 17 U.S. states which have provided data on divorce for 2004 and
                                2005 and whose voters also passed state constitutional amendments
                                prohibiting same-sex marriage—presents a striking picture: the group of
                                U.S. states arguably most hostile to divorce, those which have passed
                                both state laws and also state constitutional amendments prohibiting
                                same-sex marriage, lag dramatically in terms of divorce rate
                                improvement when compared to same-sex marriage-friendly states.<br><br>The
                                implications of such data are obvious. Homosexual couples are in no way
                                necessarily any more promiscuous or hedonistic than heterosexual
                                couples. Many homosexuals, I believe are also keen to commit to a
                                relationship legally recognised. The reason why we have not observed
                                homosexuals committing to such as yet is simply because they are not
                                able to. The engage in extramarital sex simply because they cannot get
                                married. Is one promiscuous and hedonistic if one engages in sexual
                                activity with a significant other without getting married? Therefore,
                                such a policy argument cannot stand.<br><br>The one final policy
                                argument for the retaining of 377A would be the preservation of the
                                traditional family unit, that such family unit is one of reproduction,
                                and of course, the textbook slippery slope argument that if we allow
                                homosexuality, we will then have to allow incest (sex with direct
                                family members), paedophilia (sex with minors), necrophilia (sex with
                                corpses), and zoophilia (sex with animals). Although such arguments are
                                linked to each other, I will attempt to address these in order.<br><br>From
                                the statistical data presented above, we can see that heterosexual
                                marriage is in no way harmed by the legalising of homosexual marriage.
                                (See Darren Spedale, William Eskridge and Hans Ytterberg “Nordic Bliss?
                                Scandinavian Registered Partnerships and the Same-Sex Marriage Debate”,
                                Journals of Legal Scholarship: Issues in Legal Scholarship i.5, The
                                Berkeley Electronic Press, January 2004) Such an argument is therefore
                                only based upon normative opinions and subjective predictions, ignoring
                                objective statistical data, and therefore, cannot stand. We do have
                                studies confirming the contrary, so why do we keep to our subjective,
                                erred notions?<br><br>Furthermore, is homosexuality really undesirable?
                                There are no facts to show how homosexuality is any more harmful than
                                heterosexuality to the body, compared to cigarettes, alcohol, drugs,
                                etc. There is no objective reason to why we must not expose out
                                children to anything more than heterosexuality. Perhaps we may want to
                                preserve the traditional notions of sex, should this mean that
                                therefore we must criminalize the usage of contraceptives (condoms,
                                etc), or sexual aids (like dildos, butt plugs, etc)?<br><br>In our
                                Legal Theory class on Tuesday, 4th March 2008, we have actually come up
                                with a working model for marriage to allow for homosexual couples;
                                which is a consensual relationship of permanence and devotion, between
                                two adult persons. As the law stands now, there is no requirement for
                                married heterosexual to have sex and reproduce. To encourage population
                                growth, baby bonuses and other benefits are added as an extra, in
                                addition to the basic benefits of a marriage. Can it not be said then,
                                that marriage by itself does not require reproduction? The requirement
                                of consent, between 2 adult persons would also prevent the opening of
                                floodgates. Children, animals and corpses cannot give legally
                                recognised consent to sexual matters, and this is due to policy matters
                                independent of sexuality. We do disallow and criminalise heterosexual
                                incest, paedophilia, zoophilia, and necrophilia. Therefore, why cannot
                                we do the same for homosexual incest, paedophilia, zoophilia, and
                                necrophilia? We do limit heterosexual marriage to two persons, we can
                                very well extend the policy reasons behind it to homosexual marriage as
                                well. Thus, there is no substantive public policy reason with retaining
                                377A.<br> <br>Next, we shall examine the idea of the dominant social
                                morality, which Devlin espouses that the law should maintain. However,
                                we need not even consider the flaws in Devlin’s attempt to qualify such
                                a morality, as it is not the dominant morality of Singapore which
                                demands that 377A be kept in place. The decision to retain 377A has led
                                to a heated discussion across the nation. The emergence of two extreme
                                camps, with the rest of the population along the spectrum would
                                demonstrate that there is no clear consensus on such an issue. While
                                the petition to keep 377A solicited more signatures than the petition
                                to repeal it, can we therefore ignore the morality of a nonetheless
                                significant portion of the population? I would note now that the most
                                vocal and foreward group of people for the repealing of 377A are the
                                Christians and the Muslims. However, we are a secular democracy, and we
                                do allow and respect the views of other religions. If one were to ask a
                                Buddhist or a Hindu of his views on the issue, it would most likely be
                                that of “live and let live”, in support of 377A’s repeal. I am of
                                course aware that there are many more religions, and that some
                                Christians profess a support for 377A’s repealing, and some Buddhists
                                supporting its retaining. What I am illustrating are general trends,
                                observed by experience and statistical data available from the
                                internet, largely from both petitions. Thus, in no way does the
                                retaining of 377A reflect the dominant Singapore morality, unless we
                                are willing to only look at the majority Singapore morality, and such a
                                thin majority it is. <br><br>Now, we move on to the pedigree test of
                                Legal Positivism. This would be in the context of modern Singapore, the
                                constitution. Article 12(1) of our constitution guarantees that the law
                                should not discriminate against any person. Although race and religion
                                are mentioned, sexuality is not. However, does this mean that sexuality
                                is outside of the ambit of the constitution? Taking a purposive
                                interpretation of said constitution, I would put forth that since race
                                and religion are guaranteed, so should sexuality be.<br><br>Whether we
                                like it or not, our sexuality is a physical, not a mental thing. As
                                such, I would submit that it is akin to our race, difficult to alter.
                                In 1993, the micro satellite gene marker xq28 was discovered to be
                                present in the chromosomes of homosexuals. While its role has been
                                disputed, its existence has not (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xq28).
                                Furthermore, studies have shown that the homosexual brain responds
                                differently to pheromones compared to a heterosexual brain
                                (http://www.livescience.com/health/ap_050510_pheremones.html),
                                (http://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/dn7069-gay-men-read-maps-like-women.html).
                                These are not “poorly politicized pseudo-science” which some of us are
                                inclined to believe, but peer-reviewed and published results made with
                                independent experimentation. In fact, the American Psychological
                                Association (APA) has removed homosexuality from its list of mental
                                disorders (http://www.apa.org/topics/orientation.html). Unlikely the
                                poorly politicized pseudo-science, for example young Earth creation
                                science, such conclusions are objective results, and do not change
                                “depending on which scientist you ask”. If our constitution protects
                                our individual race, why not extend the protection to our individual
                                sexuality? Is there a reason not to?<br><br>Secondly, if sexual
                                orientation is indeed a lifestyle choice, one would have to imagine the
                                difficulty in getting it changed. I would draw a parallel then, between
                                sexual orientation and religion. Singapore’s constitution does allow
                                for religious freedom, notwithstanding that there may be ex-Christians,
                                ex-Muslims, ex-Buddhists, ex-Hindus, etc. Religion is a thing which can
                                be changed, admittedly, but many people cannot cope with the difficulty
                                in doing so. While we do classify some religions as cults and
                                criminalize their practice, this is done purely on policy reasons. For
                                example, the Jehovah’s Witnesses and their anti-national service
                                ideals. Since there is no sound public policy reason denouncing
                                homosexuality, why do we hesitate to afford it the same protection as
                                religion? <br><br>There are obvious problems when we put 377A up to
                                the pedigree test of Legal Positivism, in this case the constitution.
                                Likewise, there is no sound public policy to support its retaining.
                                Furthermore, it renders the penal code internally incoherent and
                                unreasonable. And still further, it does not reflect the dominant moral
                                viewpoints of our society, only a thin majority. What then, can we
                                salvage to justify it? Going down the list, what we have left is the
                                divine, and/or objective morality purported by Natural Law Theorists.
                                The burden then, is for them to prove that said objective morality
                                provides for homosexuality, and condemns it.<br><br>The most common
                                argument I have come across is the argument from nature. It goes like
                                this; that homosexuality is not natural and abhorrent, as it deviates
                                from the natural procreation process common to all living things. To
                                this, I would point out that humans are not the only living things
                                which engage in homosexual behaviour. Bottle-nose dolphins, highly
                                intelligent animals, also exhibit said tendencies. A natural history
                                museum, Against Nature?, has been established to showcase the animals
                                which engage in homosexual behaviour
                                (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Nature%3F). What then, can we
                                base this measure of ‘natural-ness’ on if not animals? Of course, many
                                things humans practice are also against nature, does this mean we
                                should abhor such practices as well?<br><br>Finally, and most
                                tediously, some would argue that said morality comes from their god(s).
                                While I would like to avoid criticisms of religion, I will point out
                                that Singapore is a secular country, and that we allow religious
                                freedom. To allow for such a religious freedom would also mean that we
                                do not prioritise the claims of one specific religion over the other,
                                per Devlin. Therefore, the claims of a few religions within our society
                                should never be codified into our law. <br><br>Thus, in conclusion, we
                                can see absolutely no reason and room for 377A to stay, and on the
                                contrary, much for it to be repealed. I can only personally hope for
                                such a blatant error to be righted, leading to a more inherently
                                coherent, logical, reasonable legal system. While I admit that there
                                are other problematic areas of the law which should be dealt with, we
                                should take hold of this time of controversy in order to facilitate
                                this improvement.</p>
