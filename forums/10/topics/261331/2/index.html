They have programme on discussing political issues and they are given the freedom to voice out whatever unhappiness, issues they have about the gahmen which we do not have in Singapore unfortunately.  Initially, when I saw such a programme I really couldn't believe my eyes.   We are indeed deprived of freedom to talk freely about politics in Singapore.  The ruling party here really XVCCWQTET !!!</div>

If you are unhappy reading posts concerning people voicing out negatively about the gahmen, then can't be helped.  Everywhere in Singapore we come across people who speak negatively about gahmen, SC is not the only place people do that.  This really tell how much the ruling party needs improvement!

On the media, never say anything negative about them , if not they will resort to all means to get at you.  It is so unfortunate to have such kind of gahmen.<br><br>Just hope DPP will not rule again this is for the good of Taiwan.  See with bian taiwan economy is doing very badly.  I respect Mr Ma and believe he will do a better job compared to ah bian.  ONe thing about bian, he is rather magnanimous in his way.  So many hurled insults at him, scolded him and use all sorts of negative words to describe him, he never resort to file for defamation.     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">   OUr gahmen needs to learn this from bian.

You know, like for eg ah only for eg, Rane in one of her previous post called me wo nan fei. Normally, somebody of the opposite team would shoot back and said it "should be spelled as Wo Nang Fei" then insert "a counter insult" like "you noob". But what would happen if I do that? Rane would prob get focus on language problem then we go off topic again liao lor.<br><br>Like I say before so many times, I'm not against people saying bad things about govt. I like it better if the points are substaintial and well-backed like Atobe's. I may not like shutterbug and robberteh kind of everything under-the-sun also PAP's fault style of writing, but I also don't flame them and insult them mah.<br></div>
