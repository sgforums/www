            <div class='col-md body'>Ha ha ha!!  Saw him on the Chinese news last night.  He said Taiwan is different from Singapore, Taiwan is more vibrant, active and democratic!!  Mr Ma has a mind of his own.  He is a better politician compared to the old leeÂ’s son, LEE HSIEN LOONG.  Mr Ma has good sense of judgement and is real sincere in serving the Taiwanese, this is something that is missing from the LEE HSIEN LOONG.   Really, Mr Ma has my respect.  Respect LEE HSIEN LOONG, this is a question mark and most likely the answer is no.  Both of them are friends.  Shame on you lee hsien long!<br><br>The way a country is depends on how the ruling party Â“moldÂ” the country.

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally think that most Taiwan politicians are smart and coy enough to know what the priorities are. Yes, Ma maybe praising the SG to the high heavens but he knows that the Taiwanese, unlike SGreans are sharp, alert and can analyze information indepedently. They will not just blindly follow what the newspaper says. The blue camp for all this yrs like the PAP have lost contact with the hearts and minds of Taiwanese, especially the younger generation. The autocratic rule of the Chiang eras coupled with the "merry-making, serenading PRC" stances does not bodes well with younger generations. Times have changed, the younger generations of Taiwan wants to carve out an identity or culture for themselves and unlike the older generations, they have no connections or feelings for mainland. So why times have progress, KMT not only lost the support of the young, their usual stances of " KMT is endorsed by the mainland so voting for me means no war", potraying themselves as PRC's second fiddle, does not connect with the ppls. Yes no doubt PRC has threat the island with force, but it is the ppls that installs the govt, not the PLA.......<br><br>The recent speech by Ma is just a smoke screen used to allow KMT to re-shuffle their focus on domestic issues.</div>

Yes, Ma maybe praising the SG to the high heavens but he knows that the Taiwanese, unlike SGreans are sharp, alert and can analyze information indepedently. They will not just blindly follow what the newspaper says. The blue camp for all this yrs like the PAP have lost contact with the hearts and minds of Taiwanese, especially the younger generation. The autocratic rule of the Chiang eras coupled with the "merry-making, serenading PRC" stances does not bodes well with younger generations. Times have changed, the younger generations of Taiwan wants to carve out an identity or culture for themselves and unlike the older generations, they have no connections or feelings for mainland. So why times have progress, KMT not only lost the support of the young, their usual stances of " KMT is endorsed by the mainland so voting for me means no war", potraying themselves as PRC's second fiddle, does not connect with the ppls. Yes no doubt PRC has threat the island with force, but it is the ppls that installs the govt, not the PLA.......<br><br>The recent speech by Ma is just a smoke screen used to allow KMT to re-shuffle their focus on domestic issues.</div></blockquote>Definitely, and of course, majority of Taiwanese are smart to know the priorites.  Mr Ma knows what works for Singapore may not work for Taiwan.  People of Taiwan are not easily manipulated by their gahmen unlike people in Singapore.  Mr Ma has his own mind and good sense of judgement to know what is best for Taiwan and will not follow blindly the style of our gahmen. Taiwanese fight for their right and make full use of democracy to stand firm in what they believe and want.  Taiwan is a very different country from Singapore.<br><br>Somehow, I admire their guts and courage in dealing with politics issues.</div>
