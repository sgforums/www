Don't need to always, you "stupid ah", "no brain ah" and such and such.<br><br>I mean what happen if we keep saying things like this and take pride in being able to humiliate our opponent? You know, like for eg ah only for eg, Rane in one of her previous post called me wo nan fei. Normally, somebody of the opposite team would shoot back and said it "should be spelled as Wo Nang Fei" then insert "a counter insult" like "you noob". But what would happen if I do that? Rane would prob get focus on language problem then we go off topic again liao lor.<br><br>Like I say before so many times, I'm not against people saying bad things about govt. I like it better if the points are substaintial and well-backed like Atobe's. I may not like shutterbug and robberteh kind of everything under-the-sun also PAP's fault style of writing, but I also don't flame them and insult them mah.<br></div></blockquote>We are not here to please you.

            <div class='col-md body'>LOL Taiwan politics is the biggest joke of democracy.......... their politicians fight in the parliament like nobody cares, all of them are as corrupt as Suharto. Their elections are all about name callings and not about current issues. All the politicians in Taiwan are better working in the entertainment industry than in politics. In fact Taiwan politics IS an entertainment industry. As for Mr Ma Ying Jeon I do agree that he won't follow Mr Lee's style, please read this:<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Ying-jeou#Special_Expenses_Allegations_and_Resignation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Ying-jeou#Special_Expenses_Allegations_and_Resignation</a><br><br>He will be much worse! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

When their leaders are all incompetent and more corrupt than the PAP everyone complains about. Look at all the problems with Chen Shui-bian, James Soong and co? To me Taiwan is the poster boy of the problems of democracy. I can really see that unless a strong and honest leader appears in Taiwan soon we can expect Taiwan to be eaten by China within our lifetime.</div>
