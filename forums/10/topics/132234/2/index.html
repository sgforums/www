Mr Yeo did nothing wrong. You should speak to some of the scholars. Maybe even those who had yet to get a scholarship, but went for several interviews. You will feel so absolutely disgusted by some of them. To them, getting a scholarship is something normal to them because their peers are doing so. They also feel the need to get one as a prove of their academic achievements. They never did realise that they are USING PUBLIC MONEY. They never feel the need to repay the public for sponsoring their education. They feel that it's their goddamn right because they are oh-so-smart. Oh yah, some of them are my so-called friends.<br><br>Do not blast Mr Yeo beacuse of the gender issue. </div></blockquote>yes those scholars or scholars to be are so cb kia ... but i am more disgusted with the judgement of this interviewer that is pay by PUBLIC MONEY.<br><br>when 1 or 2 break bond it's maybe that person faults.. but if so many ppl break their bond then what?<br><br>1) something is wrong with sg that we cannot provide them with what they can get else where  .<br><br>2) something is wrong with the selection system and the ppl that is doing the selection.<br><br>which is it?? u guess lor.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

A whiner is still a whiner. Everybody should understand that a blog is no longer a personal diary that you can keep hide. It is hosted in public domain. You should go read those newspaper articles on bond-breakers first before you condemn Mr Yeo.<br><br>Mr Yeo has that one thing which those whiners do not have. He has passions in his work and company. Remember how much he contributed to EDB. Those whiners do not have passion. They only care about their own gains.<br><br>By the way, you have yet to answer me. Is it right to use other people's money for your education then go on and whine about how pathetic that person is? Is this how you want to see the society is degrading into? You like ingrates as your friends?<br><br>P.s. I admire Mr Yeo for his passion and character.
