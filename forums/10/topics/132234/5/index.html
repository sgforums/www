            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by timothytsgsg:</div><div class="quote_body">If there was a better economic board which re-distributed the profit better to the people, instead of almost 99% to govt. coffers, then people wouldn't be struggling right now to make ends meet- just to survive.<br><br>My cousin, a poly graduate in IT, now only earns S$900(after CPF) at HP/Compaq. Even a mere full time waiter earns more money than that.<br><br>The fact remains that while the govt. should monitor economic trade, economic links and other stuff related to it(such as passing laws to make it much more fair), it shouldn't control it completely, 100%. Because eventually politicians by themselves are greedy by nature. If you give them a few dollars more, they eventually want more of it. And they continously will want more and more every year.<br><br>It's a vicious cycle. Otherwise why do we have so many civil servants, who are being paid thousands every month for doing nothing, so many committees- which most of it are useless and pointless, and MPs and PAP ministers being paid millions of dollars when they have proven they are a bunch of useless crap idiots?<br><br>I mean South Korea, 8 years after the economic crisis in '97, has boomed since the early 2000s. SK private companies, after going through a series of tough reforms have become better and better. The likes of Samsung and Hyundai are going places and are making huge profits. So why is S'pore struggling to get out of sluggish growth since 2002?<br><br>And to include this point: why is Ho Ching's Temasek Holdings struggling in the foreign market outside of S'pore as well?  </div></blockquote>The whole meritocracy scheme as was implemented over the past 39 years can only help to produce certain manpower needed for the public administration sector.<br><br>Whether scholars or mandarins so constantly drummed into our citizens' consiciousness are entrepreneurial or creative remain a big question mark. All we know is that during the last two recessions since the 1997 financial crisis the scholars (ministers and top civil servants) that they could not do anything to save jobs except to wait out the world economic crisis.<br><br>Korean scholars and ordinary people on the other hand under normal leadership supported by a democratic and accountable system came out strongly from the recessions and did even better than before. I agree that they had been able to re-structure their economy and their local companies like Samsung and Hyundai are now making waves in technological advancements in all areas.<br><br>Meanwhile, Singapore leaders kept up their rhetoric about their talents and scholars and nothing much were achieved. The only way they know as talents how to govern the country is to continue to increase prices and government charges. When it comes to accidents and major fumbles, ministers would be making denials after denials blaming the faults on honest mistakes..<br><br>So I ask all Singaporeans : judge for yourself how good are our scholars? Should they continue to spend so much on scholars and give them all the highest salaries and perks and automatic career advancement unconnected to actual achievements as done in the private sector.<br><br>Now, we even have top civil servants making challenges again after the recessions are over to say that they are the ones who know how to judge real scholars even with such poor records on their part in past scholarship schemes. They have grown over-bold in deciding that male NSmen are the whiners and wimpers.<br><br>Sad to note that all these years of investing in our scholars can only at best produce a weakening foreign-dependent moribund economy. There has been no involvements or acknowledgement of ordinary people of the same kinds as are accorded to scholars in all spheres of economic vibrancy and entrepreneurship.<br><br>This kind of one-sided public policy has been pursued for the past 39 years without any significant improvements to lives of ordinary people.<br><br>And at the first sign of world economic recovery, our so-called talents and scholars who are given all the automatic advancements and benefits are now trying to capitalize on imagined talents and leadership again and attribute any economic recovery to their credits.</div>

For years, leaders are still talking and talking year in and year out about the same policies without getting anywhere.<br><br>That is the price our leaders are paying for being too self-confident or arrogant about themselves and not doing enough to get everyone aboard.<br><br>It is not Singapore is a very big country like China or India too complex to manage.
