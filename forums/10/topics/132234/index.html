            <div class='col-md body'>there was another thread about this.  wonder if the administrators wish to put them together.<br><br>anyway, Mr Yeo appeared on the news again today and i'm quite disappointed with his reply.  this was his opportunity at saving grace and yet he blew it.  in the first place, the issue of contention has been hidden and stashed away and will never see the light of day so when he claims that the concerned scholars were being whimpy, we would never be able to tell how true that is, would we?  without seeing both sides of the coin, how can we decide who is right on the basis of one sided arguments?  in any case, as with most arguments, there will always be two sides and i dun think anyone concerned in the issue is 100% right.<br><br>frankly this shouldn't be a big deal and the way it's being handled goes to show just how unsophisticated the protagonists can be.<br><br>Mr Yeo hoped to see sky diving individuals but we know in the army the closest thing to that we do is skiving (combine the two words together).  if macho men is what he wishes to see and not withery, willowy weaklings, then i'm afraid Mr Yeo is not setting a good example himself.<br><br>lastly about the effects of national service.  i don't think toughness is an issue.  most of us go through fitter, stronger, tougher ... physically and mentally.  however in terms of helping us make better decisions, i beg to differ.  i mean, army is all about regimentation ... following rules, following orders, accepting the unreasonable ... and after two and a half years of being incacerated the last thing you would hope to see is being treated similarly in a civilian context.<br></div>

I am curious how Mindef would respond to this when the cream of NS high-fliers are being labelled as "whinners"?

            <div class='col-md body'>The way our civil servant like Philip Yeo speaks is a clear sign that all is not well.<br><br>It reminds me of how the emperors in ancient dynasties surrounded themselves with certain officers to stage control of the government.<br><br>In our case, the same power game appeared to have been deliberately created for the same control purpose. It is just as well that after many years of autocratic governance, the autocracy has learned the art of establishing itself into power conclaves to consolidate authority around lower servants without ministerial status. Such servants will be secretly and unofficially given special seals of authority to do and speak as they like. They can engage in criticizing ministers during special sessions without being reprimanded for insubordination.<br><br>The purpose of creating such hidden powers is obviously to preserve a special vestige of power to exclude any potential challenge to authority of the autocracy.<br><br>The formal positions like ministers are no longer real powers even though they hold higher official positions. The real powers are deliberately held by certain lower hierachy officers who nevertheless enjoys special privileges and confidences of the emperor himself.<br><br>People will not be able to grasp who is finally in control of the government with such hidden authority.<br><br>People are no longer able to question the ministers or officers on wrong doings or policies or performance. It is hidden authority that will runs the government over time with the hidden powers placed in the hand of a few who will carry out secret missions to serve the powerful individuals around the emperor who himself is unaccountable for whatever is going on.<br><br>The autocracy has apparently polished itself as an autocracy as given such a system the emperor would not have to be accountable to anyone and he is fully in control.<br><br>There will be servants out to test the public reactions as such controls or hidden controls is part and parcel of autocracy.<br><br>There will be no more formal hierachy and People will have to figure out who are the emperor's favorite servants that is all and be careful not to step on the wrong tails.<br><br>Still remember the Chng Hee Kok trying to question how the economy was run etc and how despite his formal higher position in the government he was told off - to resign his MP post if he was not happy at the way it was run.<br><br>Even ex-president Ong Teng Cheong was subject to being told off by certain junior servants not to ask too many questions on assets.<br><br>This current state of political degradation is precisely why people must speak up in order to act as a check on such wrongful administration and undemocratic practices as posted in the "Defintion of True Democracy" thread.<br><br>Do you all want to see more special powers acquired by certain junior non-elected servants to whom people are paying high salaries to serve our interests to engage in power plays as described?</div>
