In fact the best workers around are those who are in the private sector and are of non-scholar breed.<br><br>Why? It's because of desire. Most scholar types probably think that since they are so smart, they do not see the need to learn more, no need to work harder than before.<br><br>But non scholars see things differently. They believe learning is a non-stop process. Even if you have become an old man, you can still learn things, albeit slower compared to a younger one. Since learning is a non-stop process, they never stop understanding, never rule out anything, always picking things up as they go along and learning from their mistakes and learning from their success equally.<br><br>Bosses from the international companies loves these kind of workers as these are the people who can really drive a team and even the whole company foward into bigger and better things.</div>

The old policy about scholars is not convincing or logical as a lot of unproven academic people are being pushed to take charge of responsibility which do not bear results. What is judgmental or presumptuous will remain so for many more years. It is a farce it is still the major policy in today's real world of competitive entrepreneurship and creativity.

I have to agree with you that academic performance is about the easiest way out for a human resource person to do his or her job.<br><br>However it is a fact that entrepreneurs in society are those with Passions, and abilities who have pursued their vocations well and established their contributions one way or another. These people are not products of our educational systems and are difficult to judge.<br><br>Many businesses, industries and jobs in the market place are not as straightforward as prepared by the schools or educational system. Projects engineers, designers and managers in many fields outside are not the same as produced or prepared by construction/engineering courses from the universities.<br><br>But our educational system is so general that it emphasises on narrow acquisition of certain subjects and presumes that jobs in the market place will be handled by these students so educated. If a certain broad-based educatioal approach has been adopted there would not be so much hype about scoring of grades in certain subjects of academic nature. There should be more preparations of students in general education plus applications of skills and practical knowledge in various real-life works found in the outside worlds and market place. The latter de-emphasises on academic but practical abilities in applying learning to works and actual business start-ups or projects.<br><br>It will take a long time for our system to change to broad-based applications of knowledge at schooling and university educational levels. Dr. Tony Tan has probably read about many postings given to FU on broad-based education and vocational success in Finland, Sweden and Denmark and has recently taken a look there to study their experiences. Such practical preparations and vocational approaches in schooling will produce more entrepreneurs for us to compete with those other countries like Korea or Taiwan in economic competitiveness and use of future technologies. The government should reverse the over-emphasis on getting the highest academic qualifications to occupy all jobs and professions and be more balanced through broad-based education in  producing more employable people to meet future demands in job markets. But our leaders are so very persistent in pursuing the academic approach that it cannot open up to broad-based education system which Dr. Tan has mentioned due to many past feedbacks to FU.<br><br>In selecting talents or employees to fit civil servive jobs, other criteria for selecting candidates for a job should be open up to include:-<br><br>(1) 3-5 years' track records in similar or related positions (2) Interests and related experiences can be judged from candidates' pursuits in works and study courses.<br><br>Examples of (1) : Many managers/executives/technicians/ in various fields from marketing to human resource, projects and manufacturing are far more capable in doing a good job than those with certain paper qualifications.<br><br>Examples of (2) : New technologies in various areas not well covered by schooling or educational institutions are occupied by persons in those positions from internal promotions or deployments.<br><br>However because of over-emphasis on paper qualifications there is  a persistent recognition of paper qualifications and grades as if these people are the talents in every field. Even in Human resource and simple accounting, the tendency is to ask for paper qualification and looking at grades.<br><br>The people with abilities in various non-tradtional fields given a chance to enter particular fields due to initial lower entry requirements are often our entrepreneurs e.g. Hyflux boss Ms Lydia Lum does not possess the first degree or the highest grade in professional paper in water purifications but through entering her persistent passion and interest in particular field she certainly excels in building her company into our truly indigeneous MNC.<br><br>Similarly The best person who discovers or designs something that finally sells in the market place are often not products of educational system but pure interests and passions.<br><br>In our society, we follow the meritocracy principle and ask for specific paper qualification in employing or promoting people to the next level. It is not a system user friendly to progress or economic success.<br><br>This kind of society lacks entrepreneurship and economic competitiveness. What the government does is to close doors by asking for specific paper qualification in every vocation. It should change the whole education system to allow more practical passionate people to become future entrepreneurs instead of presuming to know everything about the economic and equate it to academic abilities or formal training. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I have heard stuff from sammyboy kopitiam that PY was only a constable- those typical easy desk job- or something.<br><br>So he didn't really learn how to know a gun or know how to shoot properly or know some close combat martial art skills.

His vocation in his NS life is more or less like those admin assistants at CMPB. Even a cop needs to go through some training regimen in order for him to be able to catch criminals.</div>
