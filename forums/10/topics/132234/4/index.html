A whiner is still a whiner. Everybody should understand that a blog is no longer a personal diary that you can keep hide. It is hosted in public domain. You should go read those newspaper articles on bond-breakers first before you condemn Mr Yeo.<br><br>Mr Yeo has that one thing which those whiners do not have. He has passions in his work and company. Remember how much he contributed to EDB. Those whiners do not have passion. They only care about their own gains.<br><br>By the way, you have yet to answer me. Is it right to use other people's money for your education then go on and whine about how pathetic that person is? Is this how you want to see the society is degrading into? You like ingrates as your friends?<br><br>P.s. I admire Mr Yeo for his passion and character. These are what seperates the boys from the men.</div></blockquote>Is it wrong to use an agency's money and speak frankly on how the agency can improve itself?The scholar involved was concerned about the direction A*Star was heading in the way it conducted the KPIs and  benchmarking for their performance, which basically skewed the weightage towards academic grades rather than actual research output and efficacy.<br><br>Therefore I beg to ask, what is so "whiny" about speaking up about the possible mistakes a stat board might make?He is in fact protecting our interests.Only in the eyes of Philip Yeo is he a whiner, because he did not and will not conform to A*Star's ruinious pathway to supposed success.<br><br>Transparency denied is transparency denied, no matter how Philip Yeo wishes to re-glaze it.<br><br>(P.S, Iveco is right.I would rather work my way up somewhere in my own capacity than be submitted to the ludicrous blinkers of the local scholarly system.I have no hankering nor desire to be an "elite".Our establishment's concept of an elite differs from my own so I'd rather chart my own course in life.Money, prestige and influence is not everything in this world.)</div>

Given the lack of genuine transparency in these government organisations, as well as the fact that, as we know, Singaporeans are almost never told the truth about anything that reflects negatively on the government, it is nearly impossible for anyone to accurately gauge exactly how much of a contribution these organisations have made to Singapore.<br><br>For example, there is really no reliable way to verify whether all those corporate tax breaks, cuts in CPF contribution rates and other incentives given to foreign MNCs have really translated into adequate benefits for average Singaporeans. Indeed, considering the stagnant employment and salary levels we're seeing, as well as the ongoing financial problems that many Singaporean families are facing, one might have good cause to suspect that all is not well.<br><br>There is also no reliable way to confirm whether or not all our taxpayers' money is being properly managed by these government agencies. On the contrary, I believe many international commentators have remarked that many Singapore govt agencies have produced very poor returns on their investments to date.</div>

Even a mere full time waiter earns more money than that.<br><br>The fact remains that while the govt. should monitor economic trade, economic links and other stuff related to it(such as passing laws to make it much more fair), it shouldn't control it completely, 100%. Because eventually politicians by themselves are greedy by nature. If you give them a few dollars more, they eventually want more of it. And they continously will want more and more every year.<br><br>It's a vicious cycle. Otherwise why do we have so many civil servants, who are being paid thousands every month for doing nothing, so many committees- which most of it are useless and pointless, and MPs and PAP ministers being paid millions of dollars when they have proven they are a bunch of useless crap idiots?<br><br>I mean South Korea, 8 years after the economic crisis in '97, has boomed since the early 2000s. SK private companies, after going through a series of tough reforms have become better and better. The likes of Samsung and Hyundai are going places and are making huge profits. So why is S'pore struggling to get out of sluggish growth since 2002?<br><br>And to include this point: why is Ho Ching's Temasek Holdings struggling in the foreign market outside of S'pore as well?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And I only believe the only reason why I'm so passionate about these issues is because I believe S'poreans should get more out of their lives than compared to now.<br><br>It's sad however to hear from people however, that even with overwhelming evidence that no matter how the PAP have since went down the money route and abandoned the people since then, people continue to support it, blindly.<br><br>And it's their own money- the taxpayers- that we are talking about.<br><br>S'poreans deserve more rights than they have got now. I believe in that. I also believe that they should have more economic rights right now- and the first thing we should do is to make sure they earn more money(or pay less unnecessary taxes) so that they have more than enough in their pockets.</div>
