            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore to hold presidential election on Aug 27<br><br>By Doug Young<br>SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore will hold an election for the largely ceremonial post of president on August 27, the prime minister's office said in a statement on Wednesday.<br><br>The incumbent, S.R. Nathan, a former ambassador to Washington and internal security chief, said on July 12 he would run for a second term, and the 81-year-old is unlikely to face opposition.<br><br>Strict eligibility requirements, such as past experience in heading a statutory board or a company with a paid-up capital of at least S$100 million ($60 million), restrict the number of candidates. Two local candidates have already been rejected, state broadcaster Channel NewsAsia said on Wednesday.<br><br>Nathan also ran unopposed in 1999 for his first term as head of state. Until 1993 the president was chosen by parliament.<br><br>Nathan, an ethnic Indian born in Singapore, has helped offset the dominance of ethnic Chinese in the government.<br><br>Singapore is a polyglot community of ethnic Chinese, Malays and Indians and representatives from all three races have held the post of president, who has the power to veto government budgets and give clemency to convicted criminals.<br><br>Nathan's presidency has been marked by harmony with the government and its dominant People's Action Party (PAP), which has governed since independence in 1965.<br><br>Nathan's predecessor Ong Teng Cheong, who became Singapore's first elected president in September 1993, had been openly critical of the government.<br><br>The announcement of the presidential vote on August 27 - which will be a public holiday -- clears the way for a parliamentary vote later this year or early in 2006.<br><br>Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong -- the son of founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew -- was handed power in August 2004 and is expected to seek his own mandate.<br><br>A parliamentary election does not have to be held until mid-2007, but the city-state's pro-government Straits Times daily on Sunday quoted analysts and a member of parliament as saying they expected a poll as early as the fourth quarter of this year.<br><br>A precedent for early elections was set in 1991, when Goh Chok Tong -- prime minister between Lee senior and Lee junior -- called an election just nine months after he was handed power.<br><br>Analysts say that to secure strong leadership, Lee Hsien Loong must at least match his party's tally in the last poll in 2001, when Goh won 75 percent of the vote for the PAP, which controls all but two seats in parliament.<br><br>Analysts say there is no doubt that the PAP would win a comfortable majority against a cash-strapped opposition.<br><br>Copyright Â© 2005 Reuters<br><br></div>

This is long overdue for implementation. I believe this is a way of signalling to overseas Singaporeans that the government values their votes, as well as engaging them in Singapore's domestic developments.<br><br>It is ironic that Singaporeans are eligible to vote in the UK elections as resident Commonwealth citizens but do not enjoy the same right (not privilege) for their own country.<br><br>For your comment, please.<br><br>Date of Reply	10/12/2002<br>Dear contributor,<br><br>Please refer to your feedback on Overseas voting.<br><br>You may wish to know that overseas voting has been allowed. On 19 April 2001, Parliament passed legislation to provide for voting by Singapore Citizens abroad at designated overseas polling stations. The Singapore High Commission in London is one of the 5 overseas polling stations so designated. If not for the September 11 incident, we would have proceeded with overseas voting at the 2001 General Election held on 3 November last year.<br><br>The Elections Department is currently looking into increasing the number of overseas polling stations to allow more Singapore Citizens abroad to vote overseas at the future elections.<br><br>PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE<br></blockquote>and<br><br>From:<a href="http://www.elections.gov.sg/overseasvoting.htm" rel="nofollow">SG Gov't Elections Website</a><br><blockquote><br>When you register to vote overseas, you will also be assigned by the Registration Officer to vote at one of the overseas polling stations located within Singapore’s High Commissions, Embassies or Consulates.<br><br>Not all of Singapore’s High Commissions, Embassies or Consulates have been designated as polling stations as many do not have the necessary security and/or numbers of personnel to conduct an election overseas.<br><br>You can check which is your Overseas Polling Station at this page by keying in your NRIC number *.<br><br>* This service is available only after the writ of election is issued.<br><br>Overseas Polling Stations will stay open for at least 4 hours for you to cast your vote. However, you must cast your vote overseas before Polling Day in Singapore ends. Polling Day and voting hours for voting overseas can therefore differ because of the time zones of the different overseas polling stations. The date and hours for voting at each overseas polling station will be available on this page immediately after the Writ of Election is issued.<br><br>Last Updated on: 01 Sep 2004</blockquote>The list of overseas polling stations can be found <a href="http://www.elections.gov.sg/overseas_polling.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br><br>Lastly, how to register as an overseas voter?<br><br><blockquote>Singapore will have overseas voting in future elections. Eligible Singapore Citizens who are working or residing overseas and wish to cast their votes at any of the overseas polling stations may apply to be registered as overseas electors.<br><br>Application for registration must be made by the submission of a duly completed and signed "Application To Be Overseas Elector" Form to Elections Department or any overseas registration centre.<span style="font-style: italic;"> <strong>All applications must be submitted either in person or by registered post between 28 September 2004 and 18 October 2004</strong></span><strong> </strong>(my emphasis). Overseas Singapore Citizens who happen to be back in Singapore during the registration period may also apply for registration to be overseas electors at any inspection centre (for inspecting the Registers of Electors) in Singapore.<br><br>You may also logon here and follow the instructions on the computer screen to key in the information required for registration. After doing so, you can then print out the completed Application Form, sign it and send it together with a photocopy each of any supporting document you have, to Elections Department or any overseas registration centre by registered post within the registration period.<br><br>Printed application forms are available from Elections Department or any of the overseas registration centres, Contact Singapore Centre or Singapore Club, or inspection centres in Singapore.<br><br>For more information on registration to be overseas electors, you may refer to the set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).<br>Last Updated on: 29 Sep 2004<br></blockquote></div>

The closest i can find is this:<br><br>From <a href="http://SCC" rel="nofollow">SCC</a>, July 2001.<br><blockquote><br>A person must have been successfully registered as an overseas<br>elector before he can vote overseas. The basic requirement is<br>that the person must be entitled to have his named entered or<br>ratained in any Register of Electors for an electoral division.<br>In addition, he must satisfy any of the following qualifying<br>criteria :<br><br>a)<br>He is not resident in Singapore but has resided in Singapore<br>for an aggregate of 2 years during the period of 5 years immediately<br>preceding the prescribed date (which, as provided in the<br>Parliamentary Elections Act, "shall be 1st July or such other<br>date as the Minister may, by order published in the Gazette,<br>specify". Registration must be made within 21 days from the<br>prescribed date);<br><strong>or</strong><br><br>b)<br>He is :<br><br>i) A member of the SAF on full-time training or service outside<br>Singapore;<br><br>ii) A public officer or an employee of any public authority employed<br>in full-time service outside Singapore;<br><br>iii) A public officer or an employee of a public authority on<br>full-time training outside Singapore;<br><br>iv) A citizen of Singapore of not less than 21 years of age on<br>full-time training outside Singapore that is sponsored by<br>the Government or any public authority;<br><br>v) Employed outside Singapore by an international organization<br>of which Singapore is a member or any other body or<br>organisation designated by the President under Article 135<br>(1) (c) (ii) of the Singapore Constitution; or<br><br>vi) The spouse, or a parent, child or dependent of any person<br>referredto in (1) to (v) above and is living with that person.<br></blockquote>So it appears that subject to certain residency requirements, SG citizens are allowed to register. Its only if you do not meet the requirements that an exception is made citizens overseas on govt business. [/quote]<br><br>Seriously, the govt MUST improve the quality of their press releases.
