              Premier Wen Jia Bao is truly the type of leader we should have for Singapore. He does not boast of his talents or leadership or world-class standard but humbly serve as servant of the people.
              
              There is no need for him to write a book to claim or boast about his leadership or abilities. 
              
              People can see and when people respect him as true leaders. Even though China is a very large country and yet it is not suffering the kind of hypocrisy among the leaders as they go about their duties diligently not comparing with the or claiming to be the best in the world despite run-away success in many areas in recent years. 
              
              We are a small country where people are being made to suffer all the problems to make the elite HYPO leaders look good internationally while many are suffering inside.
              
              The small nation is being divided because of lack of morality among leadership. This is not happening in China and it is getting stronger as a success as their people cooperated with their leaders in every way to improve their lives and standards. In our case we have to contend with many problems with constant denials by our leaders who insisted on their past success and glories with nothing done about complacency in NKF or Selamat or suffering of ordinary people.
              
              It is this sort of wisdom which is badly lacking in our government that citizens are made to suffer much problems. Yet the hypocritical or Hypo leaders we have are still so thick-skinned that they still keep insisting they are the best leaders who have the moral authority to expect respect from the people.
              
              Respect is to be earned not forced upon by claims or counter-insurgency postings by leaders as seen in this and many forums.

              I accept your view that this covert corruptions are happening in China. Covert or Legalistic corruption is evil. However in our case legalistic tweaking of HYPO may be worse.

              <p>History always judge the legacy of a man.</p>
              <p>China with her long years of history that dates back centuries have not seen any of its leaders write memoirs of themselves and of their times - even emperors with thousands of scribes have not passed any edicts to do so.</p>
              <p>Only those who need money or more publicity or recognition - will do so to satisfy their own vanity and imagined demands of public curiosity to their high profile personality.</p>
              <p>Sadly, for one who re-write history in his own autobiography, he has prevented the publication of similar memoirs from his political nemesis.</p>
              <p>''Emissaries'' were sent to prevent the family members from publishing the memoirs of the late Devan Nair, and the late Dr Lee Siew Choh - both of whom had spent their last surviving years to document their own experiences of the political events of the 1950s through 1960s, and which would have contradicted LKY's memoirs of the same period.</p>
              <p>The survivors of these deceased Singaporean political personalities had received covert statements that publication of the memoirs would result in embroiling the survivors in litigations, and continuing the legacy of political struggle with the Powers of ONE.</p>

              Because of billions of losses in playing big brothers in UBS and other world stage, all the hypocrisy about their supremacy of leadership and crystal ball gazing abilities has been exposed.
              
              Any more big pretence about their charitable spirit by the HYPO leaders will put them in a quandary.
              
              For damage control HYPO leaders have to lower their pretences and slow down throwing people's monies for self-glory while people are deprived of subsistence due to their tight-assness.
              
              But do not worry Singaporeans are raising funds among themselves like in NKF to sincerely help victims of Myanmar or China disaster not for glory or political face but with true heart-felt sincerity.

              <p>Sorry to correct you. But Singapore is not a Christian country. But we can't blame you. Due to bad marketing, we do not really have an identity.</p>

              <p>Sorry to correct you. But Singapore is not a Christian country. But we can't blame you. Due to bad marketing, we do not really have an identity.</p>
              <p>But I have to agree with you that SG is not really known to be generous donors under most circumstances.</p>
              <p>For tightass, the shit is usually circulated in the internal system. The shitty effect is mainly felt by the lower system.</p>

              <p>@ the topic:i believe mainland China has to move forward to a democratic country sooner or later.Becoz China open up her doorstep n welcome investment has a short history.If i am not wrong,she open up her market during 1979,after the cultural revolution.</p>
              <p>China still has a long way to go of realising that Western democracy is more efficient than one-party dominating situation.They have to learn,self-reproaching,realise and implement democracy before they can go further in future.</p>

              <p>I once heard the "live" speech of lky.  he reiterated that he wants his MPs to be respected by the people.   He refuses or is ignorant that respect is earned not deserved.   We the people of Singapore are not his and his MPs and ministers' employees, stop treating us like slaves and as if we owe them a living.</p>
              <p>It is lky, lhl, goh choke tong and all in pap that owe us a living, we feed them, we are their bosses.</p>
