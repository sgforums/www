              The PRC Chinese are indeed very patriotic but i don't think they love the govt much. Singaporeans do stand together in times of crisis but they are not as patriotic as compared with the PRC Chinese. There are probably 2 reasons of this. Firstly, Sg is a relatively young country, and secondly, the govt don't quite cherish them.

              <p>As for Singapore, the things that the Government did nowadays really pissed off many ppl. Althought everything in SG looks really good to other countries,, it is effort of ordinary ppl in SG , but the Government takes all the credits.</p>
              <p>i think SG should allow peaceful protest to be legal, just like other country. if peaceful protest is not legal in a country, the country can nv achieve freedom.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I think the question of democracy deserves further examination.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, it is not neccessarily the best system to apply.</p>
              <p>In places where liberal democracy is applied, western countries and afew non-western countries, what do we see..?</p>
              <p>Different parties/ factions fight each other, decision making take very long or have to modify to suit populist sentiments, and negative campaigning/ negative attacks towards each other. Demonstrations and counter-demonstrations on many policies. Media setting the agenda and shaping public opinion. MPs and politicians have to look good and photogenic to sell themselves and win elections.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, this democracy may or may not be the best political system.</p>
              <p>Also it is important to note, I think social systems and beliefs, the building block of society, is the basis of a political system. The political system should reflect the underlying social system.</p>
              <p>In western countries, individualism, freedom of individual, individual identity, is a <br>strong character of their social values. In eastern countries, collectivism, respect for hirearchy, order, and less individualism, is strong character of the social values.</p>
              <p>This is not just some theory but a real practice too. We can see it everywhere in our day-to-day lives.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the question of democracy, it deserves further examination.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, each country or society must find for itself what is the best and most suitable system, which suits its cultural identity, social beliefs, and national character, and also most importantly, a system which can bring results, pragmatic, and workable.</p>
              <p>In other words, we shouldn't believe the notion of 'democracy' can be applied uniformly across all societies in the world in an universal manner. I think doing that would be akin to self-sabotage.</p>

              <p>I agree with Meat Pao.</p>
              <p>Since all countries are different, then clearly the form of democracy that will take place, that can work will also be different.</p>
              <p>Although some basic principles of governance will remain the same.</p>
              <p>Things like,</p>
              <p>Rule of law.</p>
              <p>Checks and balances.</p>
              <p>Protection of certain rights to citizens etc.</p>
