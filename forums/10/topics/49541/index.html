            <div class='col-md body'><br>Hi Stevenson101, I find your comment to be quite amusing, but why should you think I would want to lynch you ?<br><br>You are quite right to say that most in the First World industrialized nations seem to be having this problem of singles and small families, and that it is not solely a Singaporean experience.<br><br>Surprisingly, even in Mainland China, especially in the urban areas, this trend is becoming very common too, and China is not exactly a First World country as yet Â– at least not by the same measure.<br><br>Somehow modern day living seems to become more burdensome then in the days of the traditional agricultural or simple trading days (as in Singapore during the early 1950s).<br><br>The cost of living maybe affecting the decisions to stay single for most people Â– even up to middle age; while the thought of being bound by the responsibilities of a relationship seems to be quite daunting, especially when couples tend to change in character after the romance has worn itself out in the grind of everyday married life.<br><br>In Singapore today, it is quite common to have small private wedding receptions amongst close friends and relatives, with large wedding dinners being done away with; although in some families, the maintaining of Â“faceÂ” require a grand dinner party to be held to make a public announcement of the coming of age of the wedded couple.<br><br>The groomÂ’s parents in most Chinese families; will pay for the lavish dinners; while in the Eurasian and Caucasian families, the brideÂ’s side will pay the dinners.<br><br>Many wedding couples today will dispense away with such lavish dinners if their parents do not pay for it, and with whatever savings they have made, the wedding couple would prefer to spend on a honeymoon and build their new home.<br><br>Single child family, or no child family, can be attributed mostly to the occupational demands placed on the career women, while it can also be due to the hardship factor of a lower income family.<br><br>Surprisingly enough, many couples are also having problems in procreation, due to physical constraints that result in fertility problems, with some being caused by job stress, post-marital tensions, diet, or simple malfunction of the reproductive organs.<br><br>This is sad, and in some instances in-vitro assistance do not seem to be of any help.<br><br>It is little wonder that SM LKY had said that his greatest mistake is probably to protect Women's Rights with the Women's Charter; thus depriving some single women from ever experiencing motherhood as a second wife or mistress of some successful person who can afford to do so.<br><br>(N.B: Others have disputed the Women's Charter as being derogatory of the Singapore Women - read some articles printed in "Escape from Paradise");<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The decision by many to have smaller families not doubt comprise of many complex and differing considerations.<br><br>Of course, the most basic and foundamentals ones would include the cost of having a large family, personal prefences, and the appropriate housing needs of a large sized family as compared to a smaller one.<br><br>I believe the arguments with concern towards the cost of having a large family would have been very familiar with many of us here.<br><br>However, I would like to highlight the point that it might also be prehaps, the decreasing size of the availible housing units that may be actually' forcing' family sizes to shrink too.<br><br>Consider a typical young couple who just got married.<br><br>While they may not req a large unit in the early phase of their marriage, four or five years down the line, chances are that the pair would have had children of their own.<br><br>Assuming that the couple's first appartment isa 4 room HDB flat, the available space would be already been very streched for the two parents and the two children.<br><br>Where would there be room for the third child to come in?<br><br>Now of course if we were to look solely at this statement, the argument would be very lame indeed.<br><br>However, if the relevant authorities could give some special financial assistance for couples who have decided to have larger families at least some limited financial assistence to get a larger 5-room unit for their first purchase, the move would probably lend a very helpful hand for such family planning.<br><br>Though there will be the usual black sheeps who will try to take advantage of the scheme if oneis available, I certainly believe that the authorities would have a hard time to track down family units who had participated in the scheme, but later decided against participation.<br><br>The periodic reacquiring of the loaned sum may thus be done by the authorities, and no harm would be done anyway.<br><br>The positive benefits of such family friendly assitance would not only play a significant role in helping large family startups to be easier, but may also be seen as a parallel extension of the Baby Bonus scheme revealed by the Prime Minister some time back in a bid to encourage population growth.<br><br>Incidently, the spirit of such schemes would also go hand in hand with MCDS' rigourous promotion of extended family contacts.</div>
