            <div class='col-md body'>My chinese is completely rosak, F9 o-levels thanks to a childhood raised on american red-white-and-blue culture. I can only speak and write chinese barely (good enuff to communicate decently though).<br><br>On the other hand, despite my languare handicap, if you ask me if I am ashamed to be chinese, I'll slap you several times in the face. I am extremely okay with my heritage if you ask me, and apperciate it's rich history and diversity (americans, virtual upstarts with only 200 years behind them, have nothing much to offer save ignorance and arrogrance) not to mention being the most technologically advanced civillisation until Ming-started zenophobia shut development down. Still, it took the westerners over 200 years to catch up. Though regretably my masterly of my mother language is poor, I do not look down, nor fail to associate myself with my people.<br><br>It could be said the demographics l am in, the westernized asian chinese, are at the crossroads of cultures. In between those who don't want to be chinese at all, wanting to be japanese, korean or westerners, and between those who are largely zenophobic.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Besides, pls note that a lot of our co-called traditional chinese values which place great suspision and phobia of other cultures are greatly Ming-inspired xenophobic rules. For the majority of chinese history, our people was actually marked by their open and diverse assimilation of different and diverse cultures. The chinese are more of a blendwork of differing cultures and people rather then something you can point out and say that or that is distinctly chinese. I believe our current culture is evolving at an extremely rapid rate, after having spent years locked up since the Ming until recent years.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So which is more "chinese"?<br><br>Not mentioning the fact that race as a scientific term is actually invalid and does not exist, does a chinese person who can speak his language well considered more chinese then a westernized, english speaking one who has a greater apperciation of his own culture?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Friend,<br><br>Don't be too worked up over being Chinese. I am a chinese. But the Chinese culture I practice is not the same as the Chinese culture practiced by the Chinamen in China, nor the Taiwanese, Nor the HongKies. Its Singaporean Chinese culture.<br><br>The recent Chinese culture revival is actually because of some people wanting to create a idealized Chinese identity, and hence want to standardize the perception of what Chinese are like. And being the Majority, the China people will assume that their Chinese "culture" and "society" is the master design.<br><br>Whenever a China man call me a Banana, I merely ask him how many kids does he want. He will reply one. Then I will say, the chinese culture needs you to have many. Why stop at one. They will then say, the country can not support more. I will say that is AGAINST chinese culture.  I will also bring up ancestor worship, respect for elders and burial customs. I will also touch on how the communist has destroyed all the cultural heirlooms and banned certain practices. All these will be more than enough to shut up any Chinaman over we banana's lack of chinese culture.<br><br>We must not have the mentality of ONE chinese culture. Culture is able to adapt to each country that we chinese are in. The Anglo culture that is in USA, UK and Australia has evolved into distinct identities. Hence my own belief that we must have our own chinese identity and culture in Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, HK and China.</div>

Chinese think its more fashionable to be AMerican. Some of my Chinese guy friends seem ashamed to admit they speak mandarin. It has become like a fashion to fail Chinese in my school, people don;t care about the language.<br><br>Well as for the WEst and the world being round stuff... well i meant West as in White people, Caucasians... but specifically American, that was what i meant by WEST.</div>
