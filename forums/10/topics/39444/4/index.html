When the Europeans migrated to America, they too eventually lost their roots through the generations.  Even the native cultures themselves evolve out of their "traditional" state.  Just look at the Shakespearean English culture, much of it is lost in England; In fact the only place in the world where you can still find the remants of Shakespearan English and culture is in Beverly Hills (the Hillbillies) who despite being detached from it's native origins, still preserved its culture.<br><br>So my argument my friend, is that the Chinese Culture itself is evolving too.  For example they have switched to simplified Mandrain in China, but the Taiwanese and Hong Kongers still use traditional Mandrain.  We use simplified Mandrain in Singapore, so are we not more in touch with the "traditional" chinese culture than the Taiwanese and Hong Kongers???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nevermind, i should not speak so much stuff, cos yall will get sidetracked from the point and critic me heh, anywayz, fine fine Jesus was a jewish guy i said he most likely might have been a caucasian looking person, but that is not the point. I don't give a **** how Jesus looked like. What i said was just my thoughts whizzling in me head.<br><br>The point is; as i said before, i believe Christianitiy as a religion is a kind of brand of being Westernized, the "in" thing is to be Christian cos the Americans are Christian, and we all love America soo much don't we? Well not America, but perhaps its "way of life". Anywayz, "sorry I have forgotten your name" said the people i am reffering to are yuppies, okie, i assume yall are not yuppies then, okie well are there many of these kind of "yuppy" people then? Or are they a minority? Cos i am sure such people do exist.<br><br>Next, Christianity in Europe is dying out, more Europeans regard being Christian as something just to put under the "State your religion" category on official forms, they don't really believe in it much,,, especially after the book Holy Blood and Holy Grail came out (this book provided detective type evidence that Jesus' crucifiction was false and denounced what Christians believe Jesus was today)... in England and France, Churches have been turned into pubs, lounges, resteraunts and sometimes apartments or even manufacturing lines (but quite rare cos of the decor that churches possess). Whatever Churches are left (Canterbury, Edinburgh Cathedral) are only there for tourist purposes and to teach young kiddies how to sing in Latin, i've been there, tourists can dress up like cardinals or priests and have photos taken with the beautiful stained glass for 10 pounds. Most Europeans are more into the Eastern religions nowadays like Buddhism and Taoism. So there!<br><br>"Want to fight iszit"<br>Chaar, i can see why the mods must hav edited your post, cos you like to turn everything into a joke, i've seen you in other forums and posts, you make fun of cross-dresses and bangladeshi workers. No wonder u have got your posts edited.</div>
