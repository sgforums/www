            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ProudSGChinese:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm opening this thread due to the disgraceful attitude i see in Chinese nowadays.<br><br>Singaporean Chinese nowadays have no feelings for the Chinese Culture, the Chinese Language. I have never have seen a race which have detioriated into such extent. The Chinese in Singapore has forgotten the roots. Some can't even write their Chinese names. Why? They say that Chinese ain't important and that English is more important. The importance is not so importance. What erks me is that they are actually forgetting themselves, the blood that flows in them, the culture they have been brought up in..<br>I wish to cancel all doubts by distancing my article on Chinese as a Singaporean Chinese race and not some stuff propagating China Chinese. Even though i do treat all Chinese equally as the Malays treat one another, i do not feel so much for the China Chinese as for the Singaporean Chinese.<br><br>SG Chinese has dropped so far back that they are looking down on their race rather than looking up to it. Such is the mentality of "Jap and Korean" that many Singaporean Chinese would rather be a Jap or a Korean than a Chinese. I find that it is a downright shame. Imagine looking up to a race that invaded our ancestor's homeland and killed without blinking a eyelid. I do not understand what is so great about the japanese that wil make Chinese feel that Japanese is more cool and hence wants to "disown" Chinese. Some even rather have Japanese names den Chinese names. Some are even afraid to say their Chinese names, caus they feel it will make them look uncool.<br><br>I find that the Singapore Government has been a failure. In this aspect. In their strive for a multi-racial country they have been neglecting the Chinese race, leading it into total disarray. Their bloody lack of confidence makes them polticise every attempt to invoke a sense of pride in Singaporean Chinese. They fear of the backlash if SIngaporean Chinese turns communist. Big Joke. They are so insecure. So what has happened since? SIngaporean Chinese have lost their roots. Compare it with races like the Malay one. I am proud of them, why? They closely knitted society and they are proud to be a Malay. When Iraq was attacked, their arab brothers all around the war rose up to speak against it. What do we call people from China? Cheena. When someones say that they do not have an english name? You are a cheena-kia.<br><br>Such is the mindset of today's chinese that i feel disgusted. The PAP government has groomed a Chinese race that ain't so chinese. I hate it when people confuse Chinese with Singapore. Being a proud Chinese doesn't mean i support China. Being a proud Chinese does not mean you are not a good Singaporean.I feel that we should widen this cultural gap between the Chinese in SIngapore. Or else in the near future, we should not even learn chinese and call ourself a Chinese.<br></div></blockquote>oh man................ are u really really old? U sound like it. Im not a chinese, im a Singaporean. I may be Chinese in ethnicity, but i seriously cannot feel a connection between myself, and a bunch of people with terrible fashion sense, bad hairdos, atrocious manners, and no money?</div>

Overseas Chinese have actually made a conscious choice to reject chinese citizenship and adopt local citizenship. many have preserved their cultural practices and some have even maintained links with relatives in mainland china.<br><br>thats basically what being overseas chinese means... local citizenship, 1/2 a mind on chinese culture and the other 1/2 focused on the world where we belong. <strong>chinese culture is not china.</strong><br></div>

And so what if I think people in China look ridiculous? Just because im Chinese, i have to think that Chinese people look good? So, is it right to say that just because you are indian, u have to eat roti prata, or just because you are malay, you have to listen to metallica and skateboard? I really don't see your point. From what I gather, you think we should'nt say that people from China are badly dressed just because they have a different culture? Come on... And please, don't be so naive. Just because their growth rate is higher than ours, doesnt mean they are richer. It just means that their economy is growing faster. That's because they're poor. Back in the 60s - 80s in Singapore, our growth rate was very high too. This was because before that, we were relatively poor. Currently, our GDP doesn't grow so much because our country is rich. And how exactly do you arrive at the conclusion that I'm poor? My father earns more in one month than some chinese dude probably earns in a year. Do you even know anything about economics? A country's GDP is not a measure of the average income of a person. Please get your facts right before you come n talk rubbish, because you just end up looking damn bloody stupid. I think you're the person with a low IQ. I'm not ashamed to be a Chinese. However, I do find mainlanders to be rude and obnoxious. Is that wrong? It's a free country. That's my opinion. Live with it. I think you're the more pathetic one. You're the overseas Chinese with an inferiority complex, who needs to link himself to a big country like China and blow the trumpet of Chinese culture just to make himself feel important. You may think you're a Chinese, they're Chinese, we're all one happy family, but when you go there, you'll realize you're not one of them. You may have the same color skin, speak the same language, but you're still not one of them! To them, you speak Chinese weirdly, you have western mannerisms, etc. You're a singaporean, get used to it.</div>

I've a feeling the guy whom said this must not be rich, or do not have a wealthy family. Those in middle class and above families should now knoiw that China is growing, growing at a rate 7 2.5 times ours. Our GDP growth rate was 2-3%, China's was 7-9%.</div></blockquote>HAHAHAHAAHA..... eh how ignorant can you be?<br><br>If you've read The Coming Collapse of China, that huge GDP growth was due to overproduction in the many factories in China which have crappy quality control. All that unwanted goods are just sitting in warehouses waiting to be bought and they're contributing to that GDP growth you were talking about.<br><br>China?! GROWING?! You must've been blinded by those crazy financial advisors who're just so overwhelmed by the "potential" of the huge market. Well, there isn't much of a market to be overwhelmed about. An average Chinese national earns about US$0.50 a day, and he can't even feed himself. What makes you think that he can buy those goods the foreign investors are trying to sell? How about corruption? Sure... the CCP is trying to solve this problem by increasing Civil Service workers' salaries by US$12. Will that even solve it?! The amounts they receive by bribery exceeds that amount by the thousands.<br><br>You only look at Shanghai... but that's a real small part of China. It's only a small showcase of China for the CCP to wayang about. The government is abusing the very same people they used to rise to power - the peasants. So how confident are you that China will rule over us??<br><br>Anyway, I was way off the topic. But I'm Chinese and proud of it. I can't write the language for crap (that's why I'm in Chinese B syllabus) but I can speak it. I can still write my Chinese name and all the basic sentences learnt in primary school. I abhorr those morons who wanna "ascend" to the "higher" races like the Japs or Koreans. I respect the Japanese for their creativity (think about their real great games they produce) and they being hardworking. Koreans.... I don't wanna criticise them but they're a real great people. Been there once. But don't degrade yourself by trying to "acsend", because you're already born Chinese and you can't change it.<br><br>Many of our traditions don't make sense, like burning paper for dead ones. They just annoy me by those black shit floating around. But the traditions still kept are like filial piety etc. They make us unique. The darn angmohs out there just grow up and say f off to their parents after that.</div>

First of all, so I'm looking at it from a western viewpoint. Ok... So? I don't really get your point. I'm making things complex? Sorry if I am... Perhaps your gripes about my so-called language impairment are actually the cries of a tormented subconscious. The way I see it, you are the one who isn't literate in english. For example, look at your spelling. "Embarrase"? Look at your grammar and sentence structure. If you would have bothered to read my posts (which i find highly unlikely seeing as to how you appear to possess a grasp of the english language comparible to that of an ungulate), you'll find that they are at least grammatically correct, which is far more than I can say for yours. I think its amazingly ironic how you can tell me that my English is bad when it is plainly clear that yours is far worse. "ain't"? I hate it when people try to talk like niggers even though they aren't. So what... are you a Chinese, or an African american? Or perhaps you're just westernized. Which then leads me to wonder: "Why the hell are you complaining about Singaporeans being westernized?" Maybe you're the one who's wallowing in self-loathing. Think about what I've said, eh.</div>
