            <div class='col-md body'>Steve Chia was an NCMP, and that was a factor which got him the seven percentage points increase in the recent polls. If you factor this into Sylvia Lim's equation, 7 percentage points mean that she'll actually go neck and neck with her rivials. Of course, that figure is open to scrunity, given that Steve got himself embroided in a scandal and that he was running against a new candidate. However, being an NCMP allows u to be heard in parliment. Although your voice might just be symbolic, but it goes a long way in building a profile for urself amongst the voting public.</div>

Chee Soon Juan claimed this was a political vendetta plotted by the ruling party (one of the PAP MPs is a NUS professor; Mr S.R. Vasoo)[citation needed]. The PAP has however denied the accusation and insisted the offense was real. Chiam See Tong urged Chee to stop the accusations and get back to real business. However, <strong>Chiam was not supported by <span style="color: red;">most of the party and the Central Executive Committee voted to get rid of him as general secretary and replace him with Chee</span></strong>. Supporters of Chiam quickly left the party and formed the Singapore People's Party in 1994.<br><br>As if this was not enough, the party even decided to strip Chiam See Tong's membership in the party[citation needed]. Had he lost his membership, under the current law, he would also have to lose his seat in parliament. This invoked unhappiness among opposition supporters in Potong Pasir. Chiam took up this issue to the courts which ruled in favor of him as it was illegal to do so. Hence between 1993 and 1997, Chiam kept his seat in parliament officially as a SDP member. In the 1997 elections, he took over from Sin Kek Tong as the secretary-general (leader) of the Singapore People's Party.<br></blockquote></div>
