"Most was built between the 1950s and 1970s, and much of it is due for replacement...<br><br>"The report says that Canada's public infrastructure is at 79 per cent of its service life and that municipal infrastructure has reached its breaking point.

            <div class='col-md body'>Lion, I respect and admire the strength of your beliefs.<br><br>However, I do not agree with you taking snippets of news reports and casting them as examples of the flaws of foreign countries and the superiority of our regime. I think it is a great irony that you are doing so, when I'm sure individuals like yourself scorn at the western media when they launch attacks upon our system here in Singapore, accusations such as them being bias, sensationalist surfaces. However, these are the very same sources which you are basing your criticisms of other regimes upon. Isn't it self-contradictory? I believe that in every state there are its pros and cons. There isn't an absolute measure of a state being better than another. Take the comparison of two supposedly opposites, Iraq and the states. People would day of course the states is a lot of better. Yes, but again that is a judgment based upon a series of factors. However, they are factors which through very different sets of eyes and belief system, an individual would not concur to that comparison. Hence, when we say that such and such a country is better here, its is a personal view, based upon factors when see as essential in the framework of a state. This views are relative and cannot be dictated and has to be respected.</div>

Then things got costlier, work got longer and longer. The idea to migrate wasn't mine - was my father's at first and the old man has better foresight than I did . He was correct in saying I would find opportunities I would not find in Singapore.  Better to open 2 doors than to get stuck if I have one door open. Two of my relatives went first to Australia and then I made the jump. So yah my family is coming over to Australia because I open the door.<br><br>Grandparents - comparing to their war time experience - of course Singapore is much better than it was. Anything is better than war time.<br><br>Lion, out of curiosity , are you a student or working now? You appear to be more of a naive student than anything else.</div>
