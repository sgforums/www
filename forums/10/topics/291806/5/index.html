I think it is a great irony that you are doing so, when I'm sure individuals like yourself scorn at the western media when they launch attacks upon our system here in Singapore, accusations such as them being bias, sensationalist surfaces. However, these are the very same sources which you are basing your criticisms of other regimes upon. Isn't it self-contradictory? I believe that in every state there are its pros and cons. There isn't an absolute measure of a state being better than another. Take the comparison of two supposedly opposites, Iraq and the states. People would day of course the states is a lot of better. Yes, but again that is a judgment based upon a series of factors. However, they are factors which through very different sets of eyes and belief system, an individual would not concur to that comparison. Hence, when we say that such and such a country is better here, its is a personal view, based upon factors when see as essential in the framework of a state.
