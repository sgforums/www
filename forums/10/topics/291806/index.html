Tim Fanning said there are more high-profile shootings on streets, in restaurants and other public places, most connected to the Lower Mainland's drug-fuelled gangs.<br><br>"The trend that we've noticed over the last few years is that people killed in the city has gone from stabbings and bodily force (beatings) to more people being shot," Fanning said.<br><br>He wouldn't say if the latest victim, Raymond Huang, had gang connections, only that "he was known to other police agencies."<br><br>Vancouver police said initially Huang had no criminal record.<br><br>Huang, 45, was murdered Saturday night, steps away from the front door of his multi-million dollar home in Vancouver's posh Shaughnessy district near downtown.<br><br>Police say his 10-year-old daughter made the 911 call.  ....<br><br>"There's easy access to weapons, whether it be through the drug trade across the U.S. border or certainly through illegal sources within Canada," he said in an interview.<br><br>Kirk said the violence has evolved in the last few decades from fist fights and stabbings to the use of clubs and finally guns in public places.<br><br>Two people were killed last summer in what police say was a gang shooting at the Fortune Happiness Restaurant in east Vancouver.<br><br>In another incident(31 Oct 2007), attackers fired into an upscale Italian restaurant on the city's west side, wounding a man in what police also considered a targeted attack.<br><br>And in suburban Langley, gunmen opened fire on an SUV driven by a purported biker-gang member as he drove his son to school.<br><br><strong>Last month(19 Oct 2007), six men were killed in a Surrey apartment that police say was a drug den. Four had criminal connections but two were innocent bystanders. ....</strong><br><br></blockquote>---http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2007/11/05/4632819-cp.html<br><br>2.Have u read any foreign wire agency reported the 6 men murder case?<br>If not,why they do not report this big case?<br>Or the foreign media do think it was not a big case of 6 deaths?<br><br>3.Van is very lenient  to drug traffickers.<br>They may be let go after one day jail.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm in Vancouver. Noisy is fully entitled to pasting snippets and making claims, very effective thread starting process. It is true that there is gang violence in the city, but the local and federal police divisions have taken steps to handle the situation and over the past fews days since the announcement of an anti-gang task force, I haven't heard any reports on the news of any further gang violence. Of course the city is far from perfect, especially when comparing it with back home, things by our Singapore standards, aren't exactly efficient. However, they just epitomize the differences in certain values - like the belief in one's rights for example (When i was first here, I found it startling that bus drivers actually take breaks in the midst of bus rides, but I kinda got use to the idea). People here also go about life at their own leisurely pace, while taking time to seep in the beauty of nature and the clean fresh air that Vancouver possesses. Instead of generalizing a single piece of news bit, as a claim of one city's virtues over another, we should  view this as an alternative interpretation of living the good life.<br></div>
