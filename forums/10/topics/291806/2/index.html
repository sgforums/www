            <div class='col-md body'>Safety and crime rate is only one out of the many different criteria by which the quality of life in any particular city can be judged. And it is not such an overwhelmingly crucial element that a high crime rate would render a city unliveable. In any case, a high crime rate does not necessarily imply that one would definitely, eventually, become a victim of crime oneself, just as a high rate of traffic accidents does not mean that one would be knocked down by a car one day.<br><br>In fact I believe that with prudence and caution one can always prevent oneself from becoming a victim of a crime or traffic accident. I lived in London for three years and one day I learned from the news that a fatal shooting took place not more than 200 metres from the house I lived in. I found it no cause for alarm, and nor do I find it necessary for anyone to cause such hysterics over some news reports of violence in the cities. In fact I think if you look closer at the statistics and experience the life in the city you'll find that violence is the exception rather than norm.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Canada has a system of universal health care which essentially means that healthcare is funded by the state. However, the state taxes to pay for the healthcare. What the author failed to mention is that out of the 200k he earns as much as 40-50 per cent of it goes to the state. In addition, indirect taxes are high as well, just recently it's gone down to 12 per cent (5 per cent on perishable items). This is just to balance up the view that it's a free handout here, yeah for the lower income they do get the handout, but the burden is shifted to the middle income wage earners.

USA is having a huge gap in their healthcare with the poor suffering because of such a system as we saw in Hurricane Katrina. Singapore - the rich is also favored. In every country, the rich is favored not the poor. Let's look at this context of canada:<br><br>Let's say 50% of 200k , 100 k is for his family . Houses and land are cheaper there, cars are cheaper there. Assuming that they are frugal - they can save 50k per year.  They can buy more houses !<br><br>In Singapore, what is the average of a middle income family? Utility bills are so expensive , the 99 year lease apartments are so expensive . Eveything you have to pay for like healthcare . Of course if everyone is always perpetually healthy then there is nothing to say but life is such that things can come by surprise. And when it takes you by surprise, do you have the money to dole out ? Never mind says the government - we just take a chunk out of your CPF and if it runs out, your kids can pay for it. LOL.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's quite true ... quite a few times i went to the docs here with flu or fever only to be told that the doc's reached his patients quota for the day and asked me to come back tomorrow ... you supposedly get first class treatment, but so many docs here have their degrees from places like St Kitts or Poland, or speak with such a thick accent that you're tempted to bring a hindi speaking friend along to translate ... a friend of mine went in this july for a "woman's trouble" ops, and she was wheeled out of surgery and sent home in pain in a wheel chair on the very day she was operated on .... saving costs you see ... the price of universal health care ...<br><br>I'd past my pay stubs up here to let all see how much I fork out in taxes but you'd see how much I net too .... it's not pretty, though on paper I make more than twice the grads do in singapore ... perhaps I should also state that the "nice house with huge garden" people like to dream of costs around &gt;C$750000 in edmonton right now ... that's why 40 year mortgages are not unusual here ... yeps, 40 years ...  and utilities are way higher than what you'd pay in singapore, cos heating is an issue, my shared rental house's monthly heating peaks out at &gt;C$400 a month .... go figure ...<br><br>and nevermind about the crime and downtown ghettos and racism ... getting your car broken into makes you jaded pretty quickly I guess .... you think there are no third world immigrants here too ? ... you should poke your head into the nearest chinese take out joint or indian buffet resturant's kitchen ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>that is not to say Canada is not a good place ... I have had many fond and cherished memories here ... my point is to point out that there are no such thing as a perfect utopia ... you read about things and hear raves about relatives who've moved there and you think you're missing out on a piece of paradise ... (who'd tell you their lives there sucks anyways ? ... ) ...<br><br>I can tell you honestly that if you have already made your pile and are ready to retire, it's a great place if you don't mind the ice and the cold ... but reality is a lot more different ... moving away alone is a different preposition from moving away as a couple or a family ... and there are things to get used to and obstacles to overcome ... new social webs to build, careers to be re-started ... moving away after you've made your pile in singapore or built up your CPF nest egg is different from starting from scratch over here with nothing much ... I read about all the "my relatives says ... blah blah blah" and i think to myself ... "if only you knew" ... but of course, that's just me ... don't listen to anyone, decide and see for yourself ... it's your life, your value system different people places different values on certain things, what is a push factor for you is a pull factor for others ...<br><br></div>
