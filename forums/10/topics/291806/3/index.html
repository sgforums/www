            <div class='col-md body'>Exactly, the young couples are just priced out of the market. Imagine 250k-300k plus for a one bed room apartment. There is govt subsided housing and all, but not everyone qualifies and usually they're quite trashy. Even renting aint cheap either. Right now, I'm sharing a two bed room apartment with two other Singaporeans, we're paying 1550 per mth for a place that's situated quite far off from downtown. So yeah, that doesn't include utilities and stuff, which as Fatum indicated, is not cheap.</div>
