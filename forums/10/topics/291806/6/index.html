If I truly hated Singapore, I would not even be in this forum. I had good memories in Singapore. If any Singaporean does anything well or great , the credit will still go in part to Singapore.<br><br>I just don't like PAP policies and their  minions. They used to work for the people but now it's different. You don't see it  my way but I already see it , Singapore ain't staying afloat for the next few decades with those quick fix solutions. Info hub , medical hub, telecommunications hub, ,manufacturing hub, biomedical hub  - any of those hub succeeded yet? No because Singapore produce hubs like rabbits .  Instead India overtaken Singapore in being the info hub of Asia. Who suffers? The Singaporeans. Each time there is a new hub , they open courses to fill that hub. When that hub is not as fast growing as they expect, they ditch those poor people who trusted their government to enrol in those courses.<br><br>The only hubs they got going for them is the tourism hub which has been developed for a very long time . A port of call which has been there since the start of Singapore. Those are the hubs which have been there over time.<br><br>Does it matter if I am single or not? Yes I am single .So?<br><br></div>
