I said it once and I will say it again: the simpleton thoughts you express in your arguments are a disgrace to the Singaporean education system . You are severely lacking in critical thinking ,and most unfortunately , your content holds no substance. Spare Singapore and those educated in Singapore , like me , the disgrace of your thoughtlessness.<br><br>For a person who grumbles about the western media - why the heck are you even using their press clippings as "proof".  You contradict yourself. Shall I also remind you that you used CIA data and declared it as the only one true fact?<br><br></div>
