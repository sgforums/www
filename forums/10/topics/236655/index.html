If a general stays too long in his position, he can garner enough power to do a coup. Old man realised that a coup is a way his hold on power can crumble, that's why they have this policy of not letting a general stay in his position for too long.</div>

The world already knows that. FFS the US spends more on defence than the rest of the world combined. The IRaq war is a silly and illegal war prompted by stupidity and blind nationalism. The afghanistan war, whilst more justified, is being conducted in a misguided manner and will last for years and years.<br><br>That is not to say that I have confidence in Mindef. Let's face it, if you join the Singapore army, you are not generally what people would call 'talent'. One really wonders why these people wants to join the SAF. I suspect the thought of having to slug it out in the real world has proven too scary for many of them.</div>

They are technically superior in conventional and unconventional warfare.<br><br>Exercises and live firing exercise with planned out scenarios hardly resembles a confrontation in war. In an exercise everything is planned, so you would expect everything to run in sequence, it's like playing a chess game where you know your opponent's move in advance, whereas in real wars, every move and countermove is a big unknown. You charge to over run the practice enemy right now, wonder how many would charge against a real enemy firing real bullets at you. Would you? I certainly wouldn't, most probably I would engage in trench warfare.<br><br>Defence? Singapore will not sustain a long stretch war, it will run out of resources like food in maybe a month. IT war? nuclear war? You must be fantasizing. Foot soldiers are still the primary force in any wars, how can it ever be secondary, you can see from the invasion of Iraq, the amount of troops that was deployed to occupy Iraq. Ground troops will never be secondary in any confrontation!</div>
