He had strong roots in two influential areas, one of which was among the poor. OngÂ’s wife Chan Choy Siong was also a champion of the underdog. It is generally believed that when Ong  was   bercoming  more popular and enjoying more support  than our great leader, both Ong and his wife Chan were sent to the United States on a long sabbatical. Chan was a PAP parliamentarian to be compulsorily retired to Â‘make way for new bloodÂ’.<br>I googled and yahooed for more articles about this couple but didn't find much to read.<br><br></div>

Not like USA where the big oldies stay on top and prevent young ones from coming up.<br><br>Also, MINDEF will always give good management jobs to these people when they finish they jobs up there, like some CEO or General Manager or in GOVERMENT jobs or MPs, so that they can further grow, in terms of knowledge on other stuffs, like a new field, etc. Pay almost always increase also.<br><br>So, my take is good one for Mindef.  </strong><br><br>failure in iraq is not military wise but rather political they fail. making promotion a fast lane will only create too many half colonels, colonels, BG, rear admirals whose combats experience is minimal.<br><br>we should bring in too many generals into the public sector. only the best ones maybe. look at those rear admirals who run the LRT? why should these generals be given the fast lane to excel in the public sector. they should make out a career by themselves. that what i call a successful man!</div>

One look at the five year chart of the Amex Defense Industry Index (shown above) should make that perfectly clear. As you can see, the index has been in a steady uptrend since the start of the war in March 2003, has over tripled in value, and is now surging - presumably with our troop levels in Iraq - to a new all time high.<br><br>The index is composed of fourteen stocks, listed below:<br><br>Armor Holdings (AH)<br>Alliant Technology Systems (ATK)<br>Boeing (BA)<br>Rockwell Collins (COL)<br>DRS Technologies (DRS)<br>EDO Corp (EDO)<br>Flir Systems (FLIR)<br>General Dynamics (GD)<br>Goodrich Corp (GR)<br>L-3 Communications (LLL)<br>Lockheed Martin (LMT)<br>Northrop Grummon (NOC)<br>Ratheon (RTN)<br>United Industrial (UIC)<br><br>All of these companies are in the business of making the stuff that wars are fought with - weapons, armor, planes, guns, bombs, ammunition, and/or electronics and communications systems.
