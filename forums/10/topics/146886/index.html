            <div class='col-md body'>CEO of NLB will be a different scenario as it is part of government. One of the ministers will speak on his behalf and at the end all will be explained and accepted as there is no acccountability or transparency to verify what is right or wrong.<br><br>It is difficult to decide what is expensive since the days of the 7 wonders when expensive marbles or furnishing become part of the normal architectural aesthetics.<br><br>The people cannot convince the government not to spend on any expensive toilets or golden taps because their contribution to the economy is in billions. In any event these kinds of monies are not donations like the NKF but may be regarded as long term investments.<br><br>Even if golden book covers are installed in NLB they can be explained too as the bookds might be too valuable to be kept in ordinary covers. Carpets too are nowadays normal furnishing of ministers' offices.<br><br>One JTC officer even traded in art investments so how to ask for accountability. Anything can be explained unless it is unconscionable wastage of donation monies like the NKF case.</div>
