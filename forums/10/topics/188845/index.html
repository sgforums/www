            <div class='col-md body'>PAP psychological strategies. Clean sweep possible.<br><br>1) Personality Attack<br>a)They attacked Gomez integrity.<br><br>b) Attack WP at the root, by linking JG personality to it.<br>The older folks often do not have deep knowledge and will vote for the party which is "honest" aka PAP.<br>They know honesty and integrity "forms" a very critical part in peoples' subconcious mind when one is judging another.<br>Such Personality attack had worked before.<br>With media control, enough people will believe. Eg TLH.<br><br>2) Shift all Attention to this (1).<br>No time to look and No Need to explain other Real Issues.<br>Damn.<br><br>3) Make Believe Scare Tactics<br>They say the opposition has "hidden agenda of forming a government".<br>GCT described it like "planting a seed and letting it grow".<br>And they know people still want PAP to be government.<br><br>(A PAP supporter forumite even describe opp as "Hell break lose" if they are voted in)<br><br>So PAP paint the image to voters:<br>"Be careful with your vote.<br>WP has root integrity problem.<br>WP has a hidden agenda. They want to form a governement.<br>Do not allow them to plant this first seed."<br><br>Voters are scared.<br>They do not want opposition to "break lose" and form government as PAP want them to believe, as they still want PAP as government.<br><br>In Adjunied, Malays and old folks are majority (my rough guess),<br>and young families had been move and placed under East Coast or Marine Parade GRC (or so I had read and heard)<br>How do you think they will vote?<br><br>Conslusion: PAP Cleansweep possible.<br><br></div>

But no effort is made to state what that hidden agenda is. No speculation is suggested either.<br><br>So? Is the Ruling Party clutching at straws? With only the JAMES GOMEZ SHOW to offer them cannon fodder, they seem lost and bereft  of ideas and lacking in substance, as demonstrated by Mah Bow Tan's abrupt and sore loser's attitude towards SDA's Edmund Ng.<br><br>They have failed to answer satisfactorily to any of the WP's questions on costs of living, mean testing and complacency, perferring to make personal attacks on Chiam See Tong's age and questions his ability to fund future upgrading, while MM Lee takes pot shots at Low Thia Khiang, claiming he has lost his respect.<br><br>Frankly, who CARES about whether the revered MM Lee holds you in high regard or not? MM Lee seems to think his blessings are godly and out-of-this-world.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
