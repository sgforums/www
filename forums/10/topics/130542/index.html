But I do remember that in Singapore if you don't show up, the govt will strike your name off the voting register for the next GE. So, like flying the flag, voting is also apparently a priviledge and not a citizen's right in Singapore.  People who work/study overseas are also not allowed to vote, which is truly stupid.</div>

Even though voting is secret, it is not so in Singapore. Otherwise how can they know which area supported PAP and get a chance to upgrade their flats faster?</div>

I hope he will not be in</div></blockquote>Mah Bow Tan can come and kiss my a$$.<br><br>And in any case, when PAP used the MRT and the HDB upgrading as a threat(or treat) to those who were living in opposition wards, so as to entice or threaten people to vote PAP, there were two weak points of those two 'treats'.<br><br><strong>First thing</strong>, MRT being built using taxpayers' money shouldn't be used as a treat to get people to vote for ruling party- by law and technical aspects. Since taxpayers pay taxes annually, all taxpayers should benefit. Therefore the MRT building and extension shd be extend not to just those who voted for PAP, but also to those who didn't.<br><br><strong>Second thing</strong>, HDB upgrading, while it may only affect the value of each individvual flats, it has an extremely small effect. Sure the place looks great, but don't forget existing HDB flatowners still have to pay a sum to HDB to get upgrading. So two questions should be asked:<br><br>1) since HDB earns so much for selling 50k(cost of building one single HDB unit) for 400k, so why don't they pay 100% of the upgrading costs?<br><br>2) Since upgrading doesn't affect the overall cost of one individual unit, then isn't the owner paying something that he wouldn't get back in the long term?<br><br>And we should also consider the fact that: did the current flatowner used his own cash, a bank loan or his individual CPF account to get his flat? So would his flat become a liability or an asset in that case?<br><br>These are questions that need to be answered. And unfortunately, while these questions are complicated, people have neglected. You think flats and MRTs are so fine and dandy in this country?</div>
