            <div class='col-md body'>Re re re re re TRAINING? Of what standard?<br><br>Just a show of hands for those who once had a job and had gone re-training or holding a job now and going for re-training or upgrading?<br><br>Now what type of training are you taking now or going to take up?<br><br>I agreed with upgrading yourself and to arm yourself with additional skill but there are things you need to look for when you are taking new couses or re training.<br><br>Why I say this and it more so for those who are taking up the couses in MOM, CITI or anything that is GOV related agencies.<br><br>Let me give you my example. I used to be a safety supervisor in various safety industries such as building construction, tunnels, shipyard, oil gas petrol and chemical. I always belived in upgrading myself and so I had taken up courses related to the safety industries. Courses held in SG both SG and International standard.<br><br>The day come when I was ask to go as no more projects there is for me in my last coy in SG. So with a number of tickets (safety cert) in my hand, I tried apply for oversea work which really start my nightmare. Only one of the ticket is useable! Guess which one? The one with international standard. That's it the rest are just papers to them. Btw I apply for a position in the oil industries.<br><br>From here I can say all rubbish about MOM but it pointless now.<br><br>For those who are still in the 20s or 30s, think before you take up any course to upgrade yourself or you will find yourself wondering around in Singapore looking for jobs that may not be there anymore when your time comes. (In whatever field you are in now or crossing over later on)<br><br>For those in the 40s or 50s, you have no choices as most likely you still have loan to pay (HDB)<br>Lately some tv programes on re training are aiming at you. So you just have to pay the couses fees (to who knows who) to be a cleaner and that it. Most likely you will not be looking oversea unless you are leaving SG. You are broke and they still try to squeeze you dry.<br><br>What I can feel is that "they" are broke in the 1st place, 2 "they" can not create jobs as they ain't any that "they" know of and 3 "they" need to keep the "foreign talent" number down as what we see and what "they" say dun match.<br><br>1 they are broke because we are broke.<br>2 just look at the policy changes we know how much they know. (As leader you call yourself, we expect you to know more)<br>3 when more Singaporean are working than more FT can stay.<br><br>Btw why there isn't any re training to be a minister. Forget that. I never ask this.</div>

What they are going after and not wasting money and time on that programe and find themself can do nothing with that tickets on any other parts of the world.<br><br>"We" are now in a global village, ie to say what your attainment must enable you to use it else where and not just where you attain it.<br><br>Back to my case, attain safety knowledge in SG but it not recognise else where. People are using OSHA 18000s, SG coy just start 3 years back and guess what MOM is? Cut and paste, ask you take the couse, work only in SG. Work complete, no thank you, ask you go take another couse(unrelated) pay back to sq1??? reach 55 go become cleaner but 1st retraining?<br><br>Well, me now freelance, (not in safety) had work for MNC in Singapore, had gone offshore, oversea and never will I work for local coy or take up any couse in Singapore anymore even it world recginse.<br>Couse fees are high in SG. (example; BOSIET/OPITO in SG cost US$1250 that is about SGD$2300. same couse in MY is just RM2000)</div>
