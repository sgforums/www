            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think anybody is going to care wat I say anyway, but I will still put in 1 or 2 points.<br><br>SIngapore is very small, thus its property rental fees is exceptionally high. This had already put a strain on all business, whether is it from our own country or foreign investors. Our people aren't cheap to employ either, given the relatively strong singapore dollars and high standard of living here.<br><br>Our neighbours aren't very helpful too. Some of them r facing security and instability problems. Others are literally using "Cut and Paste" method on watever we have been doing for the past years. When we make chips, the others start to manufacture chips too. When our airport and port is profitable, they start to develop on tat too. When we sign FTA, others r planning to sign one in the near future too. If they keep following wat we r doing, in the end we will still lose out since we already have a disadvantage of high business costs.<br><br>I think the only strong point left is our reputation. Efficient, clean corruption free and diplomatically friendly. Thus service such as hospital and health, singapore still have some advantage over others in the region. If I am a rich person, I won't mind paying much more as long as I am in safe hands during operation. It is good to induce more people from the region to our hospital. Sad to say the failure of the Iran twins will fixed in people mind for a long time.<br><br>Education can also be a good direction to go into. People had to pay fees to study in the University. However we must work very hard to improve our University level and reputation since we r not so established tat tons of people wanna pay to study here yet.<br><br>R &amp; D with patent can be a good area to go to. And tis have to depend a lot on our University, since the capability of researchers is more important than the cost of land and people. One good field for R&amp;D, other than bioscience is defense related issues. Countries r willing to spend a huge sum for anything related to country security, like rifles, tank or even or thermo scanners etc. However we r still far from being a key player in tis field.<br><br>Another field is the ecommerce and software. If we are able to produce quality websites or develop software tat provide special services, we may be able to stand a niche here. But again we r facing strong opponents from US and china in tis. Probably anything under the sun tat can be achieve using software has been thought and came up with. However in one field, Singapore had done and succeeded to a certain degree is the massively multiplayer games. I hope to see increasing growth in tis field.<br><br>Some fields like making movies and music may work too, since the products is sold at the same price throughout and very profitable if successful. However we have LOTS, I mean LOTS, of catching up to do in tis. Especially since people here aren't as creative as people from other regions.<br><br>However sad to all the above industries need people to have a reasonable level of education in one way or another. And these aren't big industries tat employs a lot of people too. Or rather, if an industry requires a lot of manpower or land, it will not be suitable for singapore. Thus unemployment may not get better in the coming years.<br><br>How to solve unemployment ? The best suggestion I have is making Gov rich, and making them employ more people or give up more welfare. However tis will still not work on the long run. Unemployment is a problem even in US and Europe which they find it hard to solve too.<br><br>PS : all the <strong>suggestions</strong> above r the possible fields we can go into, not fields we can achieve now. The points get harder and harder to achieve as it moves down. If u wanna shoot, don't expect a reply.</div>

There r many competitors in tis field. As I said it is a difficult task. Wat we should try to achieve now is not the be the best in the world, but if we made it to the 3rd or 4th best, I guess we have already achieved some feats.<br><br>Singapore based Massively multiplayer games does not consists of Renewal. It also El kardian, Prince of QIn, Elysium etc (source from a gaming friend) It is a good thing to note tat the gameplay and graphics does not lose considerably with other leaders in tis field Final fantsy 11). Thus the technology is already somewat here in singapore.<br><br>Wat we need now is generate some incredible idea for game play, incredible artists tat can produce good 3D graphics and we may have a chance to compete in tis arena. Tis may be a growing market in the near future<br><br><blockquote>Our movie and music industry is too small.<br>Yes...SIngaporean are educated to be practical.<br>Born, study, find a stable job, work 8-5, retire, survive on cpf and die.<br>We are not creative because we lack competition.<br>Our strongest competitor is our own government, how to fight? </blockquote>Don't be so pessimistic yet. We r not working just for singapore market, we should be focusing on ALL the Chinese market instead. Tat will consists of Hong Kong, Taiwan, CHINA and maybe Canada. If possible, it may be a good idea to work on Indian or Malay market in tis field too.<br><br>Our movie industry, up till now is more toward giving sponsorship. The 2 latest movies, Infernal Affairs 2 and Turn right turn left (actual wordings forgotten) actually has the sponsorship from Raintree productions. Even Edmund Chen and Tay Bin Hui got a chance to act in the shows. Especially Edmund Chen. His roles is quite meaty in Tun left Turn right. I guess singapore has taken a right step in tis field up till now. HOwever it will be better if we can find ways to make them produce the show in singapore and not rely on just giving up sponsorship and producing it in Hong Kong.<br><br>For music, we have some names out there. Stephanie Sun and old names like Chen Jie Yi is quite popular during certain times. Though tat is still little compared to big name from Hong Kong and Taiwan, I shall say, we had taken a right step up till now.<br><br>New suggestions:<br>We can start work on some field in entertainment industries like working on Malay market for movies. We can produce some shows tat will feel closer to Malay people etc to capture the Malay market. Pardon me if I am wrong but I seldom heard of Malay movies for the malay people recently. Though market may be limited, but we should be aiming to produce shows with small budget initially etc.<br><br>Another way we can do is to "import" Taiwan variety shows and produce a English version of it. (we have an advantage over other chinese countires) I guess most people will say tat Taiwan variety shows r very interesting, something the western r not exposed to. If we r able to produce out good quality English show in 'taiwan variety show' format, we may end up with fantastic result. However tis idea is not EASY to achieve. From my perspective, where to find good hosts in singapore ? Frankly all channel 8 and 5 hosts r boring. We may need some legend like Jacky Wu to start tis trend  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Sad to say, if we follow tis route of chasing after the entertainment dollars, then we have a bad starting point since we had thrown away Art and Creative thinking during Singapore education process.<br><br>Again I must emphasise tat these r suggestions. They may turn out to be infeasible in the end or due to circumstances unknown to me at tis point of time.<br><br>However it will be best if Singaporean ourselves have some fighting spirit left, without blaming everyone,on Gov for our situation, or planning on migration if things don't get better etc etc. It will be good if we find ways to reverse this bad situation thrown to us instead of running away from it all, or declaring its all over and lament our fate. If tis is a sinking ship, fix it ! Be agressive ! R we just Quitters or Stayers ?</div>

I was actually feeling some kind of pride when I learned tat singapore is coming out with decent games.<br><br>More suggestions:<br><br>I am dissappointed with singapore tourism. Singapore is boring, sentosa is dead ! I was wondering why people wanna spend money to upgrade the museum and fort siloso there ?? I mean if I go for a tour, I want something more fun. Museum ? I never even go to the one in my country ! Even if I had kids or bringing an aging dad, I won't bring them there either. I only have 3 days and I do not want to waste my time. Want to see how singapore with multi culture society lives ? Forget it ! I am not in a study trip ! Shopping ? Face it, we r losing to Malaysia now. They have plenty of Giant malls tat put suntec to shame.<br><br>Instead of making good clean fun, I rather focus on fun. Build a big amusement park ! One tat match US or tokyo ! Do not tie down rules such as not allowing rides tat r more dangerous. Follow the same safety level as in US ! Fantasy island should be reopen ! It should be combined with the new amusement park to offer wet and dry variety.<br><br>Beach should be more fun ! Thailand had a fast boat, and when the tourist get tied to a parachute, they can get to glide in the air. When the boat goes, it will make the person fly. Import tat ! Import more banana boats to make rental fees cheap ! Import more interesting thrilling beach equipment ! Build a stage there ! Have interesting shows at the stage at weekend night (rock bands, cabaret girls etc). Booze at sentosa or boat quay should collect 50% less tax ! Have all night partying license easily available to organisers !<br><br>Made all shopping and entertainment throughout singapore open for the whole night at weekends ! Made SBS and public transport operate till 3 ! Why close everything at weekend midnight ? People want to stay in city, but r forced to return due to midnight cab fees and closing of departmental stores.<br><br>Anyone with other any suggestion on boosting tourism ??<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to disagree with stupidissmart.<br><br>Prince of Qin, Elysium, Renewal ALL SUCK! Have you even tried playing them before? Renewal is a crappy Diablo 2 ripoff that tries to join the ranks of MMOGs with a huge lack of depth and ONLY THREE CLASSES. Not just that. NO RECLASSES. You can't release a game like that. Even the folks making Ragnarok Online know better.<br><br>Elysium is just an "improvement" of Renewal and it's all the same. What's more. Both Renewal and Elysium will NEVER match the graphics of FFXI or the gameplay of Everquest. The Taiwanese mofos just won't get it. What works in Taiwan won't neccesary work in Singapore.. just like F4 and their lousy TV dramas.<br><br>Thank your lucky stars that there aren't many gamers in here. Those posts of yours will draw lots of flak.<br><br>Speaking of the future of our economy... I find our future pretty bleak. Many of our Singaporeans are just like drones... thanks to our <span style="font-style: italic;">efficient</span> education system that just teach us to be like dogs. Do what we're told. And we're being good dogs at that. In a global economy that demands creativity to survive, you can't just tell students to be creative and <span style="font-style: italic;">try</span> to nurture creativity. You don't do that. It just comes.<br><br>What's more, you get a very nice govt that allows MNCs to leave and don't care about the lost jobs while they just take a gamble on the biomed industry and <span style="font-style: italic;">hope</span> that it works out. You don't take a gamble on the future of the youth of a country like that. You might scorn me but I'm a "quitter". After I get that damn piece of paper I'm outta here.</div>

Suntec is selling a lot of fashion accessories while lucky plaza offering budget items. U wanna buy computer ? Go to Sim Lim tower or Funan. A lot of shops appear the same but yet there is some favour to shopping malls in city area isn't it ?<br><br>Only places like Tampines, Pasir Ris, Ang Mo kio and Toa Payoh does everything look the same.
