I thought the shopping centres have some favour of its own now. Takashimaya is selling Jap product. Paragon is selling high class product for high class people. Cineleisure is focusing on food now. Jurong Point selling things tat attract teenagers and young adult (NTU nearby). Parklane if u wanna play pool or Kbox. For bowling, steamboat with bbq u got to go to marina south. U can fly kites there too. Suntec is selling a lot of fashion accessories while lucky plaza offering budget items. U wanna buy computer ? Go to Sim Lim tower or Funan. A lot of shops appear the same but yet there is some favour to shopping malls in city area isn't it ?<br><br>Only places like Tampines, Pasir Ris, Ang Mo kio and Toa Payoh does everything look the same. They wanna convenient the people living there mah<br><br>Sad to say, I had never been to hong kong before... is it really tat interesting there ? I thought city is boring now since almost every countries have a big city of some sort. How different is it from other cities ?? </div></blockquote>well...all cities are around the same. like human, man and woman. just that who is more handsome, prettier or interesting and boring. to me singapore is a pretty but quiet girl. not much night activities except from pubbing and clubbing which i find ppl rather childish doing that.pubbing and clubbing is never a good place for ppl to communicate or interact. if i am with my friends i would rather sit down in a cafe and talk about what is gonna happen to us, money and etc. if with my gf i would bring her for a movie, walk around or go home to whack. pubbing and clubbing is for those lonely soul who cant find a mate, wasting time looking for their fantansies...i think singapore should promote more sports... hiak just live on with life</div>
