For more info pls read Machiavelli's works or pm me to start a thread on this topic. Don't really want  to hijack.<br><br>On US's motto of "In God We Trust", ideally it should be scrapped. Reason?<br>1) Religion had been a constant cause or at least a very substantial contribution to the cause of war, having such motto links politics back into religion.<br><br>2) One of the greatest concern that I have for US's politics is the rise of theocractic sentiment. Such motto reinforces these fundamentalist which I deem not only as obstacles to advancement of science but also potentially a cause for the next major war. (Again not elaborating too much into it here, unless pple request, if not hijack)<br><br>3) The Motto is a very Christian statement, to have such a statement as the national motto suggest or implies that Christianity is the national religion. If so, are other religions considered "substandard"?<br><br>4) Motto doesn't applies to atheist. So are they going to be left out of the nation? If they are not going to be left out, does the motto mean anything? If the motto doesn't mean anything, is there a point of having it?</div>
