              <p><br>Don't talk as if you did not show your sorrows and curse people here.  I have read them and know youu are doing it.   Forumers here are victimised by you everyday.   Talk so much rubbish but refused and avoid answering my question about whether you will make it global to send your prostitutes whom you feed on for a living to Amsterdam to compete with the whores there.</p>
              <p>YOu are responsible for creating a downright bad reputation for yourself here , nobody do it for you.     Anyone who has a brain will not do that.   </p>

              <p>The intelligence of a Taiwanese 'hum' begin and end at its <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.butler.org/healthGate/images/si55550966.jpg"><strong>‘Labia Majora’</strong></a>  and  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.labiaplastycenters.com/before_and_after_photos.htm"><strong>‘Labia Minora’</strong> </a>- can anything of any relevance flow from its hopeless brain that is no bigger then the size of its <a rel="nofollow" href="http://georgiahealthinfo.gov/cms/files/global/images/image_popup/ans7_vulva.jpg"><strong>‘clitoris’</strong>  </a>?</p>
              <p>Next time use a NZ ONE Dollar - it cost less to dumber 'hum' and will be appreciated more by a dumb beggar.</p>

              <p>Oh I see, bloody damn beggar also got some standard there, most chinese, be it from anywhere are treated as PRC. But foods is expensive lor, only fruits like apple..orange and even wine and cheese are cheap. But tho their foods is expensive, their portion is very big...one burger is damn big, i also cannot finish lor. Yummy too.</p>

              <p>i also never said racism, why u so held up...true, in fact, i love NZ more than OZ, but too boring for me, I slept more hour in NZ then in Singapore, very sian,  singapore is more exciting and fun. So those who got degrees or skills and love a quiet and peaceful life, please go...</p>

              <p>i dun need to go to nz to be citizen or pr.....i think as an aussie....im already auto nz resident or very easy to get in......nz is nice...it may look like the Alps in switzerland or some pristine place which is undisturbed.plus theres dragon boat festivals every year and lion dance at public places.....its very global as to oz.</p>
              <p>i slept in nz cuz its cool and windy.......reminds me when i was young.they have thermal power and free hot water as they have geothermal power au natural.its quite a nice place to sleep...even the japanese guys there sleep in their japanese only hostels and when i walk past them across the railroad station...u can see one of their head pop out from window  half asleep.:)</p>
              <p>nz is on contrary not that boring....they got threesome japanese tall long legged gals in heavy makeup walking on streets like some lolita,they have japanese artists doing a realistic space scenery using some spray cans,u get koreans singing karoke in internet cafes,u got a casino too there,laser fireworks in the sky every nite,....one time i met sean connery trying to find a street in his black suite ....sean connery actually walks alone by himself in nz!</p>

              <p>nz is a beautiful country. </p>
              <p>was in auckland last week (last visit 3 years ago), which coincided with the lv trophy competition. the viaduct is buzzing and the atmosphere, electric. tho i am not a sailing or regatta fan, i was sucked into the whole thing and enjoyed the 2 days there. </p>
              <p>the city is incredibly clean n cosmopolitan. my only grouse is there is there are too many prc chinese in auckland.</p>
              <p>went on to christchurch, and again a great quaint city with character. food is great, especially the fresh seafood. a lot of koreans and japs are in christchurch. golf is amazing.</p>
              <p>it is not difficult for singaporeans to consider nz as an immigration destination. settling down would be easier, e..g currency advantage &amp; housing relatively affordable (makes nz a viable alternative to oz) &amp; weather is moderate(north island). education system is not exactly a slack and definitely their sports is way better (good reasons to support the all blacks and the nz soccer team is in the world cup!). those settling there soon will also have the opportunity to enjoy rugby world cup 2011 which nz is hosting.</p>
              <p>....why wait?</p>

              <p>remebers marlin meat and mussels i had.i should have eaten the  sea urchin////jap dude seemed busy  so i didnt care for some strrange sea urchin which i never tasted......</p>
              <p>saw ponsenby pies advertised everywhere like as if it was katong laksa.....never ate them.</p>
              <p>went to auckland museum with the war trophy japanese zero fighter with the old japNESE PILOT who flew in it.seems like he immigrated to nz too as he was explaining how it felt to be a pilot in it.plane really looked small as compared to the hurricane or spitfire in next room.saw one japanese katana sword which was 2 metres long.</p>
              <p>but best of all would be hot shower in the freezin cold weather.everyone was very nice but it was unfortunate at that time that i went there feeling angry wiv da world....otherwise it would hve been a great trip.</p>
