            <div class='col-md body'>do you all think it is possible to have a military coup in Singapore?<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew warns of army intervention<br>As last resort, if an opposition government plunders hard-earned reserves. Possible?<br>By Seah Chiang Nee., litterspeck.com<br>Sep 24, 2006<br><br>AS he ages in the midst of an undercurrent of political pressures, Lee Kuan Yew seems to become more concerned about the safety of Singapore's US120bil (RM454.4bil) reserves accumulated over four decades.<br><br>His worry is two-fold; firstly, the rising popularity of opposition that he said could result in 'freak' defeat for his ruling People's Action Party (PAP), and secondly, corrupt opposition leaders squandering the nation's wealth.<br><br>He had earlier warned that PAP must not take for granted that it will always win.<br><br>Lee had valid reasons to worry. There's a political wind blowing across the land and politics may be entering - helped by the Internet - a less predictable era.<br><br>In the May election, the PAP's popular vote fell from 75.3 to 66.6% with no sign of reversing.<br><br>If it erodes further, more Singaporeans will hop on to the (currently weak) opposition's bandwagon.<br><br>The new recruits could include the bright and honest, but also crooks and self-serving people with an eye on the nation's riches.<br><br>In an interview with a Harvard University professor last week he hinted that in case of a plunder - and the elected president could not or would not prevent it - then "in two or three years" the army would step in to stop it.<br><br>His talk of possible military intervention - no mention of coup - caused a stir among Singaporeans.<br><br>Ironically the warning came only three days before the military coup in Thailand.<br><br>Singapore is one of the richest countries when it comes to reserves per capita. Lee once promised to 'rise up from the grave' if future leaders lead it into chaos.<br><br>Before he resigned as PM in 1990, Lee created 'a second key' to safeguard the reserves, an elected presidency that could stop the Cabinet of the day from spending money it had not accumulated during its own five-year tenure.<br><br>No government could dig into funds earned by previous governments without approval from a public referendum.<br><br>But this is the first time Lee has spoken of 'military intervention' if the elected presidency was absent or captured by the opposition, to save the nation's billions.<br><br>Educated Singaporeans, however, have often discussed the prospect of a military coup here if PAP loses an election, not to protect national assets. Lee probably sees the two as connected.<br><br>In 1984 when the PAP suffered a 12.4% vote decline - a mini-crisis to him in those days - a small think-tank committee set up by the newspaper that I edited had discussed this possibility.<br><br>Lee had angrily accused young voters of being ungrateful when so many turned against a party that did 'so much for them'.<br><br>We discussed what would happen if something worse were to happen like losing an election: Would Lee stage a military coup to stay in power? Almost to a person, we dismissed it for several reasons.<br><br>Firstly, the United States, Singapore's powerful trading partner, would come down hard on it, foreign investors could dry up but more crucially, Singapore's army and people - unlike others - would strongly oppose it.<br><br>It would even split the PAP. In short Singapore could not survive the impact.<br><br>Besides, the full-time army is a small one. Singapore's frontline soldiers are overwhelmingly made up of 'reservists'.<br><br>This would have meant that if the country voted out the PAP, these soldiers - sons, brothers and husbands - were likely to have voted along with it, so a coup against the elected leaders was far-fetched.<br><br>The army here is vastly different from the Thais, Vietnamese, Filipinos and other coup-marked countries. Its value comes from its colonial British 'no-politics' traditions.<br><br>So how seriously are Singaporeans taking Lee's coup warning? Most dismiss it as next to impossible.<br><br>If it wasn't possible 20 years ago, it is even less so today as the society has become more sophisticated.<br><br>"It will be a sad day if it is attempted. One coup will lead to another and start a culture," said a businessman.<br><br>Besides any takeover general would probably enjoy power too much to want to return to the barracks."<br><br>Nothing could then prevent them from plundering the reserves themselves, the very thing Lee wanted to stop.<br><br>So far none of the other PAP leaders or rank-and-file has echoed Lee's sentiments, so it is far from being a party position. I don't think it was seriously discussed.<br><br>To put it into perspective, Lee did not condone a military takeover but probably mentioned it as a last option if everything else failed to stop a corrupt government.<br><br>Instead he advised Singaporeans to preserve the present political arrangement, which could also mean - to his critics - 'don't vote in an opposition' or "don't introduce a multi-party system."<br><br>In his interview with Prof Lawrence Summers, Lee said: "Once you break that, by military intervention, you have destroyed a system which works on the basis of who was voted into office," he said.<br><br>There are, however, some old-timers who believe Lee never says anything flippantly and that he must have given it much thought.<br><br>So where can an out-of-office PAP, assuming the scenario were to unfold, get the troops to grab power from the (corrupt) government other than the 'people's' army?<br><br>Singapore is a small island that doesn't take much to start a coup.<br><br>Imaginative Singaporeans believe the PAP may one day launch a highly paid Presidential Guard-type unit, while others say a battalion of Gurkha troops now used for security duties could be used.<br><br>Lee, however, insisted his goal was maintaining the present governance. "My ambition is not to preserve the PAP," he said.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think this a serious case of mistrust. The "father" figure of Singapore refuses to believe that his children had grown up and can have a free hand in managing the "family".<br><br>On the other hand though, he did mentioned that Singapore would be safer if there's a crediable opposition. Although there had been an increase in the quality of the opposition in recent years, I feel that they do not have a large enough pool of talents and much of their young talents lack experience. I think that significant effort, resources and time need to be invested into the talent grooming process. Of course, there's difficulty in doing so in an environment such as Singapore.</div>

This allows them to transfer these funds without a public referendum nor parliamentary approval each time, only Presidential approval in times where the funds are required to be classified as past reserves in those corporations.<br><br><a href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?actno=1999-REVED-CONST&amp;doctitle=CONSTITUTION%20OF%20THE%20REPUBLIC%20OF%20SINGAPORE%0a&amp;date=latest&amp;method=part&amp;sl=1&amp;segid=931158661-003157#1084505479-000098" rel="nofollow">http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?actno=1999-REVED-CONST&amp;doctitle=CONSTITUTION%20OF%20THE%20REPUBLIC%20OF%20SINGAPORE%0a&amp;date=latest&amp;method=part&amp;sl=1&amp;segid=931158661-003157#1084505479-000098</a><br><br>I wonder how many Singaporeans know or even feel concerned that such an amendment was made without a single voice of concern from the public.
