If you can't answer my questions, you should shut up. Hahahaha<br><br>Anyhow, use your brain and think. Even if the government is corrupt, they would still give figures for these questions. Only that they would be fake. You think if you go to the Ministry of Finance, they will tell you "Sorry, it's state secret", "No, I can't tell you that" or "Next question please"? Please lah, the government is much smarter than you. Even if they are corrupt, they will still give you a figure. So, you haven't tried to find right? Then don't expect somebody to find out for you. </div></blockquote>U said NKF is corrupted!!! this is wat u said but  we r still awaiting 4 court decission!!!anyway, do u know where is Mr Durei now???<br><br>Our Pm's salary is on the top of the list although we r only 25 km from E- W !!! do u know!!<br><br>But my salary is S$ 100,000 per month now!!!</div>

Why are the ruling party so afraid of challenges to their political strength that they immediately spread doubts over the challenger's ability to withstand office?

The only two constituencies won by the opposition are Hougang and Potong Pasir. I don't think there are any doubts that the SDP are probably the worst party to vote for. But SDA or WP to run the country? They didn't even have enough people to challenge the PAP in the first place, resorting, as I said, to picking young and inexperienced people to make up the numbers. I would have relented if these were at least managers or directors of some company, but damn, executives are dime a dozen in this country. Running a GRC is okay, not the country. Maybe in the future, when they've gotten a better pool of talented people. But of course, people will say that the government is constantly restricting the opposition, which is another debate altogether.</div>

I don't think that anybody in Singapore has any doubts that the NKF was corrupt. If you do, maybe we can have a bet. But if you did not assume that the NKF was corrupt when making the comparison, then what were you thinking? That the government is nice and clean? If so, then good for you, there is no debate.<br><br>I do not quite understand the last two sentences.</div>
