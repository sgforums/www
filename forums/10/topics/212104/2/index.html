Say initial exchange rate is USD 1.00 : SGD 2.00, you depreciate your currency say USD 1.00 : SGD 1.50, which makes the US product more competitive in the international market. What initially cost SGD 20.00 would cost SGD 15.00 after the depreciation.<br>[/u][/b]</blockquote></div>

It's just that it's a freak result if the people accidentally voted in a party just because they dislike the PAP. I know people who actually told me they voted for the opposition because they don't want the PAP to be too arrogant and wanted some pressure on them. Certainly, they didn't vote for the opposition because of their abilities. If everybody thought like that and the SDP gets voted in, there's gonna be trouble. So, which of the current parties do you think should run Singapore?<br><br><blockquote>Has it not been MM LKY's line of arrogance that Governments formed by an Opposition can only come about by opening the treasury to Singaporeans ?<br><br>Has it not been MM LKY's hollow desparation in branding the Opposition as corrupt and incapable ?<br><br>Yet, without being corrupt, the Opposition Parties had shown that their candidates can reduce the margins of good votes to PM LHL at only 63 percent - which was despite the corrupt use of upgrading enticements.<br><br>Before the Opposition Parties can come to power, has anyone appreciated the fact that the Ruling Party has already placed their greedy fingers on the authoritative seals of power, to change the Constitution so as to bypass the Elected President, and allow themselves access to the multi-billion medisave accounts ?<br><br>Did anyone noticed the post by LazerLordz on Page 1 of this thread ? </blockquote>I wonder which party is very capapble? Well, the Gomez issue certainly showed that some of the people in these parties are not very honest. I'm not sure why people keep talking about the reserves.

I think maybe only in an extreme case whereby the new party is obviously very incompetent, corrupt and out to strip the country of its resources. In such a case, there will probably be enough people in support of the PAP in to carry such a task. But I think MM Lee is only trying to scare the people into voting for the PAP.</div>
