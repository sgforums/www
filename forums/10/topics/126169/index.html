Give them some form of punishment to say they were wrong, but show them they are part of society and can change. Show them compassion," he said.<br><br>The Dalai Lama did not mention any countries in his appeal. Japan is the only major industrialized country other than the United States to practice the death penalty and has wide public support for executions.<br><br>China, which has ruled Tibet since 1951, carried out about 90 percent of the legally sanctioned executions in the world last year, according to Amnesty International.<br><br>China executed 28-year-old Tibetan activist Lobsang Dhondup in 2003 over a bombing that killed one person but amid an international outcry a Chinese court commuted the death sentence of monk Tenzin Deleg in the same case.<br><br>The Dalai Lama, taking questions from an audience concerned that Japanese youth were turning wayward, urged schools to change their focus.<br><br>"It is not sufficient for education to be just about academics," the 1989 Nobel Peace laureate said.<br><br>"There is so much emphasis on the brain. This is good but we should be equally concerned about being warm-hearted," he said.<br><br>"In the past few centuries there has been a neglecting of these qualities in education," he said. "We should try to introduce these qualities as part of education the world over."<br><br>The Dalai Lama's lecture was the first of five he will deliver on his 11-day tour of Japan.<br><br>It is his 10th visit to Japan -- or 14th including airport transits -- but he has not met a sitting Japanese prime minister since 1980.<br><br>China protested the latest visit, even though Japanese officials have no plans to see the Tibetan spiritual leader.</blockquote>First, it was the Vatican. Now, it's the Dalai Lama. High time for capital punishment to go the way of the dodo.</div>
