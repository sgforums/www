            <div class='col-md body'>When is our next election and voting...? I'm actually quite sick and tired of all the 'wayangs'... Why don't they just pass a NEW LAW which states that they can decide and vote for THEMSELVES and stop wasting everybody's time...??<br><br>REMEMBER WHAT WAS SAID the LAST TIME...??<br><br>"We don't wanna waste too much time on elections and such... Instead, we wanna FOCUS on how to help Singaporean get over this DIFFICULT PERIOD in job findings and such...."<br><br>AFTER ELECTION....<br><br>"Singaporeans should learn to take care of themselves and face up with the challenges!!"<br><br>"Should upgrade themselves and face the problems ahead of them!!"<br><br>"We should understand and tolerate that there'll be some people who are rich and others who would be poor (make that VERY POOR...).."<br><br>I'm already seeing alot of 'DISCRIMMINATION' as Singapore segregates into 'classes'... So much for CIVILISATION... I personally think that the ones who speak the LOUDEST would be the ones who ain't having their feet burnt yet.... They just stand over your head and STAY there....<br><br>I AGREE that GLOBALISATION is a 'GOOD CONCEPT'.... And CHANGES.. And HEALTHY COMPETITIONS...<br><br>Singapore is a COUNTRY where MANY from OVERSEAS would like to come for OPPORTUNITIES.. (Or at least they thought so?) BUT my BIG QUESTION is "IF EVEN US SINGAPOREANS ARE GETTING PRETTY SICK OF THE 'SYSTEM', WHAT MAKES YA THINK THEY'LL BE MOST WILLING TO STAY AND WELCOME IT IN YEARS TO COME <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> "<br><br>The TOP CREAMS are PROFESSIONALS from OVERSEAS... The BOTTOM ONES are CHEAP LABOURS from OVERSEAS...<br><br>The top creams come to Singapore to earn and enjoy a 'cheaper' life style here....<br><br>The bottom ones earn enough and get back to their country to ENJOY their 'earnings'....<br><br>Singaporeans are asked not to leave... YET we have to CHALLENGE OURSELVES to the TOP... Or we would have to DIG an even DEEPER hole to get a place in the BOTTOM... End of the day, we won't be getting much 'fruits'... We'll only be getting LOTS of DISEASES and STRESS... So much for increasing the population....?<br><br>Think of what our ancestors have DONE for SINGAPORE? Now people just STEP IN and enjoy the 'fruits'... The trees, the flowers... The buildings.. The foundation... Where do you think all those came from...?<br><br>Who would wanna give birth to children in this kinda environment..? With STRESS and EVERYTHING... With NO PROMISE of a FUTURE except 'Take care of yourself'.... How do they tell their children...?<br><br>It has already been SCIENTIFICALLY SHOWN that any species which find the environment too hostile for survival, would only cease to reproduce and face elimination....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not the usual style of Singapore's ruling regime to notify Singaporeans exact dates of the General Election ahead of the elections.<br><br>Just like its not their habit to announce new GRC formation until the last minute.<br><br>Most other honest democratic governments in the world usually announce their elections early.</div>
