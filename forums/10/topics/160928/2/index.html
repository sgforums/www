            <div class='col-md body'><br>Pat ,for your info the past Dalai Lama was the Political Ruler of Tibet during the Mongolian Rule<br><br>Dalai Lama was to ensure the stability of the Tibet Region ,due to many fightings among the warriors and the thieves in Tibet Plateau<br><br>If he given up the Political status , He will not be able to do much to ensure the stability in the Tibet region<br><br>nah , a governor cant do that , unless that governor is a tibetan and knows the tibet culture and custom and religion very welll and handle with great tact<br><br>[/b][/quote]<br><br>You are right. I believe that one of the Qing Emperors, I believe it is Qian Long who actually ordered military intervention into Tibet to re-establish the Dalai Lama's dominon over the state. The Qing Emperors were devout Buddhist, as such they recongnise the Dalai Lama as a central figure in Buddhism and also the head of the Tibetian State. I guess the situation is as present with the 1949 revolution, which saw the communists come to power. I'm not too sure upon how Tibet became part of China from here. But one thing is clear that one reason why China so firmly wants to reaffirm it's soverignty over Tibet is due to India's support for the Dalai Lama. India's relations with China has been anything but rosey, having fought two border wars with China in the 60s over a disputed segment of the border. Another important reason is the unity and survival of China itself, with many in the party leadership believing that if one of the non-han states breaks away from China, the other states will follow suit. We are talking of a huge chunk of land here, Tibet, Xinjiang, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, Helongjiang,etc. One of my Chinese teachers, I guess that was the only thing I actually remembered, told us that in order to ensure that this would not happen, the Chinese government has been praticing a policy of resettlement, where Han Chinese are encouraged to settle in these lands dominated by the minority groups. As such, this policy will tilt the population balance in favour of the Han Chinese and ensure that these states stay under the Chinese umbrella.</div>
