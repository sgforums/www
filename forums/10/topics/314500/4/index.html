              <p>you are the one who can't take the heat that is why you accuse and find fault with people.   Gazelle redDUST no matter what new nicks you use we know you are gazelle the panty sniffer, ha ha ha.    YOUr quarrelsome ways give yourself away that you are gazelle, the very fact you put words into someone's mouth prove that you are gazelle.   You have lowest IQ as such you love to put words into people's mouths.   GAzelle, go go find some panties and  sniff, ha ha ha.</p>
