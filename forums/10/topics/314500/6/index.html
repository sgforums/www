              <p>2010 to 2011... It is about the end of the term.</p>
              <p>In addition, by 2010, we will have the 2 casinos, the circle line in place, the last payment of GST offset credits, the youth olympics, and in this year, the F1 race. In addition, by end 2010, the world economy will have recovered quite a bit from the expected global crash in 2008-2009 which is already happening.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">But bottom line, what does Lim really think of his old mate,
                  Lee Kuan Yew? Some whisper that Lim, like other "old guard" leaders
                  Toh Chin Chye, Ong Pang Boon, Jek Yeun Thong and Devan Nair, is sour toward Lee
                  for the way he always insisted on being No. 1. The talk goes that Lee was lucky
                  to catapult straight into the premiership since it suited his talent for
                  oratory, vision, and strategic thinking. Had he needed to deal with the nuts
                  and bolts of running a specific ministry, he might have come a <strong>cropper</strong>. If Lim shares this view, he
                  keeps it to himself. Publicly, he says that without Lee's leadership, Singapore
                  "would probably be like a third-world country now."</p>

              <p>(2) Keep denying problems with excuses using the media to carry good news while playing down bad news and pushing problems to the people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(3) Legalistic passing of all sorts of laws to undermine democracy e.g. GRC and approving their own million-dollar self rewards while avoiding answering to mistakes like Mas Selamat or Shin Corp.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(4) Putting up good shows and falsehoods but failing to address the root causes of problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we have a government running the country with the above-stated happenings do we still have a good government one governing with compassion, honesty and integrity to serve the people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With this kind of records of serving its own selfish interests and agendas can we now believe that the opening of flood gates to let oreign workers in to practically take over almost every and any jobs (except top civil servants' and ministers' jobs) is like stated by Minister Ng Eng Hen going to create more jobs or good for the country or its people any more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is clear that when a government through power corruption is no longer able to differentiate between simple good and evil even in making their own connected elites answer for simple acts of incompetence like Selamat, NKF, Shin Corp, Global Crossing or UBS it is way beyond redemption and reasoning. It is power corruption where the power is fighting to preserve its own interests and not that of the people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We need only simple wisdom to guide us the people. "Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely" is the wisdom we have to subscribe to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We need to go back to basic to realize and correct the root causes of problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We need to have many civic-minded people who could make a good society to uphold high morality and honesty (without all the hypocrisy like calling people complacent for their own incompetence) like the good old days.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Stop disputing among ourselves the citizens over petty issues and go for root causes of problems before we could make change and have high standard of governance for once after 40 plus years of hypocrisy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There  is no other solutions or shortcuts.</p>

              <p>But bottom line, what does Lim really think of his old mate, Lee Kuan Yew? Some whisper that Lim, like other "old guard" leaders Toh Chin Chye, Ong Pang Boon, Jek Yeun Thong and Devan Nair, is sour toward Lee for the way he always insisted on being No. 1. The talk goes that Lee was lucky to catapult straight into the premiership since it suited his talent for oratory, vision, and strategic thinking. Had he needed to deal with the nuts and bolts of running a specific ministry, he might have come a
              <strong>cropper</strong>. If Lim shares this view, he keeps it to himself. Publicly, he says that without Lee's leadership, Singapore "would probably be like a third-world country now."</p>
