              <p>1. how about a balance, and a slight tilt in favour towards singaporeans? currently, i think PAP `opened the floodgates'.</p>
              <p>2. do you try to manage it or leave it to `fate' even if it is global. for all the $billions accumulated, will $500m, just figuratively speaking, be so damaging that it will `bankrupt' singapore? i don't think so. the current aid dished out so far are crumps of what the singapore coffers has. where is the accountability and trust given to the government to take care of its people?</p>
              <p>3. your insinuation of the poorer strata of singaporeans as `lazy' is in poor taste.</p>

              <p>I absolutely agree with you.   YOu have stated very clearly the three points which are facts that one will not miss if one knows the way of PAP and how greedy they are.  </p>
              <p>From observation, lhl is no different from any other ordinary folks.  So any ordinary folks can be the PM of Singapore.  All he does is point fingers, talk crap, be arrogant, threaten as and when necessary, introduce new stuff, policies, penalise people to his own benefits and gain.</p>
              <p>After all he is without any calibre at all for the role of PM.     If one day he collapses and dies, I believe very few singaporeans will pity him.</p>
