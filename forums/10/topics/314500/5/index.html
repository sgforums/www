              <p>majority of the voters here still have no guts to vote them out, so FAP will not be out of power, at least not for the near future.</p>
              <p>lhl and pap gang create problems to their own benefits.  A good eg, is the widening income gap.   lhl said he will deal with this, but he is not delivering what he promise.</p>

              <p>just out of (genuine) curiousity, how do you feel that your life is monitored?</p>
              <p>I am not saying that it is all dandy in Singapore, I feel stiffled too some times. My wife is a strong advocator for moving out. For her, a less hectic study life for the children is what she hopes for. (parents here will know when kids have exams, the parents are equally stressed out). I am hesitant because we will lose the opportunity to let our children learn chinese. i place a high premium for that. the NWO will shift to china sooner than later, imo.</p>
              <p>we actually have PR granted elsewhere which we have not exercised. I list the likes and dislikes of staying here, and i have to say i do not have good reasons to move out. not yet at least. </p>
              <p>so, what's bothering you?</p>
