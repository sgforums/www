            <div class='col-md body'><p>Accept outflow of talents as a reality: PM<br>Fri, Apr 11, 2008<br>The Straits Times<br>    <br>    <br><br>SINGAPORE must accept the outflow of top talent as a reality, with more Singaporeans going abroad for study and work, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday.<br><br>Unlike big countries like China and India which can sustain large outflows of top talent over years or decades, and are still be able to retain a central core, the risk of being depleted of top talent is faster for smaller countries like Singapore, he said.<br><br>PM Lee highlighted fostering a sense of national identity as one of the major challenges facing small and open societies like Singapore in a his address to the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) forum on Friday morning.<br><br>Mr Lee's speech centred on the knowledge economies in Asia and how countries in this region are turning to knowledge creation and innovation to sustain their growth and improve their people's lives.<br><br>He also spoke of the challenges and impact of the internet and online channels which bring raw, unprocessed information and instant exposure to the masses, and which are changing the texture of societies everywhere.<br><br>A major challenge facing Singapore is fostering a sense of national identity, said PM Lee.<br><br>'Globalisation and the knowledge economy have created a single worldwide market for talent. In every field, the most able people are in demand worldwide, and are also highly mobile,' he said.<br><br>'The best musicians and sportspersons are already a global breed. But to do well, a country needs a core of its ablest citizens, those with both the intellectual and social acumen, to play leadership roles in the economy, the administration, and the political leadership. Without that central core to take the country forward, the society cannot perform to its full potential, and the citizens will suffer.'<br><br>Noting that more and more Singaporeans are going abroad to study or work, he said: 'We must accept this flow as a reality, and bring in talent to top up, and encourage Singaporeans who study and work abroad to eventually return and add to the vibrancy of their own society.'<br><br>Singapore not only needs to create economic opportunities here, but also opportunities for people to develop their potential and express their human spirit.<br><br>'Ultimately we must create an emotional attachment to the country, their family members, school and college mates, buddies in National Service platoons, and friends, both to hold our own people and to get others to strike roots here. Then we can maintain our own identity and sense of common destiny,' said Mr Lee.<br><br>In his address, the PM also touched on Singapore's strategies to build up its knowledge edge.<br><br>These include investing heavily in education across the whole spectrum of skills, and equipping Singaporeans to compete in a knowledge economy.<br><br>It also encourages free flow of information so that the people can keep abreast of new developments and ideas, and are ready to react promptly to a changing world.<br><br>Singapore is also stepping up its R&amp;D efforts, and geared towards welcoming new ideas, and adapting to change to create an environment which attracts talent and entrepreneurs from around the world.</p></div>

              <p>oh come on give me a break for god's sake! look at the number of FTs in OUR COUNTRY fighting for jobs rightfully OURS? n look at the number of them in our unis, how do u expect locals to stay here? ppl who cant form a proper english sentence r considered talents? while locals who pay thousands of taxes every year, with good qualifications cant get into local unis, have to make do with foreign unis? those who r rich, lucky u, u can go foreign unis n not worry abt ur sch fees. not so rich, tough luck, make do wif part time degrees n use approximately 50% of ur income every month jus to pay ur UNSUBSIDISED sch fees. n the best thing is, u may not even get a high paying job when u graduate, cos FTs are always way ahead of u.</p>
              <p>jus think of it. would u wan to pay tax year aft year, knowing that ur children n even grandchildren r not the ones benefiting fully from those payments, but rather foreigners who r studying here? any normal sane person would say a big NO! let alone local talents.</p>
              <p>n he dare to mention this "We must accept this flow as a reality, and bring in talent to top up". ya go on. soon s'pore will b a mass orgy of every1 all over the world but true s'poreans. when war comes, c who will defend u. if he had a brain, use it please. NATO.</p>
