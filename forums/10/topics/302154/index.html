            <div class='col-md body'>Not to sound racist or anything but it's a little annoying that so many Asians migrate to Australia. Last time I visited home it didn't feel the same, it felt like I was still in Singapore. Worse yet, they live in Asian communities in Asian suburbs and only associate with other Asians so you get this massive separation between the races and a lot of ethnic gangs form.</div>

What I notice is that most students, be it asian or americans , they like to mix within their own company. The americans especially. I know it because my good friend who is american , don't really like to mix with the Australian community except when he just wants to pick up chicks. He mixes with me because he knows me but he doesn't care to mix with other asians or australians he don't know. And I also notice some fair amount of american worship coming from the australians when I go out with him.<br><br>Melbourne is a student town basically. Brisbane is starting to turn into a student town smack in the city.<br><br>For me , I have friends who are australian and some are  australian born asians . The australian born asians seem to feel more comfortable with the caucasian ones than asian migrants.<br><br>The ethnic gangs , chinese or viet , usually mind their business within asian suburbs. The lebanese ones are the ones who go out and create a Cronulla problem.<br><br>Having said that , why not look at the greek , middle eastern or italian communities, they are worse - from past experience, at least the elderly asians in the hospital make a concerted effort to speak english , even though it is horrible to hear them can the language.<br><br>From my past experience , most of the  elderly migrants of italian , greek and middle eastern descent expect you to KNOW THEIR LANGUAGE. They are the ones with the mentality that if you are a girl and you can't speak their language, you are just some inferior piece of crap.</div>
