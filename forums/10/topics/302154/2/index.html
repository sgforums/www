What I notice is that most students, be it asian or americans , they like to mix within their own company. The americans especially. I know it because my good friend who is american , don't really like to mix with the Australian community except when he just wants to pick up chicks. He mixes with me because he knows me but he doesn't care to mix with other asians or australians he don't know. And I also notice some fair amount of american worship coming from the australians when I go out with him.<br><br>Melbourne is a student town basically. Brisbane is starting to turn into a student town smack in the city.<br><br>For me , I have friends who are australian and some are  australian born asians . The australian born asians seem to feel more comfortable with the caucasian ones than asian migrants.<br><br>The ethnic gangs , chinese or viet , usually mind their business within asian suburbs. The lebanese ones are the ones who go out and create a Cronulla problem.<br><br>Having said that , why not look at the greek , middle eastern or italian communities, they are worse - from past experience, at least the elderly asians in the hospital make a concerted effort to speak english , even though it is horrible to hear them can the language.<br><br>From my past experience , most of the  elderly migrants of italian , greek and middle eastern descent expect you to KNOW THEIR LANGUAGE. They are the ones with the mentality that if you are a girl and you can't speak their language, you are just some inferior piece of crap. </div></blockquote>American worship? Sorry you must be mistaken, nobody hates Americans more than the Aussies.<br><br>What I said holds true with the italians, greeks and lebs too though they aren't as bad as many of them tend to associate with the australians much more than the average asian migrant.</div>

Integration shouldn't have to be explicitly forced, take Sweden for example. Even the American Muslims are well assimilated regardless of the obvious racial and religious tension.</div>

Or do you expect every single asian person , regardless of whether they are australians or not , to come up to you and try to make friends because you are some caucasian wanting integration?  All of us , except for the indigenous people, regardless of where we are from , are just made up of migrant stock.<br><br>Funny because I spoke with my friend who is a born and bred 5th generation australian caucasian girl. She doesn't appear to think that asians are isolating themselves from others. She seems to think the same way as I do probably because we both worked in hospitals.<br><br>The key issue of any integration is language not places. Places are usually surrounded by people of the same socioeconomic status and one additional commonality be it religion or ethnicity. So far , I have not met a single asian who can't speak some basic english . Some may speak broken english but they do try their best to speak your lingua franca instead of other ethnic groups who refuse to do so. They get made fun of, ignored because other australians can't understand them  but they do try their best. I don't get the same treatment because I speak english fluenty and everyone understands what I am saying.<br><br>Chatswood used to be a caucasian area before becoming some sort of an asian area. Would you like to shed any reason why the caucasians moved out of the area other than pointing a finger to asians on non integration?  It is not like asians forced them out or non integration - it is likely because the place was developing upwards ( as in apartments) while I know alot of Australian caucasians  like their house and large garden lawns on the ground instead of an house in the sky.<br><br>I don't see alot of caucasian in high rise areas. I see alot of asians especially from high population density countries. They are used to high rises. The caucasians I know in Australia like to stay in suburbs and have their bbq parties out on a big lawn with a swimming pool in their backyard.<br><br>However I also do know of a few asians within a larger caucasian majority suburb , peacefully co existing with them side by side. I myself stayed in a caucasian majority area in Canberra (house and land is pretty everywhere there)  and I was ok with my neighbours. There was only one who doesn't talk to me but the seven others spoke to me happily because I watch out for them as they watch out for me.<br><br></div>

She stays in Caroline Springs. She is asian and 3 of her surrounding neighbours are actually caucasians. All of them working middle class white collar professionals. The extent of their communication is restricted to "<span style="font-style: italic;"> hello, how's it going ?</span>" or a good morning or good night ,small talk over gardens or the maintenance of their houses. They have their BBQ - they invite out of courtesy. She has a party - she invites them out of courtesy.<br><br>Sweden has issues with integration . Seriously. So does the Netherlands. They are poor examples. Their version of integration is allowing the muslim community to do what they want. Ask any real average nordic swede - they will tell you something which you don't like to hear. They blame the middle easterns, africans and eastern european migrants for the rise in crime.<br><br>The netherlands put a stop to letting the muslim community do whatever they want because of the horrific murder of one film director committed by a group of extremist muslims. Why did he get killed? Because he produced a film they didn't like.<br><br>The American muslims cannot not well assimilated if they have religious tensions.<br><br>Let's face it.The muslim community in Singapore is very well integrated. The ones in Europe, USA  and Australia are not because they have certain migrant muslim minority groups who make stupid  statements at the expense of the bigger community who just wants to mind their own business. That causes alot problems with the larger society.</div>
