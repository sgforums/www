My opinion is, the usage of profanities has proliferated to a point that its common to hear them in everyday life.  At first, people didn't tolerate it, now they just can't be bothered cos people just keep using them anyway.  How did it all start?  Through Media, as most western movies have no qualms in using such words.  As people see them, they find the usage of profanities to a point that its "No big deal."  When understress, in Singapore's high stress enviroment, most people just simply de-stress by employing massive amounts of "fucks", "shit-head" and "bitches."  If it makes them feel better, then theres really not much we can do about it.<br><br>Of course, theres always the other type of people that fuckin punctuate every fuckin word their shit-for-brains skull can think of.  Its usually a demonstration of immaturity, and lack of understanding of the words they are using.<br><br>Any immediate way to fix this phenomena would no doubt result in more tension generated.  In a world where profanities is as common as water, you can't expect your kids to grow up innoncent as lil white baby angels anymore.  Parents will have to make an active effort to DISCOURAGE through corrective measures, (note: Not yellin back at them with "fuckin idiot, dun use these words anymore!!!") and show them other ways of expressing themselves.  Of course, parents must be an example themselves.<br><br>2nd solution, get yourself killed, go to heaven, and you can live in a world without profanities.<br><br>Otherwise, be strong and learn to live with it, and NOT use it.  Realise that the words can hurt somebody, and avoid it.  At the same time, know that words can't hurt you, all it can do is piss you off.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Language is a dynamic process. It is continuously growing, changing, incorporating new words and grammer rules according to local circumstances while some old ones grow out of fashion and die out.<br><br>I think that Profanities in language is part of this process. It is ridiculous to try to curb it of force language to develop along a "cleaner" path...<br><br>Think about it: all languages share certain similarities as long as profanities are concerned. Body parts for instance: sexual anatomies are always used in English, Chinese dialects, Tamil, Spanish, Italian and French and Russian. Incest is a common theme in all of the above as well. Faeces is another common theme.<br><br>So whats the big deal? It is not so much the point that it is articulated at all but it is rather interesting to see that all cultures have more or less the same standards of what is considered vulgar and profane.<br><br>I think its good news. It shows that humankind has evolved a more or less common standard of what they consider vulgar and socially unacceptable and expressing them as signs of displeasure and insult shows that they do not agree with any of the above choice of profanities, and not an acceptance of them.</div>

It<br>can be an active verb (John really gives a fuck), or a passive<br>verb (Mary really doesn't give a fuck), or it can be an adverb<br>(Mary is really fucking interested in John), a noun (Mary is a<br>terrific fuck), or an adjective (Mary is fucking beautiful).

            <div class='col-md body'>Words are just an expression of how we feel. It is not the WORD that is profane but the feeling behind it. Words like "Fuck" has such negative connotation because of the way it is being used; to abuse, to vent an anger etc. Alot of other profanities words share the same "feelings" too.<br><br>To put things in perspective, let me ask you this question; "Is it wrong to express our negative feelings like frustration, anger, disappointment openly?" These profanities help to create an outlet for this outflow of negative feelings! Is it only right to express our happy feelings with words like "good", Beautiful", "wonderful"? I feel that we should be objective. Lets understand why profanities are being used in the first place on other people which will cause hurt and disappointment. Maybe, Maybe it is really necessary for a person to use profanities to release his pent up feeling (so that he/she can cool down) and for the victim to know that he/she (the victim) have done something really wrong!<br><br>If anyone is saying that one should only be mouthing nice words and refrain from using profanities on others, then I will say that either one can do both or none. The world is NOT perfect. You see good things and you also experience bad incidents. You will sooner die if you do not release the pent up negative feelings and the best channel will be the use of profanities to express a pt.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
