              <p><em><span class="pageTitle">The Fundamental Problem with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</span></em></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span class="BodyText"><em>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have a public
              mission for which they enjoy an implicit subsidy from the federal
              government, yet their corporate structure obligates them to maximize
              profits for their shareholders. That dual role creates a fundamental
              conflict of interest, one with worrisome consequences for taxpayers as
              well as the future of our competitive private financial markets.</em> </span></p><blockquote>
              <p>The Federal National Mortgage Association (now known as Fannie Mae)
              and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) are two
              government-chartered and government-sponsored corporations. Both have
              been assigned the statutory mission of enhancing liquidity in the
              middle-class residential mortgage markets by buying and selling
              residential mortgages.</p>
              </blockquote> <blockquote>
              <p>Fannie and Freddie were originally government agencies but were
              "privatized" when they were permitted to sell shares to the public.
              Today, both companies are among the largest and most profitable
              financial institutions in the world, with their securities listed on
              the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
              </blockquote> <blockquote>
              <p>Their apparent success, however, obscures an inherent contradiction.
              They are shareholder-owned companies, with managers who have a
              fiduciary obligation to maximize profits, but they are also
              government-chartered and empowered agencies with a public mission. It
              should be obvious that they cannot achieve both objectives. If they
              maximize profits, they will fail to perform their government mission to
              their full potential. If they perform their government mission fully,
              they will fail to maximize profits.</p>
              </blockquote> <blockquote>
              <p>In 1996, the Congressional Budget Office found that these two
              companies had received subsidies in 1995 of approximately $6.5 billion
              but that only about two-thirds of that subsidy was actually delivered
              to the mortgage markets. The remainder was retained for the benefit of
              the companies’ shareholders and management teams.</p>
              </blockquote> <blockquote>
              <p>That is exactly what one would expect from this hybrid form. If
              Fannie and Freddie were fully performing their government mission,
              their entire subsidy would have gone to the mortgage markets. The fact
              that they retained a portion for themselves reflects their obligation
              to their shareholders and the incentives of their executives to
              increase their own compensation.</p>
              </blockquote> <blockquote>
              <p>This conflict of interest has direct practical consequences. Since
              1992, Fannie and Freddie have had an obligation to assist in financing
              affordable and low-income housing. Obviously, doing so would be costly
              and would thus reduce their profitability. Studies now show that their
              performance in financing low-income housing—especially in minority
              areas—is far worse than that of ordinary banks. In other words, despite
              the fact that Fannie and Freddie receive subsidies to perform a
              government mission—in this case support of low-income housing—their
              need for and incentives to retain a high level of profit-ability is an
              obstacle to their performance.</p>

              <p><br>Despite all the warnings written on the wall, we have a brilliant MM who believe that it is in Singapore's long term interest to buy into banks burdened with sub-prime problems.</p>

              <p>UBS called for an additional Rights Issue - which UBS is prepared to offer a special lower price for investors who saw their recent investment depreciated.</p>
              <p>However, if Singapore's GIC do not commit more money to take up more shares with this Rights Issue, it will see the existing shares being diluted in size, besides having lost 40% from the initial purchase value.</p>
              <p>This is the brilliance in the sub-prime that Singapore Government has got Singapore tangled up with.</p>
              <p>Besides GIC being involved in UBS with its sub-prime problems, Singapore's Temasek has also bought for itself a stake of US$6.88 Billion into Citibank after it had written off US$18.1 Billion for subprime losses.</p>
              <p>Besides Citibank, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.moneymorning.com/2007/12/27/merrill-lynch-is-the-latest-beneficiary-of-global-cash-barons-move-on-us-financial-services-sector/">Temasek had also injected US$6.2 Billion into Merrill Lynch  </a></p>
              <p>With all three financial institutions linked to the US Sub-prime fiasco, and with the way that the balance sheets of these financial institutions leaving out several important bad loans that are common amongst the three - is GIC and Temasek taking a bigger bite of a poison apple then can be digested ?</p>
              <p>Should the noisylion gloat over the US problems thinking that Singapore will stay afloat amidst the present problems ?</p>

                  like zhang yimou show where everybody is poor and live in
                  countryside. Now shanghai and many cities r better than singapore.
                  Give it another 10 years and it may even be as strong as US.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">It was sheer stupidity. There is no need to try to make it look better than it is. The money invested is already lost (in that you cannot use it to buy something else, or more of what you bought). Whether you make back the losses, is another issue altogether.</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Despots all over the world think that they are clever and smart but it is better to let a nation (the private individuals in a country) to make the decisions instead of despots taking all the money and losing it to foreigners.</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Edited to add: The money is lost, you cannot use it to buy something, <span style="color: #000000;">with BETTER potential... like Buffet going round the world at this moment trying to pick up bargains. The stupid depots had already tied up tens of billions in the banks and losing Singaporeans hard-earned money they took by force to foreigners.</span><br></span></strong></p>

              <p>To be frank, Atobe has a point tat singapore gov do invest a lot on such banks and it is now hard to see if it is a smart choice or not. Tentatively, it is still cloudy and we r concluding too early to see if the loss is permanent. Since tis is supposed to be a long term investment, lets give it another 2 years to see how things go in the long run.</p>
              <p>Tat is true, however u got to see the rate of improvement instead of the current state. Russia and china have improved tremendously in recent years and it seems growth is gonna continue. Things changes fast and in a couple of years, situation will change. Just lok at china, 10 years ago everybody think china r like zhang yimou show where everybody is poor and live in countryside. Now shanghai and many cities r better than singapore. Give it another 10 years and it may even be as strong as US.</p>
