              <p>If u buy it when they r growing strong, it is not a bargain anymore</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">It was sheer stupidity. There is no need to try to make it look better than it is. The money invested is already lost (in that you cannot use it to buy something else, or more of what you bought). Whether you make back the losses, is another issue altogether.</span></strong><strong></strong>
              </p><p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Despots all over the world think that they are clever and smart but it is better to let a nation (the private individuals in a country) to make the decisions instead of despots taking all the money and losing it to foreigners.</span></strong></p>
              <p></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>They already said it is a long term investment. Long term investment means more than 2 years so lets give it some time. If u talk about something else to buy,wat ? Nobody know the future and in tis time, any shares doesn't seems to be worth buying. Banking r selling at dirt cheap prices now and it can be a steal in future</p>
              <p>Private individuals can still buy their own share now ma... and losing it to foreigner is still hard to say now</p>

              <p>"Give it another 10 years and it may even be as strong as US."</p>
              <p> This may only be possible, provided US and other first world countries stop progressing. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The rate of growth of the new countries r much higher than the developed countries. It is like someone with a higher speed can run past a person in front who is running slower. Again I have to emphasis the word "may"</p>

              <p><br>Recently I just did a refinancing with OCBC bank and based on the recent valuation the the combine value of 2 properties is about S$1.8 million and they are located at the west part of Singapore.</p>
              <p>So tell me jojo,</p>
              <p>1) Why investing in property is not about location</p>
              <p>because SG houses are all good</p>
              <p>2) How you managed to get mortgage when you are just a student</p>

              <p>ask my maths teacher</p>
              <p>4) Why are you freeloading at your siblings house when you own so many properties.</p>
              <p>cause their house nicer</p>
