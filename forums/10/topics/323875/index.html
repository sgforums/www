              <p>read my expired posting.</p>
              <p>u will surprised that US banks ,as at branch level,had a target</p>
              <p>to lend!!Thats why Tom,Dick and Harry can buy a home.</p>
              <p>If a family cannot save a down payment of say 20%,</p>
              <p>how can they have discpline and ability to pay long term  instalments?</p>
              <p>Since they have not paid any down payment or very low down</p>
              <p>payment,there is high incentive for them just mail back</p>
              <p>the keys to the banks!!The instalments they have paid just treat</p>
              <p>as rentals.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The companies are by far the biggest providers of financing for
              domestic home loans. If they are unable to borrow, they will not be
              able to buy mortgages from commercial lenders. In turn, that would make
              it more expensive and difficult, if not impossible, for home buyers to
              obtain credit, freezing the United States housing market. Even healthy
              banks are reluctant to tie up scarce capital by offering mortgages to
              low-risk home buyers without Fannie and Freddie taking the loans off
              their books.</p>
              <p>Together the two companies touch<span style="color: #ff0000;"> more than half of
              the nation’s $12 trillion in mortgages</span> by either owning them or backing
              them. They hold more than $1.5 trillion of the mortgages as securities.
              Others are sold to investors in the form of mortgage-backed bonds.</p>

              <p>U must be joking. U think bankers r the devils and deserve to die ? They help the society ! When u borrow money, u know all the terms and condition and u sign it willingly. Why blame them ? Without banks, probably the companies u see around will be reduced by a lot since they do not have the startup capital. If there is no bank, everybody is poorer since the money is locked in saving and not circulating in the economy. Without banks, many people cannot afford housing and the poor rich divides widens. It is not a surprise why all countres in the world have banks becaue they play a vital role in the economy</p>

                  hundred billions of bad debt cannot be recovered.</p>
              <p>U must be joking. U think bankers r the devils and deserve to
                  die ? They help the society ! When u borrow money, u know all the
                  terms and condition and u sign it willingly. Why blame them ?
                  Without banks, probably the companies u see around will be reduced
                  by a lot since they do not have the startup capital. If there is no
                  bank, everybody is poorer since the money is locked in saving and
                  not circulating in the economy. Without banks, many people
                  cannot afford housing and the poor rich divides widens. It is not a
                  surprise why all countres in the world have banks becaue they play
                  a vital role in the economy</p>
              <p>U mean the people who borrow money they cannot return r angels
                  while the people who loan them money and lose them r the bad guys ?
                  I think u cannot differentiate who r the good guys and bad guys.
                  Critical thinking ? I agree with u kids these days really have
                  none.</p>

              <p>Why so many people lost their homes ???</p>

              <p>Tat practise has been in existence for a long time. It is indeed greed tat spur tis trend but it is overconfidence of the consumer themselves tat did them in. Since u know so many people got chased from their house, declared bankrupts and become poor, then it again reflect on my original points tat a democratic country like USA has severe problems of its own. </p>
              <p>If u feel the bankers r devil, then u don't use the bank. Put your money in little tin boxes and not borrow a single cent from them or use their ATM machines or credit cards. Ask your company to give u straight cash and not giro or use cheque. Don't borrow a single cent to renovate your house, start a business or buy a house/car.</p>
              <p>Don't u see responsible use of the banks is very helpful and important for society.</p>

              <p>The country is not monitoring the situation and the situation has exists for many years and they just turn a blind eye to it.</p>
              <p>Again I say, responisble use of the bank is the wise thing to do. Swiping and wiping your saving is a stupid thing to do and it has nothing to do with the bank but your own stupidity. Almost everybody in the world now uses bank in some form or another. Can u go without using any services provided by the bank. I don't think it is possible.</p>
