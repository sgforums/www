              <p>SINGAPORE – Singapore statesman Lee Kuan Yew considered Myanmar's 
              junta leaders "stupid" and "dense," according to classified U.S. 
              documents released this week by WikiLeaks.</p>
              <p>The Singapore leader said dealing with Myanmar's military regime was
               like "talking to dead people," according to a confidential briefing on a
               2007 conversation between Lee and U.S. Ambassador Patricia L. Herbold 
              and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Christensen released by 
              WikiLeaks.</p>
              <p>The 87-year-old Lee is known for his outspoken and blunt assessments
               of world affairs, but avoids publicly insulting the leadership of 
              foreign countries. Lee was prime minister from 1959 to 1990 and remains a
               senior adviser to his son, current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p>A cable released by Wikileaks a couple of weeks earlier quotes Lee 
              calling North Korea's leaders "psychopathic types with a 'flabby old 
              chap' for a leader who prances around stadiums seeking adulation." The 
              reference to North Korean leader Kim Jong Il is from a cable citing a 
              May 2009 conversation between Lee and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State 
              James Steinberg.</p>
              <p>Lee has not commented on the releases, while Singapore's government 
              has dismissed them as "gossip" and cautioned against taking them out of 
              context.</p>
              <p>In the most recently released cable, Lee said China had the most 
              influence over Myanmar's leadership of any foreign country and that 
              Beijing was worried the country would "blow up" and thus threaten 
              Chinese investments there.</p>
              <p>"Lee expressed his scorn for the regime's leadership," the leaked 
              cable said. "He said he had given up on them a decade ago, called them 
              'dense' and 'stupid' and said they had 'mismanaged' the country's great 
              natural resources."</p>
              <p>Lee said India was engaging Myanmar's leadership in a bid to 
              minimize China's influence, but that "India lacked China's finer grasp 
              of how Burma worked," according to the cable.</p>
              <p>Lee said a group of less 'obtuse' younger military officers could 
              take control and share power with democracy activists, "although 
              probably not with Aung San Suu Kyi, who was anathema to the military."</p>
              <p>After more than seven years under house arrest, pro-democracy leader
               Suu Kyi was released Nov. 13, a week after Myanmar's first election in 
              20 years, which were won overwhelmingly by a pro-military party. Critics
               have slammed the polling as a sham aimed at cementing military rule.</p>
              <p>Singapore has questioned the veracity of some documents purportedly 
              leaked by Wikileaks and published by some Australian newspapers. The 
              reports quote Singapore diplomats as making unflattering remarks about 
              Malaysia, India, Japan and Thailand during meetings with U.S. diplomats.</p>
              <p>In a statement issued late Tuesday, Singapore's Foreign Ministry 
              said "what Singapore officials were alleged by WikiLeaks to have said 
              did not tally with our own records."</p>
              <p>"One purported meeting (between Singapore and U.S. diplomats) did not even take place," it said.</p>
              <p>Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister George Yeo told reporters earlier
               this week that, in any case, such cables were interpretations of 
              conversations by U.S. diplomats, and therefore shouldn't be 
              "over-interpreted."</p>
              <p>"These are in the nature of cocktail talk," Yeo said. "It's always out of context. It's gossip.</p>

              <p>Swedish authorities said Tuesday they will appeal a British judge's decision to grant bail for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.</p>
              <p>The decision means the 39-year-old Australian will remain behind bars for at least another 48 hours.</p>
              <span class="photo left" style="width: 308px;"><img src="http://www.cbc.ca/gfx/images/news/topstories/2010/12/07/tp-assange-rtxvd23.jpg.jpg" alt="WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's relief at his bail ruling evaporated when Swedish authorities announced they would be appealing it, his lawyer Mark Stephens told reporters."><em>WikiLeaks
               founder Julian Assange's relief at his bail ruling evaporated when 
              Swedish authorities announced they would be appealing it, his lawyer 
              Mark Stephens told reporters.</em> <em class="credit">(Lennart Preiss/Associated Press) </em></span>
              <p>Britain's High Court will now hear the Swedish appeal, although it is not clear when.</p>
              <p>District Judge Howard Riddle granted Assange bail earlier Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Less than two hours later, prosecution lawyer Gemma Lindfield told 
              the court she would challenge the decision, but did not elaborate.</p>
              <p>Assange's lawyer, Mark Stephens, said it was "unfortunate" that "the 
              Swedes won't abide by the umpire's decision," and that his client's 
              relief at the bail ruling had evaporated.</p>
              <p>"They clearly will not spare any expense but to keep Mr. Assange in 
              jail," Stephens told journalists outside the City of Westminster 
              Magistrates' Court in London. "This is really turning into a show 
              trial."</p>
              <p>Before the appeal was announced, it appeared as if Assange would be 
              free to leave prison once he posted bail, which was set at £200,000 
              ($317,663).</p>
              <p>Assange is wanted for questioning by Swedish police in connection with a sex-crimes investigation.</p>
              <p>He has been imprisoned at Wandsworth Prison in southwest London since
               his arrest on Dec. 7. He was denied bail at a hearing that day after 
              Riddle said he had "substantial grounds" to believe Assange would not 
              appear for his next hearing.</p>
              <h3>'An innocent man'</h3>
              <p>Assange 
              would have had to abide by strict bail conditions as he fights 
              extradition to Sweden in a sex-crimes investigation, the judge ruled.</p>
              <span class="photo left" style="width: 222px;"><img src="http://www.cbc.ca/gfx/images/news/photos/2010/12/14/assange-police-cp-9900217.jpg" alt="A supporter of Julian Assange stands outside the courtroom where the WikiLeaks founder was granted bail on Tuesday in London."><em>A supporter of Julian Assange stands outside the courtroom where the WikiLeaks founder was granted bail on Tuesday in London.</em> <em class="credit">(Karel Prinsloo/Associated Press)</em></span>
              <p>Under
               the conditions, Assange would have been required to wear an electronic 
              monitoring device, live at a registered address, report to police every 
              evening and adhere to two four-hour curfews a day.</p>
              <p>Even without the appeal, it would have been "impossible to say how 
              long it will take before [Assange] is out," his lawyer Mark Stephens 
              told reporters after the bail hearing.</p>
              <p>"Two hundred thousands pounds can't be paid by cheque, because 
              cheques take seven days to clear," Stephens said. "So we have to go 
              around and try and find money in cash and then have it delivered here to
               the court.</p>
              <p>"And until this court is in possession of £200,000, an innocent man stays in jail."</p>
              <p>A number of high-profile figures have offered to contribute to Assange's surety.</p>
              <p>Prosecutors had tried to argue that Assange was a flight risk with "the means and ability to abscond."</p>
              <p>His lawyers prevailed by outlining a series of strict conditions including a daily curfew.</p>
              <h3>Extradition hearing in February</h3>
              <p>Assange
               is wanted for questioning by Swedish police on accusations of rape, 
              sexual molestation and unlawful coercion. The crimes are alleged to have
               happened with two women in separate incidents in August.</p>
              <p>His lawyers said he continues to deny the accusations and will fight 
              his extradition to Sweden. A two-day extradition hearing has been 
              scheduled for early February.</p>
              <p>Assange has steadfastly denied the accusations, suggesting the 
              charges stem not from his actions but were provoked by his 
              organization's release of thousands of confidential, and often 
              embarrassingly frank, U.S. diplomatic documents.</p>
              <p>In a statement given to his mother to release to Australian 
              reporters, Assange suggested his commitment to WikiLeaks, and to 
              releasing documents, was "unfaltering."</p>
              <p>"I remain true to the ideals," he wrote. "This circumstance shall not
               shake them. If anything this process has increased my determination 
              that they are true and correct."</p>
              <h3>Celebrities in courtroom</h3>
              <p>Christine Assange flew to London for her son's court appearance and was seated in the courtroom's public gallery.</p>
              <p>Lawyers, journalists and celebrities packed the courtroom. Filmmaker 
              Ken Loach and socialite Jemima Khan were there; each had offered to 
              contribute £20,000 ($31,835) toward Assange's bond. Other potential 
              contributors include U.S. filmmaker Michael Moore, human rights advocate
               Bianca Jagger, Australian journalist Phil Knightley and British 
              politician Lord Matthew Evans.</p>
              <p>Assange was transported to the courthouse from Wandsworth Prison in 
              the city's southwest at least two hours before his appearance. He has 
              been held there, reportedly in solitary confinement, since his arrest.</p>
              <p>Supporters across the street from the courthouse on Tuesday cheered 
              when the bail ruling was announced. Dozens had arrived earlier in the 
              morning, carrying signs reading "Free Assange."</p>
              <p>Assange's arrest a week ago came six days after the WikiLeaks website began publishing the controversial diplomatic cables.</p>
              <p>Interpol, the France-based international police organization, placed 
              Assange on its most-wanted list on Nov. 30 after Sweden issued an arrest
               warrant against him.</p>

The Cold War had ended with the forces of the righteous triumphant.<br><br>2.	But alas, for the small countries of the world, there is now more fear. The great democracies of the world, headed by the United States have decided on a crusade to democratise the whole world, through violence and war where necessary.<br><br>3.	I am reading Robert Fisk, a British journalist, on the great war for civilisation i.e. the war in the Middle East. In all these wars the US plays a dominant role, not as a peace maker to stop the violent conflicts between the fractious Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries but to start wars against them so as to spread democracy.<br><br></span></div>

              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">4.	In Palestine, United States' backing for Israel is unstinted, without regard for how many times and how blatant are Israel's disregard for the international law or morality or how violent and lethal are its methods.<br><br>5.	Israel built "settlements" on Palestinian land with impunity, ravaged Palestinian villages, seize their land and expelled the inhabitants, openly shot and kill children, destroying houses with their occupants still inside, jailed and tortured more than a thousand Palestinians without charges or fair trial, illegally blockaded Gaza, attacked foreign ships on mercy mission while in international waters, killing foreign personnel on board, refuses to allow the Palestinians to call their land Palestine but instead to refer to themselves only as the Palestinian Authority.<br><br>6.	Robert Fisk describes the torture methods of the Israelis and this is confirmed by Amnesty International. These include sleep deprivation, squatting for hours, violent shaking, imprisonment in a cupboard, beatings, pressure on the genitals and exposure to heat and cold.<br><br>7.	Why is Israel free to do all these dastardly things? It is because the US backs it all the way.<br><br>8.	Even when the Israelis ran over an American woman with a tractor, killing her, the US did not protest.<br><br>9.	Netanyahu, the Israeli PM ignored President Obama when the latter demanded that no more Israeli settlements be built. The US President had to eat humble pie and did nothing.<br><br>10.	That is Palestine and the Palestine/Israeli conflict. Then when the New York World Trade Centre was destroyed apparently by Saudi Arabs, the United States invaded Afghanistan and Iraq. These two countries have been bombed and rocketed over and over again, their towns and villages razed to the ground. Innocent people were killed by the thousands.<br><br>11.	There is no respect for borders. Towns and villages in Pakistan also experience missile attacks, strafing by aircrafts and bombing, again killing civilians.<br><br>12.	In Iraq, the excuse for invasion is that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. A "shock and awe" blitzkrieg has killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians. Iraq was occupied by US forces but no weapons of mass destruction were found. This excuse was a blatant lie and the US has belatedly admitted it. Now Wikileaks exposed that Israelis and pro-Israelis "fixed" the intelligence that induced the US to war with Iraq. <br><br>13.	In Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan the killings and the destruction are still going on. But the US is not yet satisfied with the bloodbath it has initiated.<br><br>14.	The next target is Iran. After their experience in Iraq there is seemingly less inclination by the US to invade Iran. Instead the method adopted is to starve the Iranians through a siege.<br><br>15.	The United Nations Security Council has not approved the siege (sanctions) of Iran but the US has enough clout, influence over the countries of the world to get them to carry out its wishes.<br><br>16.	Thus if the banks of any country has any dealings with Iran, the US will disallow the bank from doing business with the US. Many other arm twisting methods are used by the US to render its siege of Iran effective. The purpose of doing this is to impoverish and create difficulties for the people of Iran allegedly because of Iran's nuclear programme but actually to punish the Iranians for the closure of the US Embassy and the detention of its staff during the civil war. Revenge is very much a part of US foreign policy.<br><br>17.	Now it is the turn of North Korea. It is the US who planned and implemented military exercises in waters close to North Korea. The idea is to threaten that already poor country to submit to the US.<br><br>18.	Provoked, the North Koreans fired at the South Korean island in the narrow strait between it and South Korea where the military exercise is being conducted. And then the Western media condemns North Korea for this when it was in fact America which provoked North Korea into firing their guns.<br><br>19.	Presidents of countries are not safe from arrest by the US. President Noriega of Panama is now languishing in an American jail. Now President Omar Bashir is being sought by America after the International Criminal Court found him guilty in a trial in which he was not defended.<br><br>20.	President Salvador Allende of Chile was assassinated through the machinations of the CIA because he was a Marxist, even though he was elected by the Chileans.<br><br>21.	Nicaragua had its harbour mined by the US in 1984. The United States was found guilty by the International Court. The other countries of South America live in fear of the US.<br><br>22.	In the Far East the US ensured the enmity between Japan and China is perpetuated and heightened. Rapprochement between Germany and France was possible but not between Japan and China. The US opposed the formation of the East Asia Economic Group.<br><br>23.	A policy of containment of China is urged on all the countries of South East Asia. Lately the US wants to be involved in the dispute over the islands of the South China Sea. For the US the dispute provides an opportunity to involve South East Asian countries in the encirclement of China.<br><br>24.	It is clear that the US is seeking to make war against the small nations of the world. The US is willing to kill hundreds of thousands of people in order to spread its influence and domination.<br><br>25.	No country in the world dares to condemn the US for its bullying of small weak countries.<br><br>26.	Everywhere in the world US Embassies have to be fenced and guarded. Everywhere there would be demonstrations against the US. The country is the most hated nation in the world.<br><br>27.	The US should be the leading nation in the world, abiding by the decisions of the United Nations, helping the poor and the weak, enriching the world with its technology and generally creating a better world by upholding non-violent ways of settling disputes between nations.<br><br>28.	It is sad that the US has chosen the ugly way just for the sake of Israel. It is sad that a country which preaches human rights, justice and freedom is the country which is most guilty of breaching all the high values that it preaches.<br><br>29.	Obama, with all his promises of change has changed nothing about US warlike ways and disregard for international norms. Clearly changes of Presidents, of parties forming Governments of the US will change nothing concerning US creed and policies.<br><br>30.	The capacity of the US to learn from its experiences is almost nil.<br><br>31.	The world will have to be reconciled with having the most powerful country in the world remaining addicted to the gun which won it the West in the past. This great democracy is anything but democratic in its relationship with the world community.</span></div>
