            <div class='col-md body'>If you ask me...they exist for a reason. But frankly, if we had the choice, I did say we do away with them. For simply because they are so loyal that they are deluded and may end up following commands because they're mercenaries and are obliged to do so, resulting in doing things which are wrong. Look at those PMCs operating in Iraq, Afghanistan now...they operate under a different set of rules as the rest of the troops. Interrogation with abuse etc...soldiers will face court-martial for doing those things even under the command of a superior officer. But PMCs...they are given a free reign to a wider degree, and can come and go as they wish. To me the Ghrukhas are more or less like the PMCs...as such, they may not exercise the better judgment under the same circumstances as a soldier or police officer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Arapahoe:</div><div class="quote_body">Walesa is that what they thought you in S. to quote, i would prefer your position.<br><br>here is my take.<br><br>Singapore is still a nation building mode thru "time". If you are still building something thru "time" you cannot tear it down before it is mature. Right now you are saying this is not what we want its not good enough. Than I say since there is a system of vote than all you can do is vote it down thru the system donÂ’t tear it down and build a new system. Because you have gone thru 40 years, it may not be perfect it is doing something better than the rest in the region. Re-invent within the system not tear it down and start from scratch.<br><br>No gov is perfect all has its biased in history, especially early history. And I discourage you to compare current US policy because Singapore history do not have the depth nor being tested to be a nation. (we haven't stand up as an entity against foreign )<br><br>Our leadership handover is still at its infant stage of child holding.  so stop bring democracy into Singapore because you ain't going to find it.<br><br></div></blockquote>I'm not sure if you're another living testament to the horrendous failing of this regime's indoctrination or you're simply an idiot by nature.<br><br>If you haven't the faintest idea what you're quoting and address the point you're quoting, don't quote. If you're going to quote, address the point you've quoted and not some tall tales and short stories which you can't coherently defend (and amazingly, go on to churn out nonsense totally irrelevant to what you've quoted) when challenged. In short, view things in the right context.<br><br>On to your tall tales and short stories (at least, in my view, they're). While every country takes time to mature, it's criminal and absolutely naive to suggest every country needs time to mature by engaging in a period of "maturing" that requires the "1st generation leaders" to be granted the respect and awe above the common man. It's not rocket science to suggest there're plenty of countries adopting the rule of law (instead of the rule of man) that have not only survived, but thrived without having need to live in fear of tyrants. The US didn't need to do that 200 years ago. Slovenia didn't need to resort to that when they gained independence over a decade ago either.<br><br>You can only vote out a government through democratic means where democracy is practised and elections are conducted in a manner that is free and fair. To suggest you could do that in Singapore is no more realistic than suggesting Mugabe could be ousted through the polls in Zimbabwe or Castro in Cuba for that matter. 40 years or 400 years, that isn't going to change so long as you have tyrants in power, so don't use that as an excuse. There're tonnes of examples on this planet that have shown democracy can thrive and is independent of a nation's history. Hence, your suggestion makes no more sense than a toddler's.<br><br>I'm sure your daily dosage of propaganda has served you well - Singapore must be so unique a regime everything is exclusive and there's absolutely no parallel with every other society on this planet. Every nation has a biased history? Show me an account where George Washington or Thomas Jefferson took someone to task for criticising him while he was still alive.<br><br>In essence, you've just answered your own stupidity succinctly with your final two sentences. You're never going to find democracy in Singapore simply because this is a regime run by despots purporting to be democrats. And to think you have the wisdom of suggesting this regime could be ousted at the polls...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everything also PAP... you guys really wanna make me laugh till i pee in my pants.... Employing Gurkhas is also PAP's fault?<br><br>Gurkhas are professional soldiers... They are highly trained and they take their job as their profession and their pride...<br><br>Whereas for most Singaporean defence personnel, be it the police, army etc, they take their job as their career, as a source of income... See the difference?<br><br>There are many things that the Gurkhas are willing to do that Singaporeans arent willing to... I know that we have capable people too in this field but we lack the willingness and dedication unlike the Gurkhas...<br><br>When I was in army last time, there was one section in the company who started a bush fire accidentally and all of them was going "Fire fire fire"... and the rest of the company watched upon in awe... At that time, there was a group of Gurkhas doing training in tht area too... They ran over and stopped the fire... See the difference between our men and theirs? We know what is going on... we shout but we dont want to do anything, either becos we feel it's dangerous or we seriously do not know how to react....<br><br>One last point... I still dont understand how the employment of Gurkhas can be linked to the PAP and the TS even mentioned Lee... Oh give it a break man... Naivety and stupidity at its peak!</div>
