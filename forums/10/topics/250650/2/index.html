It is pretty much obvious in the SAF that there is some unofficial policy against the minority races, particularly evidenced by the lack of minorities in manpower depts, and even if there were, they will be given less sensitive duties. You seem to fail to see that Gurkhas' status is practically that of a private army that is wholely subservient to the Govt who writes its pay check. Essentially the Govt is creating a state within the state, not trusting its own citizens, but regard them as possible suspects and potential coup supporters.<br><br>The Govt has shown from time to time to be extremely paranoid, even going as far as accusing some 20 or so activists as Marxists and there after exiling them from the country. What 20 or so activists could do in rousing up the people is quite simply beyond my imagination, more so when they were social workers. Moreover, the Govt has always regarded its citizens with suspicion, and going so far as to discriminate its own citizens in its own army.<br><br>In fact, I don't even know what you are trying to support here, beyond some mindless rambling possibly because of you evidently bad English.</div>

By your stupid if not inane argument, since the Soviet Union under Stalin ordered thousands to the Gulags for potentially conspiring against Stalin, our Govt has every right, and even a blank cheque, to do so against its own citizens?
