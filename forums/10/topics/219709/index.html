They are seen to practise NKF policies to deny complaints with accusations that people are complainers.<br><br>People expect our post 65 MPs to possess higher quality of education and abilities at uniting the citizens into collective ventures through broad-based practical knowledge application, innovation and restructuring of the economy to value-adding model talked about for years.<br><br>When people are unhappy they will rant they will scold and they will complain.

I am very concerned with major issues and major policy errors such as people's problems being grossed over by hypocrisy in the press media publishing only good news and covering up bad ones.<br><br>The most serious problem facing the nation building process is that the newer and young MPs are still afraid to speak up except may be Michael Palmer against major policy errors still being practised by the old guards from behind the scene. Temasek's overseas losses and the escapefromparadise public issue for example need to be investigated and questions raised by MPs in parliaments.<br><br>If serious problems are not taken care of and leaders continue to give excuses through their own post 65 MPs with plenty of excuses like in the past, they would continue to miss great opportunities to solve problems and upgrade the economy.<br><br>It is easy for any one to avoid answering to problems of serious negligence, derelictions and incompetence, by giving some reasons to shift the blames somewhere else.<br><br>This I think is the more serious problem to discuss in our new parliament by the younger MPs today. The major problem today facing Singapore is not about people not cooperating in estate cleanliness which is a relatively minor issue.</div>
