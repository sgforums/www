The Syariah Law exists here in Singapore but there isn't any "insidious bigger, bolder" steps made by the Muslim community. Your assumption that the Muslim community has some greater political agenda is pretty paranoid. They are going to take over the world!! lol...<br><br>In my opinion, this "my way or the highway" stance taken by the Australian government is pretty stupid. Like Singapore, they can make a compromise to set up a Shariah Law that is compatible with their consitituition. In that way, they can bring the moderate Muslims to their side instead of totally alienating them. Afterall, what feeds the support for the radicals Muslims are the extremist government that is incapable of compromise. So yes, although there will still be some who will fight for a fully-implemented Syariah Law, they will now be in the minority and lacking support.<br><br>The Syariah Law is not forced onto anyone. Race is unchangeable but religion is not. They can always convert if they do not agree with the Syariah Law. The problem is that the image of Islam is intertwined with the Middle Eastern culture, a majority of which is pretty backwards. And as such, we should be clear on which are Middle Eastern culture and which are Islamic practices. You don't have to wear a Middle Eastern garb to be a Muslim when a simple T-shirt and jeans would suffice. The reason why they came to Australia is to escape the backwards Middle Eastern culture but they still want to practise their religion. There is no conflict.<br><br>I also like to point out that people tend to think of all the Muslim countries having the same practices when clearly this is not the case. Because of this decentralized nature of Islam which has no one central authority, Islam is being practised differently in different countries with different 'experts'. As such if the governments is smart enough, like the Singapore government, they can exploit this system and thus decide the type of Islam that they want their Muslim citizens to practise. Too bad, the only ones exploiting this nature is the extremists.</div>

Allah is wroth against him and He hath cursed him and prepared for him an awful doom.Â” (An-NisaÂ’: 93) The so-called Â“honor killingÂ” is based on ignorance and disregard of morals and laws, which cannot be abolished except by disciplinary punishments."[5]<br><br>In Pakistan, when a bill proposing to strengthen the law against "Honor Killing" was defeated in Parliament, March 2, 2005, the government allied with the Islamist opposition to decide explicitly that the bill was "un-Islamic" (BBC)</div></blockquote>If it's just all talk and no concrete action, no prizes for guessing which brand of Islam will win out one day.<br><br>Reformation and re-taking of Islam from the extremists is the biggest challenge.And Muslims should never blindly follow Middle Eastern culture, it is God they worship, not the sands nor the tribes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by kheldorin:<strong><br>You misunderstood by saying that the Syariah Law would affect the non-believers which is not the case here. The Syariah Law exists here in Singapore but there isn't any "insidious bigger, bolder" steps made by the Muslim community. Your assumption that the Muslim community has some greater political agenda is pretty paranoid. They are going to take over the world!! lol...  </strong></blockquote>The point is not about Syariah Law being implemented in Singapore, in which the Singaporean Muslims are not migrants - unlike the subject of Muslims who have migrated to Australia, Europe, UK, and the USA.<br><br>Before we get into a paranoia of the Muslims taking over the world, perhaps we should take note of the teachings and writings of some of the fervent Muslims from the Middle-east and Pakistan, as well as their fellow-brethens in South-east Asia who are planning a Pan-Islamic South-east Asia. (See Ref #1 and 2 below)<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>In my opinion, this "my way or the highway" stance taken by the Australian government is pretty stupid. Like Singapore, they can make a compromise to set up a Shariah Law that is compatible with their consitituition. In that way, they can bring the moderate Muslims to their side instead of totally alienating them. Afterall, what feeds the support for the radicals Muslims are the extremist government that is incapable of compromise. So yes, although there will still be some who will fight for a fully-implemented Syariah Law, they will now be in the minority and lacking support. </strong></blockquote>Singapore has Forty Years of Independence, and more then 150 Years since the founding of Singapore in 1819 - the Malay Community is part of the natural history of Singapore.<br><br>The population is largely comprising of the four main racial groups of Chinese, Malays, Indians, Eurasians, and some minority groups of Arabs, Armenians, Jews, and newer emigrants from China, Europe, Japan, and other parts of the globe.<br><br>Will Singapore change its Constitution to accomodate some other newer religions that will protect the Rights of a minor religious group, which has its Precepts that are in conflict with those of our own ?<br><br>If Singapore can accomodate Islamic Shariah Law, why does it not accomodate the Shariah Law in its TOTALITY ?<br><br>If Singapore can accomodate the minority religion such as Islam, why does it not tolerate the Jehovah Witness or the Falungong ? (See Reference #3)<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>The Syariah Law is not forced onto anyone. Race is unchangeable but religion is not. They can always convert if they do not agree with the Syariah Law. The problem is that the image of Islam is intertwined with the Middle Eastern culture, a majority of which is pretty backwards. And as such, we should be clear on which are Middle Eastern culture and which are Islamic practices. You don't have to wear a Middle Eastern garb to be a Muslim when a simple T-shirt and jeans would suffice. The reason why they came to Australia is to escape the backwards Middle Eastern culture but they still want to practise their religion. There is no conflict.  </strong></blockquote>Is there an 'opt out' clause for a Muslim to renounce his religion ?<br><br>Similarly, can a Catholic also 'opt out' from being a Catholic ?<br><br>"The Syariah Law is not forced onto anyone" ? Try that again on the other non-Malay communities living in Kelantan, Malaysia - where men and women are not allowed to be in the same Q-line, nor swim on the same beach, nor enjoy their traditional entertainment with alcohol, nor public entertainment with songs and dances.<br><br>Is it not true that the image of Islam is intertwined with the Middle-eastern culture ?<br><br>Besides being clear that Islam is not simply the outward display of physical appearance - dress and goatee, or total head-to-toe garb for women - <strong>one should understand the Shariah Law in its TOTALITY</strong> that governs the LIFE and LIFE-STYLE of a Muslim Man and Woman.<br><br>If a Middle-eastern Muslim decide to leave the backwardness of his country, why does he/she continue to subject himself/herself to the backwardness of the Shariah Law that contradicts the Constitution of the adopted Country, which basically protects the basic rights of all its citizens in enjoying a HUMANE LIFE that is progressive in all cultural, social, economic and political spheres ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>I also like to point out that people tend to think of all the Muslim countries having the same practices when clearly this is not the case. Because of this decentralized nature of Islam which has no one central authority, Islam is being practised differently in different countries with different 'experts'. As such if the governments is smart enough, like the Singapore government, they can exploit this system and thus decide the type of Islam that they want their Muslim citizens to practise. Too bad, the only ones exploiting this nature is the extremists. </strong></blockquote>While most Muslim countries are independent of each other in the political and national sense, it is Islam that binds all the Muslim countries together - as it is only normal for any group of people to naturally bond and group themselves together.<br><br>However, over the last ten years, Islam has transcended narrow nationalism, and is now even troubling the legitimate Governments of Islamic States, as there are now influential Islamic Personalities usurping Islam to move the ground, and start a Pan-Islamic revolution to overthrow these Governments.<br><br>We have seen strong Islamic personalities in the likes of Ayatollah Khomeini overthrowing the Shah of Iran - (See Reference #4)<br><br>The call by Osama Bin Laden to overthrow the Royal Rulers of Saudi Arabia,<br><br>Is Islam practised differently in different countries, and advised by differing experts of the religion ? Are you implying that Islam in Singapore is different from that practised in Malaysia or Indonesia, or Pakistan and the Middle-east countries ?<br><br>Surely, every good Muslim are all bound by the same required religious practise of making the Haj, making the trip to Mecca and Medina ?<br><br>Are they any different ?<br><br>The Singapore Government is smart to accomodate the Singaporean Muslims only insofar as it is able to limit the religious fervour from spilling into politico-religious extremism.<br><br>The future of Islam will need to be carefully understood and not feared.<br>(See Reference #5 n #6)<br><br>Reference #1<br><span style="color: blue;">The evolution of transnational extremist-Muslim terrorist groups in South-east Asia</span><br><a href="http://www.dfat.gov.au/publications/terrorism/chapter4.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dfat.gov.au/publications/terrorism/chapter4.html</a><br><br>Reference #2<br><span style="color: blue;">Indonesian cops nab Muslim terror suspects - Pan-naitonal Muslim State</span><br><a href="http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20030203-061444-1355r" rel="nofollow">http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20030203-061444-1355r</a><br><br>Reference #3<br><span style="color: blue;">Singapore - International Religious Freedom Report 2004</span><br><a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35427.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35427.htm</a><br><br>Reference #4<br><span style="color: blue;">Dawn of an Islamic Revolution</span><br><a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/21887" rel="nofollow">http://www.alternet.org/story/21887</a><br><br>Reference #5<br><span style="color: blue;">The Future of Islam</span><br><a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/21887" rel="nofollow">http://www.alternet.org/story/21887</a><br><br>Reference #6<br><span style="color: blue;">A View from the Eye of the Storm</span><br><a href="http://www.ctjewishledger.com/articles/2005/08/18/opinions/articles_of_interest/article01.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.ctjewishledger.com/articles/2005/08/18/opinions/articles_of_interest/article01.txt</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh, immigrants or not, Muslim minorities are not allowed to demand for the application of Shari`ah. However, they can still appeal that in family affairs like marriages, divorces or lineage properties, they want Shari`ah to be applied, <span style="font-style: italic;">which is exactly how it has been in Singapore</span>. Likewise in a proper Muslim state while applying the Shari`ah in full, it gives the chance to non-Muslims to act in accordance with their own religious matters concerning family, personal rights and such and such.<br><br>I certainly do not think a secular country is so bad. One of its exposition is to protect religion from the interference of the State, not the opposite. From the history of the Prophet, he had asked troubled Muslims to immigrate to Abyssinia (a non-Muslim country) just because there was a ruling king who was implementing justice and nobody under his leadership were subjected to aggression, torture or bad treatment. Hence, Muslims in these countries are to respect their law and the people who hosted them and deal with them in the best of ways.<br><br>Those ungrateful clerics in the article should have their nuts pulled and cracked for not being appreciative before they are extradicted. Or let me do some other painful kinky actions to them.... sigh.<br><br>As for the severe punishments in the Shari`ah posted here, its only a one sided view on the part of the "boundaries" law. The doors of repentance are always opened and there are tons of preventive measures.</div>
