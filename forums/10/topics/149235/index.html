There is no second law.<br><br>"If you can't agree with parliamentary law, independent courts, democracy, and would prefer Sharia law and have the opportunity to go to another country which practices it, perhaps, then, that's a better option," Costello said.<br><br>Asked whether he meant radical clerics would be forced to leave, he replied: "Where a person has dual citizenship, it might be possible to ask them to exercise that other citizenship. That might be a live possibility."<br><br>In the wake of last month's London bombings by British-born Muslims, Britain is debating new powers which could include closing mosques where clerics are suspected of supporting extremists and deporting those who glorify suicide bombers.<br><br>Australia, which like Britain has troops in Iraq, fears that it could be the target of a similar attack by disaffected members of its small Muslim community and is also contemplating tougher anti-terror legislation.<br><br>The measures will be debated next month at a meeting between Howard and leaders of Australia's state governments.<br><br>Howard also called a meeting of 14 mainstream Muslim leaders Tuesday, where they pledged to defend the country against Islamic terrorism, disowned Osama bin Laden and accepted differences with the government over the Iraq war.<br><br>- AFP</div>

In the past few weeks, there's been a lot of coverage in the Australian press about radical Muslim leaders telling their followers to reject all aspects of Australian life, including the law, in favour of Sharia law.  They preached separatism and just stopped short of advocating terrorism on Australian soil.  These are the people that Costello was referring to, and rightly so - nobody's going to impinge upon their way of life, but if they're not going to return the courtesy, they've got no business coming here.</div>

The Syariah Law they are advocating only applies to Muslims so it does not affect the freedom of non-believers, just as how it is in Singapore. I don't see any sentences that imply that they want the law to affect every Australian. They are only proposing that Muslims in Australia be subjected to Syariah Law. So if they don't want to be subjected to Syariah Law, don't be a Muslim. Convert.<br><br>Another point is that, people should change their lives to suit religion not the other way round. So it doesn't matter if it's the 20th century or the 50th century. It should not be 'updated' as that would only mean human interference in God's will. And out of the 3 semitic religions, Judaism and Islam has remained constant.. That is the mark of a true religion.</div>
