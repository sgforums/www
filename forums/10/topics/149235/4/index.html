It cannot be reinterpreted because it must grow afresh, as is when it was presented with an illuminative value and objective truth. A good example is in the webpage I linked to. That is different from a mere tainted immitativeness of the religious bigots who manifests such veracity according to their own needs while claiming religious validity. For them, the Shari'ah in the first place is a utilitarian receptacle. I really hope too, there will be change.</div></blockquote>And where is change supposed to come from? When all everyone does is to focus on the division instead of building bridges. When everyone thinks that there is no room for compromise. When everyone is focused on the extremists. When the voice of the moderates are being drowned. When everyone thinks that each other are inflexible and unreasonable. When everyone justify their current actions on past actions. All this does is to widen the division and alienate each other. Damn ridiculous.<br><br>What harm is there in setting up a Syariah Law in Australia that is compatible with their consituition? All the arguments are of the form of "they are the minority and emigrants so they should not make any demands". OR "they should not have the rights because other Muslims in other countries also do not treat minorities well." What?! Where are the real disadvantages??! We don't even know the Laws that they want to be implemented. If the Australian Muslims are unreasonable in the implementation of the Syariah Law, then fine, they deserve it. But they are not even given the chance to prove their case.<br><br>Do some negotiations, find out which areas of the Syariah Law the Australian Muslims want to be implemented and then propose what can be done about it. Some social surveys and social research would also be helpful. Do not outright reject it and alienate them. At the very least, appear accommodating even though at the back of your mind you know that you are going to reject them. That's just smart leadership to prevent unrest.<br><br>Anyway, the the thread is veering way off-topic. Discussion about the Australian Muslims blew up into an attack of the Muslim world in general. Kinda reminds me of arguments with my mum. One argument on a single topic would would grow into thousands of past arguments on thousands of topics , from the day I was born till now.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

In Egypt, churches were  burnt and Chirstians communities being attacked.  Iran is also another famous country for assasinating christian leaders.<br><br>It's a known fact in Indonesia that church buildings are torn down with the excuse that they are not safe and no new buildings are allowed to be built.  That's why they use their house for religious activities. Now, there are reports that muslim extremists are forcing these chirstians to stop their activities in their own house.<br><br>Even in Brunei, if you claim to be Christians, you can forget about getting promotion as civil servent.<br><br>Comparing the way muslim govts treating minority religions in their countries, I think Muslims are generally very well treated in most western countries &amp; US.<br><br>Muslims should ask themselves are they being kind and tolerant towards others before complaining about others violating their rights. </div></blockquote>Fully agreed.... this is what i wanted to say...<br>They even cancelled or hide their christmas celebration just to accommodate minorities.<br><br>I dont see any other religion which is minor in size have created problem in other country.

Isn't that the same reasoning the Bali bombers use  to attack innocent Western tourists? It's not as if the Muslim world is one entity, that they are all homogenous and they all agree on the same things.<br><br>Because of the terrorists attacks, Muslims in Western countries are suffering from social backlash and discrimination. A guy got shot in Britain just because he looked like Middle Eastern...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  Not to mention the countless of detainess in GuantÃ¡namo Bay. </div></blockquote>Why do I make those statements? Because whenever muslims complained about not fairly treated, they forgot that muslim govts were cruel to others as well. They are not even giving others the basic rights. Bush made grave mistakes in Iraq &amp; GuantÃ¡namo Bay but are muslims really suffernig badly in US?<br><br>I don't think that oz muslims are suffering in any way. There will always be racists in oz. If I migrate there, I'll be treated as 2nd class citizens as well.<br><br>As for UK, police are guarding mosque. Yes, UK police over-reacted and we'll see if they will learn from their mistakes.  Most UK uni have muslim prayer rooms in their campus. When I was studying in UK, a church was being sued by muslims for a banner that says" Jesus is the only way to God".
