            <div class='col-md body'>Oh my... It's all about interpretation isn't it? What seems to be good for some may not be good to others. Laws (constitutional, religious, etc) are set by man. Naturally, there's bound to be unfairness, errors, etc even though the initial intention was good. Man also has this tendency to resist change. If man are more open to update these laws to fit modern situations, then we'd see less of these conflicts that we see (or read) everyday in the news.<br><br>In addition, I agree that the image of Islam is unfortunately intertwined with Arabic culture. I'm a modern Sunni Muslim young woman. I don't believe that by wearing a Hijab or being less outspoken will make me a better Muslim. Islam, or any other religion for that matter, is a faith that's within your heart. It's not about what you wear, which buildings you pray in, what food you eat... On Judgement Day, it's just you and God.<br><br>In conclusion, Shariah law can exist within the Constitutional laws. I don't see why it can't considering that the Constitutional laws of some countries (namely USA) were based on (or influenced by) Christianity. If governments aren't open-minded about it, it just smacks of double standards doesn't it?<br><br>***Just my humble but honest opinions***</div>
