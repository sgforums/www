              <p>After my topic in Chit Chat(Where buy Airsoft?),I have decided to write a short "convincing" letter to people new to Airsoft or don't know what is that in an effort to promote the sport and at the same time try to unban it.Airsoft is like paintball,with the exception that holding a replica gun feels more "real" and fun then holding a weird piece of metal that shoots paint at you.(Not insulting Paintball fans here.).In short,it is a hobby in many countries.Guess what?It's banned here even though it is perfectly legal in other countries (with some exceptions) though.It's like having MacDonalds,KFC,Pizza Hut,Subway and things you love to eat having banned.Contrary to government belief,Airsoft is VERY safe,precautions will have to be taken.Here is an excerpt from airsoftking.com:</p>
              <p><em><strong>Should parents allow kids the use of Airsoft guns?</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>When
                          your child is writing his wish list for Santa Claus or for his/her
                          birthday and you read that he/she wants an “Airsoft gun”, you don’t
                          have to be alarmed. Air soft guns are harmless providing safety rules
                          are observed. Airsoft shooting is probably <strong>one of the safest and most
                          popular sports enjoyed in the world today</strong>. But, still there are some
                          people that think they should be banned.</em></p>
              <p><em>But let's give this matter a thought. Forget the air/BB gun you know
                          from when you were a kid. You remember the one that shot out a
                          neighbor’s kitchen window. Or maybe the time that you or someone you
                          knew shot a small whole in the car door. Some one might have already
                          been telling you, it isn’t a BB gun, it's an Airsoft gun. It shoots a
                          light weight (soft) plastic BB. <strong>It will not and cannot break the
                          neighbors' windows or ruin a cars paint job.</strong></em></p>
              <p>Some might say:</p>
              <p>Load a metal BB in the gun,accidentaly shoot a window and see the auntie in the opposite block yelling expletives.This is one of concern.I don't know about Airsoft enough that there is metal BBs.But as you know:Metal BB+Accident involving eye=accident.But wait,this is where the convincing part comes:</p>
              <p><strong>Safety issues</strong>:</p>
              <p>The government does not have sufficient information on what Airsoft guns are.If you were born in the 80s/90s you know there was a widespread of Airsoft all around.It's like the latest craze in town.Many children went running around at void decks,playgrounds firing their Airsoft without concern that someone may get hurt.Then someone got hurt up real bad he even complained his whiny little a** to TCS(Now Mediacorp)that he got shot in the eye.Guess what?He deserved it.No sympathy coming from anyone,please.He did not observe rules of Airsofting and just fired his AK-74 like a moronic killer on the loose.Government received the news about the incident,sent it to lab for testing,and "anything that harms people using a toy" is considered banning material.Look,every sport carries a risk.Swimming may risk drowning.Basketball may break your finger.Football can break your nose.Heck even Dragonboating and Sailing carries some risk.(If you are following the news.)</p>
              <p><strong>Security Issues:</strong></p>
              <p>Another reason the gov banned it is the reason that it is the spitting image of the gun it is made from,hence the word "replica".And the word robbery comes to mind.If the robber were to consider robbing a store or something,he would just rob it.The Airsoft does not affect his decision.Even if there is no gun,he can just take his parang or whatever and just go rob.That innocent Airsoft gun does not change the fact that someone is going to use it for harm.</p>
              <p><strong>What I propose:</strong></p>
              <p>-Orang tip at barrel of every Airsoft weapon to differentiate from the real deal.When I saw Airsoft guns at first look,i thought the guns were something that the Power Rangers would use,since the orange is so obvious to the eye.</p>
              <p><em>It has already been confirmed that airsoft rifles CANNOT be changed to
                          a real firearm. Even if robbers try to use these airsoft weapons to rob
                          banks, they would have to consider the high probability of getting shot
                          and killed.</em></p>
              <p>-<em>From a Singapore Airsoft petition</em></p>
              <p>-Restrict 100 FPS to 280 FPS.(sorta like speed the gun can fire)</p>
              <p>-BAN IT FOR KIDS AND MINORS.They started the banning.No second chance for them.</p>
              <p>-Skirmish matches be played at Government set up areas.(No,not playgrounds)</p>
              <p>-Protective gears a must.</p>
              <p>-Airsoft guns cannot be taken out in public or anywhere not expected except official skirmish sites.Those trying to be a gun totting moron walking down Orchard Road like James Bond faces the possibility of getting shot.</p>
              <p>-Sell WWII replica guns!Since people know that robbers won't take a M1A1 Thompson submachine gun that was used in WWII.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sign this <a href="http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/legalize-airsoft-in-singapore.html">petition</a>(not mine).Because if we just sit back and pray to gods that the gov will somehow unban it,it may never come.By signing,you are helping us one step closer to an unfortunate sport that got banned.</p>
              <p> Government bans too much things.Learn to control matters and not just ban them to solve the answer.First they ban chewing gum,then Airsoft,now even porn they also want to ban.-_-II</p>

              <p>Lifted from arniesairsoft:</p>
              <p><strong>Q: What is the VCRA?<br><br>A:</strong> It stands for Violent Crime Reduction Act and amongst many other things it includes a section banning the sale, manufacture or importing of Realistic Imitation Firearms. We use RIFs to play airsoft, so you cannot buy new airsoft guns unless you can use the specific defence which applies to airsoft skirmishers (see below) who are over 18. You will still be able to own the ones you have, and you can buy parts to maintain them without needing the defence.<br><br><strong>Q: What is a RIF?</strong><br><br><strong>A:</strong> Realistic Imitation Firearm. This is something that clearly looks like a gun. If you take a RIF and paint it one of the following colours, then it becomes an unrealistic IF:<br><br>(a)bright red;<br>(b)bright orange;<br>(c)bright yellow;<br>(d)bright green;<br>(e)bright pink;<br>(f)bright purple; and,<br>(g)bright blue.<br><br>Unrealistic IF's are still legal to sell import or manufacture if you (and the buyer when selling) over 18.<br><br><strong>Q: What's an airsoft skirmisher then?</strong><br><br><strong>A:</strong> Someone who takes part in "the acting out of military or law enforcement scenarios for the purposes of recreation.", i.e. someone who takes their airsoft guns to a site with public liability insurance where airsoft games are played for the purposes of playing.<br><br><strong>Q: How do I prove I'm a skirmisher in order to use the specific defence if I need to?</strong><br><br><strong>A:</strong> Neither the <span class="searchlite"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000; background-color: #ffff00;">VCRA</span></strong></span> or the Regulations that cover this explain how you prove it - it's left up to us to figure that out (great eh?). The HO does mention site membership in it's guidelines to the <span class="searchlite"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000; background-color: #ffff00;">VCRA</span></strong></span>, so I would recommend that you join your site's membership scheme (if they have one) and get a membership card. Some organizations (such as UKARA) are setting up databases that retailers can use to check that you're an airsoft skirmisher before they'll sell to you. This involves becoming a member of a site that's registered with them (<a href="http://www.ukara.org.uk/node/24"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Link to their list</span></a>). Check <a href="http://www.ukara.org/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">UKARA's website</span></a>for more information. For proving you're a skirmisher for importing, see below.<br><br><strong>Q: What have HMRC (Customs) said about importing?</strong><br><br><strong>A:</strong> Now this seems to vary, depending on who you speak to at customs - the one thing that's consistant is that they want proof you have a defence, though the level of proof varies. So far I've heard a few stories and I'll add more info as and when I hear it. In some cases, Customs have contacted the importer while in others it's been the other way around (some people are just impatient). In all cases so far, Customs have asked the importer to tell them what the importer intents to use them for. When the importer has stated that they intend to use them "for the enactment of military or law enforcement scenarios as permitted under the specific defence contained in the regulations to the Violent Crime Reduction Act" (or a similarly worded sentence) one of two things have happened:<br><br>1. Customs have said "Okay we'll clear it then"<br>2. Customs have asked for further proof.<br><br>In the cases where proof has been requested, a number of possible "proofs" have been suggested, again depending on who they've spoken to. They have mentioned the following, and sometimes asked for more than one (they basically want as much as you can give them in some cases):<br><br>A copy of your site's PLI certificate.<br>Copies of your disclaimer forms filled in on site.<br>A skirmisher diary, signed by the site - together with contact details for the site so they can check.<br>Receipts from the site.<br>Site Membership card<br>UKARA registration details (one customs officer thought they could check this, despite what UKARA have told me ("No they can't" they said)<br><br>So although there doesn't seem to be a uniform approach to "proof", they do at least accept that they need to ask for something. Gawd knows what they do with it, but at least they can say they've checked I suppose.<br><br>Now then: I'm told that at least a couple of people so far have faced an additional charge of £40-£45 for their items to be inspected by a firearms expert to prior to release for shipping.<br><br><strong>Q: Can I still skirmish if I'm under 18?</strong><br><br><strong>A:</strong> Yes, the law is only to do with selling, manufacturing and importing RIFS. Using the ones you have is fine, so if you own 'em and the site lets you play, you're fine.<br><br><strong>Q: Can I keep the guns I already own?</strong><br><br><strong>A:</strong> Yes.<br><br><strong>Q: I'm a collector and I don't skirmish. Can I still buy RIFs after October 1st?</strong><br><br><strong>A:</strong> Nope. You will need to be an <strong>airsoft skirmisher</strong>. Sorry.<br><br><strong>Q: What about second hand sales?</strong><br><br><strong>A:</strong> Same law applies. If you're selling, make sure the buyer is legit (and I'd recommend you keep a record of everything you used to make sure they were legit). If you're buying, make sure you're over 18 ('cos it's illegal to buy too if you're under 18).<br><br><strong>Q: Can an adult give an imitation firearm to someone under 18 as a gift?</strong><br><br><strong>A: </strong>First, let's be absolutely clear what we mean here by a gift in this context. This is when an adult buys an initation firearm as a present or gift for an under 18 year old, and NOTHING IS GIVEN IN EXCHANGE. Anything else could very well be classed as buying/selling, so don't think for a moment that this is acceptable. Having said that, it is perfectly legal for someone to give an imitation firearm as a gift to an under 18 year old. The Home Office clarified this with the ABA.</p>
