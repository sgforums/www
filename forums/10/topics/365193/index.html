              <p><br>Yes, in the characteristic Lim Swee Say ways of trying to be less stupid:</p>
              <p>"<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">everyday think about how much money you have inside your cpf account, and you'll be very happy</span></em>"</p>
              <p>is similar to Madoff and Stanford telling their US contributors - think how much they have contributed, and they should be very happy too.</p>
              <p>Do not worry about being "Conned, Peeled, Fooled" - just be happy thinking about how much money you have given.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When CPF was first started by the British Colonial Government - it was meant to be an optional and voluntary retirement savings in addition to the pension scheme.</p>
              <p>LKY, Toh Chin Chye and Goh Keng Swee developed the CPF further as a cheap source of funding for the Government plan to develop the infrastructure, which at the same time was made compulsory to enlarged the net to capture a wider section of the population.</p>
              <p>The attraction was that it was a guaranteed retirement savings plan with interest of 2.5% per annum compounded annually, with the minimum sum draw down age tied to retirement at 55.</p>
              <p>This withdrawal age of 55 was revised to a later date of 62 as recommended in the Howe Yoon Chong report - this was later revised to 63 to be implemented by 2012, to be changed to 64 years by 2015, and then 65 by Year 2018.</p>
              <p>In the late-1980s, new plans were introduced to deduct for compulsory subscription to Medisave; and subsequently in the 1990s when Medishield was also added - (with the deductions ranging from $30 to $705 depending on the insured person's age - Pg 30 of Annual Report 2007 - premium discounts of $33.50 TO $282 is given subject to past period of insurance).</p>
              <p>Additonal deductions were introduced in the 1990s for old-age benefits.</p>
              <p>All these deductions were in excess of the 2.5% interest payable per annum.</p>
              <p>These deductions co-incided with population growth studies that showed a steady decline in the number of births.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the CPF to succeed, the number of retiring Singaporeans should be very much less and there should be an increasing number of new workers contributing into the CPF scheme.</p>
              <p>Those contributing must be more then those withdrawing, and this growth should be consistent every year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The CPF is designed to be like a pyramid - with a wide base and a narrow apex.</p>
              <p>With the birth rate decreasing, the new participants entering the CPF scheme every year is shrinking, compared to the numbers of older Singaporeans retiring.</p>
              <p>The CPF pyramid base is getting smaller, even as the number of aged is getting bigger from the baby boom that began in the mid-1940s after WW2.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><strong><span>The following is a letter written by Leong Sze Hian and published by <a href="http://tnp.sg/speakup/story/0,4136,193111,00.html"><span style="color: #990000;">The New Paper </span></a>on 17 February.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span><span><span>I REFER to media reports about the changes to the CPF Life scheme.</span></span></span></span>
              </p><p><span> Changing CPF Life’s original 12 options to four, is not just making it less confusing for Singaporeans to choose. There is a rather fundamental change from the National Longevity Insurance Committee’s recommendations accepted by the Government.</span></p>
              <p><span> In the original ‘no refund’ option, there was still a refund, based on the unused portion of the CPF retiree’s Retirement Account balance.</span></p>
              <p><span> Now, the new Life Income Plan (non-refundable), which pays the highest monthly income, will have no refund at all when the retiree dies.</span></p>
              <p><span> Given the choice of receiving the most income against receiving less with a higher refund for beneficiaries, I think some Singaporeans, particularly those who don’t have much in their CPF and do not have other funds, may choose the Life Income Plan as every dollar counts for them.</span></p>
              <p><span> But what will happen to widows and dependent children, if such retirees die shortly after starting to receive their CPF Life annuity payout at age 65?</span></p>
              <p><span> When the Compulsory Annuity Scheme was announced in August 2007, there was widespread unhappiness about requiring all Singaporeans to buy a life annuity, which we can benefit from only if we live beyond 85.</span></p>
              <p><span> Now, with the Life Income Plan, I think it is equally hard to accept that you may lose your entire CPF minimum sum of up to $134,000 by 2013 plus accrued interest, if you choose the option that gives you the maximum monthly payout.</span></p>
              <p><span> The committee’s original recommendation is still a better ‘middle of the road’ solution.</span></p>
              <p><span> I would like to urge Singaporeans to think carefully before choosing the no-refund option, as it may mean losing your CPF life savings if you die early.</span></p>

              during father's days, they even state in newspaper that I can top-up my father's CPF as a "father's day gift" to him.
              
              More like a "gift" to CPF!! :lol:

              <p><strong>You can top up his cpf with your cpf and since you cannot anything with your own cpf (the special account portion), must as well transfer it to your father to make him happy!!!</strong></p>
