After all, since our media plays judge so often, surely they won't mind if I do the same to them? Guess which paper top marks go to?</p>

              <p>Singapore Chee runs marathon in demo</p>
              <p>SINGAPORE Democratic Party leader Chee Soon Juan marked Human Rights Day yesterday by running a 42-km marathon from Whitley Road to Hong Lim Park, accompanied by his sister Siok Chin.</p>
              <p>His route took him past the Istana, where he handed to security guards a letter, addressed to Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, protesting against the Internal Security Act.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee explained to reporters why he had continued with the run despite police refusal last Wednesday to grant the Open Singapore Centre and Think Centre a permit for a marathon: 'It's to show our resolve. A demonstration doesn't have to be one where we hurl rocks and bottles.'</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Activists from both organisations, including veteran opposition leader J.B. Jeyaretnam and political activist James Gomez, were at Speakers' Corner awaiting Dr Chee's arrival.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Wearing white T-shirts emblazoned with the words 'Abolish ISA' and holding up a large banner bearing the same words, they took turns to persuade the noon-day crowd at Speakers' Corner that the Government was denying Singaporeans their rights by keeping the ISA.</p>

              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>The claim was itself false.</p>
              <p>CSJ's claims for taxi-fare and postage was approved by his Faculty Head - Dr Vassoo - a PAP stalwart - BEFORE the election of 1997.</p>
              <p>When CSJ was invited by his Faculty Head to join the PAP - he declined, and had instead stood as a SDP candidate.</p>
              <p>After the elections, those claims were dug up and charges were made that CSJ had claimed a S$1 or S$2 extra for taxi fare - as the taxi route from Point A to Point B should be S$XX.00.</p>
              <p>Everyone knows that from Point A to Point B - the charges will be different depending on the route that a taxi driver take, especially if detours are made to avoid traffic situation, then also on different times of the day, and on different days of the week, the same route can have differing traffic conditions.</p>
              <p>The other charge concerns the postage claims that CSJ had made, which was approved, dug up, and charges made against CSJ that CJS had included the research work of his wife into the parcel that was sent to the overseas university for examination.</p>
              <p>CSJ had claimed that this was made known to his Faculty Head that his wife's work is to be included as part of his dissertation for his PhD examination, and which already was accepted by the overseas examining university.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, it remains a puzzle as to how the Faculty Head will know of the contents of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">parcel already posted</span> - when he had claimed that he was not told by CSJ of the inclusion of his wife's research papers in the parcel.</p>
              <p>More importantly, why were these petty sums amounting to no more then S$200 should be used to nail CSJ - when these have already been approved prior to CSJ participating as a candidate in the 1997 Election ?</p>

              <p>You need me, an insignificant nobody, someone whom you had wanted to thrash, to remind you of your destructive and blind loyalty to your beloved leader, enough that you accepted my words and obediently wrote it out as a reply????!!!!  ROFL!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
              <p>For this i take FULL credit, not that i will get anything out of it, no prize, nothing, except to show that you are so easily manipulated, just as your outlaw is manipulating you and attempting to manipulate others.</p>
              <p>Excuse him for his flaws all you want. There is a difference between an allowable claims and dishonest claims, even for a buck. Excusable for humans, for who is without flaws, but inexcusable for someone who seeks high office to lead.</p>
              <p>These are not simple mistakes, but a deeper pyschological disorder, amongst his many other flaws over the years seen and witnessed by all, which you hide it in the hope that others may know not know. Such flaws cannot be condone in one who seeks to lead.</p>
              <p>Very despical of you to do that, but hey, I am only an insignificant nobody. I am sure my other more intelligent fellow citizens will realized those duplicities you hid.</p>
              <p>Such is the animal whom you seeks to elevate above all of us.</p>

              <p>Not good enough. Now be a good little person, and come with something new. You are yet again using old insults which actually insults you.</p>
              <p>I am getting bored, who wouldnt, with your nonsensical personal attacks when you run out of serious issues to hit out at others.</p>
              <p>If you run out of insults, tell me. I can wait till you gather your wits, as I often had. I am still the gentlemanly one here. Run along now, and come back.
