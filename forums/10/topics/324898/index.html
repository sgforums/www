              <p>I was just surprised that a Singaporean who doesn't equate Singapore to PAP can still feel nothing for the country. I got no answers, no discussion but a torrent of abuse. Now i am being accused of harassment, attack and humiliation. All because of a simple question. Chill alright ? I won't probe further If the fact that you have no love for your country is a sensitive topic. I just wonder if it is a common phenomenon in Singapore thats all.</p>
