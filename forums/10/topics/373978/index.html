              <p><strong>Lloyd's List, 1 Sept 2009</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Pirates attempt to board bulker in Singapore Strait</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>ARMED pirates attempted to board a capesize bulker in the Singapore Strait on Sunday evening. <br> </strong></span> <br> Five pirates armed with machine guns attempted to board the Trasmed
              Shipping owned, 173,028 dwt bulker, Good Luck, close to Pulau Nipa,
              between the east and west bound lanes of the Singapore Strait according
              to a report from the Regional Co-operation Agreement on Combating
              Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships. <br> <br> The Cyprus-registered vessel was anchored in Indonesian waters at 1845
              hrs on August 30 when five pirates armed with two machine guns
              attempted to board the vessel. <br> <br> The ship’s master raised the alarm and the pirates aborted the attempt to board the vessel. <br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The Good Luck is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">third vessel to be attacked by pirates </span>in
              the Nipa transit anchorage since the end of March this year. In the two
              earlier attacks tugs were boarded by pirates armed with guns and
              knives. </strong></span><br> <br> ReCAAP urged ship masters to maintain vigilence at all times and adopt
              counter measures such as raisng all alarm signals and mustering the
              crew. It said early detection of an attack was the best deterrent as
              the incident on the bulker demonstrated.<br> <br> --------------------------<br> <br> <strong><span style="color: red;">Latest updates @ <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com</a><br> <br> 1.

              <p>well, not sure whether I am correct, please correct if wrong.</p>
              <p>read that the pirates are also armed with high tech weapons, and powerful engines.</p>
              <p>importantly, the sea is so vast, and these pirates were using "mother" ships which look like normal shipping boats to refuel, and then launch attacks using powerful smaller speedboats which are harder to detect on radar. hence, easier for them to come close to these bigger ships.</p>
              <p>also, unlike planes or cars, even when alarm is activated, it is not immediate that they can zoom there to help so there is a time lag.</p>

              <p>"A FORMER NSman, who helped some members of the Indonesian navy smuggle a large cache of contraband cigarettes, was jailed for four years and five months by a district court on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Ee Jin Liang, 23, then a lance corporal (LCP) at the Tuas Naval Base, appeared stunned when sentence was passed.</p>
              <p>Senior District Judge Tan Siong Thye said while the jail term may seem harsh for a first offender like Eem, it serves as a deterrent to others.</p>
              <p>'If not deterred, some other national serviceman could be bribed to look the other way,' he said.</p>
              <p>'We can ill afford such security compromise in today's context as terrorism is very real and terrorists will exploit security lapses and cause massive public mayhem and destruction of human lives and property.'</p>
              <p>The judge also pointed out that the amount of contraband involved was one of the highest to have come before the courts.</p>
              <p>Excise duty and goods and services tax (GST) unpaid on these cigarettes came up to more than $3 million.</p>
              <p>Ee had pleaded guilty last Thursday.</p>
              <p>He was assigned to ferry the Indonesian personnel who were here for meetings with the Singapore Navy at the Changi Naval Base.</p>
              <p>It was during these meetings that Ee helped the Indonesians move the contraband out of the base.</p>
              <p>Investigations revealed that the Indonesians were in cahoots with a syndicate here that sold the smuggled cigarettes locally."</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>So what, anti vice has also gone on for years, so it anti crime, anti smoking, anti littering, anti HIV and so on..does it end? No, so they keep on having retreat meeting at some sunshine resort island and plan out there strategy ending up with a nite of partying, drink and eating. All wayang wayang abit and life goes on, you happy, i happy kind of state. If you notice, until the pirates strikes then they take on the action, they are not even proactive enuf to snub them off, and after so many years of anti pirates meeting and lavish eating, why are there still pirates??? Think hor?? seibei goondno one</p>
