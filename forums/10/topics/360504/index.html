              <p>A supercomputer  demonstrating the ability to remotely control virtually any networked device, such as traffic lights, cell phones, and even automated cranes through the eyes of CCTVs and satellite imagery placed throughout the country</p>
              <p>I seriously beleive that such a technology will be possible in the near future.</p>
              <p>It’s about uncontrollable supercomputer, they’re becoming too smart, gain access to all digital gadget and network, upgrading themself on their own, too objective on their duty, make them wipe out all threat on their way, including human being.<br><br>Today they’re so many research about this artificial intelligence. How to make computer or robot as real as human, like in the Artificial Intelligence movie (2001). And they becoming real. Take a look at this video, CB2, one of Japan’s most advanced robotics projects—using 197 sensors under its pallid gray skin, eye-cameras, 51 pneumatic “muscles” and the high-end processing power to drive it all, it has learned to recognize facial expressions, follow the gaze of its “mother” and even teach itself to walk</p>

              <p>Scientists nowadays have also created a Robot Scientist which the researchers believe is the first machine to have independently discovered new scientific knowledge. The robot, called Adam, is a computer system that fully automates the scientific process. (Lab Spaces).<br><br>Artificial intelligence, by claiming to be able to recreate the capabilities of the human mind, is both a challenge and an inspiration for philosophy. Are there limits to how intelligent machines can be? Is there an essential difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence? Can a machine have a mind and consciousness? Can they rule the world?</p>

              I suggest you to watch suspect zero.
