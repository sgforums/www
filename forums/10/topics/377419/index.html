              <p>Online Only -- Make Medifund criteria public<br> 09:00 PM Sep 29, 2009<br> **Letter from Leong Sze Hian**<br> <br> I would like to highlight some possible gaps in the multi-tier
                                      system of Medisave, MediShield and Medifund, to ensure that
                                      healthcare remains affordable and accessible to all
                                      Singaporeans.<br> <br> I have tried to ask many medical social workers for the criteria to
                                      qualify for Medifund, but have been told that it is
                                      confidential.<br> <br> As I understand it, all family members' Medisave, as well as the
                                      bulk of their savings, must be depleted, before one can qualify for
                                      Medifund. What this may mean is that by the time one qualifies for
                                      Medifund, the entire family may in essence be left with almost
                                      nothing already.<br> <br> Therefore, I would like to suggest that the Medifund criteria be
                                      made public, so that Singaporeans may not have a false sense of
                                      complacency, that if they cannot pay for medical costs, they can
                                      always rely on Medifund.<br> <br> For example, some important information that Singaporeans may need
                                      to be made aware of, are that as I understand it, about one out of
                                      five patients who apply may be rejected, Medifund generally cannot
                                      be used for polyclinic out-patient treatment and medicine, patients
                                      who are referred by a general practitioner cannot select subsidized
                                      Class C and B2 hospital wards and medical treatment and thus cannot
                                      qualify for Medifund, the maximum Medifund subsidy for B2 is 60 per
                                      cent, etc.<br> <br> The last time the question was asked in Parliament, the success
                                      rate after means testing for patients who requested for
                                      down-grading to subsidized C and B2 ward and treatment, was only
                                      about one per cent.<br> <br> Recently, it was announced in Parliament that less than one per
                                      cent lapse their MediShield.<br> <br> However, as I understand that there are about one million on
                                      MediShield, does it mean that about 10,000 every year lapse their
                                      cover because they cannot afford the premiums?<br> <br> How many Medisave accounts have zero or less than $500? The last
                                      statistic given by Madam Halimah Yacob, chairperson of the
                                      Government Parliamentary Committee on Health, was that about
                                      750,000 do not have any form of medical insurance.<br> <br> For those parents whose children were born with medical conditions
                                      which resulted in their MediShield being rejected, the stark
                                      reality may be that the entire family's Medisave and savings may
                                      have to be almost exhausted, before they can rely on
                                      Medifund.<br> <br> Our healthcare system may be one of the most cost-effective in the
                                      world with GDP spending of only about four per cent, and about 75
                                      per cent by private individuals and 25 per cent by the state.<br> <br> But, for those who may fall in between the gaps in our multi-tier
                                      system, described above, is it any wonder that practically every
                                      study or survey have Singaporeans saying that the affordability of
                                      healthcare is one of their greatest concerns?<br> <br> URL  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.todayonline.com/Voices/EDC090929-0000290/Online-Only----Make-Medifund-criteria-public">http://www.todayonline.com/Voices/EDC090929-0000290/Online-Only----Make-Medifund-criteria-public</a></p>

              <p>FYI</p>
              <p>------<br><br>Online Only - MOH: "Medifund criteria are public"<br>Updated 07:00 PM Oct 07, 2009<br>Letter from Karen Tan, Director, Corporate Communications Division, Ministry of Health<br><br>Mr Leong Sze Hian suggested that we "Make Medifund Criteria Public" (TODAY Online, Sep 29).<br><br>We do. The general eligibility criteria are published on the Ministry of Health website at  <a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/mohcorp/hcfinancing.aspx?id=346">http://www.moh.gov.sg/mohcorp/hcfinancing.aspx?id=346</a> .<br><br>In addition, the hospital Medifund committees assess each case very carefully and are free to exercise discretion in evaluating the merit of each case.<br><br>Mr Leong claimed that one out of five patients who apply for Medifund is rejected. This is incorrect. The approval rate is 99 per cent.<br><br>Mr Leong also claimed that patients referred from GPs cannot opt for Class B2 and C wards. This is also incorrect. All Singaporean patients who require admission are free to choose their ward class.<br><br>URL <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Voices/EDC091007-0000218/Online-Only---MOH--Medifund-criteria-are-public">http://www.todayonline.com/Voices/EDC091007-0000218/Online-Only---MOH--Medifund-criteria-are-public<br></a><br>Copyright 2009 MediaCorp Pte Ltd | All Rights Reserved<br><br><br><br>------<br><br><br><br>Online Only - Has policy been changed?<br>10:40 PM Oct 18, 2009<br>Letter from Leong Sze Hian<br><br>I refer to the Ministry of Health's (MOH) reply "MOH : "Medifund criteria are public"" (Oct 7) to my letter "Make Medifund criteria public" (Sep 29).<br><br>It states that "We do. The general eligibility criteria are published on the Ministry of Health web site".<br><br>The MOH web site merely says that the criteria is that any Singaporean<br><br>who has received subsidised medical treatment and is unable to pay for<br><br>the medical charges incurred, may approach the medical social workers at<br><br>the relevant medical institution who will help to assess eligibility for<br><br>Medifund, and can guide you in filing out the application form if required.<br><br>In other words, it is akin to saying that anyone who cannot pay can enquire.<br><br>There is no information as to what criteria is used to assess the<br><br>eligibility for Medifund.<br><br>As to "The (Medifund) approval rate is 99 per cent", with about 360,000<br><br>approved Medifund applications in a year, this refers to the approval of<br><br>applications, and not the approval rate of patients who apply.<br><br>For example, a patient who has 12 medical treatments in a year may be<br><br>counted as 12 approved applications. Whereas, the approval rate in terms<br><br>of the number of patients who apply has never been disclosed. It was<br><br>reported in 2008, that 301,126 approved applications were made by about<br><br>20,000 to 30,000 patients.<br><br>In this connection, the number of rejections increased dramatically by<br><br>2,900 per cent from 210 to 6,456 in 2006, and then declined dramatically<br><br>by 79 per cent from 6,456 to 1,266 in 2007.<br><br>What about those who were told that they do not meet the basic criteria,<br><br>which is not public information. In 2008, Madam Halimah Yacob,<br><br>chairperson of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health,<br><br>expressed some concerns that the conditions for Medifund was too<br><br>stringent, some procedures are excluded, and that for some ailments, B2<br><br>is the lowest class of ward available which only gives a maximum<br><br>Medifund subsidy of 60 per cent.<br><br>With regards to "All Singaporean patients who require admission are free<br><br>to choose their ward class", it has been the policy for many years that<br><br>patients referred from GPs cannot opt for Class B2 and C wards.<br><br>So, when was this policy changed?<br><br>Was this change ever announced to the media or the public?<br><br>URL <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Voices/EDC091018-0000093/Online-Only---Has-policy-been-changed">http://www.todayonline.com/Voices/EDC091018-0000093/Online-Only---Has-policy-been-changed</a><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
