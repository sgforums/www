              <p>I was studying at NTU in 2001 after the 8th semester final exam I noticed that my doorstep leading to my hostel room was covered in somekind of mud. I already suspected that it musn't be good since the lady cleaners didn't clean it up I mean they usually clean the hallways daily but I took no action and ignored the dirt on my doorstep.</p>
              <p>1 or two days afterwards while lying on my hostel bed a spirit went past the door leading to my room. It was awfully fast. Though I had been closing my eyes while lying on the bed I could see when the demon entered my room as I saw flashes of it getting past my door in my mind. So I turned around but didn't get up or open my eyes since I feared that it would scare me to see the entity with my eyes. As I didn't rebuke it immeadiately it went inside me. I couldn't feel my body nor could I see anything it was all black and  I heard a man's voice repeating somekind of mantra or name: Olazhong, olazhong, olazhong. I didn't know what to do but because I  am a believer in Christ I cried out from my heart to God. I said "<strong>God  help. This is beyond me</strong>" <strong>As I finished those sentence I was freed and was able to regain consciousness. The demon had fled and left me. </strong></p>

              <p>What do you mean down in spirit? If you care to explain perhaps I would ask him the next time I see him. He's a kind of celebrity these days. I just hope he still got the purity to be humble. And he's not my Benjamin LOL I just saw him a couple of times during Charismatic gatherings. He was the speaker at those events.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you mean feeling like helpless? Weak in faith? well as far as I know those people who were possesed and couldn't cast the demon themselves say something about the state of their spirit and faith. Nonetheless demon still be casted out from them. It's not about the poor victim and the demon it's about God and the demon in the first place.</p>
              <p>I've also read in a Christian testimony book that this group of Korean people gathered to worship, heal the sick and cast out demons and there was a man with a demon inside him which refused to be casted out after a whole day of people praying for him(it even taunted the people who were praying saying it couldn't be casted out). In the end the leader gave up and said God we give up there's nothing we can do. At that instant the demon started to shake the man's body in agony and finally fled. So I conclude it's not about the possesed and the demon or even the caster and the demon but ultimately it's about God and the demon.</p>

              <p>thanks for your reply.   I am not referring to possess of unclean spirit in the human body, i am talking about certain unclean spirit will go harass the same person whenever this person is down in his spirit, depressed.    Can the pastor help to cast out such spirit? I remember my ex pastor told me that when one is down he or she is indirectly opening himself or herself to these unclean spirit. </p>

              <p>Yes it's illogical why they would targeted me but I've learned that to some people thay just do what they want to do to satisfy their desire.</p>
              <p>A Character expert wouldn't know what a person is thinking at the moment or what he is feeling. But for the majority of course they would tend not to believe it and I'm not forcing upon you to believe that mind reading is  possible. You may of course believe anything that suits you.

              <p>Wah being harassed by unclean spirit? Dead people can harass us? I've never encounterd such experience. Next time the unclean spirit shows up rebuke it, challenge or taunt it if necessary, then rebuke it in God's name. It is as EASY as 1,2,3 well it is easy as long as you don't rely on your own strength the more u realize that you're weak the stronger you are in God. So my suggestion is don't be a pacifist when dealing with unclean spirits. Inaction means allowing it to go further which is stupid. They are dead and should not pose a problem. Like I said next time it bugs someone rebuke it. Don't be afraid of dead evil people hahahahahhaha. This world belongs to us the living until our time to go in peace.</p>
              <p>If I may ask in what way are the unclean spirit harass the person? Sounds like a preliminary step before possesion or the early stage of it. Don't use logic when dealing with these kind of things. I don't see why the pastor not able to cast out such spirit whether harrasment or possesion. You know in case of hauntings sprinkle holy water(blesssed water) on doors and windows and the spirit would not be able to enter the room. This is a testimony from my sister in law she always carries blessed water until this day. So why didn't it enter through the walls or the floor? Because the act of sprinkling holy water is a symbol of asking for God's protection which I guess a prayer of protection would do just as the same. The cry from the bottom of your heart is a trillion times stronger than a mere shout at the top of your voice.</p>

              1 more important thing
              
              I personally don't think they have such mind reading services
              
              If have the GIC related companies would not lost so much money if they can read the minds of CEOs of every company world wide
              
              If they have such services they already making profits instead of heavy losses
