            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by casino_king:</div><div class="quote_body">You are under no compulsion... a God that has to compel you, what sort of God is that? A God that has to threaten you? A God that has to make you promises? Do you think that you are God. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>'Compulsion'? As if you mean of if a compulsion that is of a ravaged will where we are but robots, then certainly it's not that kind of compulsion and I woudl agree wholeheartedly with you... it is a sort of a compulsion that you would criticize a certain organization of having, and oddly enough also want us to resist.<br><br>If you suppose that a compulsion that comes of knowing that God demands certain things, but yet gives us a freedom to choose if we should be compelled to do these things or not, then yes, that is a compulsion. But I would not like to mistake this kind of freedom given as an assumption that this kind of God has no demands of humanity whatsoever... if that was the case then there would be no 'right' or 'wrong' to fight over at all.<br><br>And for a moment I do not think that God <span style="font-style: italic;">has</span> to make us promises, but yet He does that for some curious reason. Not for a moment do I actually think we deserve existence or freedom for that matter, but yet we are here.<br><br>The thing is this: As you have observed there are some people who indeed have this frame of mind where meaningful existence and freedom are just personal concepts created by human minds to pacify a meaingless existence. These people then have no guilt or any sort of suppressing or oppressing the weak and poor as by and justification all justifications are personal and subjective, and that the only real thing that is worth listening to, and moves things is power. The strong can oppress the weak because the weak don't have any right to begin with... all rights are personal opinions. To them there is no such thing as fairness, and it's the strongest that survive.<br><br>If you want to fight such a notion, you must then champion a kind of law that holds absolute over the strong or the weak, that all must listen to regardless of their position or opinion. And this kind of thing must be held above and beyond human ability to change, and is the judge of all human activity. Like gravity that affects both the strong and weak... this right and wrong has plenty of things to say about the validity of an individual's actions against the weak, even if he seems for the moment to have nothing to resist him, eventually he must be made to realize that his force is not the law.<br><br>Anyway I am with you in opposing the oppression of the weak and poor... but I would like to know why I want to oppose unfairness at all.<br></div>

The apes stayed the way they are because, brute force wins all the time. Humans because they can talk, they gang up on the big bullies and that allowed the "Good and Honorable" rather than Brutish to survive. If we see oppressive behavior and we don't "gang" up to oppose it, well what can I say? We are no better than the apes. <strong>666</strong> The winning score.</div>

Where nonsense becomes "common sense" because the authorities say so?<br><br>This is why intellectuals write books and participate in forums. This help people see that what they take as "common sense" was "sold" to them.<br><br>With regards from a religious point of view and speaking from what I understand is as Christian perspective; Faith in God is righteousness. This would imply a walk with God so closely that you hear God speaks to you.<br><br>Well you have to experience it to understand it.<br><br>I can attempt to help you have a glipse of what the relationship with God is like. When you fall in love, you "get" married to that person. If you remind that  person getting married means sacrifice; he/she will still wants it. If you tell hat person he/she will not gain anything out of it; he/she still wants it.<br><br>This is an over simplification but like I said you need to be in 2 way communication with God to understand it.</div>
