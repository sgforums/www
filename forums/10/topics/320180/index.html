              <p>Some of you might remember some years ago an NUS lecturer by the nickname of Kelvin has once posted in one of the forums, about a certain secretive government stratagem to depolicise the population co-opt intellectuals with offer of sinecure positions to get them out of politics and setting up of grass root machineries to control the masses.</p>
              <p>Town council is one such machinery created for the political control purpose. TC is just an extraneous big-titled meganomaniac organisation with no particular practical functions except to politicise the populations to serve as feeder or grassroot for control purpose. Ex-PM GCT has actually attempted to depolitisation the people by trying to threaten intellectuals like Dr. Catherine Lim not to be outspoken or exceed the OB marker,
              unless she joins or form a political party to do so. Newspapers journalists were prohibited from crusading for any particular views or issues. Laws were passed to criminalise public gathering and assembly. Civil defamation suits were turned into instruments to fix politicians of threat to the party. Intellectuals of certain appeals were co-opted (e.g. Ho Kwon Peng, Tommy Koh, David
              Marshal etc) with offers of sinecure positions to neutralise them while machineries  (Town council, RC, CCC etc) to control the masses to get to serve the party's own hidden agendas.<br> <br> With such maneurve and shinanigans, people are by and large depoliticised and neutralized and devoid of any active political thinking with active independent thinkers converted to be part of the government camp. We are now the result of such long-term brainwashing, co-option and machinations of the whole population.</p>
              <p>That is what RC, CCC, PA, Town Council, CDC are all about - to bond the masses to
              serve their own political agendas or purposes.<br> <br> Town councils are not created to serve the people's needs or wellbeing but set up for political
              purposes to serve the hidden machinations of the ruling party.</p>
              <p>It took over the
              service and conservancy collections formerly paid to HDB to do the same
              maintenance and upkeep of estates without realizing any particular
              benefits to the residents over and above what HDB could have done.<br> <br> For a small country there is no need for so many mayors who will be merely duplicating the functions of the MPs of which we have also over-provided with little or no value-adding functions like solving problems faced by the poor and middle class.</p>
              <p>With half the number of MPs who are independent minded and doing away with alll the look-good Mayors we will be saving billions which can go towards lowering the rising costs of living or paving for retirements of people.</p>
              <p>Such stratagem has served to stifle the growth of alternative political talents. The current GRC system has deprived such growth while Town
              council, RC, CCC, are part and parcial of machinations are placing a large obstacle to the further growth and development of a more healthy political evolution to serve our needs.<br> <br> Unless and until citizens can see through all such political control strategem which was created to entrench the ruling party perpetually ti cling on to power we will all
              by controlled by many layers of machinations, depolitization and
              co-option we will only face natural death as a rising democracy in Asia instead of one capable of self-sustaining progress and renewal.</p>

              <p>Best way to "politicise" people is to have widespread discontentment against the government. However that is not something I'm looking forward to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In my opinion there are a few kind kind of voters in Singapore.</p>
              <p>1) Discontented, votes for opposition no matter who.</p>
              <p>2) Discontented, spoils their vote because they don't like the opposition as well.</p>
              <p>3) Discontented, votes for PAP because they listen to fellow discontented Singaporeans who are full of conspiracy theories ( won't get flats of choice, get sacked from civil service etc).</p>
              <p>4) Contented, Votes for PAP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No.4 is a lost cause. What the opposition needs to do is to sway votes from No.2,3. The number of votes can be quite substantial. SDP is a lost cause. I can go on forever about why it is that case but lets not go there for now. WP is doing some good work. Even though they do not have the manpower to draft policies, formulate strategies etc, they are capitalising on brains from the  public.</p>
              <p>Problem is, people in SBF are condemning them. People in SGF are more interested in talking about a lost cause and criticising the PAP than to talk about WP. Mind you, WP is the one who has an SMC in the Bag and almost won a GRC. Today Gopalan Nair, a blogger generates more interest than Workers party.</p>
              <p>How do you expect votes to sway if that is the case. Instead of propagating what SDP and Gopalan Nair has to say, why not propagate what WP has to say ? Instead of chasing a lost cause why not throw your weight behind WP, a party with an SMC and who almost won a GRC. Intead of saying PAP is fucked up, LKY must die why not have good things to say about WP instead ? Why should i vote for the opposition because PAP is fucked up ? Why can't I vote for the opposition because they are better ?</p>

              <p>The political situation now is fluid. LTK is able to capitalise on the internet to make headway for WP.
