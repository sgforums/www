My questions were left un-answered, everything turned into singaporeans should work harder to drive up GDP.  he doesnt even understand what is GDP.</p>

              <p><br>haha, jammed yourself...who are the specific Singaporeans? you  can only name them if you know them, the people you know do not represent Singaporean as a whole.</p>
              <p>There is little difference between Singaporean, American, Australian...where immigrants of different ethnicities made up the society. The differences are the same, the good, the bad, the ugly, the hardworking, the lazy, the nice and decent, the assholes,.......</p>
              <p>The original values that come with certain culture, like hardworking and thrifty generally found among indian and chinese, graciousness generally found among the malay, are gradually diminishing, with greater impact and influence from materialism and globalization. What is more important is that the driving forces to work hard are different.</p>
              <p>I tell you the china guys from the small villages studying in NUS sure work much much harder than the singaporean who use iphone as toys.</p>
              <p>But there are many poor singaporean who work very hard to make ends meet, to support the aging parents, those you don't see and therefore cannot them them one by one, but they are around. These are the people the young and afluent singaporean, whether pro or anti PAP, should know.</p>

              <p>Now who cares about how much PAP score dude ? I dont want them to score at all if that is possible .</p>
              <p>The lazy ones refer to those singaporean who are lazy . simple as that . why do you all think those foreigners are such a big problem for some of us in term of job availability .</p>
              <p>because they are cheap ? on that ground to those who agree to it are dumb . just because they are cheap and they beat us so severely ? singaporean wants quality . it is the same when applied to products they buy . clothes they wear . perfume they wear and all . employees they hired . things they need to spend money at .</p>
              <p>Now when we talk about 'employee' or 'job' there are different categories . like there are jobs such as maids, driver, sewer cleaner . and there are also jobs such as marketting, sales, human resources, public relation officer or manager, director, clerk, lawyer, doctor et cetera .</p>
              <p>a good doctor working in national hospital does not need to worry about competition from doctor with so so performance (disregard of the latter being local or FT)</p>
              <p>a good doctor working in national hospital only worry about competition from other good doctor who are in the same field as he is (disregard of the latter being local or FT) why ?</p>
              <p>a good sales who sells and topped the required selling points do not need to worry about competition from other sales who do not even meet their selling point at all (disregard of the latter being local or FT)</p>
              <p>a good sales only worry about competition from other sales who are performing at top speed as he is . why ? because if he is good and got reputation among customers he cannot be replaced so easily . and if he got replaced the job would be for someone better than him or he got a beef with upper management . and it is not hard for him to get another job with his skills .</p>
              <p>Unless we are talking about competing for jobs like sewer cleaning or maids, driver and such . I think most of the jobs that require skills is out there for fair competition .</p>
              <p>the same basically goes to most of the job position available . now the question is are we up to for it ? can we as marketting perform so well above average to be in that zone ? can we as sales sell so succesfully that even other company is trying to snatch us away to work for them with higher pay ? can we ? and have we tried ? or are we just living life as everyday mundane routinity and then come home at evening to complain about how we hate to see so much FT in the bus or mrt nowadays .</p>

              <p><br>Our living standard is alright . and is above average compared to almost all of the asian coutnries . it is natural for countries that develop quickly to have competition sent right at them so swiftly too . a successful government means successful country . successful country means honey&amp;milk land for imigrants . immigrants almost always means competition for locals from certain classes . competition almost always means endless complaints, blaming, finger pointing, black-sheep creation in order to draw a common sense for other people from the same affected classes to unite and point their fingers at the same direction .</p>
              <p>The truth is . our living standard is heavenly . try to compare our mrt and transportation systems with what they have in Vietnam, Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand et cetera .</p>
              <p>And it is true that when country develop so quick with the help of successful government system . with all the infrastructures supporting our life . shopping malls . first class entertaiments . first class cinemas . first class cafe . credit cards . master cards . we all tend to want too much . we are naturally greedy . we want this and we want that . next week we want this and this weekend we want that . we forgot to upgrade and better ourselves . for us everything is good and possible . and when FT came in and ruin that image because suddenly we see them in the same train as us or in the same shopping mall we suddenly feel lost of something and we dont want them to be near us . we dont want to be compared to them . but no choice . they are so good or so cheap to the point that we even admit that they are a threat for our jobs . Why ? are u so sure with your good skill . good degree . good performance that you will be replaced by cheap but no brain FT ? or are they actually cheap and brainy ?</p>
