              <p>The fact is that with this mentality , we opened our door to allow the thief to come and steal from the oridinary folks who work so far to defend what we have nurture for years. So welcome, Indian, Pinoy, because our PM say so.</p>

              <p><br> In fact yes he was malaysian before he became singaporean . like

              <p>O_O But GDP is the frontier that makes us lasts . that makes us
              one of the first among the equals . recoqnized by the world and not
              crushed during crisis . that built the MRT and all
              the primary, secondary and tertiary infrastructures
              needed to sustain our sinagporean de life .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who say there arent FT whom are better than the locals ? I see a
              lot . it depends on where you look . if you are MRT user sure u
              will see lotsa FT in the MRT . I myself drive and I see a lot of FT
              drive their own car too . some cars u wont believe is even out in
              Singapore yet .</p>
              <p>My point is there are different levels with FT too just like us
              locals . some of them use MRT &amp; buses . some of them got
              private cars . some of them got private cars with drivers
              . some of them got private jets . believe me when I tell you
              these .</p>
              <p>So is it our problem that their son get bullied
              by friends in school because they are not
              locals ? No . is it their problem that they are more
              successful than us ? the answer is also No .</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">For those abusing the system or
              bullying or dirty . those are different level FT which Singapore
              need in order to fill the undesired or low rated jobs like cleaning
              service et cetera . so that singaporean sons and daughters can
              concentrate and focus in service and trade et cetera . which is
              good . it all goes back to us whether we are up to the competing
              standard or can only suck thumb .</span></p>

              <p>Your reply is so full of <em>shit</em> . literally .</p>
              <p><br> If you see Singapore as an arena . then fight .</p>
              <p><em>Shitting</em> in online forums like you do is not gonna
              change your life or whatsoever it is that you are so unhappy about
              . whilst <em>shitting</em> here those lower level FT are working
              their asses off like dogs . some even 20 hours a day . whilst
              for us just another extra hour in our 40 hours a week schedule is
              so much of a <em>shitty</em> burden . it's true . but in
              order to survive since they know they are not worthy of anything .
              that's why they are able to clean toilets, clean septic tanks and
              all those <em>shitty</em> job you wont even touch . and when you
              have nothing else to lose you will do just anything possible to
              fight and survive . When we cannot go for clubbing on saturday
              night because our boss asked us to do a lot of extra works we
              probably rant here and there as if the sky gonna fall on our heads
              but the FT would happily do extra hours and whatever else is
              required in order to get extra money . another addition of 30 bucks
              in exchange of weekend fun probably mean nothing to us and I can
              guarantee most of us would better have relaxing weekend than to
              work but for that 30 bucks they are willing to exchange every
              weekend they could possibly exchange . now that is getting an edge
              for yourself and fighting for your life . doesnt require a talent
              to do such thing but dont blame the world that bosses and employers
              like such service . and who could really blame them
              that due to such performances some of them could possibly
              rise faster than we all imagined ?</p>
              <p>Those are about lower level FT . can you fight ? How about
              Higher level FT who hold similar position such as a manager or
              supervisor or even CEO  or CFO ? Let me tell you things arent
              so much of a different up there . I am also in managing position
              and I have all these competition up my sleeve . I now have to put
              in extra efforts during work and cannot surf facebook and chat
              anymore during work time which I could still do last time and the
              reason is because whenever I move my focus away from my work to
              social network pages I couldnt instantly relate or focus back to my
              work when I close firefox . and that affect my work efficiency
              because those FT who are also in the same managing position as
              myself keep going and they never lose focus to such things . they
              are here to win or die . that's why nowadays I
              strictly limit myself to forums and other social webbie only
              after work and at home . now some people are complaining
              about this because they cannot manage their priority . of course
              the rest of the world is unhappy about this since with the
              appearance of FT simply stiffen up the competition . no more
              slacking in office et cetera . But yeah . work like a dog .
              live like a king . dont like it . fight better .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Come to think of it . Singapore culture has always been about
              competition even before the FT came in . without them we  were
              cursing at other singaporean who strive better . when Malaysian
              came in we curse those malaysian who strive better . the same case
              when Suddenly Filipino came surging in . now THE WORLD
              came in . and guess who we are cursing now . surprised ? No .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>we were warned . 2010 . AFTA . Free trade is on dude . get on
              with the game . or be like old men who curse until they aged

              <p>If we are to call ourselves a first world country, then we
              shouldn't still have people making less than $7/hr. (I based that
              on the average price of fastfood meal).</p>
              <p>its a disgrace, when you see on tv programmes such as
              "Undercover Boss", an American cleaner is finding that her
              USD$14/hr is not enough, while here we are paying cleaners
              $500-600/month.</p>
              <p><strong>You would be surprised to know that <span style="color: #ff0000;">majority</span> of the people in US are living
              with heavy mortgage . and US is not a first world country ?
              unfortunately "first-world-country" is not measure by that . it is
              more of the Infrastructure, the Economy state of the country as a
              whole, GDP, et cetera . it was never individual .</strong></p>
              <p>and why should such low-paying jobs even exists in Singapore?
              Yes, i understand that some pay is better than no pay. but i
              believe that our salary should also be able to sustain a basic
              level of living.</p>
              <p><strong>Because we dont have robots to our clean septic
              tanks yet . rhetorical .</strong></p>
              <p>Most local workers in these extremely low-paying jobs come from
              the elderly population, where they do not have much financial
              commitment. i.e. their houses are fully paid for/ living with
              children, and they only have to pay for food and utility etc.</p>
              <p>but, what about people who still have heavy financial burden on
              their backs? People who still need to pay off their housing
              mortgages/ rental? Thanks to the rise in HDB prices and the
              popularity of 30yr housing loans, most people fall into this
              category.</p>
              <p>Based on market rental price, the rent for a bedroom is around
              $500/month.</p>
              <p><strong>Look for a better job . everything starts from our
              education . nowadays parents are planning very hard for their
              children because good parents know how hard it is for their child
              to survive when he grew up later on . some even started teaching
              them lessons when they are still inside the womb thru music and
              stuff . imagine . competition starts ever since they were being
              conceived by their parents .</strong></p>
              <p>thus, it is financially <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>impossible</em></strong></span> <em>for an average person to survive on a pay of less than $800
              take-home a month on a permanent basis, without dipping into his
              savings.<br></em></p>
              <p>exceptions: unless you are willing to live in a workers dorm for
              the rest of your life, living a really spartan existence.</p>
              <p>The FWs who come to spore to work, only have to endure a few
              years of hardship, and after that, they will head back for a better
              life in their hometown. But for singaporeans, there is no other
              hometowns to return to, so the suffering will be for forever.
              Hence, obviously, this form of job creation is unsustainable.</p>
              <p><strong>Most of them also stay . and become permanent residents

              <p><br> Hmmm . I can see your point . I was once like that . but
                  it was a phase . we all get thru it .</p>
              <p>I do make a very clear line between personal feelings and
                  business . if you run your own business and you operate solely on
                  soul or compassion . u will lose your money .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>I see it in a rather different way . for instance
                  imagine you have a 'good' that you know should worth S$500
                  and a man came and offer S$800 for it and
                  <span style="color: #ff0000;">told</span> you it is a
                  collector's item . and then a granny came and told you
                  <span style="color: #ff0000;">her grandson wanted it</span> for so
                  long and offer you S$450 for it . who would you be selling the
                  'good' for ?</strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would dismiss the granny politely and bid that 'collector's
                  item' dude <strong>S$1.200</strong> . take it or leave it . why ?
                  because now I see that the perceived value of the 'good' is
                  more than expected .</p>

              <p>Theres is a reason why we call this place home and our country. <br> If everything is about survival of the fittest most likely you wouldnt survived.</p>
              <p>Can you describe to me whats home and country.</p>
              <p>Why do we have laws?<br> <br> why not remove the law. if you get clobbered to death, if yours own problem of being beh kan.<br> <br> let's start hunting each other down then.<br> <br> if you fail to acquire arms, its your problem.<br> <br> if you fail to stop someone from sniping you, its your problem<br> <br> etc etc<br> <br> <br> see man are so quick to quote survival of the fittest when talking abt meritocracy.<br> <br> <br> but so quick to use the law when it comes to the real thing.</p>

              <p>1. if Foreigners weren't in singapore singapore would have heaps of poor people or heaps of people in jail</p>
              <p>2. if we werent here singapore would of been run to the ground singapore cant live without Foreigners because they the ones who are bringing all the money in and they the ones who are building all your malls like if i wasn't here also mbs wouldn't be up and running like it is now</p>
              <p>3. singaporeans race is mostly chinese and malay mixed</p>
              <p>4.everyone is a Foreigner to singapore because singapore doesnt even have its own real race</p>
              <p>5.my own real race is maori and english<br>and mbs is the only good looking building in singapore but crap inside sadly hahahaha i got here to late when it started flooding because these dumb *****s dont know anything about building</p>

              <p>I hope this is not representative of the view of government. Do the bossess and the sewer cleaners living in different world? No, they live in the same world and providing services to one another.</p>
              <p>The lowliest rank in society is not necessarily defined by what job they do, or how much they earn, but by what they contribute to the society. The social workers, the nurses, the bus drivers....they bring more joy and happiness to more people they serve everyday. Call me idealistic, hmmm...but that happen in the world we live in.</p>
              <p>Those who think they don't shit are actually full of shit in their head. and  whose sole interest in life is to make money will not be missed if they drawn in the drain tomorrow. The sad thing is that they can't bring money with them.</p>
