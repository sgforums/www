              <p><br>So are all the students, enterpreneurs, managers and teachers you can find in Singapore . everyone is doing their part defending this country . even FT . but not in traditional sense that everyone gotta handle a gun in order to be called "defending country" .</p>
              <p>A lot actually settled in Singapore . trust me much more will when they reached the living standard they wanted which they cant find back home . they will . and what say you when they become citizen and hold our pink card too ? many Singaporeans also go overseas to study . london US germany dubai hongkong taiwan et cetera . and a lot of them are not returning home as well . this is what is happening global . people are moving and going towards better life . fight your own if you want a taste of some . if you are already happy with your condition and do not see the reason to fight . dont complaint so much about how others are fighting to get an edge for themselves .</p>

              <p>You are saying "Singapore GDP Growth is not driven by new business ideas and Increased work efficiency" . buy some books and read .</p>
              <p>not happy that it seems to be only benefitting the elites and corporations ? fight to be one of the elites . simple .</p>
              <p>But the truth is . GDP growth does affect all singaporeans . it contributed for all the primary, secondary and tertiary infrastructures we have too . including our MRT and market price .</p>
              <p>Some FT has class . majority dont . lets just say that is just the way it should be . there are more common graduates than cum laude graduate . if all the FT who came in are selected from the 'elites group' in their homeland and you do not import the lower class FT then you will see all the manager, supervisor, CEO, CFO, directors position disappear from our singaporean grasp .</p>
              <p>by that time . imagine . would you not be here complaining about that instead ?</p>
              <p>My point is . fight . do not complain . if you see them that good . you die die fight to surpass them . if you see them no good . then you have nothing to complain .</p>

               all the animals, strongest one survives. The king just sits there high 
              up in the shade, with people feeding him grapes. You lose the fight you die. Its survival of the fittest</p>

              <p>But the truth is . GDP growth does affect all singaporeans . it
              contributed for all the primary, secondary and tertiary

              .</p>

              corporations. And you just agreed with me, majority of the FT are really crap standard. Why so do i even need to compete with crappy people, and i lose out,  they are cheaper than me</p>

              <p>The vietnamese engineer that the boss juz hired sucks, his english is so

              little things oso need a local sigaporean to translate for him and 
              spoon-feed him...<br> <br> why he got hired ?? becoz he is cheaper compared to hiring a fresh grad 
              out of NTU or NUS....this guy have a 1 yr degree from oxford brookes and
               is asking for 2K with the foreigner levy deducted from his pay monthly 
              whereas sigaporean grads are asking for 2.5k to 2.8K, and the boss still have
               to top-up 15.5% more into the sinkie CPF monthly if  employed... <br> <br> any tom, dick or harry from any crap countries can come here to find 
              work easily and alot of them actually get employed in low-level or PMET 
              level jobs easily becoz of there is a huge demand for cheap labour from 
              the employers here in S'pore and the gahmen is happily obliging them. We
               are no different from a prositute <br> <br> End of the day you have to ask our gahmen and NTUC why are they not 
              protecting local sinkies with minimum wages and etc and why are they not
               doing proper QC for the FTs who alot of them have fake degrees or 
              certificates but still can find job easily in S'pore...<br> <br> my problem is alot of so called FTs are also as behkan or even more 
              behkan then local sinkies but then the only reason they got employed is 
              becoz they are cheaper but they can afford to be cheap becoz they are 
              alone here in S'pore without their family.<br> <br> why foreigners behkan our pappies still say they are talents while 
              sinkies are not talents at all even though they might be more capable 
              then the foreigners ?</p>
              <p>I am a Singaporean, yet my Gov is supporting FT to complete with me.<br> <br> Give you another example;<br> I hv experience &amp; skilled. But I live here with family to support. <br> Everything is in SGD.<br> <br> FT hv experience &amp; skilled, but SGD converts back to their currency, they can well demand a much lower pay than me. A Uni grad with a bombay degree can ask for a lower pay than me can he ? Yes of course. But for me ? Everything is in SGD, is it fair ?</p>
              <p>Majority of singaporeans are asking not for free lunches but rather a truly fair competition.</p>

              <p>So did you just agree with me its only benefitting the elites and corporations. And you just agreed with me, majority of the FT are really crap standard. Why so do i even need to compete with crappy people, and i lose out,  they are cheaper than me</p>

              <p>From your bolded point. It looks like you dont understand the real situation that is happening now. You are not a decision maker yet. Perhaps you are a elite, i dont blame that.</p>
              <p>Its not about me being as efficient. Its about cost. Back to profit. its <strong>SGD</strong></p>
              <p>The vietnamese engineer that the boss juz hired sucks, his english is so power that people don't understand what is he talking about and  every little things oso need a local sigaporean to translate for him and spoon-feed him...<br><br>why he got hired ?? becoz he is cheaper compared to hiring a fresh grad out of NTU or NUS....this guy have a 1 yr degree from oxford brookes and is asking for 2K with the foreigner levy deducted from his pay monthly whereas sigaporean grads are asking for 2.5k to 2.8K, and the boss still have to top-up 15.5% more into the sinkie CPF monthly if  employed...<br><br>any tom, dick or harry from any crap countries can come here to find work easily and alot of them actually get employed in low-level or PMET level jobs easily becoz of there is a huge demand for cheap labour from the employers here in S'pore and the gahmen is happily obliging them. We are no different from a prositute<br><br>End of the day you have to ask our gahmen and NTUC why are they not protecting local sinkies with minimum wages and etc and why are they not doing proper QC for the FTs who alot of them have fake degrees or certificates but still can find job easily in S'pore...<br><br>my problem is alot of so called FTs are also as behkan or even more behkan then local sinkies but then the only reason they got employed is becoz they are cheaper but they can afford to be cheap becoz they are alone here in S'pore without their family.<br><br>why foreigners behkan our pappies still say they are talents while sinkies are not talents at all even though they might be more capable then the foreigners ?</p>
              <p>I am a Singaporean, yet my Gov is supporting FT to complete with me.<br><br> Give you another example;<br>I hv experience &amp; skilled. But I live here with family to support.<br>Everything is in SGD.<br><br>FT hv experience &amp; skilled, but SGD converts back to their currency, they can well demand a much lower pay than me. A Uni grad with a bombay degree can ask for a lower pay than me can he ? Yes of course. But for me ? Everything is in SGD, is it fair ?</p>
              <p>Majority of singaporeans are asking not for free lunches but rather a truly fair competition.</p>

              <p><br>So when they receive their monthly salary and they go to seven eleven to buy a snack the counter at 7-11 convert to rupee or ringgit for them issit ? are the not spending their 'lower' monthly salary in singapore also ???</p>

              <p>All I can say is those FT who get their job . if you think you can fight better than them . go make them unemployed . you are from first world country . this is your homeland . they are from third world countries . this is not their homeland . you have every winning points and every reason to win the competition . if you still cannot get an edge for yourself do not blame others . you have nothing to complain . they reach singapore they dont even know about how their fate will end . all they know is they want a better living standard .</p>

              <p>Go open social non-profit foundation . sad but true this is how the world works . do not be drama queen and be all tears and gas this is the real world . what happen to all the sperms that cannot make it ? flushed out .</p>
              <p>Singapore is better . you cannot make it they got encouragement classes for you to take . free of charge . they got counselling for the unemployed . they got job fair for the unemployed . while at the same time counselling for these people the industry do not wait and they need efficient and hardworking workforce . so whatever pass the standard and is available would be taken into consideration . like you said , each of us have our place in this society . the difference from ants is they are born with their status ingrained in them . they cannot help it . they cannot fight to rise in ranks . we can . </p>
