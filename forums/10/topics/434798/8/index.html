              <p>Singapore is better . you cannot make it they got encouragement

              the industry do not wait and they need efficient and
              hardworking workforce . so whatever pass the standard and is
              available would be taken into consideration . like you

              difference from ants is they are born with their status ingrained

              <p>OMG. I really wonder why do you keep insisting that we are not fighting. majority of sinkies are asking not for
                                      free lunches but rather a truly fair competition<br> <br> <br> and the difference in exchange rates between
                                      india/china/indonesia/philippines etc etc etc just doesn't provide
                                      for that.</p>
              <p>Whats there to fight when Its not even fair in the first place. <strong>WTF are you even serious ?</strong> Why do we need to fight with FT when our own citizens are at a 
              handicap. Btw you still dint answer my NS question. </p>
              <p>You dint get 
              my point in the ants argument. You obviously do not know how a country 
              works. Not everyone can be managers or bosses in a country. There has to
               be someone doing toilet work. Yet they are still your citizens, You 
              dont force them out and replace them with other people.</p>
              <p>Comming 
              back to the Family question i asked. What if you fall below the 
              expectations of your parents. Do they kick you out or replace you out ? 
              No right ? So how can a country we call home do this to their own people
               ? So if you are a singapore male why do you need to defend the country 
              you call home ?</p>

              <p>You can always continue tomorrow if you are tired.</p>
              <p>I think you need to get off your elite chair. You need to bring this argument into a more peasant type of argument. Not everyone is a high flyer earn 10k a month and you are missing the points i mentioned again.</p>
              <p>While i gave practical examples on the current situation and on exchange rate affecting the situation. You did not give yours and just dismissed it  that is ''ridiculous and unprofessional'' I seriously doubt you even understand my argument in the first place. Considering you are in the dark of how companys select people. Not according to talent mind you.</p>
              <p>I gave the example on why US EU construction workers are not comming to sg to be construction workers, but china india vietnam and many more. You told me they are here to own. LOL <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Own what ? Own the best construction worker award ? Own to build faster buildings ?  I am laughing now. I think you need a break to think about my points. There are more points i did not cover, enough to bring this thread to page 20.</p>

              <p>2. if we werent here singapore would of been run to the ground singapore cant live without Foreigners because they the ones who are bringing all the money in and they the ones who are building all your malls like if i wasn't here also mbs wouldn't be up and running like it is now</p>
              <p>3. singaporeans race is mostly chinese and malay mixed</p>
              <p>4.everyone is a Foreigner to singapore because singapore doesnt even have its own real race</p>

              <p>The Government allow FT to work here and provide them the possibility to be permanent citizen . there are 5 kind of FTs . as follow :</p>
              <p>01. Those who come here and look for job . BUT they cannot just come in and look for job . they need to be on social visit pass which last only for 2 weeks and during the two weeks if they fail to land a job . which means nobody want to hire them . they would be deported back to their homeland . so it all goes back to our local companies .</p>
              <p>02 . Those who came here to study . and after they graduated they will look for job and in 30 days time if they cannot find a job they would be deported back to their homeland .</p>
              <p>03 . Those Who came here due to scholarship or tuition grant from singapore government . they would graduate and they will be booked by companies before they even graduate . althou if they sidetrack and did not reached the needed requirements in their studies they would be deported back to their homeland too without finishing their studies .</p>
              <p>04 . Those who do not even come to singapore but are invited by our local companies to work in Singapore due to their outstanding qualification . usually they will hold strategic posts such as manager or ceo .</p>
              <p>05 . Those who are dirty rich like Indonesian or Hongkong people et cetera who come here to invest in property market or acquire companies or establish company or whatsoever . do you know 48% of private property in Singapore are <strong>owned</strong> by Indonesian Developer ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think most of the complaints go to FT number 01 . because for number 02 - 05 they are considered to be upper class FTs who are damn rich or at least educated . and for the FT number 01 . who could blame them that during their 2 weeks visit to singapore on social visit pass our local companies want to hire them ?</p>

              <p>I am also a foreigner but not a talent.  I found most singaporean don't understand sometimes a foreigner complaint about singaporean is just because they ran into obstacles and being frustrated.  I do not think they are really feeling so unhappy to live here. Unfortunately, most singaporean don't really care.  Everytime I needed people to listening to my problem, they don't even bother to listen nor giving me any advices.  Native english speaker does enjoy a very different experience here.  I know its quite difficult to favor immigrants from china or other poor and nor english speaking countries.  But its just being very cruel to treat people like that.  On the other hand, once they know my background is not that poor, they totally change their attitude towards me.  You know, they asked me out every weekend and doing a lot of good things to me.   My poor comment of english does not matter anymore.</p>

              <p>The connection is Not everyone is a high flyer. Do you understand ? You earn a lot, that does not mean everyone earns a lot too. You are fortunate, that does not mean everyone is. </p>
              <p><strong>01. </strong>I suppose this group you meant are the lowly educated ones. FT who come here to jobs that require not much education. Looking at how you describe group 01, i doubt you even understand the real situation. What are the chances that these group of people failing to find a job ? In fact most, or all find jobs. They just need to be cheaper than SG people to get employed. Since you like to talk about profits. Lets say you are a boss. A SG guy demanding 800 dollars for a construction worker job, A FT china demanding only 600. Who will you choose ?</p>
              <p>The FT chinese can afford to undercut the SG guy by a margin cause converting his salary back to RMB, its still better than working in china. But can the SG guy undercut himself, where everything is in Sing dollars ?</p>
              <p><strong>02-03</strong>. I suppose you mean FT studying here. Do you read the straits times ? not long ago theres this parent complaining his son didnt get the placing in NUS. He is also mad about the number of FT in local unis snatching singaporean sons placing. These people come to SG with their bombay degree and got themselves admitted to NUS, while local boys undergoing through 2 years of NS got rejected. HE questioned NUS on the admission criteria of FT.</p>
              <p>NUS replied theres no standard set of requirement. But NUS assured that the requirement is as stringent as local requirement. How would you feel if you are a local parent ? <strong>Owned </strong></p>
              <p>Scholarship or tuition grant. I wonder how much you know of this before talking. Do youknow the requirements in the first place ? Whats the reason of awarding to the FT instead of the local boys ?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">There would be 2 point of views . <strong>for job that doesnt require much brain I will qualify based on asked salary .</strong> in this case it is construction worker job . construction job doesnt require much brain so I will qualify and choose based on lowest salary then I will go on to consider about other points in both resume/portfolio . <strong>while for jobs that require more brains like marketting or sales I would of course consider about education qualification</strong> and then I will go on to consider about the asked salary . see the difference ? for construction jobs I will probably get the china guy to do it but I reserve the marketting and sales position (which is more substantial than construction job) to those with better education and communication skills (which also means if you are comparing a singaporean with people from china, you would already win in communication compared to the other) . do you get what I mean ?</span>  </p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">NUS only admit 4 international students for medical study annually/each year . that is how stringent it gets when we talk about NUS .</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So yeah . the case above . could be that . could be this . quite popular . very clear to me . you know . 'he is foreigner how come better than my son' case .</span></p>
              <p>Scholarship or tuition grant. I wonder how much you know of this before talking. Do youknow the requirements in the first place ? Whats the reason of awarding to the FT instead of the local boys ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes I know . There are local tuition grants and scholarship going on you know . check with the NTU and NUS . I suggest you take up political studies if you are planning to enroll . Every year NUS takes in 4 international students (on scholar ship) for medical study and NUS is ranked world's 20 best uni . that means not only asia but people from all over the world are competing every year to become one of the admitted four international students . only the best of the best were chosen . they are top notch fighter . they dont find job . jobs find them .</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The other one is called tuition grant . tuition grant is less stringent but it is only applied to those studies which is not as popular for instance like arts, IT, commerce et cetera . tuitin grant require you to be top 20 in your school and then they will filter out all the top 20 from all over the world who applied for tuition grants in singapore . they will then decide from there . those on tuition grant  must maintain their grades . once they get three warnings for low grades they are off singapore .</span></p>
              <p><strong>04.</strong> Nothing about this group</p>
              <p><strong>05.</strong> Ahh i will talk about the housing problem here. Before i get started, Do you even know of the housing problem in singapore ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Im a lil bit here and there in property business too . tell me about it .</span></p>

                  understand the real situation. What are the chances that these
                  group of people failing to find a job ? In fact most, or all find
                  jobs. They just need to be cheaper than SG people to get employed.
                  Since you like to talk about profits. Lets say you are a boss. A SG
                  guy demanding 800 dollars for a construction worker job, A FT china
                  demanding only 600. Who will you choose ?</p>
              <p>The FT chinese can afford to undercut the SG guy by a margin
                  cause converting his salary back to RMB, its still better than
                  working in china. But can the SG guy undercut himself, where
                  everything is in Sing dollars ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">There would be 2 point
                  of views . <strong>for job that doesnt require much brain
                  I will qualify based on asked salary .</strong> in this case it is
                  construction worker job . construction job doesnt require
                  much brain so I will qualify and choose based on lowest
                  salary then I will go on to consider about other points in
                  both resume/portfolio . <strong>while for jobs
                  that require more brains like marketting or sales I would of
                  course consider about education qualification</strong> and then I
                  will go on to consider about the asked salary . see the difference
                  ? for construction jobs I will probably get the china guy
                  to do it but I reserve the marketting and sales
                  position (which is more substantial than construction job)
                  to those with better education and communication skills
                  (which also means if you are comparing a singaporean
                  with people from china, you would already win in
                  communication compared to the other) . do you get what I mean
                  ?</span>  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>02-03</strong>. I suppose you mean FT studying here. Do
                  you read the straits times ? not long ago theres this parent
                  complaining his son didnt get the placing in NUS. He is also mad
                  about the number of FT in local unis snatching singaporean sons
                  placing. These people come to SG with their bombay degree and got
                  themselves admitted to NUS, while local boys undergoing through 2
                  years of NS got rejected. HE questioned NUS on the admission
                  criteria of FT.</p>
              <p>NUS replied theres no standard set of requirement. But NUS
                  assured that the requirement is as stringent as local requirement.
                  How would you feel if you are a local parent ?
                  <strong>Owned</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">NUS only admit 4 international
                  students for medical study annually/each year . that is how
                  stringent it gets when we talk about NUS .</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So yeah . the case above . could
                  be that . could be this . quite popular . very clear to me . you
                  know . 'he is foreigner how come better than my son' case
                  .</span></p>
              <p>Scholarship or tuition grant. I wonder how much you know of this
                  before talking. Do youknow the requirements in the first place ?
                  Whats the reason of awarding to the FT instead of the local boys
                  ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes I know . There are local
                  tuition grants and scholarship going on you know . check with the
                  NTU and NUS . I suggest you take up political studies if you are
                  planning to enroll . Every year NUS takes in 4 international
                  students (on scholar ship) for medical study and NUS is ranked
                  world's 20 best uni . that means not only asia but people from all
                  over the world are competing every year to become one of the
                  admitted four international students . only the best of the best
                  were chosen . they are top notch fighter . they dont find job .
                  jobs find them .</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The other one is called tuition
                  grant . tuition grant is less stringent but it is only applied to
                  those studies which is not as popular for
                  instance like arts, IT, commerce et cetera . tuitin
                  grant require you to be top 20 in your school and then they will
                  filter out all the top 20 from all over the world who applied for
                  tuition grants in singapore . they will then decide from there
                  . those on tuition grant  must maintain their grades . once
                  they get three warnings for low grades they are off singapore
                  .</span></p>
              <p><strong>04.</strong> Nothing about this group</p>

              <p>If every boss is like you. But unfortunately, the real situation isnt like this in singapore. Its still cost &gt; everything.</p>
              <p>everyone is replaceable in a organization except for the boss himself who might be replaced too if his company go bust...<br> <br> cost is everything...ya so wat if you have worked in that company 
                  for 20 yrs and have a niche knowledge...let me tell you what the bosses 
                  will do...<br> <br> - they will employ 2 or 3 FTs back and ask them to shadow you and learn 
                  from you and then  you boss will tell u that you are the senior and you 
                  shld show them the ropes and then you can move up the coporate ladder 
                  once u handover all your stuffs, but in reality u will most probably be 
                  retrenched when the next downturn come becoz your salary on the company 
                  payroll is damn high <br> <br> - if u refuse to pass on your knowledge den they can  sack you 
                  and then ask the FTs to learn and figure it out on their own.<br> <br> - even if they don't sack or retrench you, they will try to cut your 
                  salary and bonuses in half or your salary will 4ever remain at that 
                  level with no increments whatsoever becoz of cost-cutting measures 
                  introduced in the economic downturn and you have hit your salary cap <br> <br> By 40 yrs of age, aimed to have your own business and become the boss 
                  yourself or prepared to be replaced be by a younger and cheaper local 
                  sinkie or FTs and go drive a taxi.<br> <br> This is the hard truths of life in S'pore</p>
              <p>02-03. NUS has only one course right ? Ohh okay, very stringent indeed.</p>
              <p>So how to compare ? A indian with a bombay degree, a cheena with a chinese degeree and a SGrean with a polytechnic diploma. Who to choose ?</p>
              <p>Affordable housing. A 800k HDB with your meager salary. And with all the overcrowding here, young singaporeans are deprived of houses. How to have a baby tell me.</p>

              <p>I don't think the government minds who "singaporeans" come to be. If native singaporeans get with their program (ie live and work like FTs), they wouldn't mind. If not, they would rather import more FTs.</p>
              <p>For instance a newspaper commentary was of the opinion that "we should not be beholden to a static construct of a Singaporean identity, but rather embrace a Singaporean identity that is constantly in flux and changing as needs arise.</p>

              <p>You still dont understand the evil cycle do you ? Our birthrate is declining over the years even without FT. What makes you think with the situation so dire now, our birth rate will suddenly shoot up. People are discouraged and unhappy, and obviously things aint going better with the latest being transport fare increase, when smrt and sbs are making millions of profit. Smell a rat ?</p>
              <p>Birth rate. Instead of making singapore a more condusive enviroment for having babies. The government adopted this fast and fail method of attracting hordes of FT.</p>
              <p>Like i said few pages back. Those who prosper good for them, but those who are stuck, you as a government dont kick them out. You dont force your own citizens to a corner. Its a huge mistake seriously. Thats why its 60.1 instead of 75% now. If the govenment doesnt even pay attention to the needs of its own citizens. Why vote for them ? LET them get replaced by FT themselves. (chen shou mao)</p>
