              <p>It is highlighted since day one that singaporeans are not

              <p>Now, singapore is infested with foreigners who are not better
              than the local and some of them are even bullying the local and
              abusing the system.</p>
              <p>I dun think the old man or his lackeys will get the sentiments
              right as long as they are getting fat bonus from importing hoards
              of foreigners into singapore.</p>
              <p>It is very sad for the local on one of local MP going overseas

              <p>If we can attract good foreign talents, the like of those from our neighbouring malaysia, HK, taiwan, japan, germany, britain, korea and some US of A, I do not see any damaged done to the political social impact of Singapore, but if you get Fallen Talents from India, mynamar, bangadesh, china and philipines, that is a total diseaster for the peoples of Singapore. And currently, Singapore govt are just doing that so as to suppress real wage increase. Singaporeans business peoples who employ cheap foreigners are simply digging their future generation graves, their son and daughter or even grand ones will be facing a very competitive wage market.</p>
              <p>This indian who came to my pub office to ask for work as part time washer, he got diploma and degree from the university of chennai, bought at the price of around $1200 sing dollars, he is a PR, isn't that a fallen talent?? he works as a supervisor in a shipyard, 5 days work, so got free time during weekend, he had brought his wife and kids here, so need more money, asked for partime job. My Dad spent 10 of thousand of dollars to get me educated until getting a diploma, if I go University, more hard work and money will have to pump in, I will also need to study very hard, but for $1200, you can buy certificate in india and come here as PR, if I know earlier, I better go india and buy the cert, forget all these years of education.</p>

              <p>In terms of how foreigners can shift their homes to be near work places in order to save time and money and take lower and lower pay, bring their own countrymen in through being in position of HRs  or senoir position, buy HDB homes, sell them and go back home to be millionaires.</p>

              <p>Your reply is so full of <em>shit</em> . literally .</p>
              <p><br>If you see Singapore as an arena . then fight .</p>
              <p><em>Shitting</em> in online forums like you do is not gonna change your life or whatsoever it is that you are so unhappy about . whilst <em>shitting</em> here those lower level FT are working their asses off like dogs . some even 20 hours a day . whilst for us just another extra hour in our 40 hours a week schedule is so much of a <em>shitty</em> burden . it's true . but in order to survive since they know they are not worthy of anything . that's why they are able to clean toilets, clean septic tanks and all those <em>shitty</em> job you wont even touch . and when you have nothing else to lose you will do just anything possible to fight and survive . When we cannot go for clubbing on saturday night because our boss asked us to do a lot of extra works we probably rant here and there as if the sky gonna fall on our heads but the FT would happily do extra hours and whatever else is required in order to get extra money . another addition of 30 bucks in exchange of weekend fun probably mean nothing to us and I can guarantee most of us would better have relaxing weekend than to work but for that 30 bucks they are willing to exchange every weekend they could possibly exchange . now that is getting an edge for yourself and fighting for your life . doesnt require a talent to do such thing but dont blame the world that bosses and employers like such service . and who could really blame them that due to such performances some of them could possibly rise faster than we all imagined ?</p>
              <p>Those are about lower level FT . can you fight ? How about Higher level FT who hold similar position such as a manager or supervisor or even CEO  or CFO ? Let me tell you things arent so much of a different up there . I am also in managing position and I have all these competition up my sleeve . I now have to put in extra efforts during work and cannot surf facebook and chat anymore during work time which I could still do last time and the reason is because whenever I move my focus away from my work to social network pages I couldnt instantly relate or focus back to my work when I close firefox . and that affect my work efficiency because those FT who are also in the same managing position as myself keep going and they never lose focus to such things . they are here to win or die . that's why nowadays I strictly limit myself to forums and other social webbie only after work and at home . now some people are complaining about this because they cannot manage their priority . of course the rest of the world is unhappy about this since with the appearance of FT simply stiffen up the competition . no more slacking in office et cetera . But yeah . work like a dog . live like a king . dont like it . fight better .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Come to think of it . Singapore culture has always been about competition even before the FT came in . without them we  were cursing at other singaporean who strive better . when Malaysian came in we curse those malaysian who strive better . the same case when Suddenly Filipino came surging in . now THE WORLD came in . and guess who we are cursing now . surprised ? No .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>we were warned . 2010 . AFTA . Free trade is on dude . get on with the game . or be like old men who curse until they aged .</p>

              <p>Foreign talents are needed (agreed), but are we getting more
              foreign talents or cheap foreign labours (IT, sales, admin,
              technicians, bus drivers, banking, table cleaners)? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The main crux of it lies in PAP's quest to drive down labour
              cost, more labour supply means wages will not rise as expected,
              your wage increment would have been competed away by cheap foreign
              labour from 3rd world countries. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>we import prcs and indians today, while their income back home is lower than ours.</p>
              <p>they are "chosen" since they are racially, and to some extent, culturally similar to us.</p>
              <p>but these are emerging powers. Eventually, they will grow to become the next USAs, and what happens when Singapore then is no longer attractive to foreign workers?</p>
              <p>what do we do when all these workers leave?</p>
              <p>Do we then seek out other sources of cheap labour? import workers from rest of asean? from africa?</p>
              <p>if 1 million indian and chinese workers are already have such negative impact on us, imagine what 1 million africans,having a totally different culture, would do.</p>
              <p>racial issues aside. Right now, our basic infrastructure is also overly reliance on foreign labour. without them, bus services would not run, construction will stall, garbage will pile up, factories will shut down.</p>
              <p>this is of strategic importance. if s'pore ever becomes unattractive to these foreigners, who will do these jobs?</p>
              <p>we need to nurture our own people to not shunt these jobs, and to do that, we must first start by giving decent salary, a figure that reflects the nature of the job.</p>
              <p>We should also rethink our branding of the term "talent". People who are willing/able to work in jobs are others are unwilling/unable to do, should be labelled as "talents", and therefore be paid as such.</p>
              <p>yes, menial jobs might not require much technical expertise, but I feel that effort should be compensated regardless of one's education. Why should the hours spent labouring under the sun be compensated less than hours spent in front of a desk?</p>
              <p>The latter is taxing on the brain, while the former is taxing on the body. Both are taxing on the individual in their own ways. The labourer is working at the expense of his health, and i do not see why his effort is valued less than that of an office workers.</p>
              <p>I'm not advocating that labourers be paid more than professionals, but i feel that the discrepancy in salary should not be so far off, as with the current situation.</p>

              <p>This is basically what you are saying :<br>We must first start by giving decent salary to <em>"cleaning services or waste management services"</em> in order to nurture our own people to start loving such jobs .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My questions are :</p>
              <p>Just how much do you think would be <strong>"decent"</strong> in order to make our locals start loving such job ? how much would you think our locals would be asking for in recompense in order for them to start loving <strong><em>such job</em></strong> ?</p>

              <p>Aiya, we already know what <strong>"decent"</strong> salaries mean when we look at the salaries of the ministers.</p>
              <p>If our PM's salary is 10 times higher than Obama, then the salaries of our cleaners should be at least 10 times more than the cleaners in the US. You go figure out how much that is. If we need to find FW to do the job at lower pay, in the same token, we should be looking for FT to fill the ministers posts. <img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>suddenly so many people want to be president, because people suddenly realized the pay is over $4m per year, plus life long pension, free trips......it is a dream come true for anybody, it is a job all would love. <img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              not suitable for Singapore n China.And that if one day Singapore
