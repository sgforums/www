              <p>If we are to call ourselves a first world country, then we shouldn't still have people making less than $7/hr. (I based that on the average price of fastfood meal).</p>
              <p>its a disgrace, when you see on tv programmes such as "Undercover Boss", an American cleaner is finding that her USD$14/hr is not enough, while here we are paying cleaners $500-600/month.</p>
              <p>and why should such low-paying jobs even exists in Singapore? Yes, i understand that some pay is better than no pay. but i believe that our salary should also be able to sustain a basic level of living.</p>
              <p>Most local workers in these extremely low-paying jobs come from the elderly population, where they do not have much financial commitment. i.e. their houses are fully paid for/ living with children, and they only have to pay for food and utility etc.</p>
              <p>but, what about people who still have heavy financial burden on their backs? People who still need to pay off their housing mortgages/ rental? Thanks to the rise in HDB prices and the popularity of 30yr housing loans, most people fall into this category.</p>
              <p>Based on market rental price, the rent for a bedroom is around $500/month.</p>
              <p>thus, it is financially <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>impossible</strong></em></span><em> for an average person to survive on a pay of less than $800 take-home a month on a permanent basis, without dipping into his savings.<br></em></p>
              <p>exceptions: unless you are willing to live in a workers dorm for the rest of your life, living a really spartan existence.</p>
              <p>The FWs who come to spore to work, only have to endure a few years of hardship, and after that, they will head back for a better life in their hometown. But for singaporeans, there is no other hometowns to return to, so the suffering will be for forever. Hence, obviously, this form of job creation is unsustainable.</p>

              <p>Professions like gardeners, rubbish truck drivers, plumbers can earn A$30,000 a year easily.....was a little dazed when I heard it first hand. Even with 30% tax deduction, still much better off than their sgporean counterparts, right?</p>
              <p>And min pay for part-timers seem to be around A$20 per hour. Well, everything else is much higher but the two most expensive purchases of their lives: house and car don't quite add up to a price like ours. A new toyota sedan costs between A$15,000 - 25,000. Our 3 room HDB pigeon hole can buy a nice bungalow with swimming pool there. What a different world!</p>

              Singaporeans ought to be wary of adhering to such rubbish talk and be so very discerning and scrutinize such condescending ... instead of bleating away like sheep. Esp[ecially more so when one is afflicted with megalomania!
              
              Under a one-party system that we now have ( some forced to endure), who is checking whom? Who is balancing accounts? No independent source/body can attest to the authenticity of what is put out in terms of statistics or â€¦ 
              
              The incumbents know that their days in power is numbered. Now the gameplan is to hold on to power at any costs. A giveaway is the CEO of GIC. Is it not conflict of interests? Worse still, is that inspiteof billions lost in so-called investments, no one for sure knows if it was really invested or the statistics put out by the lame media is transparent/unbiased and why is there no independent body or ombudsman of sorts to query, check and balance claims, costs or â€¦. If one were to extroplate from the aformentioned one cannot help but feel that from HDB,CPF, Health and so many other numerous institutions operate in the same manner â€“ ie. patently lacking in transparency, in accountablilty and so on so forth.
              
              In other words, simply put, Singaporeans gave them a â€�blank chequeâ€� of sorts to do as they please and today the mess is percolating/permeating many aspects of our daily living. To deny is to delude onself.
              
              Why is there this obsession with GDP growth? It all boils down these and feels like it â€“ inisterial wages being pegged to GDP figures is the motivation. Of course, to be able to partake of the economic pie one has to be in power. Hence the unchecked influx of foreigners. Employers and MIWs benefit immensely. 
              
              The incumbents no longer seem to care for the citizens or the nation. It is a party that has degenerated into nepotism, cronyism; is avaricious and woefully venal in its ways. It is the fear of being ''found out'' that old fart fears n now he is vehemently and stubbornly is very much against any form of two-party or ...
              
              Why do you think that the incumbents wer always were wary of people like JBJ and Dr Chee. They knew that the latter were people who will ask questions, and they will be ''cornered''. They also knew that these people had convictions and were willing to risk it all for the people. The incumbents never want people like this in their own party nor in the opposing â€¦
              
              Just look around the PAP MIWS and MPs â€“ sadly, none of them come across as sincere or people-centred. It is palpable that ethics, principles, sense of justice .... has been jettisoned for political correcteness and be rewarded/earn one''s keeps.
              
              All they do is sing to the chorus of a few and for political orthodoxy n patronage they seem to have sacrificed principles, conviction, ethics on the altar of political power and greed.
              
              Undeniably, the one-party system is an albatross around each Singaporeanâ€™s neck and though not cohered in expression nor articulated explicity â€“ it does seem to coalesce into this â€“ wanting changes desperately to undo or stop this monstrous Leviathan of a system that has added to our woes, just not economically but socially as well. Do you think scholarships to foreign students would be given out so very easily if there was a two-party system or foreigners be allowed to replace locals by unfair means when it comes to jobs? Singaporeans forgoing market-rate wages is SUBSIDIZING employers and foreigners. Come 2016, the foreigners-turned-citizens would most likely vote in PAP and that was the gameplan from the outset. Locals are dreaming/sleepwalking.
              
              Politicians of any hue cannot and do not decide our fates/destinies. It is by our voting patterns that we change and transform ... n that can happen only when and if  that responsibility is a reflection of oneself.

              <p>lower echelon jobs need apprenticeships be it gardener,plumber or electrician.these apprenticeships are made by companies who prefer own race folks because its jhow it werks.and these folks in most apprenticeships are bullies and use outdated technology and faulty equipment.unless u can swim in manure and in crocodile infested waters...dont bother thinking about becoming their plumber or electrician etc jobs that need an apprenticehip.</p>

              <p>Gimchow, so the problem lies within . not in FT or no FT . their existence is just merely the black sheep of all this irony we already have within . even without FT we will still complain about other singaporean who strive better, when Malaysian came in we suddenly complain about malaysian the same when fillipino came in we also complain about them and now the WORLD came in . guess who are we complaining now ? surprised ? No .</p>
              <p>The world already agreed on AFTA free trade and everybody know it is due in 2010 . yet we all dream away and now that it is here . then we all suck thumbs kpkb whine here whine there . no FT lah no PAP lah no this and no that .</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now that is the capitalists mentality."willing buyers willing sellers."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You can pay $50 for a prostitute, there will still be willing takers. What are missing are SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, MORALITY. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Bring this back to the context of the big gap between the filtily high government salaries and the "competitively prices" of our workers, the same principle applies. go figure why people are whining.....may be a $50 prostitute wont mourn....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"> <br></span></p>
