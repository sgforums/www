Not that I say our system is flawless, with every system, there is flaw. And ours is probably being dominated by one party. At the moment, it is doing well. In the future, who knows? When it fails, then we have to do something about it. Important thing is to find people with integrity and vision, set them loose to do their work. Can't imagine CEO of companies having to report to shareholders everyday, some are already questioning the need for quarterly report... It is driving towards a short sighted approach to making profits, not good for companies in the longer term when low hanging fruits are all plucked and no investment for future.<br></div></blockquote>We cannot wait for failures to happen.A nation like Singapore cannot afford to have failures when our institutions are not really strengthened yet.<br><br>We have to be humble enough to learn from everyone, even US is learning from Switzerland on electronic voting procedures.Not wholesale adoption mind you, but to move on, we have to admit the flaws with the system and attempt to correct it.

Perhaps my experience with system gave me a rather negative perspective of its viability. System can be manipulated. Look at NKF, US Oliver North, Enron, etc etc. Did painfully set up accountability system not fail when People are of dubious character plot to enrich themselves? Did a corrupt trader not bring down 100+ year old bank? Did the Ivory coast not inherit a comprehensive system of governance? I tend to believe that system and process is failable but a person character that can withstand a thousand degree of heat will not crack when trouble or temptation come. Unfortunately, there is no sure method of validating a person character. In a population of 3+ million, finding a few good men is really all we need and all we are fortunate to have.<br><br>There is no merit to say that all government policies are flawless, just as to say all judges make perfect judgement. In totality, the government has done a fantastic job and existing pool of opposition candidates do not have enough to match (I do give them lots of brownie points for having the courage to stand before cynical Singaporeans and articulate their thoughts). It may not be fair to say that they are not capable since they have not been given a chance to perform. I learn this from my school gym, "you keep fit to play and not play to keep fit".<br><br>We are a small country with little reserves (please look at some US investment group warchest, we are really... peanuts). There is little room for mistakes, so I tend to think we need proven people at the helms and not have trainee to prove their worth. Is there other avenues for them to prove their worth, I am not sure. Who says life is fair?<br><br></div>
