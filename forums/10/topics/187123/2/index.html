            <div class='col-md body'>Whether something said is defamatory or not depends on the listeners. The court of judges should perceive the effect of statements alleged to be defamatory on the common man in the street.<br><br>A panel of jury will be better able to decide whether something said is in fact defamatory than the judges as such statements are more often than not questions of facts rather than laws.<br><br>It is sad that jury system has been abolished and today we have left every issue of fact and law completely to the judges.<br><br>Thus, in our defamation cases, we have to depend solely on the judges for interpretations whether statements made are defamatory.<br><br>Judges' interpretations may or may not reflect true intent and purpose of the words as used and heard by the public layman who might regard certain things said as either jokes or humour or public knowledge and not any deliberate allegations. For example when something has been published in the newspapers very often and someone just utter the same matters should any one regard such published knowledge as defamation caused by the person alleged to make the statements.<br><br>Jury might interpret too what constitute justifications or duties of the state to be accountable and forthcoming with criticism of policies which went wrong.<br><br>So we need to look at our defamation laws and the method of trial in our courts for such cases so that the future trials will take all these facts into account and not completely trust the facts and interpretation of facts to the judges who might interpret facts on his own views rather than impact on ordinary man in the street.<br><br>Defamation or lowering of opinion of the party said to be defamed should not be left to the judges but through perception by a group of ordinary men in the street who hear those words claimed to be defamatory.</div>
