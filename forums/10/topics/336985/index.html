              <blockquote>The ISD is also involved in neutralising several attempts 
                      by terrorist groups using Singapore to raise funds or to procure electronic 
                      parts in aid of their struggle. In 1985, the ISD took actions to neutralise 
                      a local network of the Liberation Tiger of Tamil Ealam (LTTE) headed by 
                      Sri Lankans working in Singapore. Key leaders and activists of the network 
                      were arrested and expelled to countries of their choice. In Nov 2000, 
                      the ISD carried out a security operation against another local network 
                      of the LTTE whose principal activities were the secret collection and 
                      transfer of funds. These operations served to put these individuals on 
                      notice that the authorities will not tolerate their use of Singapore and 
                      Singapore citizens/permanent residents in activities which are prejudicial 
                      to Singapore’s security interests. </blockquote>

              <div class="story_text">A GROUP of Singaporeans, including visual artist Seelan Palay, are
              holding a candlelight vigil on Saturday evening in support of peace in
              war-torn Sri Lanka.
              <p>The two-hour event will be staged at Speakers' Corner in Hong Lim
              Park, where rules on public speaking and protests were relaxed on Sept
              1.</p>
              <p>Although the event was described as a demonstration when the
              group registered it with the National Parks Board (NParks), there will
              not be any speeches or protests, said Mr Palay, 24.</p>
              <p>Instead, they will distribute fliers containing information
              about the sectarian strife in Sri Lanka which began in 1983 and has
              since claimed more than 70,000 lives and displaced over one million
              others.</p>
              <p>Mr Palay said the group will also put up a notice board for
              the public to pen 'peace' messages for Sri Lankans caught up in the
              conflict.</p>
              <p>'We hope to express concern and raise awareness about the
              situation in Sri Lanka as Singaporeans and members of the global
              community,' he added.</p>
              <p>Clashes between government forces and rebels seeking an
              independent homeland escalated after the government called off a
              ceasefire in January, accusing the rebels of using the lull to re-arm
              themselves.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for NParks confirmed on Wednesday that it received an application to 'hold a vigil for peace in Sri Lanka'.</p>
              <p>Since Sept 1, applicants need to only register online at the
              NParks' website any time before speaking or staging a demonstration.
              They have to state the intended topic as issues dealing with race and
              religion remain out of bounds.</p>

              civil war in Sri Lanka is one of the world’s deadliest ongoing armed
              conflicts, causing significant harm to the civilian population,
              environment and severe damage to the economy of the country. Now 25
              years running, it has claimed at least 215,000 lives and displaced more
              than 1.5 million people.<br><br>The possibility of a lasting peace was
              raised when a cease-fire agreement was signed with international
              mediation in 2002. However on January 2, 2008 the Government of Sri
              Lanka formally announced unilateral withdrawal from the ceasefire
              agreement and since then, the conflict escalated to critical levels in
              recent months. Donor countries such as the United States, Canada,
              Norway and Japan have expressed deep regrets on this decision by the
              Sri Lankan government.<br><br>On September 9, 2008, the Government of
              Sri Lanka ordered all local and international aid agencies to leave the
              northern areas of conflict and take their equipment with them. UN
              agencies and international relief organisations including Oxfam, Save
              The Children and the Danish Refugee Council that have been delivering
              food and medical aid to nearly 200,000 refugees in the affected region
              have started to pull out.<br><br>History has demonstrated that such
              wars can never be won. The international community must take decisive
              steps to pressure the Government of Sri Lanka to abandon the path of
              militarism and opt for a negotiated political settlement. Our prompt
              intervention will avert the loss of many more precious lives.<br><br>Join us at Speakers Corner this Saturday, Nov 15 to light a candle and show your support for peace in Sri Lanka.</p>
