In Australia, every seat (single-member ones) has a multiple-cornered fight. The people vote for their favourite candidate by numbering off the voting slip. To be valid, your voting slip must have the number "1" on it. It is not necessary to list all your choices. If I had the chance to vote (which my crush 6 years my junior does), I'd only list 3 choices.</div>
