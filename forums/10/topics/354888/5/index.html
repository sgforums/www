              can see full of Africa nationalities there working at 1/3 of a norm
              USA worker paid, but they still want it, cos it is better
              than their country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I go pizza and burgers restaurant in
              USA, most are run by Colombians, Chileans etc etc..and
              the farming are using mexicans and america obriginals (red
              indians). While most america folks are doing supervising,
              admin, controlling, trade and office jobs, the lower one had gone
              to foreigner, if not companies cannot match the Chinese or move out
              to China or some third world asia countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Same goes to Europe, recently, the heavy industrial such as
              construction and shipbuilding in BRitain went to the Albanians and
              Cezchs...there are lots of protest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course within the construction site, top responsible jobs are
              given to local with much higher paid, last time when they show
              Keppel shipyard and PSA, they also feature singaporeans, but in
              real, u see 100 foreigners against 1 singaporean. The show in
              Discover or Nat geographic is about construction and building not
              about foreigner workers migration, so what for they show the
              foreigner there??</p>

              <p>The US economy is big enough to accomodate foreigners, the Singapore one is not. Now i see the local McD at Jurong have a Filipino Manager, with Singaporeans as workers.

              <p>It seems like the present government thinks only in terms of short term economic gains without regard for future economic, social and political problems down the road.  I have always been wary of growing the population by too much at breakneck speed with the inlfux of foreign workers.  Hopefully, the fallout will not be too bad next time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>The shipbuilding, marine and construction firms are open to singaporeans, you got training supervisors jobs, you got project leader jobs, you got craftman and trademen jobs too, but there was no takers, or less, so to speak, it is not that working in a yard or a site cannot survive the living here, it is the complacency of Singaporeans, the high influential education and the aging population that cannot take up such jobs anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As far as i knew in this heavy industrials, the ratio is about 1 singaporeans to 4 foreigners, therefore, companies hv to employ 10 singaporeans inorder to have 40 foreigners, but the singaporeans are not forthcoming and keep complaining. So if you are going to sent back all the foreigners, the companies would had collapse or move all leading to a singaporeans no jobs, and if you are sending 4,000 FW back, guess how much singaporeans is going to loose their jobs, u do the math.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the past years, economy booming and good life had tarnished and spoilt our sg workers life, old age is one problem, but it should not be the source of blockage, we learn a long life learning process, Singaporeans should get themselve motivated to take on jobs that control foreigner workers or be their leader.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Every Single 1st world economy countries attract foreigners, not only Singapore. I agree that some of these countries are big, however country like Singapore, given the space, we can control the quotas. We got to trust the govt.</p>

              <p>You already highlighted already wah. Those industry the safety record is so bad.. which Singaporean want to exchange their life for such unsafe job ?</p>
              <p>Instead of fixing safety codes and enforcing strict safety rules and regulations, elevating working enviroments ... they rather pay foreigners who are willing to trade their life for the money.</p>
              <p>If one lost his life.or lifetime crippled.... how much is the shipyard going to compensate you ? 50,000 ? Is that really worth it ? Or dump you in the water.. as fish food ?</p>
              <p>To the impoverished.. they go for broke. But they also hindered the progress of improvements.</p>
