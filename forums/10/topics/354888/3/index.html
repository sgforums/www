              <p>Agreed that this is sad, I am very sure that there are enough skill workers to fill up all positions there is no need to have Filipinos to be in but I doubt Resort Sentosa would ever care. Why costing of Manpower,It alway cheaper to get Filipino to work, Am I talking rubbish? I too apply along with the thousands of people in Suntec city during their recruitment, but until today after so many weeks I still waiting for interview, there isn't even a call.</p>
              <p>Am I not qualified for the work? I have two hotel skill certificates with 10 years of experiences in Hotel Industry and 7 years of Retail experiences with a service excellent silver star award for 2008, isn't that two industry most qualified for the Jobs they have?  and that me only, I have many friends in both industry willing and ready to take up offers from Resort Sentosa but did they call any of us? What happen to the pledge the given to Singapore when they first apply for the License?</p>
              <p>I too have lose hope in Resort Sentosa and all their talk of helping Singapore.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">This is what they said about the career fair Suntec City :</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Career 2009 job fair that the trio attended at Suntec City in March was a success for Resorts World, which attracted 20,000 applications for 800 positions on offer. Eventually, the resort will have 10, 000 staff when it opens in 2010.</span></p>
              <p class="txtsubtype3"><span style="color: #ff0000;">In the huge pool of talent that Resorts World has amassed in the job applications are team members who will launch Resort World's operations in early 2010. Are you amongst them? </span></p>
              <p class="txtsubtype3"><span style="color: #ff0000;">RWS's Senior Vice President for Human Resources and Training, Ms Seah-Khoo Ee Boon said "My colleagues and I find it heartening to know that many people want to join Resorts World at Sentosa. The task at hand involves picking a winning team for the mega resort's opening in early 2010. I'm confident that strong support for our recruitment ads and job fair presentations points to healthy public support once the resort opens its doors. "</span></p>

              <p>Slang and accent are two different things.Local Slang cannot be understood unless you learn it yourself.Accent is when you agak agak and think you understand what that person is talking about.Filipinos think their English is good and sounds American but they have a little hispanic in their speaking style and pronunciation.On the other hand Singaporean English is alot clearer and easier to understand if only the speaker speaks a little slower.Next to Singaporeans I would say them pinoys are second best English speakers in the region but almighty when it comes to taking  low paying jobs that no thinking human wants</p>

              <p>Steven G , i really empathise with u man. This Gahmen n all the rubbish talk abt helping his people are bullshit i think. What i see now is even doctors in my family are leaving town and settling overseas permanently. It is not because the land is greener on the other side. It is because the country do not cherish its local talents. Y cherish when they can always import from overseas. Even the athletes representing OUR COUNTRY( i almost forgot i have one) are imported from overseas.</p>
              <p>This country is losing its people. I was so proud to be a Singaporean 15 years ago. I remember sitting in the Kallang Stadium and waving the Singapore flag proudly on our National Day. Now, i got laughed by my foreign friends for being a Singaporean. They laughed at my country for being so unfair to his people. Even one of my friends from China have the audacity to say that they will be the ones governing our country someday.</p>
              <p>Today, Singapore has become like the US. I won't be surprise in 10 years time, there ill be an Obama from China standing on the podium and addressing us on National Day parade.(I will be so disgust and perhaps dig a hole n bury myself). A country that is packed with immigrants. Please don't give me rubbish about my ancestry. I was borned and raised here. The Gahmen is giving our PRs like nobody business, cause they r the Gahmen. Even my friend who just got her PR after studying for 3 years here at a local poly out of her own pocket money sighed at the fact that another girl who came and worked as a waitress also got her PR. She wonder why she even care to get a diploma when any father's mother's son or daughter who fly in from their foreign lands can just stem their roots here and claim worthy to be a Singaporean.</p>
              <p>I served the Nation. What abt them?</p>

              <p>Before you get on the moral highhorse and condemn my fellow citizens,</p>
              <p>1. Where did you get the statistics that you qoute '80% of businessmen are foreigners' from?</p>
              <p>This is an outright lie, a joke, a laughable deliberate misconception on your deluded ego that you, a mere pissant foreigner sought to impose your domineering racist views upon us Singaporeans as colonnial masters did once during their cruel colonnisation to our forefathers. Take your racist crap and shove it where it does not shine in your own body part.</p>
              <p>2. No doubt we need you, to make full use of you only, foreigner, as you intend to make full use of us. So spare us your righteous bullshit and crap.</p>
              <p>3. Have you wondered why hardworking and productive Singaporeans will not take such jobs as you mentioned? Do you or would you accept $500 per month for the heavy labour you have to undertake, and with it to pay for the house, your family and their medical expenses, etc?</p>
              <p>You capitalist foreigner, had been profitting off our backs and we had been silent, and allowed other foreigners to be your slaves. STFU, if i were you, and maintain the status quo. We Singaporeans arent as stupid as you presumed, you son of a bitch!</p>
              <p>(PS. probably when morning comes and the alcohol in my red wine dissipates, i may tender a apology, but in the meantime, enjoy my post, foreigner)</p>

              <p>I am not condemning anybody, you were the ones who's condemning foreign people, and I think its wrong to say that.

              <p>Rather than to rub each other the wrong way, let's start afresh and try to foster better understanding, even though yet again you cast a slur against Singaporeans, implying they are not as dependable than foreign workers.</p>
              <p>Sure, we are thankful they clean up our mess and build beautiful structures PAID by us. But at what social cost?</p>
              <p>Have you considered that if there were no foriegners around, companies would have to pay more in order to profit, or at least share their profits around by paying more in order to survive?</p>
              <p>I am not sure if i am dealing with a talent or not, so i have to write simply. If you are an educated talent, you would know what kind of economic theories written by others I mean.</p>
              <p>Just consider a waitress'  pay on Christmas Island and ours. It is twice and even 3 times the amount one gets here. Why? Because the islanders were protected. But that island in truth is only sustainable for limited growth, and not the kind of growth we singaporeans are expecting for us and our next generations. Thus the trade off - to get cheap labour for bosses to profit and in the meantime they will need higher skilled staff earning more filled by our locals.</p>
              <p>The only grouse comes from those who may not be as educated, or skillful as others, or older and subsequently lagged behind to face the foreigner hordes.</p>
              <p>Worse still, and many singaporeans found out, there are many employers who took advantage of this economic system to fill even well paid jobs with younger and cheaper foreign workers/talents.</p>
              <p>Isn't the exploitation of cheap labour immoral? You are the boss, so you are in a better position to answer that. I only know that it would be immoral if our own valued citizens starve, in a globalised world that you bosses dictate and demand to societies.</p>
              <p>Let it not be said we are racists, or undependable, unreliable, or whatnots. Spend a bit more time here before you criticise next and be not selectively blind.</p>
