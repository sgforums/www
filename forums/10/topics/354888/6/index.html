              <p>After reading this thread thoroughly especially the first parts of the thread, I really felt sad of some SG's not wanting foreign workers to work in SG. I just can't help just reading people's post saying Filipino english is bad compared to SG's english. As young as I am, 16, I can say I have good english (and btw, I'm a Filipino). As you can see today, I think everyone already is learning on how to speak English. That is why you think that you have better English than Filipinos is that you can't understand it clearly. Let me explain this.</p>
              <p>It is just like Chinese English, you can't understand it clearly too right? And they also think they already are good in English and we think that it is not. It is because we are not used to how they speak it. It is just the same with Filipino and SG English. Maybe, we just don't understand each other since we are not used to hearing how they speak.</p>
              <p>And about the job thing, I'm 16 and in my first year in college studying BS - Information Technology. I just thought that after I graduate, I would work there since I have good SG and MS friends I made in the internet and they are really welcoming me on working there. Now that I have read this topic, I am already discouraged of working there since most SG's (if not all) are not really welcome seeing foreign worker's since we would just be occupying and hording your job opportunities.</p>
              <p>I hope next time we won't compare our race since it is normal that some are in high position and some are at low. You are very lucky that you are in high state today.</p>
              <p>I really signed up just to say this since I really was hurt (being a Filipino) reading all the stuff written in the previous pages. I did not come here to fight or quarrel or debate about stuff so please just be patient with me if you think my post is something you do not like. Thank you.</p>

              <p>Well thank you for your understanding European cock sucker.</p>
              <p>What I know is that SG people are good since my SG friends are good people. I hope you will think the same way to Filipinos the same as I think of what SG's are.</p>

              <p>After reading this thread thoroughly especially the first parts
              of the thread, I really felt sad of some SG's not wanting foreign
              workers to work in SG. I just can't help just reading people's post
              saying Filipino english is bad compared to SG's english. As young
              as I am, 16, I can say I have good english (and btw, I'm a
              Filipino). As you can see today, I think everyone already is
              learning on how to speak English. That is why you think that you
              have better English than Filipinos is that you can't understand it
              clearly. Let me explain this.</p>
              <p>It is just like Chinese English, you can't understand it clearly
              too right? And they also think they already are good in English and
              we think that it is not. It is because we are not used to how they
              speak it. It is just the same with Filipino and SG English. Maybe,
              we just don't understand each other since we are not used to
              hearing how they speak.</p>
              <p>And about the job thing, I'm 16 and in my first year in college
              studying BS - Information Technology. I just thought that after I
              graduate, I would work there since I have good SG and MS friends I
              made in the internet and they are really welcoming me on working
              there. Now that I have read this topic, I am already discouraged of
              working there since most SG's (if not all) are not really welcome
              seeing foreign worker's since we would just be occupying and
              hording your job opportunities.</p>
              <p>I hope next time we won't compare our race since it is normal
              that some are in high position and some are at low. You are very
              lucky that you are in high state today.</p>
              <p>I really signed up just to say this since I really was hurt
              (being a Filipino) reading all the stuff written in the previous
              pages. I did not come here to fight or quarrel or debate about
              stuff so please just be patient with me if you think my post is
              something you do not like. Thank you.</p>

              <p>Im not referring to all Singaporeans. I was just referring to the likes of this guy. So other innocent Singaporeans who did nothing wrong, (unlike this guy over here), please don't mind me saying it to him since I am only referring to him.</p>
              <p>What I really mean is maybe because of some of your attitude, good SG people get dragged down by some unwanted people since investors think of it in general. I hope you learn something dude.</p>

              <p>That's what I mean. You are already answering my question.</p>
              <p>You, as an SG person, sees ALL(though not all) Filipinos are what you think.</p>
              <p>That is what investors there in SG also think. They think that all (though not all) Singaporeans are the same attitude as you are. Age does not matter la. Why you don't want to learn? You ashamed of learning from youngster? Well? You should be ashamed of yourself. At first, I already said I don't want any conflict with anybody, then you started it.</p>
              <p>If you want to be respected by others, respect yourself and others too la. Don't think that you as a person is ALWAYS superior to Filipinos (or any other race) since most (because not all) of Filipinos are living by being housemaids, waiters, and some rubbish jobs. If you despise us Filipinos because our jobs are those, then I must think that you are some kind of very good proffesional. If you are, BE ONE !!! Don't think very high lo because I know that now, you are falling pretty high too and fast.</p>

              <p>Yes. It all makes sense. That's why we are also blaming them the same thing as you blaming your government. I'll allow you to say that since it's true. Just don't generalize it to all Filipinos since not all are like them. That is why I am not generalizing all Singaporeans to be like you since I know not all are like you. The rest are better in different ways. You, you cant fit in the puzzle no matter how I squeeze you in. You are not worth calling a Singaporean since Singaporeans I know are good people.</p>

              <p>We are just in the same situation, You want jobs, We want too. We look for jobs in other countries (not only Singapore) because we also take the opportunity. It would not be the fault of the worker since he/she is just taking up the opportunity. To us, we also hate our government. Do not put all the blame on us but also in your government. We hate our government because of corruption, that's why we look jobs outside the country. You, hate your government too, not us or our behavior, since they are accepting us to your country.
