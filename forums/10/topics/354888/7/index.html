              <p>Sigh...why is there so much hatred?</p>
              <p>Are we all starving, depraved of sustainance here on our island by anyone?</p>
              <p>Hate only leads to destruction, why destroy when we can do better by building? Alphahydrae, I cant blame you for being baited by boliaow clods like Manix, who spends his time bashing the govt for his own failures, to protect your nationalism.</p>
              <p>Rest assured not many thinks like him or his kind, same as not many of your kind think badly of us Singaporeans. Let him rot and his tongue hang out. He and his kind will not influence an iota of public opinion with their diatribe and philosophy of hate.</p>
              <p>We singaporeans know what is hate, and what is discrimination. No more will the sane and upright citizens allow it to happen again as it did to our immigrant forefathers and abandoned citizens of thieving colonials during the darkest period of their lives in a world war.</p>
              <p>I am certainly not proud of what Manix and his kind says. I weep in their lack and failure of our education that had produced so many more upright citizens, working hard in these bad times to propel and better our society, and had overlooked these people.</p>
              <p>If they need help, govt and charity organisations stand ready to help, with our society funds so that they may not starve, through upgrading and more opportunities, not to just live on handouts. </p>
              <p>There is no need to simply push blame to the govt or society for one's failure. If issues are more complex than surface reading, than it needs more serious and genuine studies to find the fault, localize and correct, something our society had been doing since our independence.</p>
              <p>We had not stop improving, young as a nation that we are, to make our country a better place to live in for all of us.</p>

              <p>Yes. It all makes sense. That's why we are also blaming them the
              same thing as you blaming your government. I'll allow you to say
              that since it's true. Just don't generalize it to all Filipinos
              since not all are like them. That is why I am not generalizing all
              Singaporeans to be like you since I know not all are like you. The
              rest are better in different ways. You, you cant fit in the puzzle
              no matter how I squeeze you in. You are not worth calling a
              Singaporean since Singaporeans I know are good people.</p>

              <p>I will always be part of the puzzle, like it or not,  I spend most of my life here, and did the responsibilities that is demanded as a citizen. Its not up to you to decide whether i should be Singaporean or not. When the time comes, my blood and the blood of other Singaporeans will bleed, You would probably jump to the next sampan or fishing trawler and wait for US or UN intervention like the rest of the FT cowards.</p>
              <p>I dont need a 16 year old to tell me what is wrong or right. All i want is my Govt to give precedence to SIngaporeans rather than foreigners. Is that so much to ask? And yeah i would always put other Singaporeans regardless of race ahead of foreigners.</p>

And besides, at first, I was not talking about the politics or the government of Singapore. I was talking about how the people in the first pages of this thread treated Filipinos. Actually, there was no conflict between us, you just mislead both of us to somewhere we did not want to be in.</p>

              <p>I pity you. I pity you and your kind. Some of them even claimed to be scholars, tarnishing the very institutions that taught them, in not even being able to look beyond their prejudices, allowing their hatred to blind their judgement.</p>
              <p>Isnt it blatantly obvious to you why a $13, 500 deposit is required? Simply put, elections are serious affairs, for the elected representatives will be the ones to collect views from their constituents and debate on policies that will be passed as laws once approved, affecting society as a whole, for the next 4-5 years till the next elections.</p>
              <p>If an elected political party have a majority of MPs in Parliament, they will be the ones to form the government, lead and guide the nation for the next 4-5 years.</p>
              <p>Do you want clowns to stand for election? And if by the chance they get elected by default ( anything can happen ), we will be ruled by clowns. Isnt so bad, come to think of it, at least they will be entertaining, keeping us in mirth as the nation sinks thru their clownish acts in parliament, more show than substance to elevate livehoods.</p>
              <p>And think of the votes that will be split between serious contenders and clowns.Not all will vote rationally. Some will vote for the best calibre leader. Some will vote along racial lines. Some will simply vote the opposite candidate just out of spite. When more clowns appear, majority votes will become a close and narrow fight. Again, do you want clowns running the country?</p>
              <p>$13,500 is to ensure the seriousness of candidates, not to waste citizen's time but to propose solutions that will solve citizen's problems, and get elected. If not, their money will be forfeited and placed in our treasury. </p>
              <p>Therefore, the money is only at best a token sum, easily affordable to any serious working citizen who has the virtue of setting aside part of his money as savings. So far since independence, it had not stop even clowns from standing for elections.</p>

              <p>I pity you. I pity you and your kind. Some of them even claimed
              to be scholars, tarnishing the very institutions that taught them,
              in not even being able to look beyond their prejudices, allowing
              their hatred to blind their judgement.</p>
              <p>Isnt it blatantly obvious to you why a $13, 500 deposit is
              required? Simply put, elections are serious affairs, for the
              elected representatives will be the ones to collect views from
              their constituents and debate on policies that will be passed as
              laws once approved, affecting society as a whole, for the next 4-5
              years till the next elections.</p>
              <p>If an elected political party have a majority of MPs in
              Parliament, they will be the ones to form
              the government, lead and guide the nation for the next
              4-5 years.</p>
              <p>Do you want clowns to stand for election? And if by the chance
              they get elected by default ( anything can happen ), we will be
              ruled by clowns. Isnt so bad, come to think of it, at least they
              will be entertaining, keeping us in mirth as the nation sinks thru
              their clownish acts in parliament, more show than substance to
              elevate livehoods.</p>
              <p>And think of the votes that will be split between serious
              contenders and clowns.Not all will vote rationally. Some will vote
              for the best calibre leader. Some will vote along racial lines.
              Some will simply vote the opposite candidate just out of spite.
              When more clowns appear, majority votes will become a close and
              narrow fight. Again, do you want clowns running the country?</p>
              <p>$13,500 is to ensure the seriousness of candidates, not to waste
              citizen's time but to propose solutions that will solve citizen's
              problems, and get elected. If not, their money will be forfeited
              and placed in our treasury. </p>
              <p>Therefore, the money is only at best a token sum, easily
              affordable to any serious working citizen who has the
              virtue of setting aside part of his money as savings. So far
              since independence, it had not stop even clowns from standing
              for elections.</p>

              <p>Do you even know what you are writing? Sigh.....</p>
              <p>Enough with the pity then. I have no intention of making fun of you, for I can see there is still good in you. Do open my eyes wide please, for your delusions, if you feel i need your pity. I seriously do, if we citizens end up hurting each other for no reason. We can help one another instead of fighting or flaming each other.</p>
              <p>That's what a forum is for - discussion, and hopefully in a civil and logical manner. When we start abusing each other, that's when clouded judgement appears. It destroys understanding and comprehension.</p>
