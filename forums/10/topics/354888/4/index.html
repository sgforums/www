              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Rather than to rub each other the wrong way, let's start afresh
                  and try to foster better understanding, even though yet again you
                  cast a slur against Singaporeans, implying they are not as
                  dependable than foreign workers.</p>
              <p>Sure, we are thankful they clean up our mess and build beautiful
                  structures PAID by us. But at what social cost?</p>
              <p>Have you considered that if there were no foriegners around,
                  companies would have to pay more in order to profit, or at least
                  share their profits around by paying more in order to survive?</p>
              <p>I am not sure if i am dealing with a talent or not, so i have to
                  write simply. If you are an educated talent, you would know what
                  kind of economic theories written by others I mean.</p>
              <p>Just consider a waitress'  pay on Christmas Island and
                  ours. It is twice and even 3 times the amount one gets here. Why?
                  Because the islanders were protected. But that island in truth is
                  only sustainable for limited growth, and not the kind of growth we
                  singaporeans are expecting for us and our next generations. Thus
                  the trade off - to get cheap labour for bosses to profit and in the
                  meantime they will need higher skilled staff earning more filled by
                  our locals.</p>
              <p>The only grouse comes from those who may not be as educated, or
                  skillful as others, or older and subsequently lagged behind to
                  face the foreigner hordes.</p>
              <p>Worse still, and many singaporeans found out, there are many
                  employers who took advantage of this economic system to fill even
                  well paid jobs with younger and cheaper foreign
                  workers/talents.</p>
              <p>Isn't the exploitation of cheap labour immoral? You are the
                  boss, so you are in a better position to answer that. I only know
                  that it would be immoral if our own valued citizens starve, in
                  a globalised world that you bosses dictate and demand to
                  societies.</p>
              <p>Let it not be said we are racists, or undependable,
                  unreliable, or whatnots. Spend a bit more time here before you
                  criticise next and be not selectively blind.</p>

              <p>Sorry to disappoint you and your often flawed theories, I am much more sober now than last night.</p>
              <p>I am much more gracious, or least i always attempt to do so in the pursuit of rationality. Cold, clinical and devoid of emotions except for facts or perceptions of facts is a better way to foster understanding thru debate, regardless of who i deal with, be him a immortal or a african goatherd. This is my principle, flawed as I am.</p>

              <p>Nowadays the term Singaporean is extremely broad based, so long as you come into Singapore, you are considered Singaporean. That's why when government said they created jobs for Singaporeans, apart from the locally born Singaporeans they meant the Filipinos, PRCs, Indonesian and Indians too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

Fast forward to today, which right minded Singaporean would want to do the job for the pay that barely suffice in a state of living that is so expensive.

              <p>Are u sure??, i went to USA and the mexicans and those south americans workers are doing the jobs, some got no permit too and dun mind getting less paid then the minimium, i go the europe, and the workers are mostly from eastern europe, the citizens there just go on strike, but it dun work out, cos the boss still have the right to employ them. In the end chao and riot take place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So instead of keep insisting on a no solution but complain issue here, why not upgrade oneself and make oneself more marketable, if you think sweep floor is taken, go for security officers, hotel staffs, etc etc which need higher skill and language proficiency to a certain extend. It is of no use keeping complaining and complaining but give no solution.</p>

              <p><br>No, in heaviest and dangerous industries such as USA oil rigs, u can see full of Africa nationalities there working at 1/3 of a norm USA worker paid, but they still want it, cos it is better than their country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I go pizza and burgers restaurant in USA, most are run by Colombians, Chileans etc etc..and the farming are using mexicans and america obriginals (red indians). While most america folks are doing supervising, admin, controlling, trade and office jobs, the lower one had gone to foreigner, if not companies cannot match the Chinese or move out to China or some third world asia countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Same goes to Europe, recently, the heavy industrial such as construction and shipbuilding in BRitain went to the Albanians and Cezchs...there are lots of protest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course within the construction site, top responsible jobs are given to local with much higher paid, last time when they show Keppel shipyard and PSA, they also feature singaporeans, but in real, u see 100 foreigners against 1 singaporean. The show in Discover or Nat geographic is about construction and building not about foreigner workers migration, so what for they show the foreigner there??</p>
