            <div class='col-md body'>pls lah.  Every GE u look at the numbers, even constituencies with a choice will have majority vote for PAP...  But its not cos the PAP is super good.. its just super good relative to the other parties...  who gives a damn about human rights if u cant afford ur medical fees or house?<br><br>But then again, I think the PAP has been doing a pretty good job lorh.  some policies, like CPF, medisave, and the range of subsidies, upgrading programmes, etc, may be socialist.   but who said we must subscibe to western democ just cos it works for them?  if it aint broke, dun fix it...<br><br>i dun think the policies are fine, but the oppo needs a large number of MPs sitting there....  but oppo MP just for the sake of having oppo is stupid.  u need some real oppo who will think of how to increase no. of jobs, lower medical fees, question specific government actions on education, spending, etc.  Not lump everything together and say the govt never respect human rights....<br><br>and complaining and bitching about the system that makes you an MP does NOT help matters very much... singaporeans who cant feed their kids dun give no shit about whether the system is fair in giving you a chance to be MP, u want people to start caring abt getting you into parliament, u start producing gd ideas that will help them feed their kids...</div>
