            <div class='col-md body'>IIRC, there is a rapid test kit for dengue fever. In any case, whether the patient is suffering from dengue fever or some other kind of fever can be determined by a blood test, specifically for the platelet count. If it falls below a certain level, the doctor can be reasonably sure that the patient is suffering from dengue fever.<br><br>In any case, I'm not sure what you want to speak out about in this thread - GPs giving the same type of medicine for a wide variety of symptoms, or the dengue problem?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am not sure how GPs handle dengue fever case when the kits were not available.<br><br>What I do know is GPs go by symptoms.<br><br>I am confident they could not tell for sure exactly what you are having.<br><br>Next time, when you have a flu (touch wood), just ask your gp, what exactly you are having. Which strain ?<br><br>Dengue is just a general example. I am sure many problems start with fever-like symptoms.<br><br>They usually prescribe panadol or the likes.<br><br>By the time things get worse, then we go to hospital and wait.<br><br>What I try to say is maybe GP fees could be lowered since they could not tell what problem you are really having for general cases I mentioned. Maybe many other examples exist.<br><br>I also notice many clinics are grouped into a holdings or something like that. Like a group of clinics and kind of franchisy.<br><br>I believe as a larger group, they could get lower price for drugs.<br><br>Yet, I see the GP fees have gone much higher than before.<br><br>People need to speak up as I do not believe in being helped when  you don't start helping yourself first by discussion about the expensive GP services. I think hospital fees may also have gone up.<br><br>Medical service should be to help people, not profit from them.<br><br>Sadly, I see hospitals and clinics run by profitable organisations.<br><br>fortunately, some religious clinics give highly subsidised services if not free.<br><br>Commericialism vs morality.<br><br>pure focus on commercialism and business and money could mean life gets tougher and tougher and all things measured in $$$.<br><br>does it mean that a person has no means to survive if he has no money to get the help he needs?  $$ is more important than life?<br><br>do you have the right to live without money?<br><br>is a persons worth / life measured only in $$$?<br><br></div>

Rather, what GPs do is to attend to low-level ailments which they can treat, and to refer cases which they cannot handle to the specialists.<br><br>And if the symptoms suggest the flu, of course he would prescribe the correct medications. You can't blame the doc if the symptoms don't suggest dengue, no? Or are you saying that the doctor should conduct dengue tests on every single patient who has the flu?<br><br>If you want to know, I spent $8 last week on a visit to the polyclinic because I had a small suspected cyst in my mouth. The doctor just examined it, explained that he couldn't adequately diagnose the nature of the cyst, and referred me to a dermatologist at SGH. No medications or treatment whatsoever.... he just explained that he suspected it to be a benign haemangioma which needed further evaluation by a specialist.<br><br>I'm not whining about the GP, no?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They are called GP for a reason. Just like cleaning a computer of viruses, it doesn't mean no sign there's no viruses. Some just don't show signs at all till something serious happens.</div>

Economics 101 again.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by reddressman:</div><div class="quote_body">There should be 2 rates to charge for medical 'consultation'.</div></blockquote>They already have two rates - one for 'short consultation' and one for 'long consultation'.<br>So what new 2 rates you propose? 'cheap' and 'super-cheap'? Or even better - 'cheap' and 'free'?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
