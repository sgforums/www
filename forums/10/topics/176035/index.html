What they want is community spirit and self-help and try to get government to do the right things.<br><br>So be humble and state your views objectively and clearly if you want to say forumers are wrong put up good reasonings and do not be so presumptuous.<br><br>Preach only when you have got the puritanism to practice what you preach but certainly not by denouncing others frivolously as whiners or running in cirlcles around them without solving problems. Stop trying to justify wrongs doings or denying problems or bad-mouthing others with one-liner name-calling of others. It looks like salmanising is what NEH is doing too in denying his own S-pass time bombs while calling others' manifesto as time bombs.</div>
