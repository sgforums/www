              <h1>Worse than my darkest nightmare</h1>
              <p id="stand-first" class="stand-first-alone"><em>As I gain my freedom, I am determined that neither those who remain in detention, nor their abusers, are forgotten</em></p>
              <div id="article-wrapper">
              <p>I hope you will understand that
              after everything I have been through, I am neither physically nor
              mentally capable of facing the media on the moment of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/feb/23/binyam-mohamed-return-uk">my arrival back to Britain</a>.
              Please forgive me if I make a simple statement through my lawyer. I
              hope to be able to do better in days to come, when I am on the road to
              recovery.</p>
              <p>I <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/22/binyam-mohamed-injuries">have been through an experience</a> that I never thought to encounter in my darkest nightmares. Before this ordeal, "<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/torture">torture</a>"
              was an abstract word to me. I could never have imagined that I would be
              its victim. It is still difficult for me to believe that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I was
              abducted, hauled from one country to the next, and tortured in medieval
              ways – all orchestrated by the United States government. </strong></span></p>
              <p>While
              I want to recover, and put it all as far in my past as I can, I also
              know I have an obligation to the people who still remain in those
              torture chambers. My own despair was greatest when I thought that
              everyone had abandoned me. I have a duty to make sure that nobody else
              is forgotten.</p>
              <p>I am grateful that, in the end, I was not simply left to my fate. I am grateful to my lawyers and other staff at <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a>, and to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/feb/11/binyam-mohamed-guantanamo-torture">Lt Col Yvonne Bradley</a>,
              who fought for my freedom. I am grateful to the members of the British
              Foreign Office who worked for my release.</p>
              <p>And I want to thank people
              around Britain who wrote to me in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/guantanamo-bay">Guantánamo Bay</a> to keep my spirits up, as well as to the members of the media who tried
              to make sure that the world knew what was going on. I know I would not
              be home in Britain today, if it were not for everyone's support.
              Indeed, I might not be alive at all.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I wish I could say that it
              is all over, but it is not. There are still 241 Muslim prisoners in
              Guantánamo. Many have long since been cleared even by the US military,
              yet cannot go anywhere as they face persecution. For example, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jan/24/guantanamo-bay-cia">Ahmed bel Bacha</a> lived here in Britain, and desperately needs a home. Then there are
              thousands of other prisoners held by the US elsewhere around the world,
              with no charges, and without access to their families. </strong></span></p>
              <p>And I
              have to say, more in sadness than in anger, that many have been
              complicit in my own horrors over the past seven years. For myself, the
              very worst moment came when I realised in Morocco that the people who
              were torturing me were receiving questions and materials from British
              intelligence. I had met with British intelligence in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pakistan">Pakistan</a>. I had been open with them. Yet the very people who I had hoped would come to my rescue, I later realised, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/22/torture-pakistan-human-rights">had allied themselves</a> with my abusers.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I
              am not asking for vengeance; only that the truth should be made known,
              so that nobody in the future should have to endure what I have endured.
              Thank you.</strong></span></p>

              <div class="teaserleft">

              heel of the modern Israeli state are in fact descended from the very
              same "children of Israel" described in the Old Testament?</p>
              <p>And
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>what if most modern Israelis aren't descended from the ancient
              Israelites at all, but are actually a mix of Europeans, North Africans
              and others</strong></span> who didn't "return" to the scrap of land we now call Israel
              and establish a new state following the attempt to exterminate them
              during World War II, but came in and forcefully displaced people whose
              ancestors had lived there for mille<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>nnia?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What if the entire tale
              of the Jewish Diaspora -- the story recounted at Passover tables by
              Jews around the world every year detailing the ancient Jews' exile from
              Judea, the years spent wandering through the desert, their escape from
              the Pharaoh's clutches -- is all wrong?</strong></span></p>
              <p>That's the explosive thesis of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>When and How Was the Jewish People Invented?</em></strong></span>,
              a book by Tel Aviv University scholar Shlomo Zand (or Sand) that sent
              shockwaves across Israeli society when it was published last year.
              After 19 weeks on the Israeli best-seller list, the book is being
              translated into a dozen languages and will be published in the United
              States this year by Verso.</p>
              <p>Its thesis has ramifications that go
              far beyond some antediluvian academic debate. Few modern conflicts are
              as attached to ancient history as that decades-long cycle of
              bloodletting between Israelis and Palestinians. Each group lays claim
              to the same scrap of land -- holy in all three of the world's major
              Abrahamic religions -- based on long-standing ties to that chunk of
              earth and national identities formed over long periods of time. There's
              probably no other place on Earth where the present is as intimately
              tied to the ancient.</p>
              <p>Central to the ideology of Zionism is the
              tale -- familiar to all Jewish families -- of exile, oppression,
              redemption and return. Booted from their kingdom, the "Jewish people"
              -- sons and daughters of ancient Judea -- wandered the earth, rootless,
              where they faced cruel suppression from all corners -- from being
              forced to toil in slavery under the Egyptians, to the Spanish massacres
              of the 14th century and Russian pogroms of the 19th, through to the
              horrors of the Third Reich.</p>
              <p>This view of history animates all
              Zionists, but none more so than the influential but reactionary
              minority -- in the United States as well as Israel -- who believe that
              God bestowed a "Greater Israel" -- one that encompasses the modern
              state as well as the Occupied Territories -- on the Jewish people, and
              who resist any effort to create a Palestinian state on biblical grounds.</p>
              <p><strong>Inventing a People? </strong></p>
              <p>Zand's
              central argument is that the Romans didn't expel whole nations from
              their territories. Zand estimates that perhaps 10,000 ancient Judeans
              were vanquished during the Roman wars, and the remaining inhabitants of
              ancient Judea remained, converting to Islam and assimilating with their
              conquerors when Arabs subjugated the area. They became the progenitors
              of today's Palestinian Arabs, many of whom now live as refugees who
              were exiled from their homeland during the 20th century.</p>
              <p>As Israeli journalist Tom Segev summarized, in a review of the book in <em>Ha'aretz</em>:</p>
              <blockquote>There
              never was a Jewish people, only a Jewish religion, and the exile also
              never happened -- hence there was no return. Zand rejects most of the
              stories of national-identity formation in the Bible, including the
              exodus from Egypt and, most satisfactorily, the horrors of the conquest
              under Joshua. </blockquote>
              <p>But this begs the question: if the
              ancient people of Judea weren't expelled en masse, then how did it come
              to pass that Jewish people are scattered across the world? According to
              Zand, who offers detailed histories of several groups within what is
              conventionally known as the Jewish Diaspora, some were Jews who
              emigrated of their own volition, and many more were later converts to
              Judaism. Contrary to popular belief, Zand argues that Judaism was an
              evangelical religion that actively sought out new adherents during its
              formative period.</p>
              <p>This narrative has huge significance in terms
              of Israel's national identity. If Judaism is a religion, rather than "a
              people" descended from a dispersed nation, then it brings into question
              the central justification for the state of Israel remaining a "Jewish
              state."</p>
              <p>And that brings us to Zand's second assertion. He argues
              that the story of the Jewish nation -- the transformation of the Jewish
              people from a group with a shared cultural identity and religious faith
              into a vanquished "people" -- was a relatively recent invention,
              hatched in the 19th century by Zionist scholars and advanced by the
              Israeli academic establishment. It was, argues Zand, an intellectual
              conspiracy of sorts. Segev says, "It's all fiction and myth that served
              as an excuse for the establishment of the State of Israel."</p>
              <p><strong>Zand Gets Slammed; Do His Arguments Stand Up? </strong></p>
              <p>The
              ramifications of Zand's argument are far-reaching; "the chances that
              the Palestinians are descendants of the ancient Judaic people are much
              greater than the chances that you or I are its descendants," he told <em>Ha'aretz</em>.
              Zand argues that Israel should be a state in which all of the
              inhabitants of what was once "British Palestine" share the full rights
              and responsibilities of citizenship, rather than maintaining it as a
              "Jewish and democratic" state, as it's now identified.</p>
              <p>Predictably, Zand was pilloried according to the time-tested formula. Ami Isseroff, <a href="http://www.zionism-israel.com/log/archives/00000524.html">writing on ZioNation</a>,
              the Zionism-Israel blog, invoked the customary Holocaust imagery,
              accusing Zand of offering a "final solution to the Jewish problem," one
              in which "No <em>auto da fe</em> is required, no charging Cossacks are needed, no gas chambers, no smelly crematoria." Another <a href="http://fresnozionism.org/archives/881">feverish ideologue</a> called Zand's work "another manifestation of mental disorder in the extreme academic Left in Israel."</p>
              <p>That
              kind of overheated rhetoric is a standard straw man in the endless roil
              of discourse over Israel and the Palestinians, and is easily dismissed.
              But more serious criticism also greeted Zand's work. In a <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/999386.html">widely read critical review</a> of Zand's work, Israel Bartal, dean of humanities at the Hebrew
              University, slammed the author's second assertion -- that Zionist
              academics had suppressed the true history of Judaism's spread through
              emigration and conversion in favor of a history that would give
              legitimacy to the quest for a Jewish state.</p>
              <p>Bartal raised
              important questions about Zand's methodology and pointed out what
              appears to be some sloppy details in the book. But, interestingly, in
              defending Israel's academic community, Bartal supported Zand's more
              consequential thesis, writing, "Although the myth of an exile from the
              Jewish homeland (Palestine) does exist in popular Israeli culture, it
              is negligible in serious Jewish historical discussions." Bartal added:
              "no historian of the Jewish national movement has ever really believed
              that the origins of the Jews are ethnically and biologically 'pure.' "
              He noted that "[i]mportant groups in the [Zionist] movement expressed
              reservations regarding this myth or denied it completely."</p>
              <p>"As
              far as I can discern," Bartal wrote, "the book contains not even one
              idea that has not been presented" in previous historical studies. Segev
              added that "Zand did not invent [his] thesis; 30 years before the
              Declaration of Independence, it was espoused by David Ben-Gurion,
              Yitzhak Ben-Zvi and others."</p>
              <p>One can reasonably argue that this
              ancient myth of a Jewish nation exiled until its 20th century return is
              of little consequence; whether the Jewish people share a common genetic
              ancestry or are a far-flung collection of people who share the same
              faith, a common national identity has in fact developed over the
              centuries. But Zand's central contention stands, and has some
              significant implications for the current conflict between Israel and
              the Palestinians.</p>
              <p><strong>Changing the Conversation?</strong></p>
              <p>The
              primary reason it's so difficult to discuss the conflict between
              Israelis and Palestinians is the remarkably effective job supporters of
              Israel's control of the Occupied Territories -- including Gaza, still
              under <em>de facto</em> occupation -- have done equating support for
              Palestinian self-determination with a desire to see the destruction of
              Israel. It effectively conflates any advocacy of Palestinian rights
              with the specter of Jewish extermination.</p>
              <p>That's certainly been
              the case with arguments for a single-state solution to the
              Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Until recent years, advocating a
              "single-state" solution -- a binational state where all residents of
              what are today Israel and the Occupied Territories share the full
              rights and responsibilities of citizenship -- was a relatively
              mainstream position to take. In fact, it was one of several competing
              plans considered by the United Nations when it created the state of
              Israel in the 1940s.</p>
              <p>But the idea of a single, binational state
              has more recently been marginalized -- dismissed as an attempt to
              destroy Israel literally and physically, rather than as an ethnic and
              religious-based political entity with a population of second-class Arab
              citizens and the legacy of responsibility for world's longest-standing
              refugee population.</p>
              <p>A logical conclusion of Zand's work exposing
              Israel's founding mythology may be the restoration of the idea of a
              one-state solution to a legitimate place in the debate over this
              contentious region. After all, while it muddies the waters in one sense
              -- raising ancient, biblical questions about just who the "children of
              Israel" really are -- in another sense, it hints at the commonalities
              that exist between Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs. Both groups lay
              claim to the same crust of earth, both have faced historic repression
              and displacement and both hold dear the idea that they should have a
              "right of return."</p>
              <p>And if both groups in fact share common
              biblical ties, then it begs the question of why the entirety of what
              was Palestine under the British mandate should remain a refuge for
              people of one religion instead of being a country in which Jews and
              Arabs are guaranteed equal protection -- equal protection under the
              laws of a state whose legitimacy would never again be open to question.</p>
