                                your view hold water maybe 10-20 years ago, but now not so. sg is more authoritarian than facist. and even then, less authoritarian now e.g. new media challenges authority, democracy is here except that people don't want to vote them out etc

              From wikipedia
              <br><br>
              Fascism, pronounced /ËˆfÃ¦ÊƒÉªzÉ™m/, comprises a radical and authoritarian nationalist political ideology[1][2][3][4] and a corporatist economic ideology. [5]
              <br><br>
              Fascists believe that nations and/or races are in perpetual conflict whereby only the strong can survive by being healthy, vital, and by asserting themselves in conflict against the weak.[6]<b> Fascists advocate the creation of a single-party state.[7] Fascist governments forbid and suppress criticism and opposition to the government and the fascist movement.</b>[8] 
              <br><br>
              
              There's no clear cut definition on fascism but imo any country governed with a cosmetics democracy while in fact it's ruled by dictatorship which neither a communist nor a true free economist is what I call fascism. Of course liberty and freedom cannot be expected from such countries. Control is the keyword in fascism countries. Total control of everything is the ideal of any fascism country. Freedom is the second casualty of such regime, the truth being the first. In such countries the regime view its own citizen as potential enemy combatant that needs to be controlled. Again control is the keyword in any fascism country.
              <br><br>
              The fact that the government could deny anybody on 'the list' fair economic opportunity and employment is a visible proof that those in rule has total control even in economy.

              Yes but in Singapore the condition is so bad. The government has too much control without proper check and balance. In other words your government can pretty much do ANYTHING to anyone without regard of the law. It's true if you say that government may have privilege and citizens have their rights but Singapore is ruled by basically a family regime which has maintained status quo for decades.

              <p><br> Yes but in Singapore the condition is so bad. The government has
              too much control without proper check and balance. In other words
              your government can pretty much do ANYTHING to anyone without
              regard of the law. It's true if you say that government may have
              privilege and citizens have their rights but Singapore is ruled by
              basically a family regime which has maintained status quo for
              decades.<br></p>

              <p>Define so bad to me.</p>
              <p>The vast majority are still fed and clothed. We still have access to running water and electricity, the internet is still cheaply available. We are free from religious and racist strife that plague our surrounding countries.</p>
              <p>Some would dispute my points by posting the homeless elderly in the streets, i am not denying their existence. But the fact remains that that the majority, and a vast majority is still housed and not sleeping in the streets.</p>
              <p>Yes, technically and legally the government may do whatever it wishes. That's why i'm so amused by you and polthepanda thinking the government is trying to get rid of you. There's no legistration that's stopping them from simply making both of you disappear(or simply cancel your visa with no explanation), instead leaving you on the net ranting about the government.</p>
              <p>I don't really buy the argument that the government has brainwashed the people and oppressed us so we wouldn't protest. Far harsher regimes have failed in this, and only North Korea succeeded by blocking its people to the world.</p>
              <p>Not one person i've spoke to about the government really liked all its policies or hail LKY as some omnipotent being.</p>
              <p>This "status quo" you speak has provided the majority of Singaporeans with a comfortable enough lifestyle, far better than most in Indonesia i reckon.</p>
              <p>That said however, i don't like how things are going and believe that the political status quo needs to change in order for Singapore to survive this century, the world is going to change rapidly in the next few decades and we can't depend on the tube cultured "talents" to react fast enough to this.</p>
              <p>I don't however, deny the fact that the PAP government has provided in the past simply because i disagree with it now.</p>
              <p>And i certainly do not appreciate foreigners demonizing my country, whether i agree with them or not. If you don't like my country go back to Indonesia and find yourself a university there, you're certainly rich enough to do that.</p>
