            <div class='col-md body'>Recent proposed changes to the GST and income tax rebates are recommended by the Economic Review Comm.Do you think it is justifiable at this time where unemployment rate is on the rise and the economy is only on the road to recovery(maybe)?<br><br>I personally have nothing against it but i thought it should be implemented only after a couple of year's time. And curbing the value of our dollar would only makes life worse, as that will cause prices of imported products(as if Sg has anything of its own!) to raise and it will have a direct impact for the jobless and lower income group.<br><br>Wonder what they mean by making Sg more competitive? Paying less tax attracts investors? But how many investors are keen at this time of economic depression? I am against the call for the GST Hike at this point of time as i feel the financial situation of an average Singaporean is unable cushion the increase, especially those with bigger households and flats and also those that had been retrenched.<br><br>Though they claim it's still one of the lowest in the world, why don't they compare how much people are earning there? And if i didn't remember wrongly, there was recommendation from the ERC(i think) not to have a pay hike...so same input, higher output, what does that make us? Poorer citizens?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Eyezer (edited 12 April 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why the GST hike come about? Most probably it's because of the too high corporate tax that put investor off as compared to other regional area like malaysia or china. And most likely, they feel the pinch when they found their income tax so high since they are earning too high a salary. So they want a decrease in personal income tax and let the burden to be spread out to those poor people out there thru GST hike. How much rebate and benefit can the low income pple get when their income tax are negligible due to their low income? You mean rebate until the government start paying the poor $$$ instead? bullshit i guess.<br><br>But what i think is this : Whether GST hike is justifiable or not, What can you do? Go on strike?? They want to implement, they will implement no matter what you say. We have no voice to speak against them.</div>
