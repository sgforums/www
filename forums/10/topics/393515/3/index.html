              <p>99 year lease condo / 999 year lease condo/ Freehold ?</p>
              <p>HDB quality vs Condo quality.</p>

              <p>Angel,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do not know where you get the idea that parents are mostly rich enough to pay off a HDB flat for their only son. Yes, there are people who did that but I bet they are the minority.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The lower income group is EXPANDING rather than dminishing. I am asking HDB for the specific details or statistics on certain things before I will make my conclusions on the rejection of the alloted flats. You are right, they can wait but with the prices that need a 30 years mortgage, I don't think they have much time left. Imagine if you are to marry at 30 years old, you need to take out all money from CPF to pay for your flat for 30 years, it would mean that by 60 years old when you finished paying your mortgage, you won't have much money left in CPF for your retirement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope you are not asking parents to take care of their children's retirement also?</p>

              <p><br>Well, Meng Seng,</p>
              <p>There are, in fact 80% of Singapore are pampering their son too much, those who worked for 30 to 40 years, got their CPF or profit from insurance mature couple with good saving habits are pouring money in to their decendents. That is why today youngs are not so energetic and hardworking as their father/mother or grandfather/mother, because most are given silver spoon or bronze spoon to feed on, i am not saying that today son are spoil, but because of one to two child in the family, parents + grandparents poured all their hopes and saving into them making them less hunger to strive and work hard. Most of these young peoples job hop here and there, no job to them is ok, unlike their father last time, no job is a serious problem. And yet, most will pick and choose the best comfortable job unlike my father time, got job very happy liao.</p>
              <p>So i think society in Singapore had changed, a family with one son will give all to the only son, the 70s and 80s generation have a good saving habit, unlike today youth like me, and their purpose to save is for raining days, and when the son got a problem with marriage, ah kong, papa and ah ma, mama  is alway there to help..them buy a house, or even a car.</p>

              <p>Some of the singaporeans snapping up properties are for investment purpose, they had calculated the gain after 5 years of loans. That is why govt had changed the policies to avoid people using property as an investment.</p>
              <p>Property is the best investment now, if own a 1 million dollar condo, in 5 times, given everything is still peaceful, if can go up to 1.8 million, a 800k gain. And it is not something that you cannot predict or put your money in shares and stocks whereby it landed in the hand of some corporation investment. You have a better control over it. Moreover, you can rent out during the period of ownership, go on with yr own work and business and in 5 years time, you take 800k like me. Keep some of it and invest in another property. For a layman on the street, i think within 5 years, he can hardly save 800k. Now you know why people drive BM, Merc, Lexus, jaguar etc etc and live in 3 storey landed property....</p>
