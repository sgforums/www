              <p>I find it very amusing that when the flat owners were selling their flats at high prices with high COV, no one seems to complain that the HDB policies are bad.

              <p><br>wha lau sista, my dad brought me up also no need 230k lor,...I attend goverment school, pay very less school fees, somemore govt give us edusave. Poly per year only 5 thousand, since young, my Dad only give me $5 per day, i walk to school, and go home, then at Sec 3, i work already,...all the way to poly, make my own money and find my own life out...therefore, by now, i am streetsmart than most of those spoonfeeding and milk feeding kids of my age.</p>
              <p>Tho my dad is able doing, that does not mean i take his money and spent lavishly, he taught be to be self sustain, independent and be wise in life. Unlike most the kids today, double income parents working to support their lavishly life with travelling, best iphone, games, watches, fashion, foods....most are spoiled, and when they come out of the shell, they see the HDB flat prices, they feel that they are unable to afford and make so much noises out of it. If cannot buy a flat, rent first lah, slowly makes money and than buy a flat, at least set your objective right. ALL night partying at St James, drink starbuck coffee, eat sakae suishi and expensive restaurant, go korea, japan, europe tour, buy sport car, change hp every 3 months, buy gucci and CK or branded goods and fashion....i give you $10000 per month pay also finish, want to buy HDB, save first lah, like me, eat ice kacang, drink 3 in 1, think only of making money, buy thailand fashion clothing, use a normal h/p, go NTUC buy foods and cook myself, go malaysia and thailand tour only or back to my taiwan,..u can save ya.</p>
              <p>So young peoples of singapore have to look at themselve first before saying that they cannot afford to buy HDB, a great shame to them who are mostly U or poly grad, when their grandfather who works as a General worker with a paid of only $120 and able to pay a flat of $50,000.</p>

              <p>Hi Angel7030,</p>
              <p>You are comparing a private business entity with a Government entity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I have explained clearly that the social contract between the people and the government is that, Land Acquisition Act would provide the government the power to acquire land at dirt cheap price so that Land redistribution could be done to serve the interests of all Singaporeans. In return, we are expecting the government to redevelop the land and provide CHEAP (REALLY SUBSIDIZED in the past) BASIC Public Housing for the majority of Singaporeans. This is a kind of Land Reform act.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No other private firms will have such privileges. PAP government is NOT keep to the deal when they starts to make huge profits out of the Land Acquisition Act and HDB flats.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, your comparison is quite irrelevant here. Private companies do not need to account to their customers in terms of cost and pricing but the Government of the day which was empowered by the people to have certain privileged powers will have to be accountable to the people!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many governments of the world face problem of Land Reform because the rich and powerful resisted laws like Land Acquisition Act. Singapore government is fortunate to inherit such powers which could make effective land reforms in the early years. However, they must not forget their part of the deal, provide cheap basic public housing for the populus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not even suggesting to revert to the old days, whereby REAL COST Subsidies were given to citizens back in the 1970s and 1980s.  I am just merely suggesting that we don't want any "subsidies" but just sell us at cost price!</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi Angel7030,</p>
              <p>You are comparing a private business entity with a Government entity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I have explained clearly that the social contract between the people and the government is that, Land Acquisition Act would provide the government the power to acquire land at dirt cheap price so that Land redistribution could be done to serve the interests of all Singaporeans. In return, we are expecting the government to redevelop the land and provide CHEAP (REALLY SUBSIDIZED in the past) BASIC Public Housing for the majority of Singaporeans. This is a kind of Land Reform act.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No other private firms will have such privileges. PAP government is NOT keep to the deal when they starts to make huge profits out of the Land Acquisition Act and HDB flats.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, your comparison is quite irrelevant here. Private companies do not need to account to their customers in terms of cost and pricing but the Government of the day which was empowered by the people to have certain privileged powers will have to be accountable to the people!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many governments of the world face problem of Land Reform because the rich and powerful resisted laws like Land Acquisition Act. Singapore government is fortunate to inherit such powers which could make effective land reforms in the early years. However, they must not forget their part of the deal, provide cheap basic public housing for the populus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not even suggesting to revert to the old days, whereby REAL COST Subsidies were given to citizens back in the 1970s and 1980s.  I am just merely suggesting that we don't want any "subsidies" but just sell us at cost price!</p>

              <p>Dear Meng Seng,</p>
              <p>As i said and posted, our govt, tho politicians, are not politically train, they are more business and laws base trained, so, in a nutshell, they rule this place with the like of a Incorporation with a business law co ops in it.</p>
              <p>The day the voters mandated them to be the govt, the day they are given the consitutional right to goven here without the need of you or mine endorsement, things like Land Acquisition Act are exactly the kind of business law they enact on it to make it look so beautiful within a framework of the social laws. In fact, in layman term, if they dun go thru this act and take the land at zero prices, it is still their perogatives as 66.6% peoples mandated their action. So what more can you say...those laws are for show.</p>
              <p>I agree that in term of percentage between paid and price of a flat, there is signicficant increase in comparing with the flat in the 80s, but remember today flat come with good surrounding amenities, park and garden, rooms are also rennovated in a sense that you dun hv to spend much on it. What the govt is doing now is telling people, be realistic, it is not going to be the good old day where govt gives alot of subsidization and can allow default in payment. Being realistic of the market price of a flat gives a person or a couple the real issue at hand, and it is not out of the reach of a new couple, as i said, certainly the govt will not set a price that nobody can afford, because govt also want people to build family and borne childrens here.</p>

              <p>It is simple Mathematics. If my Father's generation only pay 10to 15 years mortgage while I pay 20 years, it would be obvious to many people that for our children to pay 30 years mortgage means that asset inflation has outstripped income growth for the past 30years.</p>

              <p>Flats built in the 80s and 90s are BIGGER in size. For example, a 4 room flat built in early 1990s is as big as a 5 room flat now! In other places, they price properties according to dollar per square feet but HDB uses such a misrepresentation of "room flat".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you still think that HDB flats are affordable now, I really have nothing else to say but be prepared for your children to pay a 40 yearts mortgage in years to come.</p>

              <p>Dear Meng Seng,</p>
              <p>Frankly, today parents are mostly rich enuf to pay off a HDB flat for their only son, that is what the govt is looking at, and some even buy condo for them as a wedding gift.</p>
              <p>I think people here are looking from a perspectives of lower income group, that is only 15% and diminishing, it is unlike the 80s, peoples just want a roof on top, so simple flat are build, today, peoples are more choosy, imagine 40% eligible applicants rejected their given flat just because of lower floor, facing wrong direction etc etc..that incur that peoples are now more influential, they can wait because their parents have houses, unlike in the 80s where no one in family is a house ownership.</p>
              <p>Of course the term of paying is up to individual, you can pay it right off, 10 years, 20 years..all up to you and your ability.</p>

              <p>I do not know where you get the idea that parents are mostly rich enough to pay off a HDB flat for their only son. Yes, there are people who did that but I bet they are the minority.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The lower income group is EXPANDING rather than dminishing. I am asking HDB for the specific details or statistics on certain things before I will make my conclusions on the rejection of the alloted flats. You are right, they can wait but with the prices that need a 30 years mortgage, I don't think they have much time left. Imagine if you are to marry at 30 years old, you need to take out all money from CPF to pay for your flat for 30 years, it would mean that by 60 years old when you finished paying your mortgage, you won't have much money left in CPF for your retirement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope you are not asking parents to take care of their children's retirement also?</p>

              <p>It is easy to compare HK to Sg because both have scarce land resources. However, Hong Kong belong to PRC and you may not be aware that most Hong Konger have properties in main land China. It takes only less than an hour trian ride to cross over the boarder to Shenzhen. Unlike foreigners, it is very convenience for them to clear immigration (so dont compare us with Johor).</p>
              <p>In Hong Kong, the property price in Kowlong is not expensive and they have far more land than Singapore. The problem with Hong Kong on property is that they are not able to restrict mainlander PRC from buying their properties. Indeed, their government encourage mainlander property investment in Hong Kong as their main source of budget revenue (Hong Kong has very low personal taxes, company taxes and no VAT). Do you think Hong Kong ppl are not complaining? yes, there are endless protest over the runaway property price but Hong Kong government cant allow taxes increases as it will open the door for more communist PRC central government interfering in their domestic politics.</p>

              <p><br> wha lau sista, my dad brought me up also no need 230k lor,...I
                  attend goverment school, pay very less school fees, somemore govt
                  give us edusave. Poly per year only 5 thousand, since young, my Dad
                  only give me $5 per day, i walk to school, and go home, then at Sec
                  3, i work already,...all the way to poly, make my own money and
                  find my own life out...therefore, by now, i am streetsmart than
                  most of those spoonfeeding and milk feeding kids of my age.</p>
              <p>Tho my dad is able doing, that does not mean i take his money
                  and spent lavishly, he taught be to be self sustain, independent
                  and be wise in life. Unlike most the kids today, double income
                  parents working to support their lavishly life with travelling,
                  best iphone, games, watches, fashion, foods....most are spoiled,
                  and when they come out of the shell, they see the HDB flat prices,
                  they feel that they are unable to afford and make so much noises
                  out of it. If cannot buy a flat, rent first lah, slowly makes money
                  and than buy a flat, at least set your objective right. ALL night
                  partying at St James, drink starbuck coffee, eat sakae suishi and
                  expensive restaurant, go korea, japan, europe tour, buy sport car,
                  change hp every 3 months, buy gucci and CK or branded goods and
                  fashion....i give you $10000 per month pay also finish, want to buy
                  HDB, save first lah, like me, eat ice kacang, drink 3 in 1, think
                  only of making money, buy thailand fashion clothing, use a normal
                  h/p, go NTUC buy foods and cook myself, go malaysia and thailand
                  tour only or back to my taiwan,..u can save ya.</p>
              <p>So young peoples of singapore have to look at themselve first
                  before saying that they cannot afford to buy HDB, a great shame to
                  them who are mostly U or poly grad, when their grandfather who
                  works as a General worker with a paid of only $120 and able to pay
                  a flat of $50,000.</p>

              <p><br>Face very important to them.    There are some who just manage (not rich, holding not high post, salary ok, not high)  to afford it go for condo.    Never have a thought of how to pay if they lose their jobs , no thought on their savings can allow them financing the housing loan.</p>
