              <p>Hi Mr Goh Meng Seng,</p>
              <p>I am puzzled why the term 'Enslavement' given that the Majority had all the time in the world to Reject these policies by their votes decades ago and the fact that precisely this Majority are the ones who Voted for them?</p>
              <p>But i wonder if ALL voters can vote, how many more votes the Opposition  can get?</p>
              <p>At least up to now, i would say that the Majority citizens do not feel paying for  HDB is an Enslavement. They simply seem to accept it as part of life. Cars also. Cars that are , unbeknownst to some, the most Expensive in the entire milky way.</p>

              <p>actually goh meng seng is an opposition party member who is often nato. And he spends a considerable amount of time debating shit in sammyboy forums.</p>
              <p>now he says at cost? haha. He's got to consider factors like salaries, overheads etc too. If his suggestion is implemented, i would find our gst going up again very soon.</p>

              <p>There are two main components of cost in pricing an apt, namely the value of land and the cost of constructing the building. As we all agreed, the govern is not in the business of profiting from the citizen and should therefore be selling PUBLIC housing at 'COST'. What actually Singaporean is asking for is transparency in costing public housing and make known the components that make up the selliing price of these houses.</p>
              <p>Every commodities prices will increase with inflation, same with the price of housing. We agree that the value of land will increase faster than the cost of construction. In the pricing of public housing, we do not know how the government is pricing the land and consequently what was included as land cost in the apt.</p>
              <p>As I mentioned many times, the cost of construction is not a major cost component in an apt. I can testify to it because we have many projects being build in China. The ave construction cost for a good quality apt in Spore (with higher labour cost) should be abt 1-2K SGD m2. (comparing to 50K to 100K m2 in PRC) Hence it will cost btw 100K to 200K SGD for an apt including facilities. Also dont be fooled that 'make in china' is of inferior quality as the Chinese steel and cements used for construction have higher specification and safety factor than Spore.</p>
              <p>The problem is that if the govern will benchmark the land cost of public housing against the tender price of land for private property developement (which causes higher land price sales for EC development), Singaporean will pay for a significantly higher house mortage in future and lowering their standard of living. In many countries, this is an indirect tax collection method from the government. (which is happening in Hong Kong now since they dont have VAT and low corporate tax, hence the major source of government revenue is through the sales of land).</p>

              <p>If you believe that the reserve build is for the future of Singapore, than you are total misleaded. Managing fiscal finance is diff from managing a company finance. Surplus for company is known as profit and it is essential as a return to Shareholders and for future investment of the company. Whilst as a country, the fiscal surplus is not necessary capable to be utilised for raining day in the future. Why? Unlike company, government surplus are likely to be accumlated in the form of local currency, which in turn, deposit with local banks. In so doing, the govern effectively take the money supply out of the nation. Hence in order that these surplus do not jeopardise the economy, the government should and must 'return' the money to the economy in many other ways. Unfortunately, there are not many option for doing so since spending must flow through the budget.</p>
              <p>These surplus are likely to be invested in foreign currency or purchase of other country securities, including bonds. (they cannot buy SGD bond since it cancel the effect and take money supply out of the local economy). It is also unwise to invest in local share market since this will create assets inflation. Hence, in the case of Singapore government, they will continue to export or ship our money out via buying of foreign bonds or investing via country sovereign funds.</p>
              <p>In the event of a world economy downturns, although theoritically, the govern can sell the bond and soverign fund shares, it is likely to be useless as what happened in the past, share value will be depressed and selling it than will create a major loss to the country.</p>
              <p>Hence, it is the responsibility of country government to ensure it has a balance budget, not extra ordinary amt of budget surplus or deficit that will hurt the econcomy and burden the future generation citizens.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Goh Meng Seng,</p>
              <p>Welcome back.</p>
              <p>I have some questions, and some ideas I'd like to discuss and expand on.....</p>
              <p>Do you think that these HDB related issues have contributed to the low birth rate of Singapore?</p>
              <p>Do you think HDB has created social segregation, similar to educational streaming and the like?</p>
              <p>What do you think is the root cause for the asset inflation going up faster than real wages?</p>
              <p>Do you think the HDB model of government involvement in providing 80-85% of housing, is a positive, or a negative? Do you think it may be suitable for a certain time in the past, but unsuitable now? Do you think it violates the principles of free-market economics and actually distort the supply and demand and result in net negative effect?</p>
              <p>HDB is closely related to government , and banks,  (with all those loans). In other sense, homes can serve as capital. But now, 80-85% of Singaporeans' capital is tied to the government and the big banks. Do you think if there is a free-market real estate, and more home ownership, Singapore would have more entrepreneurs and more economic vitality and activities ?</p>
              <p>Thank you, Mr Goh Meng Seng.</p>
              <p>I wish you all the best.</p>
              <p>I request that you examine these issues and go deeper, because HDB is much more than just simple issue.</p>

              <p>Hi Bao,</p>
              <p>HDB is never a simple issue, especially so when CPF was allowed to be used to finance the purchase.</p>
              <p>High HDB prices will definitely affect a whole spectrum of social decisions, like when to marry (well, the most common reason of getting married is about applying for HDB flats) and how much money left for retirement after the mortgage payment. When couples find it difficult to afford HDB flat, they will delay their marriage and inevitably, affect their family planning of having babies.</p>
              <p>PAP is an expect of social engineering. There are good and bad sides of it. Social segregation is part of the deal.</p>
              <p>Excess Liquidity is always the prime culprit of asset bubble. HDB flats went into overdrive back in early 1990s when CPF was liberalized for people to buy resale flats and the HDB flats were allowed to be traded in resale market. This created a sudden surge in liquidity. Similary, now we have additional liquidity injected by new PRs which in turn pushes up the prices.</p>
              <p>HDB, as a socialist tool of supplying 80% of housing needs could be a good stabilizer. Unfortunately, the present PAP government has tweaked this system from the socialist perspective into a capitalist one. This is a disaster in the making because it would mean creating a monster monopoly in capitalist terms. This is a bit complex thing to talk about here.</p>
              <p>The capitalist free market may not be the best mechanism to deal with housing/ land distribution. This is the due to the fact that those who are rich will tend to put their excess liquidity into assets like properties. The working class will suffer as a result because their income growth could never rival the growth in wealth or income of the top capitalists. It will create a situation of extremely lopsided distribution of wealth in terms of housing and land. Many past revolution were created due to this failure of fair distribution of land and housing in the ancient feudal systems.</p>
              <p>The problem is that the PAP government does not believe in renting flats. For those people to liquidate their assets to get money and invest in their businesses and such, they must first learn that owning a house is not the top priority. If you could lower your liability by renting a flat or even rooms to save enough for you to invest in your business, then you could make your dream come true. But this is a social mindset. PAP has been too successful in their social engineering effort that Singaporeans do not think that way any more.</p>

              <p>okie .... great ....</p>
              <p>so Mr Goh ... if, say, you were to looking at selling your HDB flat, would you be willing to sell it back to the HDB at the price you got it at .... or to sell it to another couple at the same price you got it at ?</p>
              <p>I suppose not .......</p>
              <p>and that's the flip side of the coin .....</p>
              <p>if you were looking at buying a house now, of course you'd be moaning and bitching about the prices .... but if you were already a house owner, like so many other Singaporeans, would you not be overjoyed at the high prices now ? And that's the conundrum here, people who were looking at buying a flat would be bitching about high prices, but once they transition from a home buyer to a home owner, they'd be bitching about prices going lower on them, depreciating their asset ! Ironic isn't it ?</p>
              <p>I am a property agent on the weekends, and while it's true enough that there were some crazy HDB deals recently, you don't have to be one of those foreign suckers that pay 200-300k COV premiums to get a resale flat. Many of the potential clients I come across have a bad case of keeping up with the joneses. A couple earning only 5k + a month combined, shouldn't be looking at 600k+ flats in the first place. People like these have no one but themselves to blame when they discover that they've overstretched themselves ... Before I even show them any properties I'd try to sit them down and work out some sums with them but they'd go AHHH ! and say can one lah, or say "I die die one only want this estate and nowhere else !" ... What can anyone do for these people ?</p>
              <p>And of course, Singapore is only so big, if you want this and want that, want good schools, MRT, close to the city easy commute quiet neighbourhood, then be prepared to pay ! This is market forces at work, and unfortunately we are not north korea. And of course, even if the men-in-white promises everyone a roof over their heads, that doesn't mean everyone gets a 5 room high floor HDB flat with an MRT nearby but not close enough to be noisy, with a branded school within walking distance, markets and and shops 10 minutes away, right next to their parents, and want it cheap when they were buying it, but want it to be pricey when they want to sell it ! Ai pee, ai chee, ai tua liap nee ? Perhaps only when buying durians !! Anyone want the good life, then be prepared to work hard for it. I work hard for mine.</p>
              <p>There ARE still cheap flats around, if anyone actually engages a good agent (*ahem !), or actually bother to look beyond what they perceive to be their "must haves". And if anyone actually bothers to plough through the HDB policies and grant guidelines, you'd discover that while our goverment has goofed up on a lot of things, the HDB and our housing policy is not quite one of those.</p>
              <p>And for those aspiring home owners out there. Here's a basic guideline, if your combined monthly CPF ordinary account contributions cannot cover your monthly loan payments, then you're overstretched, and the flat you're looking at is too expensive for you, look for a cheaper place, please !</p>
              <p>Of course, if Mr Goh is willing to help out another needy Singaporean couple and sell his HDB house for cheap, at below valuation, I'd be most willing to help, I would waive my side of the agent fees even.</p>

              <p>okie .... great ....</p>
              <p>so Mr Goh ... if, say, you were to looking at selling your HDB flat, would you be willing to sell it back to the HDB at the price you got it at .... or to sell it to another couple at the same price you got it at ?</p>
              <p>I suppose not .......</p>
              <p>and that's the flip side of the coin .....</p>
              <p>if you were looking at buying a house now, of course you'd be moaning and bitching about the prices .... but if you were already a house owner, like so many other Singaporeans, would you not be overjoyed at the high prices now ? And that's the conundrum here, people who were looking at buying a flat would be bitching about high prices, but once they transition from a home buyer to a home owner, they'd be bitching about prices going lower on them, depreciating their asset ! Ironic isn't it ?</p>
              <p>I am a property agent on the weekends, and while it's true enough that there were some crazy HDB deals recently, you don't have to be one of those foreign suckers that pay 200-300k COV premiums to get a resale flat. Many of the potential clients I come across have a bad case of keeping up with the joneses. A couple earning only 5k + a month combined, shouldn't be looking at 600k+ flats in the first place. People like these have no one but themselves to blame when they discover that they've overstretched themselves ... Before I even show them any properties I'd try to sit them down and work out some sums with them but they'd go AHHH ! and say can one lah, or say "I die die one only want this estate and nowhere else !" ... What can anyone do for these people ?</p>
              <p>And of course, Singapore is only so big, if you want this and want that, want good schools, MRT, close to the city easy commute quiet neighbourhood, then be prepared to pay ! This is market forces at work, and unfortunately we are not north korea. And of course, even if the men-in-white promises everyone a roof over their heads, that doesn't mean everyone gets a 5 room high floor HDB flat with an MRT nearby but not close enough to be noisy, with a branded school within walking distance, markets and and shops 10 minutes away, right next to their parents, and want it cheap when they were buying it, but want it to be pricey when they want to sell it ! Ai pee, ai chee, ai tua liap nee ? Perhaps only when buying durians !! Anyone want the good life, then be prepared to work hard for it. I work hard for mine.</p>
              <p>There ARE still cheap flats around, if anyone actually engages a good agent (*ahem !), or actually bother to look beyond what they perceive to be their "must haves". And if anyone actually bothers to plough through the HDB policies and grant guidelines, you'd discover that while our goverment has goofed up on a lot of things, the HDB and our housing policy is not quite one of those.</p>
              <p>And for those aspiring home owners out there. Here's a basic guideline, if your combined monthly CPF ordinary account contributions cannot cover your monthly loan payments, then you're overstretched, and the flat you're looking at is too expensive for you, look for a cheaper place, please !</p>
              <p>Of course, if Mr Goh is willing to help out another needy Singaporean couple and sell his HDB house for cheap, at below valuation, I'd be most willing to help, I would waive my side of the agent fees even.</p>

              <p><br>FYI,</p>
              <p>Mr Goh is not going to lease his house out yet, and even if he did, he dun needs an agent.</p>
              <p>On the hindsight, after taking people money to service people, why you care so much about what people wants, if they want near MRT, shopping centres and so on, and are willing to pay with their pathetic 5k income, so be it, you, to me is a lousy agent. An agent should be customer orientated, and more so, with higher prices, your pathetic 1 or 2% will be more.</p>
              <p>There are many singaporeans and even foreigner alike doing a do first, talk later kind of stuff, they buy big cars, big houses, invest here and there, this make them works harder, let them be, if a couple with a 5k income wants a 5 rooms so be it, loan from banks and let them struggle thru, in fact, most will buck up and take on higher paid job and become more responsible in their life because of the burden of paying the loan plus interest. In another words, it stimulates their senses to work smarter and harder.</p>
              <p>Singapore is abit different from other countries, in other countries, most average or poor can only dream of having a nice house, to achieve that, they built their nest and hope that one day, they can achieve their dream house, but in Singapore, you can fulfil your dream first, than you work out to a die die situation to support the reality.</p>
              <p>Let people have a choice, doesn't mean earning 5k is going to be 5k forever, the years after, can become 50k. And please note that when the govt said having a roof on top, if also imply bus -stop and tents at ECP ya.</p>

              <p>Furthermore, there are TWO markets; resale market and new flat market. I am NOT advocating the government to intervene in resale market. The government HDB is the MONOPOLY supplier of new flats; i.e.  they can control the prices of these new flats. Won't it be great for Singaporeans to buy at cost price from HDB but sell at market price in the resale market? ;)</p>
