              <p><br>Aiya, Sista Jojo,</p>
              <p>We call this true lies, these are good lies, just like when you were a kid and your mom would like to you that there is a fairy Godmother some where looking after you.</p>
              <p>For those pathetic ones who are living in a HDB flat, please look around your flat, very squaredish just like prisoner cells with a bit of nice decoration you have to pay for it, i bet those canada inmates are living better than HDB (canada being the best prison).</p>
              <p>And across yr prison, u can see your neighbour ah pek changing trouser or ah ma cooking curry  or if you are luckier, a handsome six packs' hunk baring all for our pleasure. And the noise of gate smashing, doors banging, people talking, shouting, baby crying etc etc...perhaps you may wonder why such a cell home with door gate  shut and locked looking like prison rather than a flat is selling at half a million sing dollars???</p>
              <p>Well, it all voice down to psychology, Sing Govt is very good in playing psychology with their citizens, and poor citizens seem to buy into it, by rising price of their HDB flat is never a lose lose situation, first, citizens living in HDB flat knowing that their flat are now very much higher, gives them the confident and proud to be the LEASE owners, secondly, Govt can collect more and more money with just a plot of land of 100 m sq, they can build a 50 storeys high HDB, and all the leasers are paying the price of the land when actually most are not even  living in the land but rather, most HDB leasers are living in the air. AIR..ya. That is why those who live in private home like me, the term is call Landed Property, and for HDB, the hidden name should be Aired Property on lease</p>

              <p>I read that for a 99 year lease HDB flat, you are listed as a "leasee" in legal documents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But for 99 year lease private condo, you are listed as "owner" in the legal documents.  Meaning you can rent out the property without restrictions etc.</p>

              <p>People are paying a lot for HDB because there is no other choice.  You either stay in HDB (expensive), or private (very expensive), or roam the streets (cheap).</p>

              <p>Well, we do hve motel many years liao, but only 1, and that is small, mostly for couples.</p>
              <p>To be cheap, better and faster, about 1 year ago, the Angel's board of directors decided to expand our business after studying into the situation and entertainment market. Joo Chiat as you known, was cleared of massage parlour from 33 sleazily parlours to 3 legal parlour by our bald headed MP Chan Soo Seng. If he dun do it, his balded head may drop.</p>
              <p>As we look into our pub business, we see many customers drink until drunk and some even vomitted, especially those new birds from army or yuppies who dunno how to drink but gulp alcohol like big gulp of 7/11. sure gone case. So we want to provide an all inclusive service to our customers, we decided to buy over those sleazily massage parlour which was selling at a low price due to license validation or being confiscation because of illegal pros business captured. We provide them place to rest and stay overnite, so that they can rest well, we also provide service to inform their commanders or employers of their condition the next day, if it is a working day.</p>
              <p>Last time we provide drivers to sent customer and their cars back, but we face lots of problem, first, customer complain things lost in car, and some of them are so drunk that they wanted our driver to bring them here and there and also cannot remember their house address...end up with PRC gals in some hotel. So, it was maddness.</p>
