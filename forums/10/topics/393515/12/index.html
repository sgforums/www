               Goh Meng Seng pledges to sell flat to fund election bid<br>Posted by Ng
               E-Jay on April 21, 2010 <br>By Ng E-Jay<br><br>The Secretary-General of
               the National Solidarity Party (NSP), Mr Goh Meng Seng, has revealed to 
              close associates and supporters that he intends to sell his HDB flat in 
              Serangoon North in order to fund his upcoming election campaign.<br><br>This
               was announced on Mr Tan Kin Lian’s blog as well as on the Sammyboy 
              Alfresco Coffeeshop forum. Mr Goh had helped the ex-NTUC chief deliver 
              the mandarin versions of his speeches at Hong Lim Park in late 2008 
              during the Lehman minibond saga.<br><br>TOC’s Political Desk caught up 
              with Mr Goh Meng Seng yesterday to enquire about his decision to go “all
               in” against the incumbent People’s Action Party (PAP).<br><br>According
               to Mr Goh, NSP President Sebestian Teo has himself committed personal 
              funds to finance NSP’s election bid. As Secretary-General of the party, 
              Mr Goh feels that he should throw in his lot as well. Thus, Mr Goh, in 
              consultation with his wife, made the decision to sell his flat last week
               in order to contribute to NSP’s election war chest. He says his wife 
              has been very supportive and understanding.<br><br>Mr Goh emphasized 
              that he need not sell his flat if he merely intended to fund his own 
              election battle. However, he feels that as a leader of the party, the 
              onus is on him to personally tend to what he terms “the bigger strategic
               campaign” of NSP.<br><br>The amount of money that each election 
              candidate must spend can be daunting. The election deposit alone is 
              around $14,000 per candidate. In addition, every candidate must be 
              prepared to spend an additional $10,000 if he is a member of a GRC team,
               and more if he stands in a single member ward. Mr Goh feels that 
              leaders of NSP should be willing to assist with the finances of their 
              candidates.<br><br>A “make or break” strategy?<br><br>Every since Mr Goh
               started dabbling in opposition politics, he had made it clear to all 
              what his political stand is. In his view, he should either stay in 
              Singapore and try to initiate change to the political system, which 
              includes fighting against the PAP’s unfair election tactics, such as 
              gerrymandering and pork-barrel politics via the HDB upgrading carrot, or
               he should leave Singapore altogether for the sake of his children.<br><br>He
               says that after over a decade in opposition politics, he has to be 
              answerable to his family, having sacrificed so much time that could have
               been spent with his family. If his next election bid yields no results 
              for him, he says he might have to leave politics altogether. By selling 
              his flat, he is not only putting his money where his mouth is, but also 
              committing himself to a final confrontation with the PAP.<br><br>He says
               he will leave it to voters to decide if his party and his political 
              stand is worth voting for, and that he would have no regrets either way 
              it turns out. He says that even if he loses, at least he can answer to 
              his children with a clear conscience that he has done his best.<br><br>In
               a nutshell, what exactly is Mr Goh’s grouse against the government’s 
              housing policies?<br><br>It is best to quote Mr Goh Meng Seng’s reply 
              verbatim:<br><br>My main attack on HDB is its role as the monopoly in 
              the new HDB flat market. The government is empowered by the people to 
              acquire land at dirt cheap prices and it has acquired near to 80% of 
              land in the past. Many small land lords have made sacrifices due to the 
              acquisition by the government. However, it is the responsibility to 
              redistribute this acquired land to the masses by means of providing 
              cheap public housing via HDB.<br><br>HDB is shirking off this role and 
              responsibility by pegging its new HDB flats with the resale market 
              prices. This is not right and this is what I am fighting against.<br><br>When
               the cheapest flat in town as in new HDB flat needs a 30 years mortgage 
              to be paid for and Singaporeans are expected to sell their flats for 
              their retirement, it is very obvious that something is very wrong with 
              the whole system.<br><br>Two final points by Mr Goh<br><br>Mr Goh Meng 
              Seng said he has two final points he would like to make at this 
              juncture. Again, I quote him verbatim:<br><br>1. Freedom is NOT FREE. 
              Singaporeans get to vote because of the sacrifices made by many people. <br><br>2.
               Politics, be it opposition or ruling party, is a means to Public 
              Service. Sacrifices are expected from politicians of both sides. <br><br><br>Mr
               Goh Meng Seng’s political background<br><br>Mr Goh Meng Seng stood in 
              Aljunied GRC under a Worker’s Party (WP) ticket during the 2006 general 
              elections. His team, led by Ms Sylvia Lim, clinched 43.9% of the valid 
              votes, the highest percentage scorer after elected opposition MPs Low 
              Thia Khiang in Hougang and Chiam See Tong in Potong Pasir.<br><br>Following
               his resignation from WP after the 2006 elections, Mr Goh joined the 
              NSP. He was elected as Secretary-General in February 2010. Upon taking 
              up his new leadership role, Mr Goh initiated an aggressive campaign 
              against the PAP’s flawed housing policies that have caused prices of HDB
               flats to escalate out of control in recent years. He intends to make 
              this an election issue and give disenfranchised Singaporeans a credible 
              alternative to the PAP.<br><br></span></p>

              <p>Dear Mr. Ng,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your essay on Mr Goh is very contradicting indeed.</p>
              <p>Mr Goh is going sell his HDB to fund his aspiration and committment to NSP,  and there you are, talking about HDB prices going up which Mr. Goh will champion it as his key agenda in this coming election.  Now without a good price in HDB, is he able to fund his movement?? I would say, this is like someone knocking his own head with his own prxck. How on earth can you compalin about one thing and yet use that thing to your advantages, that is absolutely nonsense.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And correction for Mr Tan foremer status, he is never a NTUC chief, he was a fromer NTUC income CEO, that is all.</p>
              <p>Indeed, we do admire Mr Goh good causes to win and change singapore landscape in housing, but such essay by you is going to kill him straight off the election. I will not be surpirse that even his downpayment will be confiscated due to votes below specific guideline if you kepp coming out such eassy.</p>
              <p> </p>

This is not right and this is what I am fighting against.<br><br>When the cheapest flat in town as in new HDB flat needs a 30 years mortgage to be paid for and Singaporeans are expected to sell their flats for their retirement, it is very obvious that something is very wrong with the whole system.<br><br>Two final points by Mr Goh<br><br>Mr Goh Meng Seng said he has two final points he would like to make at this juncture. Again, I quote him verbatim:<br><br>1. Freedom is NOT FREE. Singaporeans get to vote because of the sacrifices made by many people.<br><br>2. Politics, be it opposition or ruling party, is a means to Public Service. Sacrifices are expected from politicians of both sides.<br><br><br>Mr Goh Meng Seng’s political background<br><br>Mr Goh Meng Seng stood in Aljunied GRC under a Worker’s Party (WP) ticket during the 2006 general elections. His team, led by Ms Sylvia Lim, clinched 43.9% of the valid votes, the highest percentage scorer after elected opposition MPs Low Thia Khiang in Hougang and Chiam See Tong in Potong Pasir.<br><br>Following his resignation from WP after the 2006 elections, Mr Goh joined the NSP. He was elected as Secretary-General in February 2010. Upon taking up his new leadership role, Mr Goh initiated an aggressive campaign against the PAP’s flawed housing policies that have caused prices of HDB flats to escalate out of control in recent years. He intends to make this an election issue and give disenfranchised Singaporeans a credible alternative to the PAP.<br><br></span></p>

              <p>I applaud and respect Mr Goh Meng Seng for his decision to sell his HDB flat to fund NSP election campaigns. A man that is true to his beliefs with real action deserves respect. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Another HDB issue im concerned about is how some people are asking to increase the 8k income ceiling to purchase hdb flats as they cannot afford private properties.  Unless they are burdened with health issues that they have to pay high medical costs, i dont think they should fight with people like me who have kids to feed and our househould combined salary are only 3kplus per month. Increasing 8k income ceiling will increase the property price further.  I have friends and relatives whose household income are lesser than us. We lead simple lives and eat 3 meals a day. I laugh when i read some forummers earning more than 8k complaining that they are poor and broke.  If  one day people like me can only afford to live in tents along the beach, im not surprised if the higher income group also want to live in tents so that they can save more money. The income gap here are already widening too much.  I beleve, there are growing resentment among lower income group. We earn less as we may not have high education due to finacially poor family background.  MM Lee is right when he say Singaporeans are less hard-striving.  But this does not mean im a PAP supporter.</p></div>
