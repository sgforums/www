              <p>One must question why above 85% of Singaporeans live in public housing, the world must think Singaporeans are stricken with poverty malaise. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Public housing</strong> is a form of <a title="Housing tenure" href="/wiki/Housing_tenure"><span style="color: #002bb8;">housing tenure</span></a> in which the property is owned by a <a title="Government" href="/wiki/Government"><span style="color: #002bb8;">government</span></a> authority, which may be central or local. <strong>Social housing</strong> is an <a title="Umbrella term" href="/wiki/Umbrella_term"><span style="color: #002bb8;">umbrella term</span></a> referring to rental housing which may be owned and managed by the state, by not-for-profit organizations, or by a combination of the two, usually with the aim of providing <a title="Affordable housing" href="/wiki/Affordable_housing"><span style="color: #002bb8;"><strong>affordable housing</strong></span></a>.</p>
              <p>Although the common goal of public housing is to provide affordable housing, the details, terminology, definitions of <a title="Poverty" href="/wiki/Poverty"><span style="color: #002bb8;"><strong>poverty</strong></span></a> and other criteria for allocation vary.</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_housing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_housing</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How to maintain the price of public housing you ask? Don't make it tradeable in the open market, you can only sell it back to HDB at original purchase price. You think the PAP government will allow that, turning their high profit center HDB into a cost center? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Kk I think maybe i need to clarify myself. (Discussing stuff with logical people quite fun)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In life alot depend on luck/hindsight.... doing the same thing as the other 80% of the people does not neccessarily end up with the same result. (referencing to eagles post to me earlier.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(referencing angel's post on property go upupup)Take property investments for example. You might be O levels or PSLE ... buy a property ... kenna enbloc(that I think more luck than hindsight) or invest wisely then sell at a good profit. Can make 1-200k a year just on that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However in Singapore to enter the investment market after you buy a HDB is hard. Because the entry alone is at least +-500k on top of your HDB loan if you have not paid it up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Problem case study ---- 500k (for cheapo private investment)+ 250k(for HDB) = 750k (dun talk about the deposit and all that cham cui lar). How much equity/income you need before bank is even willing to lend you that? For general public or non scholar material (referencing charlize's point) die le lol. Some countries dun have that problem... minimum wage gaotim that nvm u O, PSLE or wat hence charlize's pt is moot but in Sg it is a real problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I'm trying to say is because the avenues of investment in Sg is relatively limited. Bank FD interest is low, investment property entry level is expensive, minimum wage is close to non existant, everything is tied to education and job (dun talk abt self employed, shares and all that lar... to me shares is touch and go dun believe go try). In SG's case (referencing eagle) do what the 80% does will end up like the 80% is true.... but only for Singapore cos of its economic climate/restrictions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for angel.... property in singapore not always up up up. Go talk to your dad... around 199x-200x many people lose alot of $ lol because they think property sure +++.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Always have enough equity and cashflow before touch property.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Does anyone have any idea what is the cost of an HDB unit ?</p>
              <p>On Page 1 of this thread, the following was offered and which
              was also the subject of an earlier thread in 2009 :-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Both had reported the following:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After Singapore was hit by three economic recessions -
              in 1987, 1997 and 2004 - each Economic Review Committee and their
              respective sub-committees had reported that the Singapore
              Government is taking too much private money through the CPF
              system.</p>
              <p>This is from the 20 Percent forced contribution from Singaporean
              monthly wages and the prevailing approved rate from the Employers -
              which stands at 16 Percent.</p>
              <p>The whopping monthly amount of <strong>36 Percent paid
              monthly into the CPF fund -</strong> is accumulated throughout
              a Singaporean working life, which this Government can never fulfill
              its obligation to repay everyone when payout time occur;
              and this Government is resorting to a plethora of policy
              mechanism to whittle away its CPF debt to Singaporeans
              through the Medisave, Medishield, and now the CPF-Life Policies -
              as well as to delay the withdrawal date and reducing the withdrawal
              sums by increasing the balance needed supposedly for one's old
              age.</p>
              <p>The ultimate Government policy in wiping its CPF debt
              to Singaporeans is through its HDB pricing mechanism to
              rob Singaporeans of its entire CPF savings - by
              arbitrarily pricing the HDB unit as high as
              the Singaporean can bear.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Considering that land has been "robbed" from private ownership
              through the Land Acquistion Act - in which land needed by the
              Government is acquired at <strong>below market rates</strong> - it
              is disingenious for the Government to claim that it has subsidised
              HDB prices by selling HDB homes at over 100 Percent of its
              construction cost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is interesting that the argument has now arrived to
              this point with an ingenious question of asking what
              should "affordability" be in pricing public housing ?</p>
              <p>How does 'Fatum' proposed to measure "affordability" to
              Singaporeans - can there be common ground that is agreeable by
              all parties - some kind of perimeters that define what
              "affordability" should be ?</p>

              <p>Something is gravely wrong with the country when 85% of the population lives in public housing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Another interesting fact, Hong Kongers spend 3.4% of their monthly household expenditures on utilities. If you gross up the 3.4% (based on S$200 from Singapore Power) , it would mean that the monthly <strong>household expenditures (not household income)</strong> is S$5,882.</p>

              <p>Something is gravely wrong with the country when 85% of the population lives in public housing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Another interesting fact, Hong Kongers spend 3.4% of their monthly household expenditures on utilities. If you gross up the 3.4% (based on S$200 from Singapore Power) , it would mean that the monthly <strong>household expenditures (not household income)</strong> is S$5,882.</p>

              <p>There is a rental housing market in Singapore ie the 1 or 2 room rental houses provided by the HDB and the rooms rented out by HDB ownership for the poor.</p>
              <p>For the poor, the HDB has provided them opportunities to upgrade to ownership when they are financially better ie HDB has provided them substantial subsidies to buy 3 room HDB flats.</p>
              <p>It is logical that the money used for the paying the rent is better used to be paying for the instalments for a HDB flat with financial assistance from HDB and prudent choice on the size of the HDB flat bought based on one's financial ability.</p>

              <p>There is a rental housing market in Singapore ie the 1 or 2 room rental houses provided by the HDB and the rooms rented out by HDB ownershe for the poor.</p>
              <p>For the poor, the HDB has provided them opportunities to upgrade to ownership when they are financially better ie HDB has provided them substantial subsidies to buy 3 room HDB flats.</p>
              <p>It is logical that the money used for the paying the rent is better used to be paying for the instalments for a HDB flat with financial assistance from HDB and prudent choice on the size of the HDB flat bought based on one's financial ability.</p>

              <p>Fatum,</p>
              <p>I hope this will be my last reply to you. You ask what is the "affordable price" for a 4 room flat if I think $200K is too much to pay?</p>
              <p>I am sorry to say that you have missed the point totally.  It is not about a static price stated now and then. As I have said, you are buying your 4 room flat at $200K basically because people like me are making noise and challenging Minister Mah. HDB reacted and lower the price. Yes, HDB, as the monopoly of the new HDB flat market, has the total power of manipulating the prices.</p>
              <p>But that is besides the point. What we are talking about is a system of pricing, not about what is the "right price" for different times. I am talking about a sustainable pricing mechanism that is fair to Singaporeans. A market discount pricing system which is practised now is not the appropriate system as I have mentioned, PAP has the social obligation to provide cheap and basic public housing for the masses. In the past, PAP government has the proper pricing mechanism, that is based on COST PRICE of the flat. They have even given a REAL SUBSIDY based on that COST PRICE. They have fulfilled their deal on the Land Redistribution contract.</p>
              <p>So far, HDB has REFUSED to publish the COST PRICE of building each flats. But we have established the COST PRICE by some other means. It comes to about $120K (excluding land price) for a 4 room flat. Please note that this include the building of road networks and carparks for the whole surrounding as a project. For carparks, HDB continues to get revenue by means of collecting monthly car park fees.</p>
              <p>The Cost Plus pricing, as someone has called it, is a more stable and sustainable pricing mechanism. It will be shielded from the fluctuation in pricing due to liquidity availability or sudden surge in population due to some policy mismanagement. The inflation (or increase in prices) of new HDB flats will be solely pegged at the inflation of construction cost which is linked to general economic growth. This would mean that this it is more closely linked to wage growth as well. This could be determined by examine the HDB prices back in 1981 compared to present prices based on cost price, then comparing it to the real earning of citizens. A 4 room HDB back in 1981 would cost about $40K to $60K. If based on this cost plus pricing, the 4 room flat now would be around $140K. This would be about 2-3 times of the 1981 prices. Real earnings for workers has grown about 2-3 times as well for the similar period. You can check this out from Lucky Tan's blog:</p>
              <p>http://singaporemind.blogspot.com/2010/04/mah-bow-tan-we-dont-fudge-numbers-part.html#links</p>
              <p>This would be a fairer pricing mechanism that suits the social role of the government. Don't you think so? I am not even asking PAP government to give REAL SUBSIDY at cost price. I am merely asking PAP government to be responsible and honor their part of the social contract.</p>
              <p>I would not expect HDB to be in the position to control Resale market. It is a many sellers many buyers market.  I wouldn't force PAP government to do something that is not within their power or means. Just leave Resale market as it is.</p>

              <p>that is true enough, but what if we look at things at an even more macro level ? </p>
              <p>Let's remember that the HDB is not concerned with the building of new HDB flats alone. They are also operating in the resale market through subsidies for home seekers.</p>
              <p>For each new couple that choses to purchase a resale flat, 30 to 40k of subsidies are granted to them as well, plus, potentially up to another 40k of AHGs is applicable to them as well. Where do you suppose the HDB gets the money from ? </p>
              <p>Just as new flat buyers like us are subsidizing the purchase of smaller units by other home owners, we are also subsidizing the purchase of resale flats by other people.Jiak ter, per gau, eat pig, pay dog, make sense ? fair ? </p>

              <p>This would be a fairer pricing mechanism that suits the social
              role of the government. Don't you think so? I am not even asking
              PAP government to give REAL SUBSIDY at cost price. I am merely
              asking PAP government to be responsible and honor their part of the
              social contract.</p>
              <p>I would not expect HDB to be in the position to control Resale
              market. It is a many sellers many buyers market.  I wouldn't
              force PAP government to do something that is not within their power
              or means. Just leave Resale market as it is.</p>
