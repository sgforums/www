              <p>Channelnewsasiaarticlehdbcontract_com.mht that Singapore Exchange’s mainboard-listed BBR Holdings has secured a S$104.2-million contract from the Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB) to build seven blocks of flats in Yishun Neighbourhood 4.</p>

              <p>that is true enough, but what if we look at things at an even
              more macro level ? </p>
              <p>Let's remember that the HDB is not concerned with the building
              of new HDB flats alone. They are also operating in the resale
              market through subsidies for home seekers.</p>
              <p>For each new couple that choses to purchase a resale flat, 30 to
              40k of subsidies are granted to them as well, plus, potentially up
              to another 40k of AHGs is applicable to them as well. Where do you
              suppose the HDB gets the money from ? </p>
              <p>Just as new flat buyers like us are subsidizing the purchase of
              smaller units by other home owners, we are also subsidizing the

              <p>you also used the top unit prices for your calculations too, if you average it out it shaves off the figure even further.</p>
              <p>Remember also, that each singaporean couple is entitled to two bites of the cherry per life time. That is to say you'll enjoy a subsidized new flat or resale grants twice.</p>
              <p>with many people chosing a resale nowadays, the subsidy figures is likely to be substantial.</p>

              <p class="hn-byline"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(AFP) – <span class="hn-date">Jan 29, 2010</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>HONG KONG — <strong>Rescue workers Saturday pulled a fourth body from the rubble of a rundown housing block that collapsed in Hong Kong as the government ordered urgent checks on all buildings more than 50 years old.</strong></p>
              <p>The five-storey building, built in the 1950s, collapsed in seconds on Friday afternoon in Kowloon district, witnesses told local television.</p>
              <p>Rescuers retrieved a fourth body -- that of a woman -- early Saturday following an overnight search, the government said in a statement.</p>
              <p>"She was certified dead at the scene," it said. "So far, four persons died and two (were) injured in the collapse."</p>
              <p>Rescue workers ended their search after a fifth person thought to have been trapped in the rubble was located elsewhere, broadcaster RTHK said.</p>
              <p>Reports said renovation work was being carried out on the building but the cause of the collapse was unclear.</p>
              <p>Several nearby buildings were closed for safety reasons and about 100 people affected by the collapse spent the night in two community centres.</p>
              <p>Au Choi-kai, director of buildings, said a repair order had been served on the owners of the block this month. But he added that its condition was not bad enough to order its closure, RTHK reported.</p>
              <p>Development Secretary Carrie Lam has ordered checks on all buildings more than 50 years old, it said.</p>
              <p>The South China Morning Post described it as "the worst incident of its kind in the city in decades".</p>
              <p>Reports said the building collapsed in a matter of seconds.</p>
              <p>"I saw bits and pieces of earth and tiles sliding down the wall at the beginning... a woman was trying to climb out through the window. About 15 seconds later, the building fell like dominoes," a passer-by told Cable TV.</p>
              <p>Decades-old, rundown residential blocks are often interspersed with high-rise buildings in Hong Kong, an international financial hub famous for its high population density and fast pace of redevelopment.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(AFP)
              – <span>Jan 29, 2010</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>HONG KONG — <strong>Rescue workers Saturday pulled a fourth body
              from the rubble of a rundown housing block that collapsed in Hong
              Kong as the government ordered urgent checks on all buildings more
              than 50 years old.</strong></p>
              <p>The five-storey building, built in the 1950s, collapsed in
              seconds on Friday afternoon in Kowloon district, witnesses told
              local television.</p>
              <p>Rescuers retrieved a fourth body -- that of a woman -- early
              Saturday following an overnight search, the government said in a
              statement.</p>
              <p>"She was certified dead at the scene," it said. "So far, four
              persons died and two (were) injured in the collapse."</p>
              <p>Rescue workers ended their search after a fifth person thought
              to have been trapped in the rubble was located elsewhere,
              broadcaster RTHK said.</p>
              <p>Reports said renovation work was being carried out on the
              building but the cause of the collapse was unclear.</p>
              <p>Several nearby buildings were closed for safety reasons and
              about 100 people affected by the collapse spent the night in two
              community centres.</p>
              <p>Au Choi-kai, director of buildings, said a repair order had been
              served on the owners of the block this month. But he added that its
              condition was not bad enough to order its closure, RTHK
              reported.</p>
              <p>Development Secretary Carrie Lam has ordered checks on all
              buildings more than 50 years old, it said.</p>
              <p>The South China Morning Post described it as "the worst incident
              of its kind in the city in decades".</p>
              <p>Reports said the building collapsed in a matter of seconds.</p>
              <p>"I saw bits and pieces of earth and tiles sliding down the wall
              at the beginning... a woman was trying to climb out through the
              window. About 15 seconds later, the building fell like dominoes," a
              passer-by told Cable TV.</p>
              <p>Decades-old, rundown residential blocks are often interspersed
              with high-rise buildings in Hong Kong, an international financial
              hub famous for its high population density and fast pace of
              redevelopment.</p>
