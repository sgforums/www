              <p>The truth is clear that the bankrupt mind of a X-rated kid cannot swallow the stark truth as it is delivered.</p>
              <p>The half-truth is in the hopeless effort of a X-rated kid pretending to be one amongst the talented elite.</p>

              <p>The frustration has been consistently expressed by one who has been branded as a X-rated kid making the mistake of pretending to be a mature political commentator, when it continue to make consistent mistakes in simply plagiarizing ideas and text from the poltical elites - without the ability to deliver with any conviction, nor has it any ability to understand the subject matters with any depth of thought to enable it to defend the plagiarized positions.</p>
              <p>The mistake was made by the X-rated kid on its own free will.</p>
              <p>It is simple idiocy of an X-rated kid to insist on denying the "Truth" but will insist on others to follow its short-sighted  vision of what reality is.</p>
              <p>Can we believe in the X-rated values of a political clown when it has no ability to differentiate between simple "Truth" and sheer "Lies" ?</p>
              <p>It is amazing that the X-rated kid will depend on the existence of "Half-Truths" - so as to have some consolation for getting its butt repeatedly kicked in.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should extend some help to the immature X-rated Kid to help it find its directions again, as its immature mind has no ability to prove its claims that the "Truth" has been twisted, nor show "half-Truths" and "Lies" have been introduced.</p>
              <p> Does Singaporean need to think again about the bald lies that the X-rated kid need - in order to justify its own relevance in this Speaker's Corner ?</p>

              <p>Does truth need to be diluted with lies ?</p>
              <p>What will happen to the half-truths when lies are woven into it ?</p>
              <p>Only the bankrupt X-rated mind can be such a genius to mix truths with half-truths and lies - to develop into new X-rated reality of its own forlorn positions that it cannot even hope to defend.</p>
              <p>The truth is clear that the bankrupt mind of a X-rated kid cannot swallow the stark truth as it is delivered.</p>
              <p>The half-truth is in the hopeless effort of a X-rated kid pretending to be one amongst the talented elite.</p>
              <p>The lie is in the X-rated kid attempting to be a non-partisan and loyal Singaporean, when its position has been clearly stated in its clear political stand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The frustration has been consistently expressed by one who has been branded as a X-rated kid making the mistake of pretending to be a mature political commentator, when it continue to make consistent mistakes in simply plagiarizing ideas and text from the poltical elites - without the ability to deliver with any conviction, nor has it any ability to understand the subject matters with any depth of thought to enable it to defend the plagiarized positions.</p>
              <p>The mistake was made by the X-rated kid on its own free will.</p>
              <p>It is simple idiocy of an X-rated kid to insist on denying the "Truth" but will insist on others to follow its short-sighted  vision of what reality is.</p>
              <p>Can we believe in the X-rated values of a political clown when it has no ability to differentiate between simple "Truth" and sheer "Lies" ?</p>
              <p>It is amazing that the X-rated kid will depend on the existence of "Half-Truths" - so as to have some consolation for getting its butt repeatedly kicked in.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should extend some help to the immature X-rated Kid to help it find its directions again, as its immature mind has no ability to prove its claims that the "Truth" has been twisted, nor show "half-Truths" and "Lies" have been introduced.</p>
              <p> Does Singaporean need to think again about the bald lies that the X-rated kid need - in order to justify its own relevance in this Speaker's Corner ?</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Malicious Propaganda against Singapore.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>I met a guy who always complain about life of Singapore. So I ask him what was the ACTUAL reason for his hatred.</p>
              <p><strong>He:</strong> I am not complaining. I love Singapore. This is my home. All that I am doing is only to make it a better place for all!</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Me</span>: It's comprehensible if you are just frustrated with your life, which is your own doing, and resorting to venting it out.</p>
              <p>But you mean by complaining and spreading demoralizing lies with half truths, without fully exploring why certain things need to be done to ensure survival, is HELPING the country and society??</p>
              <p><strong>He</strong>: How much is the ruling party paying you to tell me this?</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------.</p>
              <p><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Complaints often heard:-</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>1. CPF is another scheme to suck the people dry.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-</span></strong><strong><br></strong>A guy starts work at 21 years old. Salary $2000. CPF contribution from both him and his employer = 30% - $7,200 a year in his account earning 4% compounded.</p>
              <p><br>By the time he reaches 55 years, he would have an est $520,000 to draw from.</p>
              <p>If he saved at home $7200/yr he would only have $244,000 per year.</p>
              <p>But leaving it in CPF, he would have an additional $276,000, and would have used it for a better and noble cause - to help elevate our society as our forefathers had selflessly sacrificed for our todays, as we must do the same if not more for our next generation.</p>
              <p><br>This sample does not take into further profit he would gain if he uses such funds to purchase property or his salary or promotion remains stagnant.<br>(this is only a sample liner calculation. If anyone wants to nitpick, please go to CPF board.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>2. CPF interest is peanuts</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-</span></strong><br>If CPF $276,000 worth of accrued interest is peanuts, then the guy who said it must be a multi billionaire, and dont need the money. Please donate it to charity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>3. it is highly probable that the government will stand to profit from the cpf life scheme with more people dying before collecting payouts. since the amount of money pledged will not go to the beneficiaries, the money will go to the government instead.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-<br></span></strong>CPF life scheme is but an insurance cover, and like any insurance covers, it is dependent on a large pool of funds to give payouts. Thus, if one dies, the payout stops, and is only fair, for such is the risk. The fund is nobly meant to take care of the aged, and its fund comes from the PEOPLE. There is absolutely no reason to bequeth such funds to the next of kin</p>
              <p><br>The PEOPLE stand more to lose, because life expectancy is expected to rise with advancement in scientific research. When more will live beyond 100 yrs old, the fund will be in danger if further payouts are required, thus stressing our contributing members more.</p>
              <p><br>Make no mistake, the balance payouts for one who dies does not go to the govt. It goes back to <strong>PEOPLE</strong>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CPF is the PEOPLE's fund, and when due on schedules, to be returned with interest</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>4. CPF funds are freely gambled away.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-</span></strong><br>Assume a million people contribute $7,200 each a year to CPF = $7,200,000,000<br>Interest the govt has to pay at 4%  = $288,000,000</p>
              <p><br>The govt's CPF board is not an invesment company, thus it assigns GIC to seek out safe, blue chip strong companies to invest in, not cowboy style, but just a realistic and safe figure for example at 6%</p>
              <p><br>At 6% dividens earned a year on $7,2 billion = $432,000,000</p>
              <p><br>With capital still intact to pay back members anytime, and after deducting the 4% interest owed to CPF board, GIC will still have $144,000,000 - and it will be this sum that is used to built schools, pay for defence, offer healthcare, etc, etc, combined with other tax revenues collected in that year.</p>
              <p>All investments come with risk, or there will be no returns. The only solution is to minimise it by getting the best brains and team to manage our funds. Baring global catastrophies such as the current financial crisis, on the whole, GIC had done well with its accumulated returns saved for rainy days.</p>
              <p>And that's just based on an estimate fig of 1mil people. There are more than 3mil working adults today, so guess how much is actually there to protect our citizens.</p>
              <p><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remember always</span>, we have no oil wealth or mineral resources to depend on, except ourselves!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>5.Life expectancy here is expected to shorten due to the claustrophobic condition</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-</span></strong><br>Claustrophobia is a only a mental condition, borne out of self centredness and the selfish unwillingness to share space.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>6.35 years old citizens below cannot buy HDB flats, but PRs can buy with brother sister combo.</strong></p>
              <p><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-<br></span></strong>Irresponsible lie and half truth to mask a hidden agenda within a sentence. 35 years old and below citizens cannot buy flat but can do so on a brother sister combo as well.</p>
              <p><strong>7. HDB flats are expensive</strong></p>
              <p><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-<br></span></strong>Go buy private housing then. Why does a car cost only $21k in Japan but need to cost $80k here? Why do other nations people live mostly in detached houses, yet we live in boxes in the sky? Why is oil only a few cents in the 20s yet it's $2 a litre now? Why is a construction engineer's pay only $1000 in the 60s, but avg $4000 now? Why, why why???</p>
              <p><br><strong>8. Foreigners hanging their flag in Singapore.</strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><br>I encourage all to be more discerning. There is nothing wrong in whinning or venting. It only shows your own pettiness. It's ok to be ignorant. It's also ok to complain but hopefully it can be backed up with credible solutions.</p>
              <p><br> But to lie, twist and turn events/circumstances with half truths are malicious acts against to our society.</p>
              <p><br>If anyone has any evidence or wrong doing of the govt, or ruler party, by all means show it or report it to the relevant authorities. There is no need to spread rumours or lies for one's hatred. The consequences will end badly on society, seldom on the monger.</p>

              <p>Congratulations for your ability to spot the "<em>logical fallcies and generalisations and misconceptions throughout the whole post</em>"  - which is the creation from a bankrupt mind of a X-rated kid.</p>
              <p>You can try to begin from where 'X' mark the spot - that is where the X-rated kid normally will try to start its sneaky path at spilling kiddie droppings that he think is meaningful and will entertain us - the Adults.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, you have to find the spot marked 'X' - as he is too dumb to make it any clearer and is waiting for someone with intelligence to do it first, so that he can plagiarize it when used as a repetitive model.</p>

              <p>Try going to the source first. I dont expect anyone to take my word for it, as those rabble rousers would like their words to be taken. Find out for yourself, and then if you feel like, I would welcome your insights, so long as it is not another infinite monkey theorum fillabustering wall of text.</p>
              <p>It is your choice. I will not impose upon you to do so, or not to do so. Only tyrannical despots and their retarded followers would make demands and orders.</p>

              <p>Glad you admit to using sarcasm. It is sign of bitterness and  deep rooted resentment over what I had said, to the petty extend of counting how many words I used. Didnt know you hated freedom so much. </p>
              <p>I guess you are the one who needs to be happy, and if you think I am the joke, anything to make you happy then. It's your perogative and life anyway, regardless of whatever nicks you use, to protect another money making nick here. that is, if you are indeed using another nick. ( a supposition only, relax)</p>
