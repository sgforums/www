              <p> <strong>AND YET, you failed to comprehend the true nature of why the $10million is necessary!</strong></p>
              <p><strong> Look no further than to the US, France and Australia. Look at their integration policies and see how it had failed miserably. Just costs alone on damage to properties was already more than hundred of millions in each country.</strong></p>
              <p><br>Ha...the 10 million dollars is a wastefull fiscal spending that resulted from ill govt social engineering policies of spiking up foreigner too fast in too short of the time. While the root cause of the Singaporean Exodus was going on for decade it has reach a proportion that cannot hide.</p>
              <p>Why even compared with US or Australia for practical discussion? Look at their size? have you not see that central planning will fail in large state? Look at China 5000 yrs historical time frame and counting still could not contain social intergration in its inland province? And you want to spend 10 millions to do what.....propaganda Intergration campaign?</p>
              <p>Unless you totally forgot that politics in SG and neighbors remain unchanged. When stone start throwing. Govt of both side of the causeway will not be able to stop. </p>
              <p>Singapore govt insist of policy not like that of the west and insist it has its own system. Look at the number of resident leaving eventually the govt run a risk of closing up itself. making itself irrelevant to the world. It is already a tough trading place to compete against emerging markets. To further closed your mind to overseas Singaporean is to close your door to human networks.  </p>

              <p>Are you so caught up with your personal beliefs that you are unable to accept facts when presented to you ? Do you want to be like that piece of irritating Turd...oops... Tobe?</p>
              <p>What has other countries size to do with our own's social integration, and with the result still not out you, you are in such a hurry to condemn?</p>
              <p>Just because you think it will fail and failures like that piece of Turd will always be failures, does not mean others will fail without even giving it a shot.</p>
              <p>And what solution are you proposing? Let things be, throw stones and kill one another? Why be like that piece of Turd who offers nothing but criticisms after criticisms?</p>
              <p>But it is your choice and your life that you choose, like that piece of Turd.</p>
              <p>No human network will be disregarded. It's ok to criticise and condemn, but with offers of practical solutions and not lofty idealism, and one must have the grace to accept that if it is rejected, there should be no grudge as there may be other necessary conditions and better options to consider.</p>
              <p>BUT it is not ok to criticise and condemn blindly, and using past history of how things were done in a different era, with no solultions. Such actions only amounts to clear blind hatred and intense malicious propoganda to serve a selfish end.</p>

              <p>Such a stupendous leap in thought process can only happen from a X-rat thinking that it is jumping from a 10 storey building when it is actuall hopping off a 10 inch tall stool.</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that the X-rat has such poor thought process, which stems from its poor X-rated reading ability and resulted in atrocious X-rated marks in the necessary comprehension to achieve any degree in intellect ?</p>
              <p>Why will a X-rat not address the <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/377726?page=9">‘”Turd’s post on 10 Oct ’09 – 3.50PM on Page 9 of this Thread” (*1) </a>- and give a direct critique of its own, but instead will urge others to provide an analytical work ?</p>

              <p>Good dog, you piece of Turd. At least managed to make you stand on one particular issue, which shows your utter stupidity once again, even though the rest of your post is as usual - nonsensical infinite monkey theorum typings to be dismissed, as all rantings should be.</p>
              <p>I would perfer arapahoe to make clear his stand on the issue of size against dollar funding. and i doubt if he would thank you for twisting it to your way of perception, unless he hasnt a clue on what he meant by that.</p>
              <p>Who is talking about absorbing a tiny or high fraction of people into a higher proportioned population, an act of leaving them to their own devices?</p>
              <p>You fool of a Turd, we are talking about 'social integration' here - making the new immigrants of different racial or ethnic groups into unrestricted and equal association within our  equal society and republic, and contributing to it for the welfare of all in peace.</p>
              <p>But then, fool that you are, it is expected of you to either be ignorant or deviously twisting and manipulating of facts, to promote your ghastly agenda of installing your outlaw Dr.Chee onto the throne.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Malicious Propaganda against Singapore.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>I met a guy who always complain about life of Singapore. So I ask him what was the ACTUAL reason for his hatred.</p>
              <p><strong>He:</strong> I am not complaining. I love Singapore. This is my home. All that I am doing is only to make it a better place for all!</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Me</span>: It's comprehensible if you are just frustrated with your life, which is your own doing, and resorting to venting it out.</p>
              <p>But you mean by complaining and spreading demoralizing lies with half truths, without fully exploring why certain things need to be done to ensure survival, is HELPING the country and society??</p>
              <p><strong>He</strong>: How much is the ruling party paying you to tell me this?</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------.</p>
              <p><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Complaints often heard:-</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>1. CPF is another scheme to suck the people dry.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-</span></strong><strong><br></strong>A guy starts work at 21 years old. Salary $2000. CPF contribution from both him and his employer = 30% - $7,200 a year in his account earning 4% compounded.</p>
              <p><br>By the time he reaches 55 years, he would have an est $520,000 to draw from.</p>
              <p>If he saved at home $7200/yr he would only have $244,000 per year.</p>
              <p>But leaving it in CPF, he would have an additional $276,000, and would have used it for a better and noble cause - to help elevate our society as our forefathers had selflessly sacrificed for our todays, as we must do the same if not more for our next generation.</p>
              <p><br>This sample does not take into further profit he would gain if he uses such funds to purchase property or his salary or promotion remains stagnant.<br>(this is only a sample liner calculation. If anyone wants to nitpick, please go to CPF board.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>2. CPF interest is peanuts</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-</span></strong><br>If CPF $276,000 worth of accrued interest is peanuts, then the guy who said it must be a multi billionaire, and dont need the money. Please donate it to charity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>3. it is highly probable that the government will stand to profit from the cpf life scheme with more people dying before collecting payouts. since the amount of money pledged will not go to the beneficiaries, the money will go to the government instead.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-<br></span></strong>CPF life scheme is but an insurance cover, and like any insurance covers, it is dependent on a large pool of funds to give payouts. Thus, if one dies, the payout stops, and is only fair, for such is the risk. The fund is nobly meant to take care of the aged, and its fund comes from the PEOPLE. There is absolutely no reason to bequeth such funds to the next of kin</p>
              <p><br>The PEOPLE stand more to lose, because life expectancy is expected to rise with advancement in scientific research. When more will live beyond 100 yrs old, the fund will be in danger if further payouts are required, thus stressing our contributing members more.</p>
              <p><br>Make no mistake, the balance payouts for one who dies does not go to the govt. It goes back to <strong>PEOPLE</strong>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CPF is the PEOPLE's fund, and when due on schedules, to be returned with interest</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>4. CPF funds are freely gambled away.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-</span></strong><br>Assume a million people contribute $7,200 each a year to CPF = $7,200,000,000<br>Interest the govt has to pay at 4%  = $288,000,000</p>
              <p><br>The govt's CPF board is not an invesment company, thus it assigns GIC to seek out safe, blue chip strong companies to invest in, not cowboy style, but just a realistic and safe figure for example at 6%</p>
              <p><br>At 6% dividens earned a year on $7,2 billion = $432,000,000</p>
              <p><br>With capital still intact to pay back members anytime, and after deducting the 4% interest owed to CPF board, GIC will still have $144,000,000 - and it will be this sum that is used to built schools, pay for defence, offer healthcare, etc, etc, combined with other tax revenues collected in that year.</p>
              <p>All investments come with risk, or there will be no returns. The only solution is to minimise it by getting the best brains and team to manage our funds. Baring global catastrophies such as the current financial crisis, on the whole, GIC had done well with its accumulated returns saved for rainy days.</p>
              <p>And that's just based on an estimate fig of 1mil people. There are more than 3mil working adults today, so guess how much is actually there to protect our citizens.</p>
              <p><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remember always</span>, we have no oil wealth or mineral resources to depend on, except ourselves!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>5.Life expectancy here is expected to shorten due to the claustrophobic condition</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-</span></strong><br>Claustrophobia is a only a mental condition, borne out of self centredness and the selfish unwillingness to share space.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>6.35 years old citizens below cannot buy HDB flats, but PRs can buy with brother sister combo.</strong></p>
              <p><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-<br></span></strong>Irresponsible lie and half truth to mask a hidden agenda within a sentence. 35 years old and below citizens cannot buy flat but can do so on a brother sister combo as well.</p>
              <p><strong>7. HDB flats are expensive</strong></p>
              <p><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-<br></span></strong>Go buy private housing then. Why does a car cost only $21k in Japan but need to cost $80k here? Why do other nations people live mostly in detached houses, yet we live in boxes in the sky? Why is oil only a few cents in the 20s yet it's $2 a litre now? Why is a construction engineer's pay only $1000 in the 60s, but avg $4000 now? Why, why why???</p>

              <p><br>I encourage all to be more discerning. There is nothing wrong in whinning or venting. It only shows your own pettiness. It's ok to be ignorant. It's also ok to complain but hopefully it can be backed up with credible solutions.</p>
              <p><br> But to lie, twist and turn events/circumstances with half truths are malicious acts against to our society.</p>
              <p><br>If anyone has any evidence or wrong doing of the govt, or ruler party, by all means show it or report it to the relevant authorities. There is no need to spread rumours or lies for one's hatred. The consequences will end badly on society, seldom on the monger.</p>

              <p>I would recommend that you ask the CPF board for answers to your specific queries, for they are better qualified to do so. Any answers I volunteerily offer is as a common laymen, just like you, a fellow contributor to CPF.</p>
              <p>Your questions are 2 parts. (1) who pays the extra interest - my answer is higher dividens earned from SWF's careful blue chip investments for <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">any </span></span>or special interests if tabled in the past, now or future </p>
              <p>There are risks involved in any form of investments, thus the need for the best and brightest with financial acumen to be there, not playing cowboy style, but long term view for better returns as our world progresses in social and scientific knowledge.</p>
              <p>(2)He is going to live in the streets - if one has brains, hands and legs, why would he need to live in the streets? A small room in a HDB flat costs less then $300 to rent, and only $26/mth for a 1rm flat from HDB if he earns below $800/mth.</p>
              <p>C'mon, even a roadsweeper can earn that kinda money a month in Singapore!</p>
              <p>As for quality of life, one must live within his means, either work harder or upgrade himself if want more in life. There are no free lunches. It sucks, but we citizens are not oil rich princes with crude oil under where we live or sons of royalties.</p>
              <p>But still...who knows..there's always toto and big sweep. No need to spend alot. One  $2 ticket a month and see if your luck is there, but better always to depend on one's hardwork to move up. Many achieved it and so can anyone here in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, the mindless "high fallutin" words in the X-rated statements reflect the indiscriminate plagiarizing of ideas without any attempt to be circumspect to reality.</p>
              <p>If the best and brightest with financial acumen were employed, will there have been flip-flop decisions to sell investments at the rock bottom prices even as rescue efforts were made to explain that the investments of the SWF are for the longer term ?</p>
              <p>With the investments made when prices were at their highest, and sold when rock bottom prices were reached, it must be the brightest and the best that had incurred a loss of US$100 Billion in one year alone, which reflects 30 per cent of the value of the entire portfolio.</p>
              <p>Surprisingly, China SWF was reported to have made US$10 Billion in 2008, when their SWF was only formed recently compared with Singapore's SWF.</p>

              <p>Does a X-rat understand the phrase - "Quality of Life" ?</p>
              <p>Does living within one's means - or working harder, or upgrading one'self - achieve the "Quality of Life" that one desire ?</p>
              <p>Again, the pretentious simpleton in the X-rat is nothing more then to disguise itself in its sanctimonious self-appointed role to pontificate towards others.</p>

              <p>More possibly, you're simply perpetually in a state of denial, desperately trying to make the sad life you live more palatable, by justifying the unjust things perpertrated by the ruling elite.</p>

Is it physical impairment of the brain, mental corruption of the mind or a demonized and possessed spirit? Only you can tell. Although I must thank you, for the quoted text above as applied to your own replies does make a fine point when I read them as you suggested.</p>
              <p>Perhaps if you are willing to attempt to open your sewn-shut eyes once more, you'd see things the way they really are. Then, you might also finally be able to see through a mirror, that the only Turd here, is YOU.</p>

              <p>Reading through your replies, I can only laugh with sadness. You are either paid to say these things, which is unlikely, since the people who'd pay you would hardly consider you worth even just scraps of the kind of peanuts they pay the dogs.</p>
              <p>More possibly, you're simply perpetually in a state of denial, desperately trying to make the sad life you live more palatable, by justifying the unjust things perpertrated by the ruling elite.</p>

              <p><br>xtreyier should look at the gorillas in white social engineering and think clearly whether it will lead to Hotel Singapore scenario or Singapore my Home scenario.
