              <h2>Singapore's ruling party warns voters against opposition</h2>
              <em>By Fayen Wong</em>
              <div>SINGAPORE, March 27 (Reuters) - <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore's ruling party, which is likely to call an early election this year, has warned voters if they elect an opposition candidate their constituency stands to lose out on state-subsidised improvements. </span></strong></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, who visited an opposition ward at the weekend, told local reporters that it would be in the residents' interests to vote for a People's Action Party (PAP) candidate at the next election if they want their estates to be get new lifts and improved shopping facilities.</div>
              <div>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong recently asked Goh, a former Prime Minister, to help win back Singapore's two opposition wards. The tiny, fragmented opposition holds only two out of the 84 elected seats in parliament.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Chiam See Tong, chief of the Singapore Democratic Alliance, has led the Potong Pasir constituency for the past 25 years while Workers' Party secretary-general Low Thia Kiang has chaired the Hougang ward since 1991.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"I do not want the two constituencies to be left behind, especially Potong Pasir, an old estate. Five years down the road, assuming Chiam do win, there will be no upgrading," Goh was quoted as saying on state broadcaster Channel NewsAsia's Web site.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Goh's comments echo remarks he made before the January 1997 poll, when he told voters that those wards which elected an opposition candidate would be the last in line for upgrading and risked becoming "slums".</div>
              <div>The upgrading of state-built housing estates typically includes a fresh coat of paint, new parks and playgrounds, and facilities for the elderly such as ramps and lifts that stop on every floor.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The ruling PAP has dominated parliament since Singapore's independence in 1965.</div>
              <div> </div>

              <h2>Singapore's ruling party warns voters against opposition</h2>
              <p><em>By Fayen Wong</em></p>
              <div>SINGAPORE, March 27 (Reuters) - <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore's ruling party, which is likely to call an early election this year, has warned voters if they elect an opposition candidate their constituency stands to lose out on state-subsidised improvements.</span></strong></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, who visited an opposition ward at the weekend, told local reporters that it would be in the residents' interests to vote for a People's Action Party (PAP) candidate at the next election if they want their estates to be get new lifts and improved shopping facilities.</div>
              <div>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong recently asked Goh, a former Prime Minister, to help win back Singapore's two opposition wards. The tiny, fragmented opposition holds only two out of the 84 elected seats in parliament.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Chiam See Tong, chief of the Singapore Democratic Alliance, has led the Potong Pasir constituency for the past 25 years while Workers' Party secretary-general Low Thia Kiang has chaired the Hougang ward since 1991.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"I do not want the two constituencies to be left behind, especially Potong Pasir, an old estate. Five years down the road, assuming Chiam do win, there will be no upgrading," Goh was quoted as saying on state broadcaster Channel NewsAsia's Web site.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Goh's comments echo remarks he made before the January 1997 poll, when he told voters that those wards which elected an opposition candidate would be the last in line for upgrading and risked becoming "slums".</div>
              <div>The upgrading of state-built housing estates typically includes a fresh coat of paint, new parks and playgrounds, and facilities for the elderly such as ramps and lifts that stop on every floor.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The ruling PAP has dominated parliament since Singapore's independence in 1965.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Goh told voters in the opposition wards at the weekend that if they elected a PAP candidate at the next poll, he would propose that those two members of parliament be freed of the party whip. PAP members of parliament are required to vote in line with the party.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Analysts say the PAP's decision to put Goh in charge of winning back the opposition wards reflects the increased prominence of the opposition, which recently said it would contest as many as 57 of the 84 elected seats at the next poll.</div>

              <p>I met a guy who always complain about life of Singapore. So I ask him what was the ACTUAL reason for his hatred.</p>
              <p><strong>He:</strong> I am not complaining. I love Singapore. This is my home. All that I am doing is only to make it a better place for all!</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Me</span>: It's comprehensible if you are just frustrated with your life, which is your own doing, and resorting to venting it out.</p>
              <p>But you mean by complaining and spreading demoralizing lies with half truths, without fully exploring why certain things need to be done to ensure survival, is HELPING the country and society??</p>
              <p><strong>He</strong>: How much is the ruling party paying you to tell me this?</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------.</p>
              <p><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Complaints often heard:-</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>1. CPF is another scheme to suck the people dry.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-</span></strong><strong><br></strong>A guy starts work at 21 years old. Salary $2000. CPF contribution from both him and his employer = 30% - $7,200 a year in his account earning 4% compounded.</p>
              <p><br>By the time he reaches 55 years, he would have an est $520,000 to draw from.</p>
              <p>If he saved at home $7200/yr he would only have $244,000 per year.</p>
              <p>But leaving it in CPF, he would have an additional $276,000, and would have used it for a better and noble cause - to help elevate our society as our forefathers had selflessly sacrificed for our todays, as we must do the same if not more for our next generation.</p>
              <p><br>This sample does not take into further profit he would gain if he uses such funds to purchase property or his salary or promotion remains stagnant.<br>(this is only a sample liner calculation. If anyone wants to nitpick, please go to CPF board.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>2. CPF interest is peanuts</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-</span></strong><br>If CPF $276,000 worth of accrued interest is peanuts, then the guy who said it must be a multi billionaire, and dont need the money. Please donate it to charity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>3. it is highly probable that the government will stand to profit from the cpf life scheme with more people dying before collecting payouts. since the amount of money pledged will not go to the beneficiaries, the money will go to the government instead.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-<br></span></strong>CPF life scheme is but an insurance cover, and like any insurance covers, it is dependent on a large pool of funds to give payouts. Thus, if one dies, the payout stops, and is only fair, for such is the risk. The fund is nobly meant to take care of the aged, and its fund comes from the PEOPLE. There is absolutely no reason to bequeth such funds to the next of kin</p>
              <p><br>The PEOPLE stand more to lose, because life expectancy is expected to rise with advancement in scientific research. When more will live beyond 100 yrs old, the fund will be in danger if further payouts are required, thus stressing our contributing members more.</p>
              <p><br>Make no mistake, the balance payouts for one who dies does not go to the govt. It goes back to <strong>PEOPLE</strong>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CPF is the PEOPLE's fund, and when due on schedules, to be returned with interest</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>4. CPF funds are freely gambled away.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-</span></strong><br>Assume a million people contribute $7,200 each a year to CPF = $7,200,000,000<br>Interest the govt has to pay at 4%  = $288,000,000</p>
              <p><br>The govt's CPF board is not an invesment company, thus it assigns GIC to seek out safe, blue chip strong companies to invest in, not cowboy style, but just a realistic and safe figure for example at 6%</p>
              <p><br>At 6% dividens earned a year on $7,2 billion = $432,000,000</p>
              <p><br>With capital still intact to pay back members anytime, and after deducting the 4% interest owed to CPF board, GIC will still have $144,000,000 - and it will be this sum that is used to built schools, pay for defence, offer healthcare, etc, etc, combined with other tax revenues collected in that year.</p>
              <p>All investments come with risk, or there will be no returns. The only solution is to minimise it by getting the best brains and team to manage our funds. Baring global catastrophies such as the current financial crisis, on the whole, GIC had done well with its accumulated returns saved for rainy days.</p>
              <p>And that's just based on an estimate fig of 1mil people. There are more than 3mil working adults today, so guess how much is actually there to protect our citizens.</p>
              <p><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remember always</span>, we have no oil wealth or mineral resources to depend on, except ourselves!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>5.Life expectancy here is expected to shorten due to the claustrophobic condition</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-</span></strong><br>Claustrophobia is a only a mental condition, borne out of self centredness and the selfish unwillingness to share space.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>6.35 years old citizens below cannot buy HDB flats, but PRs can buy with brother sister combo.</strong></p>
              <p><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-<br></span></strong>Irresponsible lie and half truth to mask a hidden agenda within a sentence. 35 years old and below citizens cannot buy flat but can do so on a brother sister combo as well.</p>
              <p><strong>7. HDB flats are expensive</strong></p>
              <p><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-<br></span></strong>Go buy private housing then. Why does a car cost only $21k in Japan but need to cost $80k here? Why do other nations people live mostly in detached houses, yet we live in boxes in the sky? Why is oil only a few cents in the 20s yet it's $2 a litre now? Why is a construction engineer's pay only $1000 in the 60s, but avg $4000 now? Why, why why???</p>

              <p><br>I encourage all to be more discerning. There is nothing wrong in whinning or venting. It only shows your own pettiness. It's ok to be ignorant. It's also ok to complain but hopefully it can be backed up with credible solutions.</p>
              <p><br> But to lie, twist and turn events/circumstances with half truths are malicious acts against to our society.</p>
              <p><br>If anyone has any evidence or wrong doing of the govt, or ruler party, by all means show it or report it to the relevant authorities. There is no need to spread rumours or lies for one's hatred. The consequences will end badly on society, seldom on the monger.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-</span></strong><strong><br></strong>A guy starts work at 21 years old. Salary $2000. CPF contribution from both him and his employer = 30% - $7,200 a year in his account earning 4% compounded.</p>
              <p>By the time he reaches 55 years, he would have an est $520,000 to draw from.</p>
              <p>If he saved at home $7200/yr he would only have $244,000 per year.</p>
              <p>But leaving it in CPF, he would have an additional $276,000, and would have used it for a better and noble cause - to help elevate our society as our forefathers had selflessly sacrificed for our todays, as we must do the same if not more for our next generation.</p>
              <p>This sample does not take into further profit he would gain if he uses such funds to purchase property or his salary or promotion remains stagnant.<br>(this is only a sample liner calculation. If anyone wants to nitpick, please go to CPF board.)</p>

              <p>If we accept the analogy of the X-rated kid that - <strong>IF</strong> every guy starts work at age 21 and retire at age 55 - and has an accumulated $520,000 per year - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what will the CPF pay-out amount be when the number of Singaporean retirees reach age 55 annually</span> ?</p>
              <p><strong>Assuming</strong> that the population size reaching age 55 is 800,000 persons - the amount to be withdrawn will be <strong>S$416,000,000,000</strong>.</p>
              <p>Is there enough in the CPF for this amount to be withdrawn by the 800,000 persons reaching 55 years - with each withdrawing only a small sum of $520,000 ?</p>
              <p>What will happen if the <strong>800,000 persons</strong> turn out to be <strong>1,500,000 persons</strong> annually that represent the baby boomers from the period 1946 through 1962 - before the "Stop at 2 - Family Planning Campaign" succeeded in the mid '70s ?</p>

              <p>So the X-rated mind of a kid has finally learnt to plagiarize
              even the "Wall of Text"</p>
              <p>How did the X-rated kid find the bravado to copy the "Wall of
              Text" style of posting, when it has consistently fight shy to
              tackle such detailed way of addressing issues ?</p>
              <p>The X-rated kid has proven his skill at plagiarizing again.</p>
              <p>If only he could also learnt to copy with
              any substance - even as he had shown so much skill at
              plagiarizing the style but without any ability to
              copy the delivery.</p>
              <p>Lets analyse the contents :-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> How did the X-rated discern that the complaints made were
              demoralizing lies ?</p>
              <p>Can there be "half-a-truth" in the "lies" ?</p>
              <p>What possibly can "lies" be in a X-rated mind ?</p>
              <p>As usual, the attempt of a X-rated kid fall short again
              with its hollow efforts at being as outspoken as those whom it
              wants so badly to be.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we accept the analogy of the X-rated kid that
              - <strong>IF</strong> every guy starts work at age
              21 and retire at age 55 - and has an accumulated $520,000 per year
              - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what will the CPF
              pay-out amount be when the number of Singaporean retirees
              reach age 55 annually</span> ?</p>
              <p><strong>Assuming</strong> that the population size reaching age
              55 is 800,000 persons - the amount to be withdrawn will be
              <strong>S$416,000,000,000</strong>.</p>
              <p>Is there enough in the CPF for this amount to be withdrawn by
              the 800,000 persons reaching 55 years - with each withdrawing only
              a small sum of $520,000 ?</p>
              <p>What will happen if the <strong>800,000 persons</strong> turn
              out to be <strong>1,500,000 persons</strong> annually that
              represent the baby boomers from the period 1946 through 1962 -
              before the "Stop at 2 - Family Planning Campaign" succeeded in
              the mid '70s ?</p>
              <p>Can the X-rated mind handle a report that is prepared by
              others who shows more intelligence then that of a
              X-rated kid -  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.squarecirclez.com/blog/singapores-population-bubble/808"><strong>‘Singapore’s population bubble’</strong> (*1) </a>?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is the worry about the accrued interests, or is the X-rated mind
              unable to handle the bigger issues that are in a harder
              coconut which has been haunting the Elite Talents in
              Government since 1984 when the Howe Yoon Chong Commission was
              formed to study the CPF withdrawals for the Aged ? </p>
              <p>Can the X-rated mind look beyond the size of a peanut, or has
              its abilities been limited by the limited space in its peanut shell
              ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How does the "<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Blue
              Statement</span></strong>" reconcile with the "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Red Statement</span></strong>" ?</p>
              <p>Only the X-rated ability of a kid that has shown repeated
              expertise at plagiarizing the simplistic answers will continue with
              its pretense at being outspoken by copying the words and
              explanations of others.</p>
              <p>What else can it offer beyond the 'copy and paste' approach that
              it has become so expert at ?</p>
              <p>The CPF-Life has been designed <strong>to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">delay</span></strong> and even
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">prolong</span></strong> the lump-sum payout of CPF monies as the Government has
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">no
              capacity</span> to payout</strong> even the estimated sum of
              S$416,000,000,000 based on a simple assumption of only 800,000
              persons taking out a peanut sum of $520,000 as each
              person is entitled at age 55. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Beyond exercising the outspokeness to the obvious, has the
              X-rated kid move beyond the fact that Singapore has only ourselves
              when we have no oil wealth or mineral resources ?</p>
              <p>Has it not dawned on the X-rated mind that human resource is all
              that Singapore has, which lead to the fact that we have become the
              source of all the wealth that this PAP Government has been sucking
              since it became aware of how to tweak the money out of Singaporeans
              from cradle to grave ?</p>
              <p>Capital of the assume $7,200,000,000 still intact ?</p>

              Singaporeans are backed up by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3 Million</span></strong> working
              adults ?</p>
              <p>Can there be any truth in such a hollow statement - when

              <p>Is the X-rated mind of a kid trained in psychiatry or
              psychology, or even in sociology for such an outspoken
              claim that  "claustrophobia" is a mental condition ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps it is due to its X-rated familiarity
              of the peanut space above its shoulder ?</p>
              <p>Is the claustrophobia atmosphere of a ONE-room HDB

              ones generally known as those stuck in the vicious cycle of poverty
              ?</p>
              <p>It is not surprisng to understand the pompous thinking of
              a X-rated kid that is only familiar with a peanut size
              living space for his mind - that the ONE-room

              <p><strong>1. CPF is another scheme to suck the people
              dry.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-</span></strong><strong><br> </strong>A guy starts work at 21 years old. Salary $2000. CPF
              contribution from both him and his employer = 30% - $7,200 a year
              in his account earning 4% compounded.</p>
              <p><br> By the time he reaches 55 years, he would have an est $520,000 to
              draw from.</p>
              <p>If he saved at home $7200/yr he would only have $244,000 per
              year.</p>
              <p>But leaving it in CPF, he would have an additional $276,000, and
              would have used it for a better and noble cause - to help elevate
              our society as our forefathers had selflessly sacrificed for our
              todays, as we must do the same if not more for our next
              generation.</p>
              <p><br> This sample does not take into further profit he would gain if he
              uses such funds to purchase property or his salary or promotion
              remains stagnant.<br> (this is only a sample liner calculation. If anyone wants to
              nitpick, please go to CPF board.)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>the sum of $520,000 sounds nice, but you forget that different age group pays different amount of cpf contribution. the older you are, the lower your cpf contribution.</p>
              <p>in addition, most people set up their own family at some point in their life, and buy their own flats. (assuming that a couple have 2 children, and own a 4 room flat) considering that a 4rm flat costs around $320k, acquired in the late 20s and early 40s, they will not have much money left in their cpf saving accounts, since there is a net monthly loss of balance from their account until the flat is fully paid for. and with that, considering the lost of the interest money, it is highly unlikely that the couple will have anything close to $150k.</p>
              <p>in addition, even though in theory, the couple become 'richer' when their flat rise in value, this profit is locked down, as being their only house, they cannot sell it and recoup their money, since they will have to find another house to live in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <strong>2. CPF interest is peanuts</strong><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-</span></strong><br> If CPF $276,000 worth of accrued interest is peanuts, then the guy

              <p>as mentioned above, since you are unlikely to accumulate much savings until you have paid off your housing completely, you are also unlikely to generate much interest.</p>
              <p>________</p>
              <p><strong>3. it is highly probable that the government will stand
              to profit from the cpf life scheme with more people dying before
              collecting payouts. since the amount of money pledged will not go
              to the beneficiaries, the money will go to the government
              instead.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-<br></span></strong>CPF
              life scheme is but an insurance cover, and like any insurance
              covers, it is dependent on a large pool of funds to give payouts.
              Thus, if one dies, the payout stops, and is only fair, for such is
              the risk. The fund is nobly meant to take care of the aged, and <strong>its
              fund comes from the PEOPLE.</strong> There is absolutely no reason to
              bequeth such funds to the next of kin</p>
              <p><br> The PEOPLE stand more to lose, because life expectancy is expected
              to rise with advancement in scientific research. When more will
              live beyond 100 yrs old, the fund will be in danger if further
              payouts are required, thus stressing our contributing members
              more.</p>
              <p><br> Make no mistake, the balance payouts for one who dies does not go
              to the govt. It goes back to <strong>PEOPLE</strong>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CPF is the PEOPLE's fund, and when
              due on schedules, to be returned with interest</span></p>
              <p>_______</p>
              <p>correction: it is not the people's money. it is the savings of individuals who have work hard over the years to accumulate their own retirement savings for their own personal use, and thus should not be forced into this scheme, which reeks of socialism. so why are their kins not entitled to the full sum of the deceased's savings?</p>
              <p>cpf was intended as a mean for people to be independent and self-sufficient, and not rely on others for their retirement. did they realise that the concept of CPF simply does not work out in real life, that for all its grandiose, it is simply a farce, a failure?  savings systems, which cannot cope up with the rates of inflation over time, cannot be a efficient form of retirement plan.</p>
              <p>back then in the 70s, it is envisioned that $250-300/month is ample for one to retire on. 30 years later into the future, today, the same batch of people found out that $300/month is just peanuts. hardly enough to pay the bills.</p>
              <p>and life expectancy is just a figure. the life expectancy for 2009 babies is 83. that means that the current batch of 2009 babies will have a 50% chance of living to the age of 83, 83 years into the future. meanwhile, for the rest of us, we are very much unlikely to live far beyond the age of 85 to benefit from the annuity payout.</p>
              <p>furthermore, chronic diseases once associated with only the elderly are striking at younger and younger age groups. diabetes, heart diseases, kidney failure, cancer, are all striking at younger age groups, including those in their 20s and 30s. with such 'cullings' in place, how many people would actually live beyond 85?</p>
              <p>having collected so much money in the form of tax from the people, why should the government force people to support each other further, with their own cpf savings? shouldn't it be the responsibility of the government to support the impoverish elderly using the tax collected? the social security systems of western countries uses tax as fund generators. they do not eat into the savings of the people for such schemes. furthermore, singaporeans do not have any say with what the government do with their CPF money, when it is firmly locked down in the hands of the government.</p>
              <p>__________--</p>
              <p><strong>4. CPF funds are freely gambled away.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-</span></strong><br> Assume a million people contribute $7,200 each a year to CPF =
              $7,200,000,000<br> Interest the govt has to pay at 4%  = $288,000,000</p>
              <p><br> The govt's CPF board is not an invesment company, thus it assigns
              GIC to seek out safe, blue chip strong companies to invest in, not
              cowboy style, but just a realistic and safe figure for example at
              6%</p>
              <p><br> At 6% dividens earned a year on $7,2 billion = $432,000,000</p>
              <p><br> With capital still intact to pay back members anytime, and after
              deducting the 4% interest owed to CPF board, GIC will still have
              $144,000,000 - and it will be this sum that is used to built
              schools, pay for defence, offer healthcare, etc, etc, combined with
              other tax revenues collected in that year.</p>
              <p>All investments come with risk, or there will be no returns. The
              only solution is to minimise it by getting the best brains and
              team to manage our funds. Baring global catastrophies such as
              the current financial crisis, on the whole, GIC had done well with
              its accumulated returns saved for rainy days.</p>
              <p>And that's just based on an estimate fig of 1mil people. There
              are more than 3mil working adults today, so guess how much is
              actually there to protect our citizens.</p>
              <p><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remember always</span>,
              we have no oil wealth or mineral resources to depend on, except
              ourselves!</p>
              <p>___________</p>
              <p>investments always pose a risk. and ^% is definitely not a low risk investment. in fact, if you look at the investment brochures of banks, you will see that 6% returns is classified as medium-high risk investment. and with that, you stand a substantial chance of losing money.</p>
              <p>furthermore, what does the government do with the returns from such state investment? why should you let others to invest your money, when you could have done it yourself? only recently, did the government approve the calculation of profits by our SWF into the annual budget. which means that for the past 30 years, these profits have been made soley for the sake of making more money, with little benefit to the people. when government gives us payouts, these payouts are the excess tax collected, not the profits earned by GIC. so whatever they earned does not goes to the people at all, only to build up the reserves.</p>
              <p>CPF is not a giant storeroom which only store our cash. it is also a form of bank, and banks do not simply just sit out there on top of a pile of money. most of the money deposited are invested out, which means that cpf isn't really that liquid, thus the need to retain the money longer.</p>

              <p><strong>5.Life expectancy here is expected to shorten due to the
              claustrophobic condition</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-</span></strong><br> Claustrophobia is a only a mental condition, borne out of self
              centredness and the selfish unwillingness to share space.</p>
              <p>_____________________________</p>
              <p>i have no comments on this. but i agree that life expectancy will shorten, not due to claustrophobia, but due to the increasingly unhealthy lifestyle people are now leading.</p>

              <p><strong>7. HDB flats are expensive</strong></p>
              <p><br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reality:-<br></span></strong>Go buy
              private housing then. Why does a car cost only $21k in Japan but
              need to cost $80k here? Why do other nations people live mostly in
              detached houses, yet we live in boxes in the sky? Why is oil only a
              few cents in the 20s yet it's $2 a litre now? Why is a construction
              engineer's pay only $1000 in the 60s, but avg $4000 now? Why, why
              why???</p>
              <p>____________________</p>
              <p>well, they are more expensive now. consider that engineers are highly educated professionals. back then in the 70s, most people are factory employees, making around $500-700 per month. an engineer making $1kcan better afford a $50k 4 rm flat than a factory worker making $500 a month.</p>
              <p>today, with intense competition from foreign talents, an engineer probably makes $2.5k per month, not $4k. the average white collar worker makes $1.5k per month. a 4 room hdb flat cost between $300k -500k (red hill area)</p>
              <p>do the math:</p>
              <p>engineer: pay rise by 2.5X, but housing rise by 6X</p>
              <p>common worker: pay rise by 3 X, housing rise by 6X.</p>
              <p>for either of them, housing has indeed rise above the affordability of the 1970s.</p>
              <p>in addition, recently over the argument over the affordability of hdb flats, nus scholars have stated that the government's basis of affordability is based on a 30 year loan estimate. while for our parents' generation, they pay off their loan between 5-10 years, certainly not the 30 years estimation used by the government.</p>
              <p>furthermore, people are purchasing their first home later in life, in their early 30s. based on a 30yr loan estimation, these people are expected to repay their loan well into their 60s. with the current retirement age at 62, these people will have to continue repaying their housing loan even after they are retired and out of job. how will they be able to afford the servicing of loan, when they are no longer working?</p>
