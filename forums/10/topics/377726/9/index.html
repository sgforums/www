              <p>Finally the "basic social skills" of debating in public forums - that a "zwei-siao-hog" had boasted to teach others - have now been clearly revealed in all its entirety.</p>
              <p>Your hang-up with mutts seem so appropriate in your role of the Master Hog in Georgie's Animal Farm, and it is so becoming of you to accept that role with such enthusiasm that only a "Fascist Hog" can have.</p>
              <p>Have your grown tired of playing with your "turd" that only a Hog will be familiar with - and now switch to toying with a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’</a> ?</p>
              <p>You have certainly got the meaning correct, but unfortunately can the intelligence of an anxious "Fascist" "zwei-siao-hog" appreciate what "Drama" is all about ?</p>
              <p>Even your X-rated pet could not keep his boredom out with me, can anyone compete with the drama of the resident <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’</a> ?</p>
              <p>It is unlikely that the Bear will appreciate the "zwei-siao-hog" interfering with the quiet pride in his <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Narcissist">“narcissist” </a>role as THE one and only <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’ </a>in this Forum.</p>
              <p>The "zwei-siao-hog" should return and rest in his familiar 'turd', or migrate to some cleaner sanctified turf to seek absolution for his "Fascist" insult at associating the worship of Yaweh with that of CSJ. </p>

              <p><br>It is odd that a "hog" will get involved in politics and refer to the SDP and CSJ as chimpanzees, and the MIW as gorillas.</p>
              <p>For all its love-hate emotions towards the SDP-CSJ and MIW-LHL - one will have to wonder if the "hog" is such an authority about the intelligence of Apes when using the ape family to make references to the politicians in Singapore</p>
              <p>If one were to make reference to a detailed study of a report concerning the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.buzzle.com/articles/gorilla-intelligence-other-great-apes.html">‘Gorilla Intelligence And That Of The Other Great Apes’ (*1) </a>- it will be amusing if the "hog" will retract its "zwei-siao" remarks about the SDP-CSJ being chimpanzees considering the vast difference in intelligence levels:-</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">The gorilla has a bigger brain than that of the chimpanzee yet all the evidence indicates that the chimp is the smarter of the two!</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;"> The use of tools in the wild by chimpanzees has been observed and well established for some time now and in fact recently chimps have also been observed successfully hunting lemurs with crude yet self-crafted spears. </span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">On the other hand tool use by gorillas in the wild has been little observed and certainly not to the same extent or sophistication as their more rambunctious cousins, the chimpanzee. </span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">So then do these observations lay to rest once and for all the age old quandary about "which species of ape is second to man in intelligence"?</span></em></p>
              <p>Can a "hog" species be anywhere near the ability of a chimpanzee to be anywhere related closer to "Man" in intelligence ?</p>
              <p>No wonder at the recent open confrontation between LKY and CSJ - the gorilla was stumped for words, and could not reply to the honest questions of a chimp.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is clear that even at meal time, while the "hog" will squeal and grunt without an iota of intelligence to gobble up the muck served for its meal, the chimpanzee will quietly pick and enjoy its meal in quiet concentration.</p>
              <p>With the intelligence of the "hog" in making its "zwei-siao" observation colored with all its bias and prejudiced energy, anyone who is in a hurry during lunch time in town will be seen as walking away from CSJ and SDP.</p>
              <p>When there is so much construction activities in the city, and the buzz of conversation at a food center - perhaps only a "hog" will conduct its political activities in a toned down manner to conceal its "zwei-siao" presence ?</p>
              <p>It certainly will go with the grain in the wooden pattern intelligence that is imprinted in the brain of a "hog" after being repeatedly trashed with a wooden plank. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree about 50% especially about CPF and HDB.    Our leaders should realise that the bottom half of Singaporeans are struggling to meet the endless increasing in prices.  CPF , HDB, transport , etc should go back to basics like in the 70s.  The rate of CPF contributions were much less then and prices of HDB were much lower although the floor areas are bigger than the flats now offered.</div>

              <p>When local born Singaporeans were thrown out of job in 2004 through 2006, with the remaining Singaporeans that remained employed having deep cuts to their wages and CPF - was there any offers of help from the Government to those who were locally born and lived here all their lives ?</p>
              <p>Even when no help was extended in terms of "unemployment aid" - the jobless were only asking for their <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PERSONAL</span></strong> CPF savings to be open for their use, and still this request was <strong>REJECTED</strong> outright.</p>
              <p>A ST Newsreport had even headlined PM LHL claiming that "<em><span style="color: #ff0000;">it is not the job of his government to look for jobs for jobless Singaporeans</span></em>" - when the jobless had numbered no more then 4 per cent at its peak by 2005.</p>
              <p>Surprisingly, about one day later, ST News reported China's PM Wen Jia Bao telling a crowd of concerned and desparate China nationals in a provincial town that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the government will ensure that there will be jobs for everyone</span></em>".</p>
              <p>That is the X-Factor in leadership which unfortunately an amateur and undiscerning political commentator in a X-rat cannot even be honest to differentiate.</p>
              <p>Your insufferable sanctimonius attempts to teach others of all the false lessons that you have mindlessly plagiarized without any attempts at being circumspect can only open yourself to constant ridicule and contempt.</p>
              <p>It is best that a X-rated kiddie should learn to keep its ignorance to itself, unless it prefer to be seen as a X-rated Rat hopeless polishing the heavily tarnished image of its ageing PAPa.</p>

              <p>You claim to imply being a better person, having lived overseas and that your ex fellow citizens are frogs living in a well, among your numerous posts.</p>
              <p> You claim to have better political experience, maturity and comprehension, with a global outlook, than your fellow ex-citizens here whom you and your kind looked down as narrow minded yokels of one tracked political dominance.</p>
              <p> AND YET, you failed to comprehend the true nature of why the $10million is necessary!</p>
              <p> Look no further than to the US, France and Australia. Look at their integration policies and see how it had failed miserably. Just costs alone on damage to properties was already more than hundred of millions in each country.</p>
              <p> How about lives? Human lives are more precious. No amount of money in this world can ever buy back one single life.</p>
              <p> Worse still, after rebuilding damages and lives, it had done nothing to integrate the people. The problems continued to fester. </p>
              <p> We, 'frogs in the well' as you haughtily looked down on us upon your delusions of granduer pedestal, are pragmatic people. That ten million does not goes into one group of people's pockets. It goes to everyone involved, including our very own citizens in the social integration projects funded.</p>
              <p> Better the millions spent, then to do nothing, and when things get out of hand, even money is of no use.</p>
              <p> Cooperation, a willingness to open up and share, to reach out is more necessary and helpful, than to high and mightly condemn and criticise such efforts.</p>
              <p> Unless, you, the so called global intelligentsia citizen, have better and more practical ideas than just malicious propaganda and impractical lofty idealism to belittle your fellow ex-citizens?</p>
              <p> But then, it wont be necessary, really. We will do fine on our own, depending on ourselves and others who will help us sincerly, as we and our forefathers had done before.</p>
              <p> Enjoy your abandonment of us and the good life you live, and leaving your family back here for us to look after for you, and we will do so. No one gets left behind in our country. Spare us your crocodile tears, whinny justifications for leaving and condemnations. We have gotten used to it.</p>
