              <p>What else can be expected from a pretentious "Bavarian Hog" except loud boastful words - when <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">it will not confront to piss off CSJ and the SDP at a public place</span></strong>, even as they were so "zwei-siao" as to break the rice bowl of the hawkers ?</p>
              <p>Surely we can believe that the pretentious "Bavarian Hog" has soft fish balls to stand up against the shadows of the tyrants and bully boys - afterall, it was "zwei-siao" enough to see the crowd run away from the supposedly noisy CSJ and SDP, but did nothing to protect the helpless hawkers ?</p>
              <p>Why did the pretentious "Bavarian Hog" not piss CSJ and the SDP in public ?</p>
              <p>It would have at least proven the "zwei-siao" claims of daring to "stand up against tyrants and bully boy" ?</p>
              <p>The pretentious "Bavarian Hog" would have hit the headlines of the PAP controlled media - which would have a hullabaloo time deriding CSJ and the SDP.</p>

              <p>What does the "zwei-siao-Hog" mean in stating that <em>"except for the malays, all of us are descended from foreigners to this island"</em> - when our understanding of foreigners refers to the European Colonialists, and all those who are not the main stream races that make up this population ?</p>
              <p>If everyone in Singapore are descended from foreigners, which foreign nationality is the "zwei-siao-Hog" descendants from - even in his pretentious form as a "zwei-siao-Bavarian-Hog" ?</p>
              <p>Are we descendants from foreigners in this land except for the Malays ?</p>
              <p>Obviously the "zwei-siao-Hog" did not read the Malaysian ex-PM Mahathir's book that is titled "The Malay Dilemma" in which he had researched that the Malays had their original homeland in Yunnan Province.</p>
              <p>The "zwei-siao-Hog" can claim his pretentious foreign lineage from the "Bavarian Hog" even as he had shown no "meat balls" to back up his claims.</p>
              <p>We know for a certainty that he may as well have been a crossed with some "sea-hogs" to become a "bastardised miscreant" considering the presence of "fish-balls" that prevented him to back-up his boastful "zwei-siao" claims to be able to confront tyrants and bully-boys and protect Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The "zwei-siao-Hog" is at its pathetic best when it strut with its short legs, huffing and puffing with pretentious bravado in self-importance, when he is afraid even to confront the shadows of CSJ and the SDP.</p>

              <p>I encourage all to be more discerning. There is nothing wrong in whinning or venting. It only shows your own pettiness. It's ok to be ignorant. It's also ok to complain but hopefully it can be backed up with credible solutions. But to lie, twist and turn events/circumstances with half truths are malicious acts against to our society. If anyone has any evidence or wrong doing of the govt, or ruler party, by all means show it or report it to the relevant authorities. There is no need to spread rumours or lies for one's hatred. The consequences will end badly on society, seldom on the monger.</p>

              <p>Be harmonious, I think this is not the stance of government to gag people. Truth can be rumours itself while rumours could also be truth. This interview is interesting with "credible solutions" to reflect on a harmonious Singaporean society and a harmonious world. <a href="http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/UBYDFDGIkSE/">http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/UBYDFDGIkSE/</a></p>

              <p><br>What more need to be said about one who has been awarded the distinguish title of being a "zwei-siao-Hog" - except that this referenced response must prove the totality of this "zwei-siao-imbecile" ?</p>
              <p>What does the "zwei-siao-Hog" mean in stating that <em>"except for the malays, all of us are descended from foreigners to this island"</em> - when our understanding of foreigners refers to the European Colonialists, and all those who are not the main stream races that make up this population ?</p>
              <p>If everyone in Singapore are descended from foreigners, which foreign nationality is the "zwei-siao-Hog" descendants from - even in his pretentious form as a "zwei-siao-Bavarian-Hog" ?</p>
              <p>Are we descendants from foreigners in this land except for the Malays ?</p>
              <p>Obviously the "zwei-siao-Hog" did not read the Malaysian ex-PM Mahathir's book that is titled "The Malay Dilemma" in which he had researched that the Malays had their original homeland in Yunnan Province.</p>
              <p>The "zwei-siao-Hog" can claim his pretentious foreign lineage from the "Bavarian Hog" even as he had shown no "meat balls" to back up his claims.</p>
              <p>We know for a certainty that he may as well have been a crossed with some "sea-hogs" to become a "bastardised miscreant" considering the presence of "fish-balls" that prevented him to back-up his boastful "zwei-siao" claims to be able to confront tyrants and bully-boys and protect Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The "zwei-siao-Hog" is at its pathetic best when it strut with its short legs, huffing and puffing with pretentious bravado in self-importance, when he is afraid even to confront the shadows of CSJ and the SDP.</p>

              <p><br>And all the reports stated by you are inconclusive by nature. In fact, the scientific community are confused by the origins of the Malays.</p>

              <p>In fact, the Malays are considered Austronesian people and hence probably the New Zealand theory is more probable than the Yunnan theory.</p>
