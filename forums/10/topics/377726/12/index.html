              <p>The theory of Proto Malay originating from <a title="Yunnan" href="/wiki/Yunnan"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yunnan</span></span></a> is supported by R.H Geldern, J.H.C Kern, J.R Foster, J.R Logen, Slametmuljana and Asmah Haji Omar. The Proto Malay (Melayu asli) who first arrived possessed agricultural skills while the second wave Deutero Malay (mixed blood) who joined in around 1500 BC and dwelled along the coastlines have advanced fishery skills. During the migration, both groups intermarried with peoples of the southern islands, such as those from <a class="mw-redirect" title="Java (island)" href="/wiki/Java_(island)"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Java</span></span></a> (Indonesian), and also with aboriginal peoples of <a class="mw-redirect" title="Australoid" href="/wiki/Australoid"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Australoid</span></span></a>, <a title="Negrito" href="/wiki/Negrito"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Negrito</span></span></a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Melanesoid" href="/wiki/Melanesoid"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Melanesoid</span></span></a> origin.</p>

              <p><br>Has the "zwei-siao-HOG" now turn to comedy as a past-time or as a career ?</p>
              <p>Is the "zwei-siao-HOG" fit to teach anyone anything when it cannot even teach itself to accept simple fact proven by anthropologists - and accepted by political leaders - that Malays are migrants from Yunnan Province in China; while it insist that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the Malays are the original settlers in Singapore, and all other ethnic groups are immigrants here</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>It surely must be "zwei-siao" to promote the idea that CSJ can be in any position to be in political power, when he is made a bankrupt 1000 times more than his ability to earn to settle the bankruptcies.</p>
              <p>It is plain "zwei-siao" to equate CSJ with the PAP - as it shows the typical ignorance of a "zwei-siao-HOG" preferring to let its stupidity lead its already weak intellect.</p>
              <p>It is not a surprise that the once confident "zwei-siao-HOG" - feeling as superior as a pseudo-Bavarian-HOG - should now deteriorate to such pathetic level of dejection in a very public forum, as it cannot get over its fixation with the fact that it can be out smarted by one that it can only deride as a simple turd.</p>
              <p>The familiarity with turd is best left to a "zwei-siao-HOG" that will hog its last favorite word to its death as an unaccomplished Turd from a Turd World Country of Turdistan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Incidentally, the admiration given by "light 123" was for the "zwei-siao" language from a "zwei-siao-HOG" made towards its other nightmare.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the dejected "zwei-siao-HOG" needs a boost for its flagging spirit that now border on dejection. </p>
