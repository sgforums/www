              <p>after reading thru this whole thread, i guess (on offence but ) the entire picture is incomplete, i believe 3 factors which might change a few things are left out</p>
              <p>1) the likely contest of Bishan GRC was not mentioned, i think many forgot on 1 thing, chiam see tong was planning on this area, also with Kenneth Jayaratnam from the Reform party</p>
              <p>2)same as one but they might have a alliance as i last remember talks were underway</p>
              <p>3)in all..this might change a few major things, granted the PAP<em> may</em>  stay in power but likey a decreased popular vote of around 50%  , while the rest might happen as what <a href="/users/259141">Firdaussaid</a> have predicted.</p>
              <p>however in a nutshell should this happens, there will be a lot of power wrangling going on in this transistion period which would lead to many unknowns. one must not forget, which GRC are holding key ministeral post? i know that Bishan for 1 is one of them, (home affairs, 2nd min of def), i think GRCs that have MP linked to defence would be next along with those GRCs with already weaken PAP support.</p>
              <p>@angel 3070- please leave the prenakans (babas) out of this, i really consider it as racism as i belong to those people. however if you want to count LKY as a prenakan, remember this- i heard that he is  a hakka prenakan from his grandmothers side if that counts, as for me i am a hokkien prenakan-so theres some difference here dude, so please try not to generalize us as one big lump of the same people as some of our styles are quite different too.</p>

              <p>My short and sweet answer to the question of this thread is : NOT in our lifetimes!</p>
              <p>Its because, except people forumming or commenting in alternative blogs and forums, the majority could not care less about politics.</p>
              <p>who can even question what i just said?</p>
              <p>Singaporeans effectively accepted all policies dished out in the last 50 years, correct me if you can convince me.</p>
              <p>To the credit of QPicanto, i think his sentiment is quite normal.</p>
              <p>Many issues happened. So, its natural for him to have this thinking that the election may be a watershed.</p>
              <p>He reminds of me 10 years ago. in that election , many turned up to support WP. What happened? Did they not vote for WP? They could not have ticked the wrong box right?</p>
              <p>And then 5 years ago, even more turn up to support WP. What happened? This time they should have learnt how to tick a box right?</p>
              <p>Impression has nothing to do with Reality.</p>
              <p>Even if the whole world change leaders, Singapore will not, in my humble opinion, in the next election. And yes , since the last election , the whole world has basically changed all its leaders if not ruling party.</p>
              <p>Opposition parties have not tackled issues that concern the people enough.</p>
              <p> Its just a big Shame.</p>

              <p>It is true that Singaporeans are evading politics and behaved in a way of not knowing what is happen than knowing it. For the young ones like us, it is more worst, many peoples including forumers do not understand, why Singaporeans are not interested in politics, for most of them, like me, just grumble here and there and life goes on, whatever had increased, implemented, decided by the govt, is long stamped and approved, life goes on.</p>
              <p>What i had studied and noted so far in context of Singapore politics alienation is actually a brainchild of LKY and the PAP. They make Singaporeans willing to sacrifice politics in exchange for Social economy progression. Beside propagating their brand, the govt put heavy emphasis on work and study hard, every layman on the street would understand that you work hard to survive in singapore, and work harder, the govt increase cost of living higher while bringing in more materialism mindset leading to people working more harder to find money to support a living here, as such, where got time for politics. Everytime I talk to my father about politics, he will say, let them win and life goes on, then he go to sleep or watch tv after a long day work. This is a typical situation that i am talking about sacrification of politics for sake of Social economy.</p>
              <p>Next, to the youngs, the govt make study a must, and not only that, must study hard, all these lead to students or young adults looking toward academic success and hoping that will make a career success, and by bringing FTs, we need to compete with them for a bowl of rice, so, where got time for politics?? And that work exactly into their plan.</p>

              <p>Since when has any consideration been given for PR to have the right to vote ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, LHL was blind and a hypocrite when despite saying "mai hum" it will allow a Taiwanese "hum" to enter Singapore, and even to operate a Bar to make its living in the flesh trade with imported talents from other countries.</p>

              <p>The faces of a X-rated Fraud never fail to impress with its characteristic sheepish looks of "dishonesty", "deception", and "delusion".</p>
              <p>Why will the X-rated Fraud become so strident in a thread that it has no clue to form an opinion ?</p>
              <p>Yet it will avoid to defend its egoistic performance on a make belief stage that it insist on building over some imaginery "rocky granite" - which made it so easily blasted by 24 nuclear explosions to wash the X-rated Fraud into a canal that it refused to accept with its pseudo-intellect.</p>
              <p>Amazing that the X-rated Fraud will allow its infatuation with natures end product that is produced so naturally by all living things.</p>
              <p>Still it has its own unique problems not to be able to function in the natural ways - as seen in the manner that it will belittle others, when the X-rated Fraud can only have its satisfaction when it defecate each time at the command of its pseudo-intellect - that it will depend to force its own issues, when all living things have no problems.</p>
              <p>Do normal people get so hung up and become so besotted with a love-hate emotion attached to a piece of natures end product ?</p>
              <p>It is certainly amazing the lengths that a X-rated Fraud will want to torment a piece of nature's end product that it will wish to hang on to for its own dear life - and to see even a femine form in it.</p>
              <p>Pathetic is too simple a word to describe its complex X-rated Fraudulent psyche.</p>

              <p>What i had studied and noted so far in context of Singapore politics alienation is actually a brainchild of LKY and the PAP. They make Singaporeans willing to sacrifice politics in exchange for Social economy progression. Beside propagating their brand, the govt put heavy emphasis on work and study hard, every layman on the street would understand that you work hard to survive in singapore, and work harder, the govt increase cost of living higher while bringing in more materialism mindset leading to people working more harder to find money to support a living here, as such, where got time for politics. Everytime I talk to my father about politics, he will say, let them win and life goes on, then he go to sleep or watch tv after a long day work. This is a typical situation that i am talking about sacrification of politics for sake of Social economy.</p>

              <p>I share the same sentiments as you.</p>
              <p>In many families , i suspect is the same situation of 2 camps. All scared to voice up, some support the PAP some against but in a subdued manner.</p>
              <p>the last 5 years seen more change in mindset.</p>
              <p>But this is not enough.</p>
              <p>Another main factor why i see not much change is the INCREASED number of New Citizens. This most likely will change / have Changed the TREND. The number of voters has increased, I assume.</p>
              <p>Its a wise move nevertheless.</p>
              <p>Many did not see it coming until recent short years.</p>
              <p>Too late.</p>
              <p>Thus no change, imho.  People will continue to accept all policies in a practical sense of the word.</p>
              <p>Change can only Come AS and WHEN PAP decides to do so given now at highnoon, the opposition is still practically unable to make Changes.</p>

              <p>In many families , i suspect is the same situation of 2 camps. All scared to voice up, some support the PAP some against but in a subdued manner.</p>
              <p>the last 5 years seen more change in mindset.</p>
              <p>But this is not enough.</p>
              <p>Another main factor why i see not much change is the INCREASED number of New Citizens. This most likely will change / have Changed the TREND. The number of voters has increased, I assume.</p>
              <p>Its a wise move nevertheless.</p>
              <p>Many did not see it coming until recent short years.</p>
              <p>Too late.</p>
              <p>Thus no change, imho.  People will continue to accept all policies in a practical sense of the word.</p>
              <p>Change can only Come AS and WHEN PAP decides to do so given now at highnoon, the opposition is still practically unable to make Changes.</p>

              <p><br>On the demographic approach , older singaporeans, with the time,  tend to move into politcs discussion and switches side to support the opposition if a right opposition come. Whereas the youngs and middle ages are more in concentration of their careers and study, they alienated themselve from politics.</p>
              <p>LKY understood this situation, therefore he had to curb excellent opposition candidate with lawsuit within his might or alternatively,  bring them in to join PAP. And as our population is getting older and older, as per what i said above, more voters, being eligible even at old age will switch side and test the ground on PAP, with reinforcement of Foreigners here that anger the senior citizens further, the govt had no other choice but to open up citizens to young foreigners in hoping that they champion for PAP during the election.</p>

              <p><br>Did the Taiwanese "hum" forget to add that the apathy of young Singaporeans are also due to the efforts of hypocrites that the PAP government will accept as new immigrants to be permanent residents, or to be the new citizens to subvert all young Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>It is amazing that the PAP government will allow a Taiwanese "hum" to be a resident in Singapore - without any language skill test to be conducted to reveal its atrocious standards - which can only result in the eventual demise of the English Language as the official aministrative language.</p>
