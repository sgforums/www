            <div class='col-md body'>AP Photo shows IranÂ’s new President as 1979 US hostage-taker<br><br>Wednesday, 29th June 2005<br>Iran Focus<br><br>London, Jun. 29 - Iran Focus has learnt that the photograph of IranÂ’s newly-elected president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, holding the arm of a blindfolded American hostage on the premises of the United States embassy in Tehran was taken by an Associated Press photographer in November 1979.<br><br><img src="http://www.iranfocus.com/uploads/img42c16163b1a05.jpg"><br><br>Prior to the first round of the presidential elections on June 17, Iran Focus was the first news service to reveal AhmadinejadÂ’s role in the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran.<br><br>The identity of Ahmadinejad in the photograph was revealed to Iran Focus by a source in Tehran, whose identity could not be revealed for fear of persecution.<br><br>Soon after the Iranian Revolution in 1979, Ahmadinejad, who was studying in TehranÂ’s University of Science and Technology, became a member of the central council of the Office for Strengthening of Unity Between Universities and Theological Seminaries, the main pro-Khomeini student body.<br><br>The OSU played a central role in the seizure of the United States embassy in Tehran in November 1979. Members of the OSU central council, who included Ahmadinejad as well as Ibrahim Asgharzadeh, Mohsen Mirdamadi, Mohsen Kadivar, Hashem Aghajari, and Abbas Abdi, were regularly received by Khomeini himself.<br><br>Former OSU officials involved in the takeover of the U.S. embassy said Ahmadinejad was in charge of security during the occupation, a key role that put him in direct contact with the nascent security organizations of the clerical regime and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards, which he later joined.<br><br>After the 444-day occupation of the U.S. embassy, Ahmadinejad joined the special forces of the Islamic Revolutionary ProsecutorÂ’s Office, based in Evin Prison. The Â“Revolutionary ProsecutorÂ” was Assadollah Lajevardi, who earned the nickname the Butcher of Evin after the execution of thousands of political dissidents in the 1980s.<br><br>Defectors from the clerical regimeÂ’s security forces have revealed that Ahmadinejad led the firing squads that carried out many of the executions. He personally fired coup de grace shots at the heads of prisoners after their execution and became known as Â“Tir Khalas ZanÂ” (literally, the Terminator).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So what are the Americans gonna do? Impose more sanctions on Iran for democratically electing a 'terrorist' to the Presidency?<br><br>No doubt he (the president-elect of Iran) is a hardliner. Apparently, he has openly encouraged Iranian modelled 'Islamic Revolutions' all around the world. Who knows he might set up the Soviet equivalant of 'Comintern', which aim was to spread communism worldwide, only this time it is the spread of a hardline, intolerant form of Islam. That is just speculation on my part of course. I'll rather like to think it just a cautious moderate letting one go so as not to come across as one straying from his roots. Afterall, his come from behind win was crafted by none other than the Ultra-Religious Right themselves.<br><br>On the other hand, this are early days. We do know he is an excellent administrator from his time as Mayor of Tehran. He has also reiterated the stance of the previous administration in continuing dialogue with the EU on the nuclear issue. Furthermore, I'm sure he stands far well better in the eyes of the Ayatollahs than his soon-to-be predeccessor. So, he might just be able to get things done unlike Kohmeni.<br><br>On the issue of he being a 'terrorist'. Well, I guess that just even the books. Afterall, the Pot head cum AWOLer became the President Of the United States!<br>and the Coperate Blood Sucker became his deputy.<br><br></div>
