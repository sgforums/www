            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore has been inefficiently managed because it has followed a top-down system where one man takes control of all major policies but he cannot implement many goals and challenges despite all the policies.<br><br>It could have become a greater nation where people willingly carry out their parts in producing a more vibrant and self-relient economy.<br><br>It is time to ponder over what kind of leadership PM Lee should adopt. Personally I think he should be more proactive and pro-people and not practise the past habit of denying problems without solutions.<br><br>What is leadership? What are leaders supposed to do or accomplish ?<br><br>In my personal opinion, leaders should possess the following qualities :-<br><br>(1) Passion,<br>(2) Ability to Motivate followers,<br>(3) Ability to get people to work with coordination and apply knowledge.<br>(4) Ability to translate complex goals and ideas into implementation processes to bring about competitiveness, technology start-ups and jobs etc.<br>(5) Invest monies and perform tasks with Accountability and Transparency<br>(6) Collective leadership by core team to make major decisions,<br>(7) Sense of integrity free from theoretical assumptions or controls that stifle mass participation in knowledge application.<br><br>A leader should first possess the passion to persuade people to his beliefs or visions and not insist on people's acceptance of his visions, precepts or assumptions.<br><br>He should serve his followers as humility of servant with reliability, or sense of justice, empathy to attain social and economic wellbeing of all.<br><br>He should be honourable, possess integrity and not engage in artful arguments or fallacies or rhetorics or empty promises.<br><br>He should understand the needs and aspirations of people and the intimate relationship between social, cultural sphere and economic vibrancy so as to nurture and unleash their skills and talents of the people.<br><br>A leaders should provide his people with broad-based practical education to facilitate widespread application of technology and knowledge.<br><br>He should empower people to work for results by laying down challenges and goals in participative processes to enable all to compete together as a team.<br><br>He should practise collective leadership for accountability and transparency and produce teamwork that is creative, entrepreneurial and proactive in every field.<br><br>A leader should be proactive and people-friendly and avoid using petty controls and regulations, or practise artful creative accounting, double taxing and recovering of costs to full market values that will cause hardship.<br><br>He leader should regard people as true partners so that all will have a part to play as a team and all will be totally involved in decision making and effective implementation working towards results.<br><br>Above all a leader should motivate his followers in maximizing the utilization of resources to realize innovations, entrepreneurship, application of knowledge and value-add competitiveness.<br><br>When leaders identify all challenges and tasks for team performance through objective-steps processes, they will empower the team to reach for overall efficiency and productivity with coordination and application of knowledge at all levels to attain results and objectives.<br><br>If PM LHL cannot change the leadership style of his father, Singapore will remain the same - people migrating to other countries, losing our talents to others, talented people will stay away and not willing to contribute with views or good suggestions, preferring to earn monies and let the country's social and economic problems stay unsolved..<br><br>It will not make any difference if MM Lee retires or not if he cannot bring about the above-stated changes through his son.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As a further illustration of my foregoing points about government's past top-down management inefficiency, NKF types of problems were widely known and pointed out to the government before. 2 years ago, a Whistle Blower Bill was even proposed but it was shot down on the pretext that Singapore was not ready for such accountable governance.<br><br>Why was it shot down? It is because top-down system of governance will not allow many good ideas to go through due to it inherent lack of accountable and transparency.<br><br>Similarly the recently proposed Codes of Corporate Governance for companies with legal sanctions for their enforcements was also shot down on the ground that Singapore was not ready for it.<br><br>Why? Is it not because GIC or Temasek might not want to open up and be subjected to such codes.</div>

" - I wonder who else in the Political Leadership you can possibily be referring to; as the only one that is constantly worrying about MONEY is "harry" again.<br><br>He worries about the corruption that can afflict his party members, he worries about the sufficiency of pay to his cabinet and his civil services, he worries about the excessively high salary that Singaporeans are paid which will only ruin his plans of bringing Singapore forward - and yet it was also his own scheme to force Singapore wages to a higher level so as to force the pace of higher technology being introduced to move Singapore to a higher plane of technical competence.<br><br>Can he still contribute or will he be a hindrance ?<br><br>As matters stand, he is drawing an annual salary of a Million Dollars and more, PLUS Fees from giving speeches at forums overseas ?<br><br>Yet he will reveal occassionally that <strong>he has taken a back seat </strong>and allowing the younger Ministers to run the show.<br><br>If he has admitted to taking a back seat, and functioning only on Stand-by, should he be drawing the full time salary of an active full time Ministers.<br><br>Can the Cabinet function independently in decision making process, or will the decision making process be bogged down due to the constant refererral of matters that require 'harry's input' ?<br><br>Will he not be a burden and a hindrance to the Cabinet ?<br><br></div>

He should retire gracefully and people with passions and commitments take over to solve the 20 problems without any more hindrances from hims or excuses.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to disagree with that. I think LKY will NEVER step down. He said something like this before "... even if you lower me into the grave, if i feel something is wrong, i will get up..." which reflects his strong determination to continue dominating in Singapore politics.</div>
