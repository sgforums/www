            <div class='col-md body'>Let me try to summarise the report in zhao pao paper today for the benefit to those who don't read the chinese paper. However if you do read chinese please see the full report below.<br><a href="http://www.zaobao.com/sp/sp050910_510.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.zaobao.com/sp/sp050910_510.html</a><br><br>The report say that fellow Singaporean living in Marsling were trying their best to keep the area mosquito free but they saw that there was a drain clogged with dead leaves and rubbish make the drain water stagnant and prone to mosquito breeding. So they complain to HDB who claim that the drain does not belong to them. So they went to the Town Council who claim that the drain does not belong to them too. After about a year of complaint, they reported to Ministry of Environment who would send someone to fog the area once a month. From the picture in the newpaper, the condition of the drain still remain the same.<br><br>Today, the ST reported that the PM is setting up a Inter-ministerial committee to fight Dengue fever. Maybe the first thing they can do is to identify who owns the drains.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
