              <p>Will foreigners respect Singaporeans when they are in the
              majority and we are in minority?</p>
              <p>Even the PAP regime sides with them, not us, foreigners will get
              cocky.</p>
              <p>I ask you, if batam is flooded with Singaporeans, the government
              praises you and criticises the locals,  will you still show
              respect to the local people there?</p>
              <p>You will act humble or cocky?</p>
              <p>Who is to fight for our interests?</p>
              <p>PAP all side with foreigners.</p>
              <p>This bastard PAP regime really make me feel very disgraced and
              angry.</p>

              <p>Very clearly that the government not siding the locals but unfortunately the election results shows that locals support them so cannot blame them for making policies which pro-FT, sadly to say though.</p>
