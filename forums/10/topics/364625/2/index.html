              <p><br>Happy is in one mind, as long as you are happy in what you are doing legally, you are happy. External influences never cease to influence to the negative aspect of life, just ignore it, be contend with life, do what you like, careless about what people said, try to compare more with the weaker state of human life rather than the higher end and finally, know your limitation. You will find happiness in it. Which family dun have problems??? Which countries dun have problems?? Which country citizens dun critise their govt but still vote for them?? Same same, u go malaysia, the taxi driver will curse their govt, you go thailand, the road seller will curse their politicians, you go Singapore, old Uncles and aunties always comment on govt.

              <p>angel, i think happiness is determined by both inside and outside, i cannot understand the reason why in such developed and stressed society, the alcohol is that expensive, if you say it's to prevent that driver maybe get accident after drinking, it's a typical singapore example, result oriented, figure oriented, just to reduce car accident, you cannot take away the right to indulge in alcohol.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I find that FT is a very vague phrase, what is FT, if you are rich, you should be call FR, foreign rich, if you are an Academic, you should be call FS, foreign Scholars, if you are real talent in singing or sports or technical skills, then you should be term as FE, Foreign entertainer, FSP, for sport, FTECH for technical know how, and so on...but just by giving a name FT, PRC Gals at my pub who knows how to entertain men are also FT mah...I think the govt should segregate all these Foreigners and filter out those who are actually not talents to get out of here, some just wear a coat, tie and sell bird nest also talent ar??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I mean as a country, you can attract foreigners talents, but are you getting the right talents?? And also you should try to attract talents that are in short in, not attracting talents to do job that belong Singaporeans bread and butter issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the moment, i think the hidden agenda for attracting talents is to increase the population no matter what talent you are...</p>

              <p>a typical example of how PAP rules, is by figure, not by heart, look at the figure, tax on alcohol, can reduce car accident or fight, fine on unsuccessfull suicide can reduce suicide rate, then fine it, he is treating citizen like machinery, but every human being is emotional animal, when they are not happy, they need to find way to vent it, and when drinking alcohol, can reduce your sense of conscience, don't have to think about what's the consequense of your result, i think it's a perfect psychological therapy, is it,</p>
              <p>though i don't regular drink alcohol, but i think if when  i want , i can drink as many as possible cheap beer ,that's good.</p>
              <p>By the PAP's way of ruling, yes in surface, everything goes well, but in everyone's heart, they feel  they have not thorough enjoy what hard working will pay them back, and is it too much to ask for just cheap beers?</p>

              <p>what i see is not so optimistic, the globalisation, make powerful country levy unfair trade and exploitation on small country,</p>
              <p>the south america have been struggling for paying debt of developed country,  actually because the exchange rate is floating, so they have payed many fold than original debt, ironically, after pay for so many year, their debts didn't decrease but increase.</p>
              <p>and developed country set up factory in poor country, like vietnam, which factor is highly polluting,</p>
              <p>US could wage war to iraq and afganistan, with no justified reason, but DPRD even they launch a salitelle could be criticize for violating some resolution. is  it fair,</p>
              <p>the US's approach is slowly by economic aid, trade to change their target country's ideology, like they said, they try to liberate the people from some country .</p>
              <p>So by globalisation, the voice from small country is not heard.</p>
              <p>like most people watch hollywood movie, then the small buget movie from many country is ignored. How does they the developed country earn money, each dollar they earned ,is from the each dollar vanished in some developing country.</p>
              <p>the developed country's economy have almost saturated, so they have to find new incentive, of that, they have their eyes in asia, that's why asia is been called the power house of the world's economy. Before any top 500 company go to a country, he first identify it's competitive company ,then destroy it, by it's large capital.</p>
              <p>i am trying to say, the future is not so optimistic, you quote keynesianism , i heard that keynes said there is big uncertainty in economics. You can hard predict future by what  happen in history, because many thing changed.</p>
              <p>global warming, and pollution have destroy many species in world. And so many virus, become more and more smart, the human's exploitation of earth, have change earth in many aspect, so i think now, it's not the right time to be optimistic,</p>

              <p>If they are from richer country, then they won't choose singapore for where to work, ya?<br>If government raise the tax of cigar. then you have to pay money for 2 pack to get one pack, if the government open the door for FT, then locals have to face competition from outside.</p>

              <p>again, is what being shaped by PAP policy, if he don't allow
                  many FT come in the first place, then it won't be any problem, i
                  can understand that Boss trying to employ the cheaper worker, when
                  their performance is same, so it require local to be more
                  competitive,</p>
              <p>If they are from richer country, then they won't choose
                  singapore for where to work, ya?<br> If government raise the tax of cigar. then you have to pay money
                  for 2 pack to get one pack, if the government open the door for FT,
                  then locals have to face competition from outside.</p>
              <p>They keep saying upgrade your skills, they overlook that, how
                  far a person's potential could go, no wonder they think like this,
                  because they are elite, they live in big condo, drive car, if under
                  this condition, they could understand the ordinary person well,
                  then that's rare</p>
