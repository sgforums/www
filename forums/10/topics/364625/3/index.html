              <p>Why not? Fire can be used in a good way and a bad way. this applies to other stuffs in our every day lifes. For example, u complete a course in engineering. Another engineer in the society is another "future builder". but being an engineer, u are able to do bad things like hot-wiring a car, is that a benefit to the society?</p>

              <p><br>man , i am not here for a debate,  but i think keep right mentality is important, that's many things more important than job money, house, like we have the same span of life, but the width of life, is different, i think it's important to do with right mentality, so that, when we die , we don't feel much regret about life.</p>

              <p>i think it's hard to define greed is good or bad, it work differently for different person, but if i say you are greedy, i think you will not take it as  a compliment, i say many people , when they are richer, become less happier,</p>
              <p>when they are poor, they work hard for better tomorrow, with maybe his GF, or spouse, but when he become rich, he forget the commitment made by him to his GF, there are hot chicks attracked by his money, and he is seduced, and his wife discover it, typical divorce case,</p>
              <p>i think people don't realise, some rich are not happy, like jone D. rockefeller, when he is 30 plus, he looks like 50 years old. That's why he finally make alot of charity works.</p>
              <p>Greed destroy his health and mentality completely.</p>
              <p>So my principle is don't  think too much, do it, it think working should be joyful in the first place for ordinary people. We don't own a company, however they do not need to undertake the risk of running a company. Working hard attitude is not pushed by other, but generated by the passion in your self.</p>
              <p>i used a buddhism teaching to explain it, greed mean desire, being attached to what you want, i think nice working mentality mean, driving by passion not desire</p>

              <p><br>that is because you believe u are, nobody is saying you are a loser, but i believe you are simply lazy and not motivated after some traumatic change in your life..as a person, especially guys out there, you need to learn to take the up and down of life, life is a journey, do what you are happy at, in the end, sooner or later, no matter if you are rich, poor, lazy, hardworking or lousy, all will meet at the same junction.

              <p>you know it's easy to say than to do, if everything going as planned, then there will be no poors. i really need to rest , and wait. My primary goal for life, is not whether i am successful or not, i rather  like a good family, healthy kids.</p>
              <p>the ability of being happy is equal no matter how successful they are.</p>
              <p>If you get the ability, then very probably i will be successful.  but every human being is different, i think everyone have their advantage and disadvantage, someone going ways too far in looking for success.Forget the primary reason for doing that.</p>
              <p>You know i believe in taoism teaching, so just be natural. Maybe it's the best thing for someone is low in life. Anyway my life is still ok. Don't worry.</p>
              <p>Different person got different definition about life,  i will  go my way.</p>

              <p>What Angel said is right. Get those warm butts moving. I was once like you, down, but I was never out. I hid within my own comfort zone, never venturing out, and began to rot in my despair. But one day I woked up and realized this is not life.</p>
              <p>I re-analyze what was wrong and needed to be done. I re-started at the bottom , as a blule collar worker, worse off than a FW, to break my pride, break my ego, and rebuild my confidence, which is the most important ingredient for success.</p>
              <p>Took orders without question from simple supervisors, and in time, saw and experience many issues that helped me frame a larger view of society that helped me later when I moved up the social ladder, re-establishing my network.</p>
              <p>I see your situation as temporary lost of confidence in yourself. You will need to rebuild it up again. But then it is still up to you to wallow in despair. Only you alone can make a difference - up or down your choice.</p>
              <p>A similar choice the majority of citizens whom are retrenched or out of jobs now, must make or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the rot will set in.</span> We can truly win and overcome adversities, but only if we never give up on ourselves. The evidence is the recovery from our previous and this current financial crisis, which will be over soon. Mankind did not rot, but each individual slogged it out, and everyone counts to successfully truimph together as a human race against the crisis.</p>

              <p>You know any attempt could be end up with failure, and failure is hard to sallow. Maybe someone who try, he succeed, but no one even have the courage to give it a try.

              <p>Who is the govt but representatives of our society? What had our society 'demanded' of you?</p>
              <p>You are free to rot, to live on our handouts, sacrificed by the millions of us who worked as well as our forefathers who had contributed their earnings and efforts to our society. But there is only so much we can give.</p>
              <p>You must help us ( society ) by working, getting a job, be responsible for those you take care of. Is this too much for you?</p>
              <p>I am aware jobs are hard to come by, being that it is a crisis, not only for us but foreigners as well, but should we give up? Every dollar earned is every dollar saved. We all need to rationalized our spending. This is only temporary. Is this too much for you to handle?</p>
              <p>Foriegners are claimed as taking over our ricebowls. It is not their fault. The ones to  be blamed are our local bosses, who set wages, hire and fire. In such an environment, are we to take to the streets or just give up?</p>
              <p>To take to the streets or whine or give up will only produce worse results detrimental to our lives. The only solution is for us all not to rot, but find employment, no matter how mean. It is only temporary, as others in the world too, are slogging it out. Is this too demanding for you?</p>
              <p>Have confidence, fellow citizen. You arent the only one facing this situation. Many had and had overcome it over the years and will overcome this crisis eventually, better and stronger.</p>

              <p>Who is the govt but representatives of our society? What had our
                      society 'demanded' of you?</p>
              <p>You are free to rot, to live on our handouts, sacrificed by the
                      millions of us who worked as well as our forefathers who had
                      contributed their earnings and efforts to our society. But there is
                      only so much we can give.</p>
              <p>You must help us ( society ) by working, getting a job, be
                      responsible for those you take care of. Is this too much for
                      you?</p>
              <p>I am aware jobs are hard to come by, being that it is a crisis,
                      not only for us but foreigners as well, but should we give up?
                      Every dollar earned is every dollar saved. We all need to
                      rationalized our spending. This is only temporary. Is this too much
                      for you to handle?</p>
              <p>Foriegners are claimed as taking over our ricebowls. It is not
                      their fault. The ones to  be blamed are our local bosses, who
                      set wages, hire and fire. In such an environment, are we to take to
                      the streets or just give up?</p>
              <p>To take to the streets or whine or give up will only produce
                      worse results detrimental to our lives. The only solution is for us
                      all not to rot, but find employment, no matter how mean. It is only
                      temporary, as others in the world too, are slogging it out. Is this
                      too demanding for you?</p>
              <p>Have confidence, fellow citizen. You arent the only one facing
                      this situation. Many had and had overcome it over the years and
                      will overcome this crisis eventually, better and stronger.</p>

              <p>Work so hard to let the government bleed u dry for profit? The government gets foreigners to come because they know locals have no talent, hence they earn their profit from human life. And what do the government do? Sit in their chair waiting for the money to flow into their hands.<br><br>Social slaves</p>
