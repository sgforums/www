              <p>Those 'roots' that you speak of are none other than your family and forefathers. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nothing is more epic or dramatic than what they had done so that you may live to enjoy your sojourn here in Singapore this life.</span></p>
              <p>Stare at the mighty towers of Singapore. Look at the great factories of our industrial heartlands. Walk in the pleasant surroundings of our esplande. Ride in the comfort of our MRT. Open your eyes to the ever expanding vista of our Universities.</p>
              <p>These, are only made possible, because your forefathers stayed and worked hard for, so that you, may enjoy the fruits of their labour, in peace and prosperity, not a bed of roses daily, but if you continue to contribute, it will be this foundation you will lay upon for your next generation.</p>
              <p>Without the family, there can be no society. Without a society, there can be no nation. Your family, those whom you love and care about, are your roots, that together created a society and the foundation upon which  we all share and call Singapore our home. </p>
              <p>When applicable foreigners apply for our citizenship, they come with eyes open, similarly to sink their roots. It will be our task to welcome them, guide them, and show them how they too, can be like our forefathers and us, build a peaceful and prosperous future for their next generations, contributing to it and make our multicultural nation great.</p>
              <p>Not all foreigners are saints, and equally so our locals. This will be each and everyone of us citizens task to change stubborn mindsets, for the common good of all, so that our society would survive for us and our next generations.</p>
              <p>This is not a dream but an achievable reality. Change can only happen, and begins with you and me.</p>

              <p>The roots I mean are the time spent living in singapore. You will want to protect singapore more and want singapore to prosper if u have spent most of your lives here.</p>
              <p>And ofcourse the factor which makes a singaporean a singaporean. The heart  for our nation itself. Do those FTs have it?</p>
              <p>The reason why FTs come to singapore is beacause their own countries have much less better enviroments to live in. Imagine a crisis happends in the near future, the first thing FTs will think of, naturally will be to move over to the next better country. Thus leaving singapore to her own impending doom.</p>
              <p>"Why even help a country which isnt even yours?"</p>
              <p>"Why help when the reason FTs are here is to make use of singapore?"</p>
              <p>Singapore now depends heavily on FTs so much that every where u see are FTs. Now then chaos will be sure grip to singapore as theres no way to replace those FTs at such short notice at all.</p>
              <p>Although not all FTs are saints but people will be sure to run when theres impending danger. Running back to their real homes.</p>
              <p>The time for FTs to grow their roots in singapore will be a hundred years.</p>
              <p>But removing FTs will be close to impossible.</p>

              <p>The reason why FTs come to singapore is beacause their own countries have much less better enviroments to live in. Imagine a crisis happends in the near future, the first thing FTs will think of, naturally will be to move over to the next better country. Thus leaving singapore to her own impending doom.</p>
              <p>"Why even help a country which isnt even yours?"</p>
              <p>"Why help when the reason FTs are here is to make use of singapore?"</p>
              <p>Singapore now depends heavily on FTs so much that every where u see are FTs. Now then chaos will be sure grip to singapore as theres no way to replace those FTs at such short notice at all.</p>
              <p>Although not all FTs are saints but people will be sure run when theres impending danger. Running back to their real homes.</p>

              <p>Your heart is where your love, care and concern lays. It lays with your family, relatives and friends, and is where mine and fellow citizens' similarly lay. There is enough of us to protect your love ones, just as you would lay down your life for ours. It is you and me that makes up our society and nation.</p>
              <p>FT/FWs can go anywhere they want. As long as you are beside me in a crisis, it is enough to weather any storm together to protect our loved ones. I trust you more than foriegners. Our loved ones are where our hearts lay, for Singapore is only a name, a piece of rock. It is yours and our love ones that makes up a nation for us to love.... </p>

              <p>I thank you for your kind accolade of me, but in truth, there are many more singaporeans whom are like me or even better than me. You and I can make a better world for everyone, if not the world, at least our own country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at our innocent next generations working hard and play hard, enjoying their childhood. I had been to wretched places on earth and had seen immense suffering. Children and women are the ones who often suffered under the hands of mismanagement by rulers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dont see it happening here. While we are still far from perfect, but we are the building blocks upon which the next generation depends on for a better world. We must not fail them, even though they are not our own, but collectively, they represent a future of better humanity, the way our much suffering forefathers had fought, united and bestowed upon us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for integration, I could write a book on it. There wouldnt be enough pages here. But all it takes is that first step - reaching out to others and helping them feel a sense of belonging in our country, share in our pride for being a democratic and advance multi-cultural nation, both in technology and philosophy in asia, something the foreigners from asian or even western world knows not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The second step would be the sharing of a common goal - personal aspirations, achievable here in our society based on meritocracy and rule of law, which in turns will power our economy to stratatrophic heights in Asia. With such strengths will we then be able to help the less fortunate in our society, so that no one will be left behind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is only the beginning of what we can do, in a new and progressive society we singaporeans are to mature as we hurtle into the future. You and I are part of this bold plan to go where no human has progress before, swiftly and quietly, if only you would read between the national lines.</p>

              <p>But now singapore is developed world. we should set our target higher, there are many thing done by PAP, not humanity friendly, yes , there are different approach to manage a country, singapore have already acheive height in becoming a developed country from a colony,</p>
              <p>And many people doubt that whether singapore chould survive , after british withdraw from singapore,</p>
              <p>next i would say something inflammatory, i think PAP, is a party with communist characteristics, like the whip punishment, high tax in cigarette ,and alcohol. And they policy maker are elite, they think they can decide what's good and bad for citizen, then essence of freedom, is that, even what i do is not good for my self, i am allow to do that,</p>
              <p>some philosopher said,  small country have many advantage than bigger country, and democracy can easily been facilitate in small country,</p>
              <p>maybe  elite in PAP, locals don't enough enough capability of self government.</p>

              <p>While it may not be possible for some to see the big picture, but to continue on where I had been rudely interuppted, most are worried about the financial crisis and had not looked further and should not be blamed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is imperative for everyone to get a job in order to get out of the crisis. As long as each has a job, each will be able to survive the downturn. It is only temporary, for no human will want to be destitute for life. Hunger, and the seeking of food, is natural. At each strata of social class of humanity, each will consumate their natural urge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The rich with their money will find ways, trickling down such monies to all levels, and as Keynesian theory had proven, spending is the only way out of a financial crisis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Earth is still resource rich, and tech had advance and will only continue to advance to better manage resources, which will in turn boost economies through trade.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, the financial crisis will pass. It is only a matter of time. But in the meantime, each must have a job to survive, no matter how mean, and when good times return, we will be able to seek better solutions to prevent another crisis, as well as to look further to more loftier humanity aims.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FT/FWs are required as an economic solution in our country. The social issue can be tackled thru integration. And when the crisis is passed, they can formed the next batch of educated immigrants to help our society make that leap into the big league, so long as our society choose their leaders wisely - opposition or ruling party whomever. </p>

              <p>what i see is not so optimistic, the globalisation, make powerful country levy unfair trade and exploitation on small country,</p>
              <p>the south america have been struggling for paying debt of developed country,  actually because the exchange rate is floating, so they have payed many fold than original debt, ironically, after pay for so many year, their debts didn't decrease but increase.</p>
              <p>and developed country set up factory in poor country, like vietnam, which factor is highly polluting,</p>
              <p>US could wage war to iraq and afganistan, with no justified reason, but DPRD even they launch a salitelle could be criticize for violating some resolution. is  it fair,</p>
              <p>the US's approach is slowly by economic aid, trade to change their target country's ideology, like they said, they try to liberate the people from some country .</p>
              <p>So by globalisation, the voice from small country is not heard.</p>
              <p>like most people watch hollywood movie, then the small buget movie from many country is ignored. How does they the developed country earn money, each dollar they earned ,is from the each dollar vanished in some developing country.</p>
              <p>the developed country's economy have almost saturated, so they have to find new incentive, of that, they have their eyes in asia, that's why asia is been called the power house of the world's economy. Before any top 500 company go to a country, he first identify it's competitive company ,then destroy it, by it's large capital.</p>
              <p>i am trying to say, the future is not so optimistic, you quote keynesianism , i heard that keynes said there is big uncertainty in economics. You can hard predict future by what  happen in history, because many thing changed.</p>
              <p>global warming, and pollution have destroy many species in world. And so many virus, become more and more smart, the human's exploitation of earth, have change earth in many aspect, so i think now, it's not the right time to be optimistic,</p>

                      and work for a couple of years.</p>
              <p>He would be as disillusioned like the many here, perhaps worst..
                      perhaps. he might not be able to take it and commit suicide.</p>

              <p>You said that to me before.</p>
              <p>And I have been out working for a year plus since you told me when I was in NUS (ya and I expect you will say work a few more years, and after a few more years you will say another few more years). Not disillusioned yet leh... In fact still managed to profit indirectly from them, and the profit is increasing :D</p>
              <p>As I said (when I was a student), don't compete in areas that's their specialisation. I still have other ideas which I have yet to implement.</p>

              <p><br>Happy is in one mind, as long as you are happy in what you are doing legally, you are happy. External influences never cease to influence to the negative aspect of life, just ignore it, be contend with life, do what you like, careless about what people said, try to compare more with the weaker state of human life rather than the higher end and finally, know your limitation. You will find happiness in it. Which family dun have problems??? Which countries dun have problems?? Which country citizens dun critise their govt but still vote for them?? Same same, u go malaysia, the taxi driver will curse their govt, you go thailand, the road seller will curse their politicians, you go Singapore, old Uncles and aunties always comment on govt. These are natural phenonmenon</p>
