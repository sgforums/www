              <p>The problem here is not with the students or their
                              abilities.  The interviewers have failed in their job, which
                              is to identify the academic potential of the students and to
                              accommodate for the applicants' different interviewing styles.</p>
              <p>Irrelevant.  We're discussing educational opportunities
                              here, so employment opportunities and even the impact of lack of
                              educational opportunities are red herrings.  Let's not muddy
                              the waters here.</p>
              <p>This still begs the question - I didn't ask if people got enough
                              money, I asked how education and finances would help parents do
                              more for their kids.  I'll put it to you bluntly: if I gave
                              you ten grand today, what precisely would your plan be to help your
                              kid get better grades, and how would it work?</p>
              <p>Nope.  This is the pitfall of all policymakers - those that
                              believe that throwing money at a problem only find that at the end
                              of the process they're broke and they haven't achieved a
                              thing.  It's not what you've got - it's how you go about
                              solving the problem.</p>
              <p>All of the above is based upon the assumption that the teaching
                              that students receive during class time is ineffective. 
                              That's like going out and buying a Ferrari because you assume that
                              a Toyota isn't going to get you from Point A to Point B.  Why
                              not focus on solutions to make classroom teaching more
                              effective?</p>
              <p>It would affect their studies if you assume that the only
                              predictor of academic performance is the amount of time spent
                              studying, ignoring other factors like efficiency of study
                              techniques.</p>
              <p>Certainly if a kid spent all his time after school and weekends
                              helping run the family chicken rice stall with absolutely no time
                              to do homework, you would have a problem there.  On the other
                              hand, I'd wager that such cases do not constitute a significant
                              proportion of Singaporean students.</p>
              <p>Let's take a step back here and be solution-focussed rather than
                              problem-focussed.</p>

              <p>ok, let's clarify. do u mean by education specifically only school education? or does it include other chances tt a child might have to take part in activities tt can help him or her improve as a person?</p>
              <p>i believe we might be talking abt a diff demographic here.</p>
              <p>i wld save up the money, to answer u bluntly, so tt my kid wld nt have to work to get pocket money. and he or she wld be able to use the money for overseas excursions and wld nt miss out simply because we can't afford it as a family.</p>
              <p>my case is related to specifically how financial assistance can benefit  *financially poor* children. in terms of classroom solutions, this is smth tt applies across t the board and affects kids who may come from well to do families as well.</p>
              <p>moreover, isn't this solution u recommend also based on the assumption tt teaching is ineffective?</p>

              <p>Nope. It’s not abt “dropping out”. That would be the extreme. I
              think most of us basically have the means to <strong>not</strong> drop out. What I’m saying is that getting the basics is not a big
              problem, but those who come fr low income families are
              disadvantaged when it comes to the extras that would’ve enhanced
              their education, such as further readings, immersion programmes,
              even hostel stays. They can only afford the basics, but not the
              rest tt wld enhance their education (the things that other students
              who have money can afford).</p>

              <p>Further readings and immersion programmes?</p>
              <p>Hang on - by the time you get to university you're meant to have developed the capacity to have self-directed learning already.  Certainly when I was at university I didn't go for any extra pay-per-use courses or classes, and any extra reading I needed could be found in the library.  That didn't stop me from staying in the top 5% of my classes.  What's with all of this extra stuff?</p>
              <p>From what you wrote earlier, it sounded like people were dropping out of university because they couldn't afford it.  Now, to be blunt, the tune seems to have changed to "they didn't have money to get the nice-to-haves".</p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cathykitty:
              <p>By university, we would be able to apply for the tuition fee
              loan, with interest, of course. But the bursaries would have been
              very useful in paying for other items, and certainly, in ensuring
              that I would not have to resort to giving private tuition to get
              pocket money, which I did, sometimes, at the expense of time spent
              on my studies.</p>
              <p>While it’s true that lots of uni students work part-time, it
              would be better if these jobs were taken out of choice (such as,
              they have gauged tt they wld be able to cope even with the job),

              <p>You get no sympathy here.  Between classes, homework, placements/internships and paid work, an 85-hour week was an easy one for me, with the norm being a 105-hour week.  I did that for eight years.</p>

              <p>Wrong.  Throwing money at the students is like slapping a band-aid on an AIDS patient.  You may cover up the symptoms but you're missing the root cause of the problem altogether.</p>
              <p>When I did a stint as a relief teacher, my biggest problem was not class discipline.  it wasn't students who didn't get the idea either.</p>
              <p>The problem was the lazy, unimaginative 20-year veteran teachers who didn't want their iron rice bowls disturbed.</p>
              <p>By the end of my first month, my poorest-performing students were showing a minimum grade improvement of 15%.  The problem wasn't that they were incapable of understanding the subject matter.  The problem was that the teacher I was relieving was absolutely hopeless at presenting the subject matter and diagnosing where the students were having difficulty.</p>
              <p>For example, in maths classes, it was obvious that the Chinese-educated students were as arithmetically capable as the English-educated ones., but they really struggled with the problem sums.  I took a week out of the syllabus to focus on English and to teach the students to break the sentences down and understand what was being asked of them.  It took a day to diagnose the problem and a week to remedy it, and I got an easy minimum 15% improvement.  I wasn't MOE trained - I just used my common sense to sort things out.  What the hell was the other teacher doing?</p>
              <p>After I got the result, the older teachers came up to me and said, "Don't work too hard".  Honest to God, I swear that they said those precise words.  Next thing I knew, these teachers were going to the principal and complaining that I was "getting along too well" with the kids.  WTF does that mean?  Was I accused of being a pedophile?!</p>
              <p>What it came down to was this group mentality amongst the older teachers that as long as nobody produced a good result, they could all do their own thing and collect their own paychecks without accountability.</p>
              <p>If you want to do something to help the poorer kids, start making teachers as accountable for performance as anybody in the real world, and fire them if they screw up.  They're too damned comfortable in their jobs and it's the students who suffer for it.</p>

              <p>It's still like that now.</p>
              <p>If your students improve a lot under you, the other teachers are not happy. They levy charges like what you said, and other charges like: "the paper you set was too easy" and spread rumours like "must have leaked the questions to the students"</p>
              <p>Lots of backstabbing in MOE schools, especially with the new grading system. That's why it's better to be a tuition teacher.</p>

              ok, man. i think u've missed my point. 
                                  
              the triple As paragraph btw, was a response to someone's complaint tt NUS business sch was becoming more strict. however, if u'd read more carefully, u'd realise tt my second post wasn't just abt tt. 
                                  
              basically, there's jus one point i am making.
                                  
              in the last para of my post, 3 DECEMBER 6:38 PM
                                  
              "i think the system here helps poorer kids to get thru school up to a point. and in tt sense, it is â€œequalâ€� because everyone can have an education. but if the kids shld need more help, they will have a lot of problems finding it."
                                  
              that, Gedanken, is the main point i am making. the "equal" education is not that equal if we take into account other activities tt cld contribute to the child's learning. poorer students miss out on those.
                                  
              the points abt teachers and training in the post previous to this one was actually only made to counter a point abt "old teachers" tt u brought up. in fact, i am not too comfortable with how u seem to generalise tt older teachers are not responsible and just too "damned comfortable". those sound like judgement calls that are better suited for a teacher's gripe thread on "i hate old teachers who dun do their work". 
                                 
              certainly not this thread, which is supposed a discussion on whether or not singapore kids have equal education, regardless of their parents' wealth (pls see the first letter from MOE, and *read it*)
                                  
              basically, i am saying tt ur bringing in the teachers into this discussion of an equal education is IRRELEVANT. when the term "equal education" is used in the thread topic, there is the implication tt it is smth to be discussed at the policy level. that is how i interprete it anyway. so, i don't think we shld talk abt teachers or "classroom solutions" too much, because school teachers (who have not gone on to become MOE officers) have very little bearing on our education policies. in case u didn't know, Singapore works top-down. 
                                  
              since my argument sounds so muddled to you (perhaps i've brought in too many red herrings), why don't you tell me *your* main line of argument. 
                                  
              you have gone fr socie analysis to telling us how u've managed your time well in uni to finally, talking abt "old teachers" being, essentially, ineffective in the classroom.
                                 
              i really lost track of what you were trying to say somewhere along the way. can u explain to me what you mean by "throw in the bin". are u suggesting tt the older teachers be fired if they underperform? 
                          
              also, what are u gg to replace with these teachers? robots? in case u didn't know, MOE has problems hiring teachers and getting them to stay long term. and as it is, class sizes are already 40 to one teacher for sec schools. 
                         
              what's ur point, really? do you think singaporean kids have equal education? if you will be so kind, summarise ur main argument in one paragraph. or refer me to a section in ur previous post tt makes it clear.
                                  
              thanks.

              the points abt teachers and training in the post
                  previous to this one was actually only made to counter a point abt
                  “old teachers” tt u brought up. in fact, i am not too comfortable
                  with how u seem to generalise tt older teachers are not responsible
                  and just too “damned comfortable”. those sound like judgement
                  calls that are better suited for a teacher’s gripe thread on “i
                  hate old teachers who dun do their work”.
                  certainly not this thread, which is supposed a
                  discussion on whether or not singapore kids have equal education,
                  regardless of their parents’ wealth (pls see the first letter from
                  MOE, and <strong>read it</strong>)</blockquote>
              <p>Given the points I have
                  demonstrated above, you'll understand if I do not take your advice to
                  “read it” with any measure of seriousness.  I don't have the time to go
                  after individuals who steal the public's money by drawing paychecks
                  that they don't deserve.  Had you taken your own advice, you would
                  have realised immediately (as eagle had) that I was talking about the
                  system's tolerance of such individuals rather than the individuals
                  per se.</p>

              basically, i am saying tt ur bringing in the teachers
                  into this discussion of an equal education is IRRELEVANT. when the
                  term “equal education” is used in the thread topic, there is the
                  implication tt it is smth to be discussed at the policy level. that
                  is how i interprete it anyway. so, i don’t think we shld talk abt
                  teachers or “classroom solutions” too much, because school
                  teachers (who have not gone on to become MOE officers) have very
                  little bearing on our education policies. in case u didn’t know,
                  Singapore works top-down.</blockquote>
              <p>It's astounding how you could trip over yourself within the space of a
                  short paragraph like the one above.  Singapore works top down, so
                  everything is driven by policy, and to boot you acknowledge that the
                  title of the thread implies policy-level discussion, but then you go
                  on to say that we shouldn't talk about it?
                  If you think I'm sounding frustrated at this point, it will be the first
                  accurate judgement that you have made so far.  If I'm you are indeed
                  a graduate as you claim, I'm very disappointed.  What you have done
                  above fails the basic level of analysis that is the raison d'etre of
                  undergraduate education.  Had one of my Honours students written what
                  you had, I would have immediately told them that they would fail
                  because they just sank their own ship.</p>

              since my argument sounds so muddled to you (perhaps
                  i’ve brought in too many red herrings), why don’t you tell me
                  <strong>your</strong> main line of argument.</blockquote> <blockquote>you have gone fr socie analysis to telling us how u’ve

                  somewhere along the way. can u explain to me what you mean by “throw
                  in the bin”. are u suggesting tt the older teachers be fired if
                  they underperform?</blockquote>
              <p>Again, disappointing.  You have failed to see how each piece fits into the
                  overall picture.
                  The “socie analysis”, as you fail to grasp it, demonstrates the basic
                  tenet of this entire discussion.  Teachers cannot make students learn
                  anything; they can only help students learn.  Someone with knowledge
                  of teaching, like eagle, grasp this immediately, but because you fail
                  to understand it you choose to disregard it.  For someone who claims
                  to have tertiary education, I am saddened to tell you that you have
                  failed to develop the basic level of intellectual discipline required
                  of you qualification.</p>
              <p>As for the time management point, that has nothing to do with the main line
                  of argument.  The intent was simply to tell you that your sob story
                  about balancing work and studies doesn't hold water.  Many have done
                  more and gone further.</p>
              <p>Vis-a-vis the “old teachers” point, as I've already said, you're barking up
                  the wrong tree and making yourself uncomfortable for nothing.  I'll
                  review and extend in the next point.</p>

              also, what are u gg to replace with these teachers?
                  robots? in case u didn’t know, MOE has problems hiring teachers and
                  getting them to stay long term. and as it is, class sizes are already
                  40 to one teacher for sec schools.</blockquote> <blockquote>what’s ur point, really? do you think singaporean

              <p>Okay, by this point, given all of the wrong turns you've taken, I can't fault you for your conclusion, only
                  for the wrong turns and lack of intellectual discipline.  Given your
                  demonstrated lack of capacity for identifying underlying concepts, I
                  guess I'll have to spell it out, loathe as I am to repeat myself.</p>
              <p>First, I'll go one better - here's a sentence that summarises everything: if school teachers were doing their jobs, we wouldn't be talking now.</p>
              <p style="font-style: normal;">I'll say it again:  t<span>eachers
                  cannot make students learn anything; they can only help students
                  learn.  This is a well-researched and widely-accepted underpinning of
                  what the teaching industry worldwide knows about the practice of
                  teaching.  The incorporation of this simple point is the underpinning
                  of any school of thought in teaching excellence.  The ones who don't
                  get that their job is to do their utmost to help their students learn
                  are the ones who deserve to get fired.</span></p>
              <p style="font-style: normal;"><span>It's
                  been done before.  In the early 90's, Victorian premier Jeff Kennett
                  shook up the state's teaching industry by annulling all long-term
                  teaching contracts and forcing teachers to justify their continued
                  employment.  There was a huge public uproar and strikes all over the
                  place but guess what?</span></p>
              <p style="font-style: normal;"><span>It
                  worked.</span></p>
              <p style="font-style: normal;"><span>Teachers
                  took up being serious about knowing what their jobs were and teaching
                  standards improved markedly.  Those who couldn't or wouldn't get it
                  were fired.  Tough luck – the Department of Education's job was to
                  provide (surprise) quality education to the kids and they did that. 
                  Losers who thought they had an ironclad meal ticket lost out, and
                  I'll shed no tears for them.</span></p>
              <p style="font-style: normal;">Next, I'll say it again:  t<span>eachers
                  cannot make students learn anything; they can only help students
                  learn.  You're never going to turn Forrest Gump into Albert Einstein,
                  but dammit, if you've helped Forrest do the best he's capable of,
                  you've done your job.</span></p>
              <p style="font-style: normal;"><span>And
                  every school teacher is employed to do his or her job.</span></p>
              <p style="font-style: normal;"><span>This
                  leads me to the piece la resistance. If teachers did do what they
                  were supposed to do, this discussion wouldn't be taking place because
                  no amount of private tuition, </span>*ahem<span>* immersion programmes or trips on the River Seine for 14-year-olds
                  would make a significant difference to the kids' grades.</span></p>
              <p style="font-style: normal;"><span>Quod
                  erat demonstradum.</span></p>

              <p>Ok, sorry then, Gedanken. I don't think I have grasped your main ideas. When I have more time away fr work, I'll read thru all the posts more thoroughly again.</p>
              <p>With regards to your previous post, there are already performance-based assessments for teachers in Singapore. But I suppose you're right that even if a teacher has a low rank in the system, he or she might still be able to stay on.</p>
              <p>However, I do know of teachers in Singapore who have been asked to leave because of poor performance (heard abt it thru my teacher friends). But they would have to be really bad for that to happen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Would this help with the performance culture you're talking abt?</p>
              <p>It's the same for universities here, but I have heard of at least one case, where this policy has been abused by unscrupulous department heads who used "ineffective" as an excuse to get rid of a good teacher who spoke up against them.</p>
