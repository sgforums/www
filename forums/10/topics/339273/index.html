              <p>  I REFER to the letter, 'It's about who can afford better tutors' (Nov
                  26), in which Ms Pamela Liu opined that students from well-to-do
                  families would get into better secondary schools and questioned what
                  would be left for bright but poorer students.</p>
              <p>Ms Liu is wrong to assert that the Primary School Leaving
                  Examination (PSLE) has 'evolved into an exam that divides the haves and
                  have-nots among our 12-year-olds'. The top 5 per cent of students in
                  the PSLE do not come only from a few schools with rich parents. In
                  fact, they come from more than 95 per cent of our primary schools and
                  across all socio-economic groups. In addition, over 2,000 students from
                  155 schools (or about 90 per cent of our primary schools) successfully
                  obtained a place in participating secondary schools this year under the
                  Direct School Admissions (DSA) exercise, based on their talents in
                  different fields. These students likewise came from various
                  socio-economic groups. The criteria each school uses in the selection
                  of students under the DSA are made public on their websites.</p>
              <p>In our schools, all students have access to enrichment
                  activities, such as art, music and sports programmes, or overseas
                  training, exposure trips and competitions.</p>
              <p>Our school-based co-curricular programmes provide
                  opportunities for all students to develop themselves in art, music and
                  sports. Additional funding is also provided to help students,
                  especially those from less well-off families, go on overseas exchanges.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Education strives to enable all students,
                  regardless of their family background and circumstances, to achieve
                  their full potential.</p>

              <div class="top_headline">I think about year 2000, the State Times
                  published a study by NUS showing private tuition has no effect on
                  grades. This logic is flawed because the study did not control for
                  competent teachers or motivated students.<br></div>

              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Understand their logic now</span></p>
              <p>1.<strong>The top 5 per cent of students</strong> in
                  the PSLE do not come only from a few schools with rich parents.</p>
              <p>2. In
                  fact, they come from more than 95 per cent of our primary schools and
                  <strong>across all socio-economic groups</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Does 50% from well off family and 1 % from low income group means <strong>across all socio-economic groups? </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Most importantly in the top 5% PSLE cohort, has the number of lower income group <strong>increased, stayed the same, or decreased? </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>It must be very impressive</strong> if the lower income group can do better or remain the same without the help of private tuition.</span></p>

              <p><br>Those conditions aren't exactly fair, you're talking like Singapore's educational system is radically different from other countries'. </p>
              <p>Under any educational system the high income group will have the advantage. But unlike say the US in which the rich and powerful can still push their poor performing children into top schools like Yale (eg: George W Bush), you're still going to need top PSLE grades to enter RI, RV, Hwa Chong..etc.    </p>

              <p>Neither.</p>
              <p>Over here in Melbourne, I worked on a project that used census data (i.e. all schools, not just a representative sample) to assess the influence of various school characteristics on  student results.  This was done via structural equaltion modelling and the variables included factors such as private vs public schools, as well as application levels of best-practice teaching practices.</p>
              <p>None of it made a difference.</p>
              <p>The things that did come out of the modelling were that:</p>
              <p>1) Teachers do not have the power to improve results, only to remove obstacles to reaching maximum potential performance<br>2) Effective teaching practices do not influence results (bearing in mind the caveat in the point above), but are effective in instilling an interest in learning in the students<br>3) If there is a predictor of results upon leaving the school, it is the students' performance at the time of entering the school - the high-performance schools' claim to fame is simply based on the quality of students it chooses to admit.</p>

              <p>i mean, what can we do about the income gap and its influence on education? we can't possibly tax the rich even more and give all to the poor to reduce the income gap. the "have-nots" can simply study and work harder to make their dreams come true. even if this wealth problem is eradicated, i'm certainly sure that some people will start complaining about the intellect their children were born with compared to children who were born with hints of intellect and creativity.</p>
              <p>yes, i do admit the richer have better chances of getting high grades, but that is on the assumption that they are willing to put in effort as well and apply what they learn in tuition to get aces in their examinations. i am just quite irritated at those people who keeping calling this unfair. there is nothing we can do about it, or should we ban tuition and fine those who hire private tutors?</p>

                          education? we can't possibly tax the rich even more and give all to
                          the poor to reduce the income gap. the "have-nots" can simply study
                          and work harder to make their dreams come true. even if this wealth
                          problem is eradicated, i'm certainly sure that some people will
                          start complaining about the intellect their children were born with
                          compared to children who were born with hints of intellect and
                          creativity.</p>
              <p>yes, i do admit the richer have better chances of getting high
                          grades, but that is on the assumption that they are willing to put
                          in effort as well and apply what they learn in tuition to get aces
                          in their examinations. i am just quite irritated at those people

              <p>Over here in Melbourne, I worked on a project that used census
              data (i.e. all schools, not just a representative sample) to assess
              the influence of various school characteristics on  student
              results.  This was done via structural equaltion modelling and
              the variables included factors such as private vs public schools,
              as well as application levels of best-practice teaching
              practices.</p>
              <p>None of it made a difference.</p>
              <p>The things that did come out of the modelling were that:</p>
              <p>1) Teachers do not have the power to improve results, only to
              remove obstacles to reaching maximum potential performance<br> 2) Effective teaching practices do not influence results (bearing
              in mind the caveat in the point above), but are effective in
              instilling an interest in learning in the students<br> 3) If there is a predictor of results upon leaving the school, it
              is the students' performance at the time of entering the school -
              the high-performance schools' claim to fame is simply based on the
              quality of students it chooses to admit.</p>

              <p>Therein lies the difference between A2, A1... or rather, grades ranging from 70 to 100.</p>
              <p>I think that's where the potential varies.... :D</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And the problem is that most students are not brought to their potential, and hence another reason why the grades vary so much...</p>

              <p>But the way you're saying is that wealth is the only
                  prerequisite to having high grades.</p>
              <p>But these higher income families can also mean that their
                  parents are highly educated professionals and thus could instill
                  better learning values into their children. </p>
              <p>Meaning the children do better not neccesarily because they got
                  more money for tutors but because their parents know how to
                  nurture them better.</p>

              <p>The quote was taken from Tan Kin lian. I think what he meant is the higher income has a disportionate chance of having high grades,maybe due to private resources. I do agree on most of what you say about good parenting.</p>

              <p>My charge-out rate to do this stuff is three grand a day, so yes, I think I know a thing or two about research.  Your  "two sides of a story" defence would apply if I picked a random sample and extrapolated it to the general population.  The strength of the findings is that it is census data - we literally surveyed everybody, so there's no "two sides" to it.</p>

              <p>well, few things in life are fair and if people keeping ranting day and night about getting equal opportunities, an equal start and footing, an equal whatever...., we will never be able to achieve much as a society because people are so obsessed with their communist-like beliefs.</p>
              <p>when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade. you make the best out of what little or many opportunities you are given. the truly successful people in life are those who can harness their opportunities to the maximum despite the obstacles and circumstances and excel in whatever they do.</p>
              <p>i mean, what can we do about the income gap and its influence on education? we can't possibly tax the rich even more and give all to the poor to reduce the income gap. the "have-nots" can simply study and work harder to make their dreams come true. even if this wealth problem is eradicated, i'm certainly sure that some people will start complaining about the intellect their children were born with compared to children who were born with hints of intellect and creativity.</p>
              <p>yes, i do admit the richer have better chances of getting high grades, but that is on the assumption that they are willing to put in effort as well and apply what they learn in tuition to get aces in their examinations. i am just quite irritated at those people who keeping calling this unfair. there is nothing we can do about it, or should we ban tuition and fine those who hire private tutors?</p>

              <p>read my above argument. i think that settles the whole problem and i agree that a poor but motivated student can do much better than a lazy rich student.</p>
