By the way, proton, where's the answers I have been asking from you in my previous posts? And I wonder do the below posts count as admissions of defeat.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by protonhybrid:</div><div class="quote_body">you're just babbling about your OWN G******* self n*mrod.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by protonhybrid:</div><div class="quote_body">i see your development hasn't accelarted, au contraire it's RET@RDED!<br><br>keep repeating this until you advance enough intellectually to see the fallacy. till then au revoir.</div></blockquote>Look, I don't wish to spend more time arguing with you guys about an opinion I and many others hold. But to see someone having an opposite view, I'm curious to know what made them think so. But as you can see, it's taking up too much time while the topic is getting nowhere, and I know many of us involved are really exhausted.<br><br>Let me just propose you one final question to satisfy what I, and maybe others as well, would like to know. Please reply with either a "Yes" or "No" - that will be good enough. <strong>If you wish to justify your answers or have any other comments, please keep them in a separate post. I just need that "Yes/No" answer.</strong><br><br>Here's the question: Do you think it's fair for you to go into a car with a acquaintance of the opposite gender and end up getting a jail term of 6 months and 200 lashes for it?<br><br>If you can't even answer this question and consciously skip it for the sake of throwing in your own argument, I would then see no purpose for us to continue this debate.<br></div>
