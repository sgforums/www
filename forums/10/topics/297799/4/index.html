In a very heavily dominated male society , how could a woman possibly have a voice to leverage using the media? It was her lawyer , who is a well known human activist, who appealed her case ,as the newspaper reported. Her husband used the media to appeal her case. I don't see how she , being the lowly woman , could command a media presence in Saudi Arabia.<br><br>For him appealing her case and for her husband using the media, she got an increased number of lashes . Reassignment of blame to the victim again.<br><br>You are so blind to think that you are so right when you really do need to improve your comprehension.<br><br><strong> Their archaic law makes it right . However as a woman , it is repugnant and absolutely disgusting . I don't have to accept this as a woman and I don't think you have any right to tell me not to criticise any form of discrimination against my own gender.<br></strong></div>

If I am not wrong, [b]honour-killing is prohibited under the Sharia laws. </strong>Numerous Islamic imans and scholars have already voiced their opinions that houour-killing is illegal.[/b]</blockquote>It is their belief therefore their values. I was very careful about the words I choose - notice I didn't say imposition of religion.<br><br>Those are examples especially the one about the Iman who is a religious leader.<br><br>The honor killing is not only inherent in the arabic culture , it is also done in Pakistan . Some of the hardliners actually believe that it is what Islam commands. Under the sharia law in most middle eastern countries , the person who honor kills , does not serve much of a sentence - maybe two to three months. So it just shows how prohibited it really is.</div>
