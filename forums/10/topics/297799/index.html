But shouldnt there be a basic <strong>humane </strong>regulations which can serve as basis for <strong>ALL</strong> norms and laws? But the problem is, the world cannot seem to agree on this basic set of humane regulations.<br><br>For eg,<br><br>we firmly believe excuation by stoning of women is inhumane.

            <div class='col-md body'>It's a privilege to enforce such Islamic ideals. We can't afford such ideals. Women folks are our part of our productive assets and we show appreciation for their efforts by giving them more rights in return. Unlike us, the Saudis have oil and have limited use for their women folk. With limited use, the Saudi women are given less recognition and appreciation. In return, they lived a luxurious comfortable lifestyle that average Singapore men cannot afford to provide.<br></div>

The Saudis seems to be the headquarters of Islam ( <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) only because of their dominion of Mecca, the locus of all Muslims.

It wasn't what to be called divine or immutable in the first place.<br><br><blockquote>eg a man can has multiple wives.<br>I know this occured in many civilisations across the world in ancient times.

The operative cause is no more, irrelevant now in 99% of places and situations, and you can find many muslim scholars, male and female challenging that idea. Some of our local female ones are Norani Othman, Siti Musdah,  Marina Mahathir, Sinta Nuriyah Wahid, Nursyahbani Katjasungkana etc.</div>
