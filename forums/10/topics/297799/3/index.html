Honor killings are not just boogeymen legends in European countries - they are a reality.

Malaysia, Indonesia and Turkey are good examples of countries who can adapt to modernisation - if they can do it , why not the rest?<br><br>So for each hardcore muslim who criticises or even violate the rights of women in countries other than the middle east, there will be a few women criticising the laws of their land.
