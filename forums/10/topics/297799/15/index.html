Mr David Saul Marshall.<br><br>You also forgot - Singapore modified those british laws. Why do needless work again when there is a base template to use? It's called efficiency.<br><br>Why not start talking about Malaysia as well? Singapore was once part of Malaysia and I am pretty sure that Malaysian law is also modified from the colonial british ones.<br><br>All I hear from you is the hoo haa over anglophone culture. If anyone says anything contrary or opposing your views ,  they must be anglophone lovers.
