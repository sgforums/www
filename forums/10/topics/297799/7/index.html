Even the muslims in Singapore  have that freedom. I don't mind a woman wearing whatever she wants as long as she has a choice. I am not some anglophile who sees an abaya and yell oppression.

No one in their right minds will do that .  I earn the same as the guy ranked in the same position in Australia . So what low wages? Oh I actually won a job interview in Australia and the other person competing against me was a male. So what can you say about that?<br><br>Oh Singapore? They give more to the men who served NS = that is the right of NS men - I am not about to argue against that - those guys gave 2.5 years of their lives serving the country. They deserve every penny of it and more for their years of service.<br><br>Even rape statistics everywhere is underreported due to the victim feeling that she is to be blamed , shamed and facing her attacker again triggers horrible memories. Rape is about taking a person's control away.<br><br>Saudi Arabia - the only way to justice is to procure 4 male muslim witnesses who WITNESS the rape.  If a woman reports it , she is not only subjected to humiliation and shaming her family for being "dishonoured", she is also akin to getting charged with adultery if she cannot produce 4 male muslim witnesses who saw the act take place. The woman is expected to fight til death to "protect " her honor.<br><br>Modernised Countries - the victim can seek justice by going to the police . Getting a rape kit test done, crime scene investigation if any ,and then going to trial.<br><br>Rape tends to be specially heinous because it is totally tears a woman inside out emotionally. Be it a Saudi Arabian woman or a caucasian woman or a chinese woman<br><br>I read somewhere that in the Arab world, they have to jail those poor women who have been raped so that their families don't get to them. Even if the family wants them out ,they sign an assurance that they will not kill the rape victim. Even if they do sign the assurance , they still kill her anyway for shaming them. And what does that get them? 2-3 months in prison for the killer and maybe a huge celebration in the village.<br><br>Why they kill the rape victim in the Arab world? Because if she shamed the family, her relatives will be octracised - her brothers ridiculed. So her blood cleanses all.<br><br>Take it on the other side , if a woman kills a man in the Arab world even defending herself, she dies anyways.</div>

So what you are in fact saying is that honor killing should be allowed ? Even some Islamic scholars are trying to prevent honor killing ...even the grand mufti of syria spoke against it in Zahra's case. Her case was heard because her husband was truly in love with her and very upset about her murder. She was murdered for being raped . Her husband married her to save her from being killed. Her brother killed her anyways.  Her husband himself , for trying to get justice for her and other women, is octracised by HIS VILLAGE.<br><br>No I beg to differ. If migrants cannot adapt to the current culture of a country - then why even bother migrating? They should stay where they are - where their villages throw a huge party for a person who honor killed a poor woman who was raped .<br><br></div>
