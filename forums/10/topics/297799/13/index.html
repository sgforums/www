(opps I care as much for animals as I do for humans)<br><br>If the Saudi women accpet their lowly roles in the Saudi society and Sharia laws, well then I dun have much to say. However, this is not the case.<br><br>The general trend now is that Saudi women desired for gender equality, just that they do not dare to voice out often for fear of repercussion. There is an increasing number of women's right groups in Saudi Arabia, fighting for women's right. What does this tell us of?<br>Moreover, it is only those few ultra-conservative male at the top whom are refusing to give simple right to the women such as driving cars.<br><br>Let me quote an classic case. A few years ago, there was a big fire in a all-female school at night in Saudi Arabia. As it was night time, the students were in their sleeping attire. As the fire spread, they tried to run for escape. However, Saudi religious police locked the school main gate and refused to let the students out. Reason being: The Sharia laws required all women to be properly dressed (cover from top to bottom) in the public. The religious police firmly refused to let the students out despite frantic pleas by the firefighters and parents. In the end, <strong>most of the poor students were burnt to death.</strong><br><br>What can we see from this case? Were the Saudi religious police wrong? They were following the Saudi/Sharia laws leh. It is the laws leh. But it was not as if the female students were naked or something. They had their sleeping attire on. Yet they suffered the slow and painful deaths.<br><br>And this is not an isolated case.<br><br>If you still think such cases can be forgiven simply by saying 'Different cultures different reasoning...' and 'we have no right to criticize Saudi laws' etc, then I got nothing more to say.<br></div>
