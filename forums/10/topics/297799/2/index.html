The whole Saudi system reeks of medieval laws with no checks or balances.

It is a fact. Don't need to argue it.<br><br>In Australia, we have been forced to listen to gang rapists claiming Islam as their defence , and an iman calling women fresh meat just because they don't follow their standards of modesty.<br><br>In Europe , there were honor killings by muslim families from the middle east, sub saharan Africa or pakistani origins. And guess what the defence is again? Their religion.<br><br>I don't mind the moderate Islamic practices in SE asia. The muslims in SE asia are more tolerant than the ones who come from the Middle east.  Why? Because the culture in some ethnic groups in SE asia had a matriachal system , i.e. Minangkabaus. The Islam which spread to SE asia was integrated into the culture. Islam of that time didn't seek to force itself on cultures - it seeked conversion and in order to integrate , it had to accomodate cultural norms of the time.<br><br>Islam is a good religion which preaches the way of righteousness. However you have men , who in the name of religion, destroying the good religion themselves by their actions /words as well as IMPOSITION on other cultures, regardless of whether intentionally or unintentionally.<br><br></div>

There is no democracy there for women. There is no democratic say who the minister should be. Democracy at best in Saudi Arabia is a farce.

Even Malaysia would be the Muslim world's version of USA - liberal and free, standing next to Saudi Arabia.</strong> Iran herself, even have women in government and it is a strict muslim country. They have the second largest population of jews in the middle eastern world.

After that , what is there to say about killing in the name of religious superiority? There is no discernable difference  between gender apartheid, religious and racial apartheids- they are discriminatory and wrong.<br><br>Hitler had his own beliefs that jews were filth and he set about wiping them out. Some hardcore muslims have the beliefs that Americans and the white world are the devils of the world and they did a  9/11 , london bombings, bali bombings etc.<br><br>There are cases of hardcore imans in western countries who are adamant that women are asking to get raped because they are "immodest" by the middle eastern standards.  One iman recently created an uproar in Australia for stating that women exposing their flesh are akin to fresh meat asking to get raped. What does it tell you?<br><br>There are certain hardcore muslims are already imposing their own beliefs in other countries. Honor killings are not just boogeymen legends in European countries - they are a reality. Women have been raped by some of these black sheep who used the excuse of "religious culture" even though they are in another country.<br><br>These hardcore fundamentalists cast a bad light on the other muslims who want to coexist peacefully in a diverse society. Malaysia, Indonesia and Turkey are good examples of countries who can adapt to modernisation - if they can do it , why not the rest?<br><br>So for each hardcore muslim who criticises or even violate the rights of women in countries other than the middle east, there will be a few women criticising the laws of their land. I consider it a fair exchange.<br><br>I am a woman and I refuse to see how other women should be treated like property or lesser beings. It is not a liberal stance.

            <div class='col-md body'>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19176808/<br><blockquote>Father in 'honor killing' found guilty of murder<br>Brit ordered his daughter strangled for falling in love with wrong man<br>Image: Banaz Mahmod<br><br>LONDON - A father who ordered his daughter brutally slain for falling in love with the wrong man in a so-called Â“honor killingÂ” was found guilty of murder on Monday.<br><br>Banaz Mahmod, 20, was strangled with a boot lace, stuffed into a suitcase and buried in a back garden.<br><br>Her death is the latest in an increasing trend of such killings in Britain, home to some 1.8 million Muslims. More than 100 homicides are under investigation as potential Â“honor killings.Â”<br><br>Mahmod Mahmod, 52, and his brother Ari Mahmod, 51, planned the killing during a family meeting, prosecutors told the court. Two others have pleaded guilty in the case. Two more suspects have fled the country. Sentencing is expected later this month.<br><br>The men accused the young woman of shaming her family by ending an abusive arranged marriage, becoming too Westernized and falling in love with a man who didnÂ’t come from their Iraqi village. The Kurdish family came to Britain in 1998 when Banaz Mahmod was 11.<br><br>Â“She was my present, my future, my hope,Â” said Rahmat Suleimani, 29, Banaz MahmodÂ’s boyfriend.<br><br>During the three-month trial, prosecutors said MahmodÂ’s father beat his daughter for using hairspray and adopting other Western ways. Her uncle once told her she would have been Â“turned to ashesÂ” if she were his daughter and had shamed the family by becoming involved with the Iranian Kurd, her sister 22-year-old Bekhal Mahmod testified.<br><br>Banaz Mahmod ran away from home when she was a teenager but returned when her father sent her an audio tape in which he warned he would kill her sisters, her mother and himself if she did not come home, her sister said.<br><br>She was later hospitalized after her brother attacked her, the sister told the court. The brother said he had been paid by their father to finish her off but in the end was unable to do it, said the sister, who testified in a full black burqa. She said she still feared for her own life.<br><br>Bekhal Mahmod, Banaz's sister, testified that that her brother was ordered to kill Banaz, but couldn't go through with it.<br><br>The years of Banaz MahmodÂ’s abuse were compounded by police officers who repeatedly dismissed her cries for help.<br><br>She first went to police in December 2005, saying she suspected her uncle was trying to kill her and her boyfriend. She sent police a letter naming the men who she thought would later kill her.<br><br>On New YearÂ’s Eve, she was lured by her father to her grandmotherÂ’s home, where she suspected he planned to attack her after he forced her to gulp down brandy and approached her while wearing gloves. She escaped by breaking a window and was treated at a hospital.<br><br>Police dismissed her suspicions, and one officer, who is under investigation, considered charging her with damages for breaking her grandmotherÂ’s window.<br><br>Laying in her hospital bed after the escape, Mahmod recorded a dramatic video message saying she was Â“really scared.Â”<br><br>The videotape, taken by her boyfriend at the hospital, was shown to the jury during the trial.<br><br>Woman told family she wasn't seeing boyfriend<br>After she was released from the hospital, she returned home and tried to convince her family she had stopped seeing her boyfriend.<br><br>But friends told the family they spotted the couple together on Jan. 22, 2006.<br><br>Soon after, a group of men allegedly approached her boyfriend and tried to lure him into a car but he refused. It was that event that prompted Banaz Mahmod to go to police again. This time officers tried to persuade her to stay in a safe house. She refused, believing that her mother would protect her.<br><br>But her mother and father left her alone in the house the next day. Her boyfriend alerted police after time passed in which she failed to send him text messages.<br><br>Her body wasnÂ’t discovered until three months later after police tracked phone records.<br><br>Britain has seen more than 25 women killed by their Muslim relatives in the past decade for offenses they believed brought shame on the family. More than 100 other homicides are under investigation as potential honor killings.<br><br>Some Muslim communities in Britain practice Sharia, or strict Islamic law.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’re seeing an increase around the world, due in part to the rise in Islamic fundamentalism,Â” said Diana Nammi with the London-based Iranian and Kurdish WomenÂ’s Rights Organization.</blockquote>A perfect example of imposition of the hardcore minority on another country .
