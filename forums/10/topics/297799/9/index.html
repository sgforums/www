Even between families, each can hold values and a culture which deviate from the norm and differ from each other completely.

I can tell you directly right now, I know. But it's not just me, everyone knows. Does it comes as a surprise to you that a human should be able to tell what is right and wrong?<br><br>There can be situations where inaction is possibly better than action, but it all depends on the cause. In the case where the girl was abused by her father, I would say that the cause to take action and end the unfair treatment is to save her from a suffering which she as a human doesn't deserve. So what's your cause for inaction?<br><br>If you find that how she has been treated is just, I would like to know whether you will be able to walk towards the cruelly tortured girl, covered in bruises all over her body from repeated assails, kneel down and stare straight into her hazel eyes, where you can see her broken soul is begging for help and mercy, telling her calmly "You deserve the punishment. This is fair and right".<br><br>And may I know why are you bringing in unrelated topics into the discussion and evading the main one at hand? For instance, what does Singapore's take on marijuana has to do with women lashed for meeting a male stranger? I have been noticing your arguments versus fymk's. There were many times when she brought up a strong and valid point. But on several occasions, you ignore hers and throw in an issue that is totally unconnected to the current topic. I begin to wonder whether your ignorance is authentic or on purpose? If not, where are the answers I have asked for in my previous post to you?<br><br>Nowhere in this world has its entire population decides the rules for themselves - where one part of the population is denying the rights of another to do so. Even if the people are given the rights and don't set the rules themselves, they appoint a group of people to do so on their behalf. You call them the government. But no, I doubt the Arab females had requested for or agreed to the establishment of a law to whip them if they meet up with a male acquaintance.<br><br>Singaporeans under the age of 21 are not involved in voting events and other administrative matters that concern their lives and their country. But 21 years later, will this group of people be given the opportunity to do so? A resounding "Yes", of course. But how long do the Arab women have to wait before having the rights to take full control of their own lives? A thousand years? Probably longer. Or are you expecting them to undergo sex change surgical operations to join the Arab guys who have been denying their human rights, just like you deem liberty as being legal for women to go topless anywhere in public? Personally, I would like the latter to happen. But as humans, shouldn't we not only be able to tell between what is right and wrong, but to also tell between reality and fantasy?<br></div>
