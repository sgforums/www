I suppose it's not the Arabs as an entirety, but the Arab males who dominate its society.

Say, you have a neighbour whose family is bounded by very conservative values. And one day, you see a girl in their family was brutally injured and covered in wounds at their doorstep. Her brother speaks up for her and tells everyone in the vicinity that his father is abusing his sister. You were told that she was beaten up by her father because she had broke a rule his father has set that disallows female family members to leave the house. Other neighbours came to know of the situation and were criticizing the father. He then got furious, slapped his brother and took a thick cane to whack the girl.<br><br>What will you do as a neighbour? Are you going to be someone you are like now, suggesting that he has the right to set his own family rules and therefore right to punish her that severely? And remain indifferent about it, or even grateful for the fact that he has not imposed those restrictive rules on your family, which you deem as respect for your own family? But later, regret for your inaction only after a tragedy has happened, say, she commits suicide, or kills everyone in the family before so?<br><br>Or would you rather be on the other side, disagreeing with his actions and are willing to take one step further to stop his abuse of violence, and thereby ending her suffering that she, as a human being like you and me, does not deserve?<br></div>

I suppose it's not the Arabs as an entirety, but the Arab males who dominate its society. I'm sure if the Arab females were given the same power as their male counterparts, probably through a miracle, the first thing they will do is to abolish those laws that are denying their long-deserved rights as a human.<br><br>I don't impose my definition between right and wrong on them, unless you see me killing those Arab judges and rapists there. I'm simply expressing what I feel as a fellow human being for someone who, in my definition, has been treated unfairly on the other side of the world.<br><br>Let me ask you a hypothetical question. Say, you have a neighbour whose family is bounded by very conservative values. And one day, you see a girl in their family was brutally injured and covered in wounds at their doorstep. Her brother speaks up for her and tells everyone in the vicinity that his father is abusing his sister. You were told that she was beaten up by her father because she had broke a rule his father has set that disallows female family members to leave the house. Other neighbours came to know of the situation and were criticizing the father. He then got furious, slapped his brother and took a thick cane to whack the girl.<br><br>What will you do as a neighbour? Are you going to be someone you are like now, suggesting that he has the right to set his own family rules and therefore right to punish her that severely? And remain indifferent about it, or even grateful for the fact that he has not imposed those restrictive rules on your family, which you deem as respect for your own family? But later, regret for your inaction only after a tragedy has happened, say, she commits suicide, or kills everyone in the family before so?<br><br>Or would you rather be on the other side, disagreeing with his actions and are willing to take one step further to stop his abuse of violence, and thereby ending her suffering that she, as a human being like you and me, does not deserve?<br></div></blockquote>thats not a very good example, because when you are neighbours, you will be living in the same country, governed by the same law and exposed to similar cultures.

Your topless statement is worthless . Not many women want that type of right to be topless and walking around the streets. Same rights pertain to something unrelated to anatomical differences such as the right to a job, the right to justice withou the singular need of 4 male witneses, the right to go wherever they want , the right to DRIVE.<br><br>Did I mention anything about colonising Saudi Arabia? Did I?<br><br>You are just a fanatical bigot who wants women subjugated to lesser beings. If you wish to have and treat a woman as your property, go to Saudi Arabia . There you can imprison your poor wife and do whatever you want to her while making sure that you have no MALE relatives around to watch.<br><br>Did I impose anything? Certainly not on Saudi Arabia . I voiced my opinion and I don't see how that IMPOSES on anyone except for men like you who think that a woman is a piece of property regardless of where they are in the world.<br><br>I hope that you will not have daughters because with a father like you , who needs family.</div>
