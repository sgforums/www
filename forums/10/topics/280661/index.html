            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Something I chanced upon over the net.....</span><br><br>One of the things I have been thinking about recently, is which opposition party to join if I want to join one. And what are the reasons for not choosing to join a particular party.<br><br>Here are the reasons why I wouldnÂ¡Â¯t join these parties:<br><br>SDP: With the media and the Tali-PAP heavy weight out in full power to discredit him, the SDP will find it hard to win supporters or attract voters. While I have nothing against Dr. Chee and the SDP, I find it hard to agree with his means and whatever he is struggling about. One thing though, IÂ¡Â¯ll give it to the man and his family for the sacrifices they are making.<br><br>NSP: There was a time Steve Stiff Chia brought some incitement to the local political scene, after Dr. Chee Â¡Â®fell from graceÂ¡Â¯. Until his wife bust his ass and his maid photos, that is. My impression of the NSP - based on my lack of knowledge of their grassroot activities - gives me the impression of it being a Â¡Â®Election PartyÂ¡Â¯, i.e. it only surfaces during elections and other than that, you donÂ¡Â¯t hear much about them in between elections. Why would anyone want to have anything to do with them at all if thatÂ¡Â¯s the case?<br><br>SPP: Chiam See Tong is a hero. In spite of the fact heÂ¡Â¯s called Ã”Ã�ÃŠÂ±ÂµÂ² (Temporary Block in Hokkien), he has survived quite a number of elections. Unfortunately, the future of the SPP does not look bright anymore. One must question, when the day comes for Chiam to retire, who will his successor be? There is no apparent successor or heir to ChiamÂ¡Â¯s legacy. It is sad that when Chiam retires, Potong Pasir may fall once again into the hands of the Tali-PAP, and the SPP may fade into obscurity.<br><br>SDA: The names says it all. Singapore Democratic Alliance. One the surface, it would appear that it is an alliance of opposition parties. One of the functions of this alliance is to avoid 3 party fights during elections, and to pool resources to meet the Â¡Â®minority candidateÂ¡Â¯ requirements since some parties do not have enough members to run for elections. Sounds good on the surface, but it can also be viewed as some kind of under the table political trade, and it also means that a team of candidates could end up far from where they worked on the last time. In other words, while it might allow the opposition to contest more than half the seats so the Tali-PAP isnÂ¡Â¯t returned to power on the nomination day itself, the outcome is almost concluded the moment they agree who should run where.<br><br>So that leaves only one that I would consider joining, if I do join. And itÂ¡Â¯s the one not in the above list: The WorkersÂ¡Â¯ Party - founded by David Marshall, the WorkersÂ¡Â¯ Pary has been around for half a century.<br><br>With the exception of the James Gomez incident, my opinion of the WorkersÂ¡Â¯ Party has generally been positive ever since the days of Joshua Jeyaretnam (though in recent years I do not quite agree with some of the things he says or the things he is doing). However, current party chairman Sylvia Lim and Secretary-General Low Thia Khiang appears to be down to earth, no nonsense individuals. They do not say things lightly, nor do they do things without any meaning.<br><br>The other thing I like about this political party is that it does not take voters for granted, as can be seen by its stronger showing in Hougang the last election. The WP works the ground relentlessly, and maintains a presence between elections. It is also quick to admit its short-comings, and is constantly renewing itself.<br><br>If thereÂ¡Â¯s a party anyone want to join for an alternate future other than the one envisioned by the Tali-PAP, the WorkersÂ¡Â¯ Party should be it.<br><br><a href="http://www.nowhere.per.sg/?p=431" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowhere.per.sg/?p=431</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree PAP has high calibre people, in fact people with an opinion and people who care. However, they have to tow the party line, and are subjected to the party whip, and in the end are better known to be just 'promoters' of policies dished out by the ruling body.<br><br>Thus i urge those with an alternative view to seek ways to express your views without being shackled by the chains... even joining an opp party means you've got to sing their song.... which may not be what you want.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, to join a apposition party is harder than just filling up the forms even though we had a average resume( university level).<br><br>1. there is still the believe by friends, family members who believe joining the opposition will kill your career. though nobody can really prove it, but imagine, which MNC or bigger SME will employ someone who goes against the PAP, especially some of these companies are bidding for govt projects.<br><br>2. the sacrifice of personal time and monetary gains.<br>unlike the PAP candidates, most of the indidviduals are rich professionals. if they dont win, they go back to office and continue to earn their millions and most company will be eager to employ them coz of the VIP image of PAP party.<br>those who join the Opposition party in election, if fail, will be mob and talk about by friends and everybody in the streets. And would be difficult to start a new career.<br><br>i ever did ever consider about joining a apposition party, i am neither stupid, with reasonable good education, streetwise, and handsome mid 30s.<br>whenever i though of my family, there an advice coming from my mind that say, NO!!! if you fail, not only you cannot be a martyr(political not religious),you will probably end up broking your family.<br><br>probably i am not one who has the will to make all those sacrifice and i will those we has the courage to DO IT and already DONE IT all the best in their political career. this social stigma of will gradually change as more singapore travels around the world. I am not die hard anti PAP , just that i never believe one party govt will be beneficiaries to any country in the long term.<br>GODSPEED.<br><br></div>
