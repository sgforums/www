The quarterly circulates some 2000 copies worldwide.<br><br>The article, which has made its rounds in Singapore and created a stir among the uniformed ranks, was written by an American soldier Sean Walsh, who was stationed at the United States Embassy in Singapore for several weeks in 2004, during his summer break from the US Military Academy.<br><br>In the article, The Roar of the Lion City, the writer also claimed that women have been held back from holding high posts in the SAF, and that there is a policy to keep Malays out of sensitive areas.<br><br>Despite his criticism of the SAF, Mr Walsh, who graduated from the US Army Ranger School, concluded his article by saying "there can be no doubt that the SAF is the most competent, well-equipped and best trained force in the whole of South-east Asia" Â— a claim the SAF itself has not made.<br><br>He also admitted that the SAF was "more than capable" of defending Singapore's borders, conducting peacekeeping missions and dealing with asymmetric threats in the wake of 911. It possessed a "world-class" special operations force which would not require outside assistance, he noted.<br><br>So, why the paradoxical praise and criticism of the SAF?<br><br>Mr Walsh, who is deployed in Germany, could not be contacted, but in his article he pointed to the age of SAF's top commanders Â— such as Brigadier-General Desmond Kuek, who was 39 when he was promoted to the post of Army Chief Â— and concluded that "youth naturally corresponds to inexperience" and this "casts obvious doubts on their ability to lead in a conflict against battle-hardened troops".<br><br>However, responding to queries from TODAY, Col Benedict Lim, director of public affairs at the Ministry of Defence ( Mindef ), said: "The SAF does not seek out wars but will not flinch from putting its soldiers into harm's way to fulfil its primary mission of protecting the vital interests of our country."<br><br>He also pointed out that the SAF carries out about 70 exercises annually with other countries' armed forces, some of which have considerable combat experience, and has been praised for its professionalism. The SAF has also carried out humanitarian missions, for example during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.<br><br>Defence analyst Dr Alvin Chew told TODAY that the debate centred on Singapore's defence policy, which is based on diplomacy and deterrence. As such, the relative youthfulness of SAF officers, who are groomed in building bilateral or multi-lateral relationships with foreign militaries, was not a major drawback.<br><br>Also, given that fighting a war is not the Republic's most pressing concern, defence analyst Dr Bernard Loo said that early retirement meant that the SAF's best and brightest could be deployed for "broader or higher national purposes Â—whether it is in running the economy, or running the Government".<br><br>Defending Mindef 's policy to aggressively recruit and offer scholarships to the "brightest and most capable young men and women", Col Lim said that the SAF, like the rest of the public sector, operates on the principle of meritocracy, and those "who do not perform adequately are released".<br><br>But are Singapore soldiers ready to be stand in harm's way?<br><br>Mr Walsh wrote that a heavy emphasis on safety and the fact that "any major injury or death causes a very public uproar among parents" has resulted in a force less than ready for deployment.<br><br>Taking a different view, Col Lim argued that "an emphasis on safety and rigorous, realistic training are not mutually exclusive" and that the SAF prepares its servicemen to "fight, survive and win" in battle.<br><br>As for women in uniform, Mr Walsh's claimed that one of the SAF's "greatest shortcomings" was that high rank and important commands were closed to most women. Admitting "there was no policy that pushes gender integration for its own sake", Col Lim said that women with proven merit in the SAF currently "command ships and army units, fly combat aircraft and serve in many combat vocations".<br><br>Perhaps the most controversial claim by the US soldier was that "official discrimination against the Malay population remains an open secret" and those of the race are "systematically kept out" of sensitive areas.<br><br>Mr Walsh claims that this has two major consequences: It "limits the involvement of the ethnic group most inclined to join the military" and it feeds the "perception of a second-class status among Malays, a fact which terrorist recruiters have taken advantage of before, and they may do so again" Â— referring to the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) members arrested in Singapore for plotting terrorist attacks.<br><br>Addressing this charge, Col Lim said: "The writer's prescription for ethnic integration in the SAF seriously underestimates the challenges of building ethnic and religious harmony in Singapore.<br><br>"Singapore has made much progress in ethnic and religious integration. Singapore does not gloss over the fact that there is yet more to be done and addresses these challenges directly and openly."<br><br>Stressing that integration in the SAF would proceed in tandem with nation-building, Col Lim added that there are a good number of Malay SAF officers, some with higher degrees, whose studies were sponsored by the SAF, and whether a Malay SAF officer makes it to a higher appointment depends solely on merit.<br><br>In fact, Malay officers have risen through the ranks and held senior appointments.<br><br>"We have Malay pilots, commandos and air defence personnel. Those who have shown the potential to take on higher appointments in the SAF are given every opportunity to do so. Malay officers in the SAF hold key appointments such as Commanding Officer," said Col Lim.<br><br>"In fact, the proportion of eligible Malays selected for specialist and officer training is similar to the proportion for eligible non-Malays."<br><br>Mr Zulkifli Baharudin, a Malay community leader and former Nominated MP, said that the JI arrests had shown that some Singaporeans "will not react primarily to our national interests and are not completely colour-blind in our instincts".<br><br>He added: "We have also seen in the past that events in India and China have had Â— and I'm putting it mildly Â— reverberations here." - TODAY </blockquote>---http://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna/cgi-bin/search/search_7days.pl?status=&amp;search=MINDEF&amp;id=263407</div>

Mr Lee said then: "My job is to see that Singapore's position as an air hub is not lost. And if budget airlines were to eat up Singapore Airlines' profits but retain Singapore as a hub ... so be it."<br><br>Analysts pointed out that while Singapore had set the benchmark with its airport, cities like Dubai and Kuala Lumpur were now copying the template - making it imperative for Changi to move even faster.<br><br>The awards measured the performance of various airports based on service quality, facilities and passengers' feedback. In the 2005 survey, Changi had finished second behind Incheon, while KLIA was third.<br><br>Determined to turn the tables last year, the Malaysian airport planned its assault on the award systematically.<br><br>"There are 28 features in the ACI survey and we had to monitor each feature to ensure that we did not slip behind," said Malaysia Airports Holdings managing director Bashir Ahmad.<br><br>"This is a very nice feeling," said Mr Bashir of edging out its southern neighbour in the list. "As you all know, we are always compared to Changi Airport and it's nice to know that we have done very well this particular year."<br><br>There was no response from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore by press time.<br><br>While aviation analysts said that awards could be subjective, some were surprised by the turnaround. "I thought Changi did quite well last year," aviation consultant Prithpal Singh told TODAY. "In terms of facilities, efficiency and comfort, Changi is second to none."<br><br>Last year, the signs were particularly encouraging. More than 7.2 million airline passengers surveyed by London-based market researcher Skytrax helped Changi win its first Skytrax Airport of the Year award. Britain's Business Traveller magazine voted it the best airport for the 19th straight year. Its weekly flights reached a record high of 4,199.<br><br>The fact that KLIA has sneaked ahead in this particular survey underlines the constant need for improvement, analysts said.<br><br>Even minor things - like shops being understaffed or hiring unhelpful sales staff - could sway perceptions, Mr Singh said. "You cannot ignore this ranking. Basically it shows that we need to put more emphasis on this human aspect," he added.<br><br>Just last week, Transport Minister Raymond Lim said in Parliament that the "software" aspects of the "Changi Experience" would be strengthened.<br><br>When Terminal 3 opens its doors next year, Changi's handling capacity will rise by about 45 per cent to 67 million passengers a year, he said, adding that the airport "will also continue to provide training for frontline staff to ensure that the highest service standards are maintained".<br><br>This was critical as airports sought to attract transit passengers as well as tourist, said Flight International's regional managing editor Nicholas Ionides.<br><br>"Airports recognise that they are symbols of a country," he added. "Airport operators put a lot of focus and investment on creating a good impression on travellers."<br><br>Mr Peter Harbison, executive chairman of the Centre for Asia-Pacific Aviation, said: "There is a great deal at stake for airports, for their airlines and for the national economy.<br><br>"This has been recognised in Singapore by the importance attached to the success of Changi. Its neighbours will continue to be tough competitors, although Changi has set the benchmark in the past." - TODAY/yy</blockquote>--http://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna/cgi-bin/search/search_7days.pl?status=&amp;search=Changi%20airport&amp;id=263844<br><br>3.TODAY is a 30% opposition paper!!<br><br>4.SG never tell u the bad news later.We are vulerable,short of water,<br>losing jobs to other countries if we dunt change,terrorists attack,ration<br>of foods,petrol already in place ,U are advised to stockpile TWO weeks<br>of foods etc<br><br>5.SG is not a banana country.We are a durian country.</div>
