              <p>Simei so big. Tell everyone which block. Coz the nearest home is 10m away (less than a block length). Dun be afraid. No need to tell unit number. Just block can already. Mah Bow Tan only need a bock to house 1500 FW.</p>
              <p>Be more specific. I can also tell everyone I stay in AMK or Jurong - so big!</p>
              <p>Dun dare to reveal means you like to talk but when it is your turn to show, cannot show.</p>

              <p>Simei Blk 232. Hurhurhur. So whats next? I have to scan my NRIC to prove i really stay in Blk 232? I dun know where else they wanna build the dorm but it would be great to see those 1400 local version of "Ku Klux Klan" who signed the petition get all so disappointed.</p>
              <p>Well if you apologise, then at least we can talk. Its ok to have differing views. You can disagree with me, but dun come and challenge me to show this, show that. Right Then I will also apologise, cos those people in Serangoon touched a raw nerve also. But well if you agree to disagree, then we can both live happily ever after haha</p>

              <p>The pino and indons maid will definitely hook up to the blanga. although not everyone but 5-10% is enough to create problems for the resident. My friend happen to encounter such problem. he is not alone!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The pandan gardens resevoir where it house also large dormitory.</p>
              <p>I use to jog there before and after the dormitorywas built. the litter conditions is very bad! they like to drink below our void deck and leave their bottles litter around the floor. If you have a kid, walking past these drink blanga, do you worry about their safety?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I dun quite understand why they cannot re-locate the dorm and have to waste additional tax payer money to build a road.</p>

              <p>For starters Reyes, I live somewhere near the Jalan Kayu area - where they converted the old Farmway HDB flats to a series of workers' quarters, so I do know what you're talking about. However, I must concede that I live overseas for a large part of the year, but whenever my mum tells me about the how these workers hang around the vicinity of the Jalan Kayu area, and leave their beer bottles stewn all over the place, I can't help but feel concern to the safety of my loved ones and those living around me</p>
              <p>So I do know what you're talking about. </p>
              <p>But my point is that to get to the root of the problem or issue, we have to stop seeing these individuals as mere economic utilities - as people we are making money out of for their cheap labor, but rather as human beings who have needs and wants like all of us. Because when we see them as mere tools, as sub humans upon a hierarchal specturm of human beings, we denegrate them to a state where we fail to understand the true nature of the situation and as such offer sub-par solutions which will lead to greater problems. </p>
              <p>We need foreign workers, that is the way our economy is set up, and expelling them is definitely not the solution. But where are we to house them? Some say quarters are the way forward, others argue that we should built settlements far away from 'civilization'. Other just don't know what to do, but just scorn at their mere appearance because unlike us, they are 'different' and somehow their difference they exact are somehow a threat to our safety and existence. </p>
              <p>Foreign workers do commit crimes, their ways unsettle us evidently, but locals do commit crimes, but they look similar to us, so somehow walking along some street in Ang Mo Kio, is somehow safer than walking along Little India on a Saturday night. The notion of difference magnifies the threat of their presence. A crime committed by a foreigner when reported in the mainstream media is magnified in it's prominence, as compared to some crime committed by a local. I'll really to see the numbers comparing the statistics of crimes committed for every foreigner as compared to Singaporeans or 'locals'.  </p>
              <p>Another complaint is that they go on liaisons with our domestic workers. It is a concern as should our domestic workers contract vernal diseases or end up pregnant, it will be a health concern and incur monetary expenses upon our families. Therefore, if we were to allow foreign workers into our estates and heartlands, somehow or rather these laisons will become a health hazard. But look at this more humanly, for most of us we have our families with us, our spouses, our loved ones. These structures construct the central core of our sense of security and we will feel threatened if these aforementioned structures are threatened - these basically embody our needs and functionality as human beings. Similarly, foreign workers like us, have needs too. They need that structure that we possess, for which many of them do not get to participate in for most part of their lives here. Some would say, that is something they have to put up with, because they have chosen this path, but who would chose a path to part with ones loved ones, unless forced by their situation. So somehow their socio-economic situation has become their own fault and they have to somehow be derided into the periphery of human existence because of a situation they were born into?</p>
              <p>It is a want for them, the only way to offer one to overcome a want is to offer a greater incentive, an opportunity to grant a greater want of theirs. Reward them, for those who have no criminal records or have shown <span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal; white-space: pre;">examplarary</span> working ethics, reward them with a renewal of their contracts for a longer period or for the really promising ones, further training and even a path to Permanent Residency or even citizenship. Some will argue and not be able to phantom the sight of 'these foreigners' eventually having the same rights as us, but this notion boils down to the same sub-human narrative that just does not encompass this debate, but all debates concerning immigration into our country, which concerns the future of this nation.</p>
