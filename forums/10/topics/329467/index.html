              <blockquote>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The National Development Ministry has said the location of temporary dormitories is limited by the available choices of vacant state buildings. <br><br>It tries to avoid housing foreign workers in residential areas and seeks residents' understanding and support if some dormitories are located near their homes. <br><br>The ministry said this in response to Channel NewsAsia's query after residents of Serangoon Gardens expressed unhappiness that a vacant school in the estate may be converted into a foreign workers' dormitory. <br><br>Since last week, a petition has been making the rounds in the quiet neighbourhood. So far, over 500 residents in the private estate have signed the petition. <br><br>They are against turning the vacant school building on Burghley Drive into a temporary dormitory to house about 1,500 foreign workers and plan to raise this issue with their MPs on Wednesday during a dialogue session. <br><br>If approval is given and the plan goes ahead, the dormitory is likely to be a self-contained community, with shops and other social amenities. Authorities said this would minimise the impact on the neighbourhood. <br><br>However, residents are unlikely to be convinced, many of whom live just across the road. Traffic congestion and security are among their concerns. <br><br>One resident said: "Most of my neighbours are very old and they live alone. So security is a big issue if they house it here." <br><br>Another resident said: "It would be a disaster here. Thousand-over workers, can you imagine?" <br><br>Residents are hopeful that the authorities will take heed of their views. <br><br>MP for Aljunied GRC, Lim Hwee Hua, said: "I'm not surprised by the reaction, and I think the concerns raised are valid. What I'll do is look at the feedback, add my own views as an MP looking after the area." <br><br>Mrs Lim added: "The social issues are a little trickier. Obviously, you can't expect the foreign workers to be just confined to the site itself. So if they're housed there, they'll be coming out onto the park space, and mixing with the residents. <br><br>"This is not a problem by itself, but I think the residents are thinking of the social aspects, such as whether there'll be the wrong kind of relationships formed between the domestic helpers and them. These are harder to address but they are concerns we should listen to." <br><br>The authorities said they are still reviewing the suitability of the site and no decision has been made yet. - CNA/vm <br></span></p>

              <p>why dont the ministry built the dorm at the pulau ubin or offshore island?</p>
              <p>In HK and taiwan, fishermen from china forbidden to step into the mainland and confine to dormitory boundaries only.</p>
              <p>they are here to work and earn money. it shouldnt come at the expense of singaporeans own comfort zone.</p>
              <p>the ministries shouldnt pass their own problem to most singaporeans after they get the levvy tax.</p>
              <p>i dont think by making foreign workers staying in our neighbourhood wil enhance the "national development "experience if our life!!</p>

              <p>Citizens have decided to build several large dormitories housing thousands of foreign talent workers on the huge vacant plot of land on the Istana grounds because it is one of the last sparsely populated areas left on this island.  The dormitories are likely to be a self-contained community, with shops, beautiful gardens, historic buildings, other social amenities with a short walk to Orchard Road.  Visiting foreign heads of states will get to experience staying among imported foreign workers from impoverished third world countries, experience working to pay off the worker's levy and enjoy urinating anywhere they like, preferably against somebody's car or house.  </p>

              <p>Why must foreign workers be treated like a prisoner and housed in intern/concentration camps ?</p>
              <p>Why couldn't the companies or authorities disperse them and rent single rooms for them to stay ? 2 workers to one rented room and spread all over the Island ?</p>

              <p><strong>Citizens seeks Ministry's understanding on workers'
              dorm</strong></p>
              <p>Citizens have decided to build several large dormitories housing
              thousands of foreign talent workers on the huge vacant plot of land
              on the Istana grounds because it is one of the last sparsely
              populated areas left on this island.  The dormitories are
              likely to be a self-contained community, with shops, beautiful
              gardens, historic buildings, other social amenities with a short
              walk to Orchard Road.  Visiting foreign heads of states will
              get to experience staying among imported foreign workers from
              impoverished third world countries, experience working to pay off
              the worker's levy and enjoy urinating anywhere they like,
              preferably against somebody's car or house.  </p>
              <p>Citizens said this would minimise the impact on the
              neighbourhoods of the common people.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi its sad that foreign workers are discriminated in Serangoon area and it even saddens me to see that people in that same area welcome expats. It is outright discrimination. Maybe a sudden surge of 1000 foreign workers maybe too much, maybe just 500? Maybe spread the workers into smaller dorms? But the way I see it, that these people in Serangoon seems to be saying that they do not even want a single FW in their area. I dun like George Yeo but I guess he puts it right when he said that it is valid to have such concerns but before the discussion goes on, they must not paint a picture that ALL FW are rapists, molesters and troublemakers.</p></div>
