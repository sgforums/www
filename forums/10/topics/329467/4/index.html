              <p>But my point is that to get to the root of the problem or issue, we have to stop seeing these individuals as mere economic utilities - as people we are making money out of for their cheap labor, but rather as human beings who have needs and wants like all of us. Because when we see them as mere tools, as sub humans upon a hierarchal specturm of human beings, we denegrate them to a state where we fail to understand the true nature of the situation and as such offer sub-par solutions which will lead to greater problems. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>well that what the govt are saying.they are expandable!</p>
              <p>first, they are paid for their work. second, they can choose not to come here is they feel they can find work better somewhere. this is free market. no one say, they are sub human. infact, these words seem to come out from you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>most of us just hope the govt or relevant authority can identify these problems seriously. have a foresight and built more dorms at tuas, loyang or offshore islands.</p>

              <p>Foreign workers do commit crimes, their ways unsettle us evidently, but locals do commit crimes, but they look similar to us, so somehow walking along some street in Ang Mo Kio, is somehow safer than walking along Little India on a Saturday night. The notion of difference magnifies the threat of their presence. A crime committed by a foreigner when reported in the mainstream media is magnified in it's prominence, as compared to some crime committed by a local. I'll really to see the numbers comparing the statistics of crimes committed for every foreigner as compared to Singaporeans or 'locals'.</p>

              <p>are you saying our media dont like foreign workers as well? bias?</p>

              <p>anyway, i am strong believer that some of the scare disease that we are encountering now are possibly spread by foreign talent.</p>

              <p>Yeah, if you look at Serangoon Gardens area, the amount of
              private property land there is like astronomical compared to its
              surrounding areas (Ang Mo Kio, Hougang) etc.  Everywhere is
              populated by one or two storey landed properties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You may be on to something there in regards to land price.</p>

              demolished some of the one storey landed properties.

              <p>Hey Reyes, thanks for your points. </p>
              <p>When I mentioned sub-human, of course it does not mean that we literally categorize them as sub-human like what the Fascists did, rather, what I meant was that the attitudes towards foreigners especially the rhetoric exercised by some forumites earlier in the thread was akin to seeing these foreign workers as sub-human. Yes, I admit, sub-human might be too strong a word, but I hope it represented my disgust with their views. </p>
              <p>With regards to your second point, nope, I'm not criticizing the media. I'm was attempting to show that both locals and foreigners commit crimes, its just that foreigners are different, so when they commit crimes, people take notice and think that foreigners are the main cause of crime in our country and use that as ammunition for debates we have in this forum. That is why I said I would like to see the statistics of crimes committed per foreigner against that committed by locals to show that it is because of our fear and suspicion of difference which has magnified a crime committed by a foreigner, as compared to that by a local. </p>
              <p>Hope I did clarify my points. :)</p>

              <p>Haha, yes Angel, I'm not exactly a pragmatist by any far stretch of the imagination, but I wouldn't  apologize for my ideals. </p>
              <p>I guess what I can say is that, irregardless of all our differing world views, one thing we all concur is that the state of things as they are - really suck! </p>
              <p>Singaporeans definitely deserve better! But I just hope that on our path to seeking that betterment, we can better ourselves not just politically and economically, but in terms being more compassionate and humane in our perspective to things around us.   </p>

              <p>Singaporeans definitely deserve better! But I just hope that on our path to seeking that betterment, we can better ourselves not just politically and economically, but in terms being more compassionate and humane in our perspective to things around us.   </p>

              <p>I let to paint the picture of you as an owner, bring in a guest workers to help your progress in your business and wealth, u provide lodging for him, ensure that he is comfortable with all basic needs. But you must also ensure that he is socially acceptable. Therefore you need to give basic training and instill discipline in him so as to help him accustomed or be accepted in our society.</p>

              <p>We dun look down on him, he works with his hands to earn a living, he save for his family, he is a responsible person, but we cannot put him in equal footing as us. Their objectives is to make money and leave us for the betterment of his hometown, no loyality nor attachment to any of our national pride and achievement.</p>

              <p>You can go to any nation in this world, and believe me, we treated foreigner workers the best, but of course their are some bad eggs contractors who wanted to conn them. </p>

              <p>With regards to your second point, nope, I'm not criticizing the media. I'm was attempting to show that both locals and foreigners commit crimes, its just that foreigners are different, so when they commit crimes, people take notice and think that foreigners are the main cause of crime in our country and use that as ammunition for debates we have in this forum. That is why I said I would like to see the statistics of crimes committed per foreigner against that committed by locals to show that it is because of our fear and suspicion of difference which has magnified a crime committed by a foreigner, as compared to that by a local. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>What the press print in the paper is actual crimes that had already committed, not to mention how many go unnotice.</p>
              <p>Yes you are right, local do commit crimes, such as maids basher. But they are singaporeans, they are part of society and whether we like it or not, they have the right to be here. The foreigners while contributing to our growth are at the sametimes increasing our crime rate and dis-stablising our social norms. While not FW will commit a crime but a 1-2% of them is enough to create havoc in society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the greater point is we should reduce our reliance on FW. it has to be start from the govt, by reducing the nos of FW, it will better create job opportunity for locals. Not the opposite way.</p>

              <p>Well, not necessary that demographic goes PAP. Remember the last election, The Straits Times reported that votes in the Jalan Kayu sub connstituency in Ang Mo Kio GRC were lower compared to the other sub constituencies, if it wasn't for the other sub-constituencies, you might have one of the WP newbies sitting in Parliament as well, if Jalan Kayu was a single seat instead of a sub constituency in a GRC. </p>
              <p>And does anyone actually remember why people in Seletar Hills/Jalan Kayu voted the way they did? Well, they were unhappy their market got torn down. So don't bet that people in Serangoon Gardens, people from similar demographics, would not do the same, don't bet against it. </p>
