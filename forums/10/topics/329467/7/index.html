They have to take more from silliporeans... and while they expect you to be law abiding they abuse the constituition and persecute people like Dr Chee Soon Juan and the late JBJ who are just exercising their rights as citizens to be opposition... they are worse than TT Durai in the way they take public money and yet they have so many assdogs licking their asses hoping to pick up some crumps that they throw on the floor for their assdogs to eat... and they even have asspuppies that call themselves angel... a puppy thinking it is an angel... hahaha.. what a joke.</span></span></p>

              <div class="story_text">LABOUR chief Lim Swee Say on Thursday called on Singaporeans to brace themselves for a rough ride ahead, urging them to take a long-term view in coping with the fallout from the financial turmoil.
              <p>Speaking on the eve of the release of the latest growth forecast for Singapore, he told reporters there were no signs yet of retrenchment, although it is to be expected next year.</p>
              <p>Some unions are also expecting lower year-end bonuses, he said on the sidelines of a forum with employers and unionists at Downtown East resort centre in Pasir Ris.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: small; color: #ff0000;">But he assured Singaporeans the labour movement had not been sleeping in the past three years when the global economy was going strong. </span></strong></p>
              <p>Among other things, the NTUC has been redesigning jobs for low-wage workers, introducing flexible work for women and re-employing mature workers.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: medium; color: #800000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He now wants workers and employers to tighten their belts and spend wisely</span></span></strong>.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: small; color: #ff0000;">Also, they need to work together to make their companies more competitive by reducing costs and improving productivity. </span></strong></p>
              <p>At the forum, he also cited a company that found it made more business sense to keep its local workers in an economic downturn.</p>
              <p>The company, which Mr Lim declined to name, believed that when the economy rebounded, other companies would compete for workers.</p>
              <p>But it would be a step ahead, with enough local workers to meet the required ratio for hiring foreign workers.</p>
              <p>Singapore National Employers Federation president Stephen Lee also told the forum employers should take a long term view on the current push for re-employment of older workers and continue to support it.</p>
              <p>'All these up and down economic cycles, no matter how sharp they are, we will be able to ride them out,' he said.</p>
              <p>Earlier, deputy secretary-general Heng Chee How also called on employers to strengthen their fundamentals to limit the financial fallout.</p>
              <p>This include containing costs, gearing up operations to be flexible, training employees to be adaptable and working with unions to keep up the morale of workers.</p>
              <p>'We need no longer waste time hoping to be miraculously shielded from the financial turmoil that is unfolding globally, or from its economic consequences,' he said.</p>
              <p>'Instead, we can take positive and productive action to deal with the challenges ahead.'</p>
              <p>He drew attention to the signs that Singapore's economy was slowing down in tandem with the world economy.</p>
              <p>The Trade and Industry Ministry has revised its growth estimates downwards from 4-6 per cent to 4-5 per cent for this year.</p>
              <p>While Mr Heng did not say if there would be a further downward revision in Friday's announcement, he highlighted Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam's comments on Sunday that the Singapore economy may slow down for several quarters.</p>

              <p><br>Cheem leh.</p>
              <p>I welcome FTs. I hope they spend less commuting. So, I think the best place for their dormitory is in Orchard / Scotts or Tanglin areas.  We must walk the talk when we say we love our FTs. We must care for them and make their stay here a happy one. Those areas are happy areas. These should be the places for FT dormitories in me humble opine.</p>
              <p>Tanglin is nice place to live. The residents there should have the opportunity to mingle with our valued foreign workers. We must walk the talk.</p>

              <p>Actually the FWs should be housed in places like lim chu kang where resident numbers are low. All FWs need is just a shelter over their head and a decent living condition. LCK is also near tuas. Locating them at other places are just finding trouble. No one is gonna let their house value drop without a fight.</p>
              <p>I dunno why the commends are always about discriminating against FWs. Its true that they cause trouble. There is no doubt about it. I've been a resident in Jurong West for more than a decade. Before their dorms were built, this place used to be peaceful and safe at night. However, after it was built, we have drunks moving all about half naked at night, men hugging each other like long-lost lovers, beer bottles being discarded along the road and better still, fights nearly every night. These are also why the values of houses in our estate is decreasing. </p>
              <p>Why must we lose money for people like them? People who come to our country and make a mess at the places they stay? After they made their mess, they would hide behind the protective shield of sympathetic singaporeans who find that whatever negative commend said about them are "discriminating". Its obvious why they are discrimainated against, they tarnished the image of my neighbourhood and, perhaps, every neighbourhood they live in.</p>
              <p>They build house, they build road and yes, they are our nation's "builders". But we paid them too. It is not as though they come and work for us for free. We pay them an agreed price every month fot them to work. Everything is fair. Only retards will come in and say " Hey you freaking bastards, they build our roads and whatever shit you know." Fuck you man. No happy dun work, there are tonnes of people waiting to replace you. Want to work here better be a guai kai.</p>

              <p>A typical example of a sympathetic singaporean who is most probably planning to migrate, living hell behind for greener grass.

              <p>If u will ask me, my dear Colonel, every employer who bring the FW here must ensure they get the jobs, accomdation and discipline needed. It is not a matter of culture mix and blending, it is a matter, as you Colonel rightly put it, for them to suit our culture and not we and them mix togther. I will suggest that any company who employ FW must built dormitory within their factory. Formerly, in construction, employer built  dormitory for their workers within their own premises, so are the shipyards, no problem for all. The workers are happier too, cos they can get to work very fast, very convience, no complain from the public, employers can also keep a close eye on them.

              <p>Yes, I dun mind foreigners mingeling among us, but please dun ask us to suit their culture, they must suit our culture, employers can also impose discipline into them to ensure all workers are back by 10pm o'clock (cos i use to go home at about 11 pm, me scare) and all light off by 11 pm. No drinking or littering or sleeping in public such as HDB void decks, parks and grass patches.</p>

              <p>When i visited or worked in another country, i tend  follow their laws and disciplines, and i will also suit their culture, if japanese are polite, i must learn to be polite, if the finns dun talk loudly, i will try to talk normally, if the British wait for their MRT (tube) with patience and allow passengers to come out before we go in, i followed them. This are what we expect from foreigners, they are alway welcome, but please dun walk around in sarong half nake with some high alcohol drink in their hands and smoking some kind of pots with a silly smell, sitting and lying on the grass beside the drain, glaring at me when i walked by...who knows what are they thinking...that is why, i wear 2 underwears.</p>

              <p><br> Colonel,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My SS women are ready to deport him (the writer) to a private
              chamber, await your command.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We shall raise the issue to our fouth Reich in the coming Nazi
              general conference.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If u will ask me, my dear Colonel, every employer who bring the
              FW here must ensure they get the jobs, accomdation and discipline
              needed. It is not a matter of culture mix and blending, it is a
              matter, as you Colonel rightly put it, for them to suit our culture
              and not we and them mix togther. I will suggest that any company
              who employ FW must built dormitory within their factory. Formerly,
              in construction, employer built  dormitory for their
              workers within their own premises, so are the shipyards, no problem
              for all. The workers are happier too, cos they can get to work very
              fast, very convience, no complain from the public, employers can
              also keep a close eye on them. But today, dormitories are
              built adjacent to houses where we live. Why??</p>
