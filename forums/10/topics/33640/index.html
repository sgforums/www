            <div class='col-md body'>for all you peoples information regarding my last post...<br><br><strong>Innocent Passage. Innocent passage refers to a vesselÂ’s right to continuous and expeditious transit through a coastal StateÂ’s territorial sea for the purpose of traversing the seas without entering a StateÂ’s internal waters</strong>. Stopping and anchoring is permitted when (1) incident to ordinary navigation, or (2) made necessary by force majeur (e.g., mechanical casualty, bad weather, other distress). Passage is innocent so long as it is not prejudicial to the peace, good, order, or security of the coastal State. There is no provision in international law for prior notification or authorization in order to exercise that right. UNCLOS III contains no requirement that passage through a StateÂ’s territorial sea be necessary in order for it to be innocent; it does, however enunciate a list of activities not deemed to be innocent:<br><br>any threat or use of force against the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence of the coastal state or other acts in violation of the principles of international law as embodied in the UN Charter;<br>any exercise or practice with weapons of any kind; (<strong>read as GUNs and missiles are off ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )</strong>any act aimed at collecting information to the prejudice of the security of the coastal state; <strong>(read as radars are off.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )</strong><br>any act of propaganda aimed at affecting the defense or security of the coastal state;<br>launching, landing, or taking on board of any aircraft;<br>the launching, landing, or taking on board of any military device;<br>loading or unloading of any commodity, currency or person contrary to the customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws and regulations of the coastal state;<br>any willful and serious pollution;<br>any fishing activities;<br>the carrying out of any research or survey activity;<br>any act aimed at interfering with any system of communication or any other facilities or installations of the coastal state; and<br>any other activity not having a direct bearing on passage.<br>The United States takes the position that the above list is exhaustive and intended to eliminate subjective determinations of innocent passage; if a vessel is not engaged in the above listed activities, its passage is deemed innocent.<br><br>Innocent passage extends to all shipping and is not limited by cargoes, armament, or type of propulsion. Note that UNCLOS III prohibits coastal state laws from having the practical effect of denying innocent passage.<br><br>Innocent Passage does not apply to aircraft. Submarines in innocent passage must transit on the surface, showing their flag.<br><br>Challenges to Innocent Passage: (1) Merchant ships must be informed of the basis for the challenge and provided an opportunity to clarify intentions or correct the conduct at issue. Where no corrective action is taken by the vessel, the coastal State may require it to leave or may, in limited circumstances, arrest the vessel. (2) <strong>A warship / state vessel must be challenged and informed of the violation that is the basis for the challenge. Where no corrective action is taken, the coastal State may require the vessel to leave its territorial sea and may resort to minimum force to enforce the ejection.</strong><br>Suspension of Innocent Passage: A coastal state may temporarily suspend innocent passage if such an act is essential for the protection of security. Such a suspension must be (1) non-discriminatory; (2) temporary; (3) applied to a specified geographic area; and (4) imposed only after due publication / notification.<br><br>Right of Assistance Entry. Based on the long-standing obligation of mariners to aid those in peril on the sea, the right of assistance entry gives limited permission to enter into the territorial sea to render assistance to those in danger. The location of the persons in danger must be reasonably well known. The right does not permit a search. Aircraft may be used to render assistance, though this right is not as well recognized as that for ships rendering assistance. See CJCSI 2410.01A for further guidance on the exercise of the right of assistance entry (available on the Internet at http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/cjcsd/cjcsi/2410_01a.pdf).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>though it seems from the above that Najib is indirectly recognizing singapore's authority over PB... it must be noted that he did not say that key magic word... the recognization of singapore's sovereignty over PB...<br><br>and from his words... its clearly.. this is a man that deserve respect...<br><br>on the one hand, he emphasize continue patrolling by RMN over PB... on the other hand he appears to assuage singapore's concern by stating the obvious clause under the IMO treaty...on innocent passage...<br><br>BUT in reality.. he did neither...<br><br>by sending his ships to patrol without radar and weapon on... he is invoking the innocent passage clause under the IMO as a foreign ship in singapore waters (hurray from singapore)... but at the same time... such an action would not reduce malaysia's claim over PB either....since its normal for a country's ship to have its radar and weapons off in their respective territorial water... (i can hear hurray from across the causeway)<br><br>yet from the singapore's point of view... malaysia's continuous non stop passage into the singapore water around PB is seen as provocative because of the following...<br><br>1... the RMN ships fail the part where ships in transit are to pass expeditiously and continuous through the SLOC... by repeatedly re-entering the water over a short period of time or anchoring near PB without reasons....<br><br>2... the RMN ships radar off ... but then is the RMN ship within the lanes of the SLOC?? if not... wont such an action tantamount to prowling??<br><br>3... the RMN ships weapons and missiles are off... i beg to ask.. how the hell will RSN knows that unless both are within visual range... plus... its very easy to switch on the guns and missiles....<br><br>Therefore... there is no other way singapore can interpret malaysia's actions as innocent...<br><br>the good news is that... singapore under the IMO treaty are permitted to use minimal force to send them packing home... and i think we should use it....</div>

May sound lame, but that was what i thought after reading the part about guns covered, radar off etc.<br><br>However, perhaps they recognize the waters around PB currently belonging to Singapore, and thus they are entering it under Part 2, article 17, "innoncent passage."<br><br>What they are doing now is that, they are claiming that PB belongs to them, and until they win their case at ICJ, the ownership of PB and the waters around it remain status quo.  Ours.<br><br>And apparently, it is a wise move on their part.  IF they came in with their guns showing, radar on, and weapons ready to fire, we have a LEGAL right to tell them to piss off or we blow em up.<br><br><strong>Article30<br><br>Non-compliance by warships with the laws and regulations<br><br>of the coastal State<br><br>If any warship does not comply with the laws and regulations of the coastal State concerning passage through the territorial sea and disregards any request for compliance therewith which is made to it, the coastal State may require it to leave the territorial sea immediately.<br><br></strong><br><br>Whatever laws n regulation those may be, would be up to us to specify.  Mainly, bearing arms.  Also, to "patrol" PB with their vessels, is not called "passage" as defined in article 18, regarding the terms of "innoncent passage."  Therefore, we can tell them to leave, regardless they are showing arms or not.  If they were to contest PB, and bring up our refusal of entry of their ships, then they don't have a case at all.</div>

The good news is, when the British built the lighthouse, the capital of the straits settlements was Singapore. and the straits settlements include Malaysia.  Thus, we would have to prove decision and plans for lighthouse were made here.  Singapore has also exercised control over the lighthouse and maintaining it for a 'considerable period of time' and therefore can claim its rights over the PB.  However, Malaysia has from time to time, voiced its disagreement over Singapore's control of Pulau Branca, although never this much. . .<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Singapore has constantly also sent patrols to that island, part of exercising control over it.. .<br><br>The Court concludes, on the basis of the effectivitÃ©s referred to above, that "sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan belongs to Malaysia".<br><br></span><a href="http://" rel="nofollow"></a><br><br></div></blockquote>I am rather certain, that taking into account Singapore's control over the island in the past, and the lack of a heated disagreement from Malaysia previously, plus the fact that the British built the lighthouse at a time when they were using Singapore as the place to administer the whole area, will secure PB for Singapore under ICJ ruling. . .</div>
