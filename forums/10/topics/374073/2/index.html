              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">When they manage Singapore.And that is,they are too focus on
                                      highly educated Singaporeans n their decendents,thinking that
                                      highly educated Singaporeans will produce high quality
                                      decendents.</span></p>
              <p>Is focusing on highly educated Singaporeans and their decendents a mistake? On the contrary, the "success" of Singapore is down to education. Without education and a skilled labour force, where do you think we'll be.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I can tell you,LKY n LHL,u guys are very wrong again.I have met
                                      ppl who are highly educated,but after graduates n serving NS,they
                                      cannot face or cope with the pressure of working n society n they
                                      lock up themselves in their world.Unable to face the reality(in
                                      some ways,sounds like u guys huh?<img src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif">).And they are far more worse than me.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">That is because our education system is catered to business demands which I deeply despise. However for the "good" of the country, this encourages big MNCs to employ the skilled workforce and bring investments into the country. Why we are so unhappy is because </span>most of us are workers and are tied down by wage slavery.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Actually,for every countries n society,successful ppl comes from
                                      highly educated(50%) n low educated(50%).A piece of certificate
                                      doesnt really mean anything.So if u guys focus mainly on highly
                                      educated ppl,naturally,u guys are going to fail.Coz birth rate will
                                      going to be low n migrating population are going to be high!!!</span></p>
              <p>It does not matter if you're highly educated or not. Why will any socially responsible person on meagre wages having problems sustaining their own lifestyle start a family?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">And also,high educated parents might not produce high educated
                                      children.Coz their children might not interested in studying well
                                      in school.So those who doesnt do well in school,cannot be label as
                                      failure.Coz many successful ppl around the world n in history also
                                      doesnt come from high educated background.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">It depends on how one defines success. </span>For me, success is someone who has done his/her best. You can be poor yet successful in your own right. Unfortunately in reality, the demands of the free market and elitism rules.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Besides,take a look at yourself,LKY,LHL n GCT also highly
                                      educated.But look at you guys managing this country,more n more ppl
                                      discarded you n migrate to other countries.Singaporeans also dont
                                      want to born babies for u,and you guys have turn a country into a
                                      corporate.From my point of view,you guys are worse than many
                                      politicians,like Bush.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">LKY n GCT are from Raffles Institution some more,what a
                                      shame!!!!</span></p>
              <p>While I can understand your frustrations and the financial predicaments that many Singaporeans face, I feel the PAP has done to the best as it can within the frameworks of capitalism. However I'm pessimistic in the long term if this LKYist state will survive as a nation.</p>

              <p>I'm more than happy to accomodate your criticism. I'm just an ordinary person with very ordinary writing skills, so what's there to postulate? If you say my views are skewed and hollow, fine with me, I don't mind. Isn't this a forum to share ones' views so please give feedback and constructive criticism.</p>

              <p>For those who say there are loads of countries better than sg, I say rubbish. I'd lived, study and work in the UK for 3 years and in no way the conditions are better. I might generalise but i guess it's the same elsewhere.</p>

              <p>The larger the group, the greater the regression to the mean.  Given the Internet's support of vanity press, the number of opinions provided by Internet identities outstrips the number of arseholes they collectively possess.  This, incidentally, also explains why they're full of shit.</p>

              <p>And where on earth did I said high education is overrated, I said it is good to have knowledge, and knowledge doesn't mean u need to be educated, the application of knowledge whether from higher education or personal research which most inventors do, helps our society and humankind to progress. But few works in such a way, most are getting higher educated in hoping to earn more money and a higher post job. There is simply no creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship in them, at the end of the day, they become working class for corporations which in one way or the other dun really need them.</p>

              <p>I agree with Angel7030, science and technology is key to help society and mankind progress, and you do not need a piece of paper to achieve it. That piece of paper is to "prostitute" oneself to a business in competition with the rest of the working class. What you need for research is knowledge and practicality. However once any invention is subordinated to money for profits, the business world rule your product. Today, budding entrepreneurs and inventors need capital to start even a small business but investors control these capital and they do not like risks. Eventually you're only be a minor shareholder because of capital power by the bigger corporations. Unless you have business acumen, you can end up like Bill Gates it's gonna be a very unlikely affair. In the current economic climate, how can one start a business when one cannot get a loan from the bank?</p>
