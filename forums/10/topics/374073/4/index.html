              <p>An honourable opposition PM? How do you know he/she wants to take power, enrich the party and its supporters' coffers, leave office whatever the reason and enjoy the good life. What about the ordinary working men and women, why should they bother. Take the money and run.</p>
              <p>Look at the USA, i'm not even sure who's running the government right now. The Democrats or the financial oligarchy. And yes, many american politicans do hold positions or are associates of big corporations and wall street.</p>

              <p>Why do people of less honourable standing always end up in positions of power? It's called Adverse Selection. You need to have a system to limit this Adverse Selection.</p>

              <p>Are these American politicians holding positions in big corporations appointed by the President; or did they gained their positions by virtue of their abilities? That's the difference between meritocracy and cronyism.</p>

              <p>You are obviously confused with political appointments and business appointments. Temasek, GICs, GLCs are business entities, they are not government institutions. MAS and SPF are government institutions. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since when I suggest, "meritocracy can exist without social equality"? Please quote me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Like I said above, you got confused with political appointments and business appointments. There won't be issues if you appoint someone working as a Wall Street Analyst to the Treasury, it would be strange if you appoint your wife (an Engineer) to Freddie Mac.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>International Revolution? Aren't you abit extreme, there are no such requirements. If your house has issue in which how you things are run, you only need to make changes to your house, no need to change your neighbours too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like I said before, the form of government you are endorsing will never happen in the current one, old man has said before, he will not take the citizens' issues into consideration when making decisions, he will do what he wants. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>And if you misunderstood LKY, please dun add pepper and salt, LKY did not said he dun care what citizen think and just make his decision, he wants his ministers to engage the public, gather feedback, and from there, he make his decision. Well, someone has to make a final decision in everything right? And I am afraid to tell  you that his decision is alway good for singapore, maybe some are right at that point of time but reflected wrong at this present point of time, enviroment change, so when he changing his decision, you all keep saying he twists and turns. But then, so far he is so good in the eyes of the public, except for a few peoples here who really hate him from the very start and some oldies grumbling as usual, there is nothing wrong and everyone is living in peace.</p>

              <p>Seriously, I know this is a speakers' forum and you are entitled to your views but please respect your fellow forumers. Using words like "obviously confused" and "since when i suggest" does not facilitate discussion and only lead to a flame war. I've sent you a private message but you did not reply so I just like to make it clear here.</p>
              <p>With all due respect, our government, just like any other world governments represent big corporations and financial institutions. It is of no surprise if any world leaders have positions across the corporate board. If I am indeed obviously confused, i seek your enlightenment.</p>
              <p>Yes, you did not quote that, I did. My question here is how can meritocracy exist without social equality. E.g. I can pay to send my son to the "best" private school with the "best" teachers but those who cannot afford must be educated under the so called "bad" teachers. This might not be too true in Singapore but it's just an example.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In communion world, the leaders control the pleasants, they voice out that they all are equal, but there is still a hierrachy, there is still a leader palace, there is still discrimination, there is still command and obeying problem, question on why i have to listen to you and not you listen to me, and there is still reasoning on why they get more ration and we get less. The world had tested equality thru Communion ideology, but failed miserably resulting in many dictatorial ending. Then is shift itself to Capitalism Democracy, a more vibrant and liberal system, you are free to roam the world, if you work, you get pay, if you are bold and are high achievers, you got the opportunities to be rich, or be a great leader depend on how peoples look at you, you have the opportunities to move from class to class depend on your effort and opportunity given. The lower class work for the higher class and the higher class paid them thru their capital gains. Thou it is still not equal, but so far, we are at this position. Till the day that someone can come up with a system that make us all equal, we all shall remain unequal, that is the fundamental of social science, you need to comprehend this basic in your mind before you engage any social political science arguement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even great scientist and mathematician also agree that we are in relativity only, there is no equality, just make so to look more equal, math is indefinite, the pie alone is infinite, how can there be exact equality. It is only the day, that this very world end, or the whole universe light off, then, in the total darkness and silence, equality is born.</p>

              <p>Now the govt is into exploiting singaporeans, retrain them and pay them low salary.</p>
              <p>They are brainwashing singaporeans that it is the employment trend these days for employees to work a few jobs in the same positions and get low pay.  What the shit, they overpay themselves world class salary while the singaporeans are exploited, lowly paid and oppressed.    Damn it, PAP!</p>

              <p>Alamak,i was looking for a job only,why put me through the torture?</p>
              <p>Another experience i have about this type of course is when i apply for insurance agent.They said must take course n sit for exam.Then,they ask u to buy the books(The book not cheap ok,cost around $100 dollars).</p>
              <p>Then after i study n go sit for the exam,the exam questions are like "A" level type of questions!!!Although it go multiple choice answer,but the English n the way they set the questions are damn deep n difficult.</p>
              <p>I fail 1 time,i decided not to retake already,coz i dont know must take how many times then i can pass!!!And also,the bus fares that i take when attending the course n exam fees,havent calculate inside leh!!!</p>
              <p>I heard some senior insurance agent said last time when u want to become insurance agent,the exam was very easy.True or not?Why now the government want to make the exam so difficult?</p>

              <p><br> i dun really care what you said about me, that is not important,
              but just no good for yourself.</p>

              <p>The world is deem perfect by humankind, but it is actually never
              be in the state of equilibrium. The way, we human took on animals
              as slaves, foods and even gifts to a state of extinction, you
              dare to say the world is equal???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In communion world, the leaders control the pleasants, they
              voice out that they all are equal, but there is still a hierrachy,
              there is still a leader palace, there is still discrimination,
              there is still command and obeying problem, question on why i have
              to listen to you and not you listen to me, and there is still
              reasoning on why they get more ration and we get less. The world
              had tested equality thru Communion ideology, but failed miserably
              resulting in many dictatorial ending. Then is shift itself to
              Capitalism Democracy, a more vibrant and liberal system, you
              are free to roam the world, if you work, you get pay, if you are
              bold and are high achievers, you got the opportunities to be rich,
              or be a great leader depend on how peoples look at you, you
              have the opportunities to move from class to class depend on your
              effort and opportunity given. The lower class work for the higher
              class and the higher class paid them thru their capital gains. Thou
              it is still not equal, but so far, we are at this position. Till
              the day that someone can come up with a system that make us all
              equal, we all shall remain unequal, that is the fundamental of
              social science, you need to comprehend this basic in your mind
              before you engage any social political science arguement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">great scientist and mathematician also agree that we are in
              relativity only</span></span>, there is no equality, just make so to look more
              equal, math is indefinite, the pie alone is infinite, how can there
              be exact equality. It is only the day, that this very world end, or
              the whole universe light off, then, in the total darkness and
              silence, equality is born.</p>
