              <p>Is there any numbers to support your statement here?</p>
              <p>50% seems to be a rather odd number, what are your criterias for deciding what is considered successful and whether someone is highly educated or not?</p>
              <p>This seems to be more your opinion, rather than of any concrete proof.</p>

              <p>My 50% theory are base on say primary to secondary,i consider low educated.And high school,polytechnic to university,i consider high educated.I must stress first,i dont look down on anyone,whether they come from high or low educated.</p>
              <p>What i am trying to say is that both high n low educated ppl got those who can cope with stress n work well in the society.And there are also those who cant.So,the government,especially LKY,should not have to bias idea that they should take care of the high educated first.</p>
              <p>I kind of feel that LKY think high educated ppl should married high educated ppl,n born more babies.Whereas low educated ppl should married low educated ppl n born less babies.</p>
              <p>The book "Men in White" also criticise LKY that he gave high educated ppl privilege to let their children have first choice of chosing the school they want.Although he abolish the policy due to too many critics.</p>
              <p>And i think our society care too much about certificate,which cause unnecessary stress to Singaporeans n their kids.Thats really sucks.</p>

              <p>It's just tough luck for you that I'm under no obligation to wrap you in cotton wool.  The fact is that there is such a thing as wrong and right - you're wrong and you're a fucking idiot for being wrong, so deal with it.  Not my problem if you can't handle the truth.</p>

              <p>An honourable opposition PM? How do you know he/she wants to take power, enrich the party and its supporters' coffers, leave office whatever the reason and enjoy the good life. What about the ordinary working men and women, why should they bother. Take the money and run.</p>
              <p>Look at the USA, i'm not even sure who's running the government right now. The Democrats or the financial oligarchy. And yes, many american politicans do hold positions or are associates of big corporations and wall street.</p>
