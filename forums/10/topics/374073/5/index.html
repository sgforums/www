              <p>Seriously, I know this is a speakers' forum and you are entitled to your views but please respect your fellow forumers. Using words like "obviously confused" and "since when i suggest" does not facilitate discussion and only lead to a flame war. I've sent you a private message but you did not reply so I just like to make it clear here.</p>
              <p>With all due respect, our government, just like any other world governments represent big corporations and financial institutions. It is of no surprise if any world leaders have positions across the corporate board. If I am indeed obviously confused, i seek your enlightenment.</p>
              <p>Yes, you did not quote that, I did. My question here is how can meritocracy exist without social equality. E.g. I can pay to send my son to the "best" private school with the "best" teachers but those who cannot afford must be educated under the so called "bad" teachers. This might not be too true in Singapore but it's just an example.</p>

              <p>I was just showing your error in comparing a political appointment with a business appointment, they are worlds apart. How can anyone make such a mistake? So I guess you must have been confused. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Which other democratic world leader has appointment by the current PM to sit in a business corporation? Ho Ching, Dhanabalan, former retire IRAS head, etc.....? Since you say there are other democratic world leaders sitting in big private corporations with the help of the President and PM, maybe you should quote some. Maybe you can cite China, Burma, North Korea..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> I have a relative who used to be the county chief, after he left public office, he was given a post in Bank of China. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> But then again, China is communist. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>what course?? sexology or homosexual course?? do not think that they are not learning, at 85yo, LKY is still learning how to use computer and facebook, so are all PAP peoples, but do they have to tell you that they took this and that course?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ho Ching had taken a full practical course in FI, no doubt about it, so realistic that she now understood the risk of Investment after losing billions, do you still want her to take another course??? better dun, if not another few billions from the coffer will be gone. So, after taking her course, she got a few months summer break, now she is back better equipped with knowledge and skill, hope that she do well.</p>

              &lt;...too focus on highly educated singaporeans n their descendants, thinking that highly educated singaporeans will produce high quality descendants....&gt;
              
              this is lky's belief. i don't think lhl believes in that.
              
              it is not that edn is not impt but it is a mistake to be too obessed with grades and paper qualifications. jobs and promotions are given to pple with top grades and paper qualifications regardless of their suitability, aptitude and experience. dedicated workers are rarely given a chance if they don't have the necessary paper qualifications.
              
              fixation with grades has also produced an undesirable result: pple with the paper qualification but don't seem to have learned anything. as a result they are unable to apply whatever they learned.

              <p>You were talking about having a paper qualification to do a job, you cited hawker, if a hawker has no paper qualification, he also can't set up shop. Likewise for a taxi driver. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
