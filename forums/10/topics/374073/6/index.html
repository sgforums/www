              <p>You go around blabbing "<em>need a paper just to get into any job, rather then their abilities to perform well", </em>don't you think this is out of context. CEO and Directors of Temasek, GICs and GLCs is not <strong>any job</strong>, you definitely need some form of business qualification to function optimally in these business organisations. You compare a hawker to a CEO, might as well compare hawker to doctor right. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> The only other way a person with no relevant qualification can get the job is cronyism, your father owns the company and makes you the CEO.</p>
              <p>I hope you understand after this elaborate discourse, if you don't then it's too bad, I do understand some folks are limited in comprehension abilities, such like lionnoisy, so I will make no further replies. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Food handling course is still a course in "food" preparation, you mean they don't teach basic food handling skills in food cooking diploma courses? I certainly don't want to be eating from your stall if you don't have basic food hygiene standard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agree you don't need qualifications to make big money, but you definitely need qualification to run big corporations within the 3Es. I am sure you are a good property salesman. So why don't you step into Temasek and tell them you can do the job but you don't have any qualification, you can kick that Israel guy off, I am all for a Singaporean running Temasek. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><em>sigh.... just how many employer out there hold any papers

              <p> </p>
              <p>Howlheje was talking about HC, LKY and LHL positions in Temasek,
              GICs and GLCs.</p>
              <p>You go around blabbing "<em>need a paper just to get into any
              job, rather then their abilities to perform well",</em> don't you
              think this is out of context. CEO and Directors of Temasek,
              GICs and GLCs is not <strong>any job</strong>, you definitely need
              some form of business qualification to function optimally in these
              business organisations. You compare a hawker to a CEO, might as
              well compare hawker to doctor right. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> The only other way a person with no relevant
              qualification can get the job is cronyism, your father owns the
              company and makes you the CEO.</p>
              <p>I hope you understand after this elaborate discourse, if you
              don't then it's too bad, I do understand some folks are limited in
              comprehension abilities, such like lionnoisy, so I will
              make no further replies. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Food handling course is still a course in "food" preparation,
              you mean they don't teach basic food handling skills in food
              cooking diploma courses? I certainly don't want to be eating from
              your stall if you don't have basic food hygiene standard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agree you don't need qualifications to make big money, but you
              definitely need qualification to run big corporations within the
              3Es. I am sure you are a good property salesman. So why don't you
              step into Temasek and tell them you can do the job but you don't
              have any qualification, you can kick that Israel guy off, I am all
              for a Singaporean running Temasek. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
