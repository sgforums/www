              <p>When they manage Singapore.And that is,they are too focus on highly educated Singaporeans n their decendents,thinking that highly educated Singaporeans will produce high quality decendents.</p>

              <p>Actually,for every countries n society,successful ppl comes from highly educated(50%) n low educated(50%).A piece of certificate doesnt really mean anything.So if u guys focus mainly on highly educated ppl,naturally,u guys are going to fail.Coz birth rate will going to be low n migrating population are going to be high!!!</p>
              <p>And also,high educated parents might not produce high educated children.Coz their children might not interested in studying well in school.So those who doesnt do well in school,cannot be label as failure.Coz many successful ppl around the world n in history also doesnt come from high educated background.</p>
              <p>Besides,take a look at yourself,LKY,LHL n GCT also highly educated.But look at you guys managing this country,more n more ppl discarded you n migrate to other countries.Singaporeans also dont want to born babies for u,and you guys have turn a country into a corporate.From my point of view,you guys are worse than many politicians,like Bush.</p>

              <p>Is there any numbers to support your statement here?</p>
              <p>50% seems to be a rather odd number, what are your criterias for deciding what is considered successful and whether someone is highly educated or not?</p>
              <p>This seems to be more your opinion, rather than of any concrete proof.</p>

              <p><br>Definitely, we treasure a gift more than a tool. At the end of the day, the application of knowledge is the most important, some use it to conn and cheat, some use it to help the society, and some use it as in self interest, and some use it to help others etc etc..</p>
