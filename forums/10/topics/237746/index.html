            <div class='col-md body'>Call me a paranoid Xenophobe, but the projected 6.5Million population scares me. With current a current population of about 4million, of which Singapoeans make up only 3Million it is deffinately forseeable that the "Old" Singaporean population will be diluted in the new mix.<br><br>With firtility rates not exceeding 2.1, Our "Old" singaporean population will not, at least in the next 10-20 yrs be able to grow rapidly enough to form the majority of this 6.5Million. Will our new singaporeans stand by our nation as we have all these years? What incentive is there to fight for a nation of forigners?<br><br>Whats worse, is that i forsee Singaporean society becoming more fragmented. Even today its common to see parallel societies forming. Sure we need forigners to meet labour demands, but the rate of influx of these forigners is staggeringly quick. They barely have enough time to integrate with society. SIngaporean dont mix with them but more importantly they dont make the effort to integrate with society mainly because they have no need to. There are so many of them that they  easily form support communities of their own nationalites within the country. Juct like in the Universities here. Let me give u an example. There are 2 indian cultural Societies. One for the India Indians and one for the Singapoeran Indians.<br><br>These people do not identify themselves as singaporeans but rather as citizens of their homelands. This is so even after they gain citizenship here. I think it is totally unwise to put the future of a country we have worked so hard for in the hands of fair weather friends. The Old singaporeans with means to be mobile will end up sidelined and be forced to leave. Singapore could become a bording hose soon enough.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is because Rajaratnam's wish for a stronger emphasis on Singaporean identity did not materialise as planned.<br><br>It's time we moved away from emphasis on ethnic groups and focus on policies that help to foster and create an overall identity that immigrants should adapt to. It would be a disaster for immigrants and expatriates to form ghettos and refuse to socialise. One day, we will face the problem that England is facing today with their British Asian groups, same as Australia.<br><br>Promote the Singaporean identity above racial and ethnic identity, immigrants and PR must take a test about our history and our culture should they wish to settle down. Proficiency in English is a must. If they refuse to integrate, sorry, quality is better than quantity.</div>

How many young Singaporeans, born in Singapore, are looking after their parents and grand parents? How many young Singaporeans are talking about migrating for their own freedom, their own future without even have a thought for their parents, who might not be able to adapt to the new environment as the young do?<br><br>Who are the ones who do not want to employ the old Singaporean? are they not the young Singaporean, as bosses or working in HR or recruitment who think it is cheaper to employ young people, who can run faster, work later, at lower costs? the old Singaporeans therefore should work in canteen, foodcourt.....<br><br>It is ironical that many who are against the government politically ended up singing the same tune with the PAP when it comes to dollars and cents.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Are the young Singaporean ready to fight for Singapore TODAY? As soon as war starts foreigners would flee, but we, as Singaporean have our families, our belongings here, and the land we call home. Fighting for our country is our duty and our pride, a nation of foreigners is just an excuse for not fighting.<br><br>If we are not proud of our country, if we can't differentiate the difference between our loyal to country and our support for different political parties, we lose the moral ground to influence the new comers. If we do not mix with them I don't see why they should make any effort to integrate in a society, especially when the people are thinking of migrating every minute of the day. The india indians society was probably formed because they could not gain acceptance into the Singaporean Indian Society.<br><br>My only hope is that by the time we have 6.5 million people, there would be a lot more young singaporean, locally born or immigrated, to pay tax to support the OLD Singaporean, by then I would be one of them, but have to count on the government, again....sign.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> <span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>New immigrants are more likely to be loyal to the "ruling party" for obvious reasons; they feel they own everything they have to "their government". Take note, <strong>Singapore is already the 2nd most densely populated "nation" in the world</strong>, so things will just get worse. The rich can afford to buy holiday chalets overseas, but the poor may in future have to be packed in cramped million-dollar HDB flats that belong to HDB, not them. Then, there's the casino with all the social ills it brings, and also racial issues, where Singaporean citizens are required to pay more in order to enter the casino. Natives are now unofficially 2nd Class citizens in their own "country". New immigrants and "Foreign Talents" are the 1st Class citizens. We are truely screwing ourselves. There's no national identity, nor self esteem. Only more taxes for the "government's" coffers.<br><br>And sooner or later, we, the natives may find ourselves becoming the minority of a place we can't call our own. It's time to remove the "cancerous tumor" before it's too late.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gigabyte14:</div><div class="quote_body">true. leadership not only requires brains, but tons of experience too.<br>but i don't think the government recognises that.<br>all they know is that high education status = gd leadership, yes?<br><br>but how can the government change the mindset of the growing population to increase the falling birth rate? that's the question.<br><br>pure citizens should get a place at the parliament, as they would feel the loyalty for the country, not by some dick or harry who receive a PRC permit.<br><br>2.1 is just too low of the current fertility rate. but times had changed. people are smarter in planning their marriages and most families now are making work the #1 in their minds.<br><br>at least the fertility rate should be around 2.5-3 per family. i wonder how we mere singaporeans can change that?<br><br>the government should do something too...<br><br>and somehow, i feel as like i'm depending too much on the government.</div></blockquote>This so-called "fertility rate" has got a lot to do with numerous disillusioned citizens migrating per year to other truely democratic countries to start afresh, taking their families with them, or some even abandoning their ageing parents here to perish on their own. It sucks just as bad that Singapore doesn't allow dual citizenship. So it's almost always a case of "I've made a decision and I'm not coming back liao". Then there's the "National Service" where male Singaporeans who risk their lives throwing grenades and handling weapons in are being paid less than what a Bangla road sweeper gets for a duration of 2 whole years.<br><br>Very soon, only 2 main groups of people would be left here in this hellhole.<br><br>1. The rich and powerful with assets and good lifestyles here.<br>2. The very poor peasants who can't afford to immigrate.</div>
