              <p>C'mon guys, get a grip, will ya?</p>
              <p><br>The only time we would face a 'mother of all recession'is when earth's resources dried up. We would all starve to death.</p>
              <p><br>But fortunately, earth's resources aint dried up. People still need food and infrastructure for trade and commerce. Some companies will fold, some won't. So there will still be jobs.</p>
              <p><br>Next, the current financial crisis didnt make money disappear. It only went into savings. People do have money. Some lost, some made more, but the money is still there. The biggest risk anyone can have now is to keep or hoard money, for if not circulated, it will dry up in time.</p>
              <p><br>Retrenchments will happen, but there's no need to panic. 6-7% unemployed only means <strong>93% STILL HAVE JOBS</strong>. With their salaries,if they circulate it, it would help the economy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If every nation follow this, this crisis will soon be over as money once again circulates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Stop the panic already..its passe</p>

              <p>The problems with the derivatives market exist back in 1980 when Nick Leeson
                  brought down the Barings Bank of UK. Alan Greenspan reduce the rate
                  to 1% after Sep11 to stimulate the economy and Bush push for more de-regulation
                  that made the problem worst. Greenspan's only regret was that he misjudge
                  people's greed to supersede their capacity for goodness and ethics.</p>
              <p>TS point is that since our government is so capable and smart as they said
                  they are; demanding huge compensation along with their claim.. why are they not
                  able to avoid this mistake and dug themselves deeper? To any financial
                  managers, their recent purchase of Merrill and USB etc, if not motivated
                  politically, would qualify for the biggest and worst blunders any money manager
                  would make.</p>
              <p>With the obscene amount of money we're paying the ministers, the least they
                  could do is to predict the direction of the economy for the next 6 months or
                  more. If they are saying they know it is bad and they know it is getting worst,
                  so what are they doing? It has nothing to do with being psychic...</p>
              <p>This brings us back to the Hong Kong saga.
                  The government's excuse is that Singapore
                  has not reached the same level of panic??!! Is that a good excuse? Do they need
                  to wait for bank runs by both foreigner and locals before they react? This is
                  what I call complacency and arrogance.</p>
              <p>How many failures must be see before we agreed to those facts that points to
                  the incompetence of the current government? How long before the people decide
                  to hold them accountable? The lost of Singapore's wealth by Temasek and
                  now by the Town Councils.. geeze..</p>
              <p>If the ministers are truly as capable and paid like corporate CEO (which I
                  sincerely doubt many of them would qualify), then they should be held
                  accountable like corporate CEO.</p>
              <p>First of, please get Ho Ching to resign and pay back the losses made under
                  her command.</p>
              <p> Btw, Nick Leeson was a clerk in UK
                  before he was super Foreign Talent in Singapore..</p>
