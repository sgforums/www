              <p><br> Don't say that lah. He might seem 'angry' sometimes but that's how
              the state-owned media portrays him. What to do? He's actually a
              normal guy just like you and me fighting passionately for a
              cause. Seriously. Same goes with his sister. Nowhere near as
              "demonic" as the Straits Times and the MM would have you
              believe lah.</p>
              <p>Don't worry I'm not a clone of Andrew.. He's way too
              confrontational.. totally not my style. I just really disagree with
              many of this current goverment's policies. And the rather arrogant
              way it acts when implementing policies.(re: IR.. GST increase.. 21%
              electiricity tariff hike. etc.) Why never consult us, the people?
              And many other issues also lah...</p>

              <p>Some of the laws in this country are unjust, do you know

              <p>Wrong.</p>
              <p>He does this for us, for born-and-bred citizens of singapore.
              Citizens who are bloody well scared of the government to confront
              these unjust laws and their corrupt ways themselves.</p>
              <p>Think abit lah.</p>
              <p>He's been jailed 7 times for doing this. He's a family man for

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">You call him grand emperor and you detract from that phrase immediately, I think he is just an ass-hole, for persecuting dissidents and opposition and then using his success in persecuting them, to cash in with massive amounts of public money ... but good thing he has a wife that cannot peacefully die  and a son that had cancer (which should be coming back soon) and now if enough people join me in cursing him, his grandchildren will pay <span style="font-weight: bold;">until he stops his despicable acts or if he is smart, stop before his grandchildren are affected... but I think it is too late for that...</span></span></p>

              <p>He's doing what he does cos he wants a better future for his kids. He doesn't want them to grow up in an environment like today in Singapore with our education system etc.. Hell I know I wouldn't. Not only his kids.. for all Singaporeans who has has a stake in building up this country. Surely nothing's wrong with that.</p>
              <p>andrewpkyap is one thing, I do hope I'm not really as belligerent as him when it come to confronting these issues.</p>

              <p>If he wants good thing for his kids, stop cursing. Be it kamma, or law of attraction or whatever, if a person's is very persistent with negative thoughts, negative situation will keep follow the owner of the negative thoughts as well. But what goes around comes around. It will boomerang back, just a matter of extend. That's if he truly cares for his kids.</p>
              <p>Cursing does no constructive help at all.</p>
