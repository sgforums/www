            <div class='col-md body'>I read with amusement the comments from both Rear Adm Teo Chee Hean (ST 31 Mar 06) and Mr Wong Kan Seng regarding the unveiling of candidates (below):<br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/pdf_main.asp?pubdate=20060406" rel="nofollow">Time to show hand opposition parties</a><br><br>In them the general argument was that it would be "<strong><span style="font-style: italic;">unfair to the voters</span></strong>" if the opposition waited till polling day to reveal their candidates.<br><br>It seems the Ruling party is content to disregard the challenges of the opposition party and highlight their challenges on the front page of local newspapers.<br><br>Also it seems the Ruling party believes the only way to unveil candidates is through press conferences.<br><br>Has the Ruling Party addressed the opposition parties' calls for their manifesto to be published? This coming after the PAP scrutinized every inch of the WP's manifesto? They seem to have conveniently forgotten about this challenge and prefer to campaign only from their strengths and ability to unveil new so-called non-conformist candidates and have quietly sidestepped the questions posed thus far.<br><br>In addition, no election date has been announced. Where is the so-called '<span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>fairness</strong></span></span>' crooned by Mr Wong? Fairness and level playing field does not seem to be part of the PAP's dictionary, yet they abuse the use of such words at will.<br><br>Mr Wong also showed brazen arrogance in brushing aside comments made by Mr Low Thia Khiang as merely out to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">'score political points'</span></span></strong>, instead of addressing them altogether, a trait more and more apparent and frequently practiced when members of the Ruling party prefer to sidestep critical landmines.<br><br>He further commented that Steve Chia raised <span style="font-style: italic;">'many issues and questions, but<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">none of significance which would change the lives of Singaporeans</span></strong></span>.' In one sweeping statement, he completely ignored the questions Steve Chia raised on the national reserves, which i think concern ALL SINGAPOREANS and are HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT.<br><br>Mr Wong Kan Seng must be living on Mars if he thinks such issues are of no consequence to Singaporeans.</div>
