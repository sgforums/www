            <div class='col-md body'>will Singaporeans get a share of it ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><strong>Temasek Holdings posts $7.6b profit</strong><br><br>Tuesday Â• September 13, 2005<br><br>TEMASEK Holdings, Singapore's investment company, posted a 3.8-per-cent rise in group net income to $7.6 billion in the year ended March 31, according to bond offer documents.<br><br>Sales rose 22 per cent to $68.7 billion, according to the sale prospectus. Contributions from STT Communications, Neptune Orient Lines and Singapore Power helped boost revenue, Temasek said.<br><br>Temasek is preparing to sell about US$1 billion ($1.67 billion) of global bonds, its first such sale, to help fund investments in foreign companies such as Bank of China. Temasek, which last year revealed its financial performance for the first time, has been trying to boost returns by lifting overseas investments to about two-thirds of total assets.<br><br>"They're increasingly more transparent, which is good," said Mr Tan Chong Koay, chief executive of Pheim Asset Management in Singapore. "You can't make money forever but they have done well so far, riding on the growing economy."<br><br>Temasek chief executive officer, Ms Ho Ching, 52, is expanding investment outside of Singapore in a bid to lift returns, which averaged 3 per cent a year in the decade ended March 2004.<br><br>Temasek's portfolio value rose to $103.5 billion from about $90 billion. About 86 per cent of its total portfolio value comprised publicly-listed securities and other liquid assets. The company had total assets of $199.1 billion, according to the prospectus.<br><br>The investment company is planning a sale of 10-year bonds, according to emails sent to investors by the sale's arrangers. The company may price the bonds to yield more than 40 basis points, or 0.4 percentage point, more than United States Treasuries of a similar maturity, one of the emails said.<br><br>Temasek's earnings will be released "soon", said Ms Eva Ho, a spokeswoman for Temasek, declining further comment on the prospectus and bond sale.<br><br>The sale will help fund acquisitions by Temasek, which in the past two years has taken stakes in ICICI Bank, China Minsheng Banking Corp, South Korea's Hana Bank, and Indonesia's PT Bank Danamon and PT Bank Internasional Indonesia.

            <div class='col-md body'><br>An extract from the Economist, 12 August 2004<br><br><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw04/040812e1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.singapore-window.org/sw04/040812e1.htm</a><br><br><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">TEMASEK : First Singapore, next the World</span></span></strong><br><br>Following the appointment of Ms Ho, Temasek has been rapidly building up its "external wing". Ms Ho sees banking, telecoms, transport, education and healthcare as areas ripe for consolidation.<br><br>Since her arrival, Temasek has spent $1.5 billion buying stakes in banks in Indonesia, South Korea and India, a 5% holding in Telekom Malaysia, a controlling 62% stake in Global Crossing, an American telecoms firm, and a chunk of Quintiles, an American clinical-drug trial company.<br><br>But there may be less to Temasek's track record than meets the eye.<br><br>A study earlier this year by LEK, a consultancy, found that Temasek's 22 major listed companies had made an average return of only 1.7% a year since their respective listings. And Ms Ho herself has admitted that <span style="color: red;">Temasek's return had dropped to 13% a year over the past decade</span>.<br><br><strong>By contrast GE, which does not receive the same favourable treatment from a friendly government, managed <span style="color: red;">27% a year </span>over the same period</strong>.<br><br>Moreover, many of Temasek's best-performing investments are either monopolies or operate in protected markets with favourable regulation.<br><br>The capital costs of the city's metro system, for example, have been borne directly by the government, allowing SMRT, the operator, to undercut its private-sector rival ComfortDelgro.<br><br>Chartered Semiconductor, Singapore's attempt to get into making microchips, has been given lots of tax breaks.<br><br><strong>Given such support, the crown jewels in its portfolio, the zealousness with which they have been protected, and the rapidity with which Singapore grew in the 1970s and 1980s, <span style="color: red;">it should have made much more money</span></strong>.<br><br>Worse, when Temasek or its subsidiaries have ventured overseas or had serious competition, they have often flopped.<br><br>DBS overpaid for its purchase of Hong Kong's Dao Heng Bank, argue analysts, while SingTel's acquisition of Optus, an Australian telecoms company, and NOL's of American President Lines, a rival shipping company, have taken years to come right.<br><br>Singapore Airlines's investment in Air New Zealand was a disaster and had to be written off after the latter went bankrupt, as was SingTel's in C2C, an underwater-cable operator.<br><br>The biggest lossmaker, however, has been Chartered Semiconductor which, with inferior technology to Taiwanese rivals, has bled money for much of the past three years and had to be bailed out by Temasek in 2002.<br><br>Fed up with complaints from outside shareholders, and concerned that her chastened executives would no longer seize opportunities, Ms Ho has started using 100%-owned subsidiaries to expand.<br><br>The NOL bid is the latest example.<br><br>The container-shipping industry is consolidating and NOL, as the seventh largest, is too small to survive on its own. Owning the whole company will make it easier for Temasek to control its destiny.<br><br>But buying out other shareholders and delisting companies' shares fly in the face of the privatisation strategy espoused a few years ago. They also sit oddly with Temasek's talk of becoming more open.<br><br>Buying up entire companies rather than investing in listed ones will, if anything, make Temasek more opaque, not less. And even the rating agencies are struggling to understand what goes on at the company, which will not obviously reassure outside investors nor, indeed, Singapore's taxpayers.<br><br>Temasek says it is becoming a competitive and transparent global investment company. But at heart it is still a prime example of Asia's paternalistic capitalism: a government-owned collection of assets that operate largely in protected markets with a whiff of nepotism, and one that will find its addiction to secrecy very hard to break.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When Durai sued his critics for defamation, he made it look like he was defamed but truths eventually came out in SPH case. Legal suits can be very subjective and do not settle issues of truths. What is at stake is basic principle of accountable corporate governance at Temasek. Is it accountable or not to prevent wrong doings of diverse nature. That is the issue we will have to wait to see what will be done. If problems are not solved at fundamentals, they will be entrenched and surface one day like the NKF.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bonds are bought and traded mostly by institutions like pension funds, insurance companies and banks.

Bonds do suffer from less day-to-day volatility than stocks, and bonds' interest payments are higher than dividend payments that the same company would generally choose to pay to its stockholders. Bonds are liquid Â— it is fairly easy to sell one's bond investments, though not nearly as easy as it is to sell stocks Â— and the certainty of a fixed interest payment twice per year is attractive.

When the market's interest rates rise, then the market price for bonds will fall, reflecting investors' improved ability to get a good interest rate for their money elsewhere Â— perhaps by purchasing a newly issued bond that already features the newly higher interest rate. This drop in the bond's market price does not affect the interest payments to the bondholder at all, so long-term investors need not worry about price swings in their bonds.<br>However, price changes in a bond immediately affect mutual funds that hold these bonds. Many institutional investors have to "mark to market" their trading books at the end of every day. If the value of the bonds held in a trading portfolio has fallen over the day, the "mark to market" value of the portfolio may also have fallen. This can be damaging for professional investors such as banks, insurance companies, pension funds and asset managers. If there is any chance a holder of individual bonds may need to sell his bonds and "cash out" for some reason, interest rate risk could become a real problem.

A downgrade can cause the market price of the bond to fall. As with interest rate risk, this risk does not affect the bond's interest payments, but puts at risk the market price, which affects mutual funds holding these bonds, and holders of individual bonds who may have to sell them.<br>A company's bondholders may lose much or all their money if the company goes bankrupt. Under the laws of the United States and many other countries, bondholders are in line to receive the proceeds of the sale of the assets of a liquidated company ahead of some other creditors.

As an example, after an accounting scandal and a Chapter 11 bankruptcy at the giant telecommunications company Worldcom, in 2004 its bondholders ended up being paid 35.7 cents on the dollar. In a bankruptcy involving reorganization or recapitalization, as opposed to liquidation, bondholders may end up having the value of their bonds reduced, often through an exchange for a smaller number of newly issued bonds.<br><br>Some bonds are callable, meaning that even though the company has agreed to make payments plus interest towards the debt for a certain period of time, the company can choose to pay off the bond early. This creates reinvestment risk, meaning the investor is forced to find a new place for his money, and the investor might not be able to find as good a deal, especially because this usually happens when interest rates are falling.<br></div>
