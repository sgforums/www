              <p>As much as the Singapore claims that protectionism will not drive the economy forward. But lack of it though will kill creativity and innovation as people will be hard pressed to be driven to survive rather than to innovate and improve. The exact social situation has happened in Singapore already.If Singapore wants to prosper in the 21st century, it will need to learn the new rules of the innovation game—and how the it can play this game to win. if we put our resources in the right places and don't waste scarce resources trying to recapture a bygone era in Singapore's economic model . Now they are learning the hard way that money and might cannot buy innovation. But ideology does. The ideology to improve the nation and its people. If the PAP takes this approach, there will be  a possibility that talent drain can be avoided.</p>
              <p>It never fails to amaze me, how can a 17 year old who haven't finish colleage... be able to hack an Iphone.. a product developed by by a team of engineers and programmer triple his age. But if this 17 year old is in Singapore, he would have been charged and put in jail in favor of multi national corporations like APPLE. But again without hackers, would antivirus programs, digital rights protection, electronic security be invented?</p>
              <p>The idea is that all things are inter dependent on one another in some form or way that defines natural equilibrium.</p>
              <p>This is the exacts stark contrast that exists in free wheeling democracies. There are no rules to stifle creativity or talents on opposing fronts, even if its a bad one,</p>
              <p>Protectionism by  creating innovation incubation centers to foster creative thinking and provide a support system to local entrepreneurs.  <br><br>However, just like what some economists said, while emerging countries like China are moving up the value chain when it comes to innovation, the US is still and will remain a leader in this realm for a long time, but the question s Where does Singapore stand?</p>
              <p>A nation that has depended heavily on world economic landscape and responding to changes with a tweaking of an outdated economic model will be doom to fail.</p>

              <p>Funny, I really just wrote a paper on this topic.</p>
              <p>In anycase, I've found that protecting intellectual property rights, had a good correlation to innovation.  But Protectionism was something that I really didn't look into... hmmm.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, protecting IP rights allowed people to "innovate" safely, and coupled with lucrative commercialization of patents gave people incentive to.  And as the place become pretty much known as a "center of innovation", even foreigners from less IP protected countries would head there to do their research.</p>
              <p>So its possible that protectionism may not be very good for innovation.  Looking at the US example, practically half their patents are filed by non-residents.  HMmm</p>

              <p> In the opening statement of your thread - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">As much as the Singapore claims that protectionism will not drive the economy forward</span></em>" - this refers to the PAP government position in their insistence that protecting the Singapore's Labor from the entry of "<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Foreign Talent and Cheap Labor</span></em>" will not drive the economy forward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, what do you understand by "protectionism" - when the term refers to protecting of one's market from foreign competition ?</p>
              <p>In your first paragraph that lack of protectionism "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">will kill creativity and innovation</span></em>" - are you referring to the "<em>protection of intellectual rights</em>" under the Copyright Laws, which is different from the closing of national borders to protect the manufacturers from foreign competition ?</p>
              <p>Secondly, if "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">money and might cannot buy innovation</span></em>" and "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">ideology does</span></em>" - how do you see a nation of citizens to be brain washed by one or more ideologies to suddenly be enlightened and become innovative creators and inventors ?</p>
              <p>Can any PAP ideologies help to prevent brain drain ? </p>

              <p>Why should you be amazed that without the benefit of formal higher education, a 17 year old can match the skills of a team of engineers and programmers ?</p>
              <p>When a person develop a passionate interests in any one subject, you will be surprised the extent that the passion can drive a person to achieve great heights.</p>
              <p>It is the environment that nurtures and develop a person to have an enquiring mind, the initiative to probe, and the daring to challenge the status quo, and the humility to accept that there are bigger and more challenging things that require further pursuit.</p>
              <p>Why should an inquisitive 17 year old who open up a product that it owns and change the content of the iPhone product that it owns -  end up being prosecuted by Apple ?</p>
              <p>If the 17 year old had responded to the terms and conditions of the purchase of the iPhone and knows the limits of the product ownership that does not full title to the 17 year old, then the product should be returned if the 17 year old find the terms to be too cumbersome and restrictive to his full enjoyment of ownership.</p>
              <p>Once the 17 year old respond to the terms and conditions of ownership, it is a matter of contractural responsibilities and maturity not to infringe the contract.</p>

              <p>Apple has a separate "APPS Market" for anyone to design a program that helps to make the iPod the best seller, and Apple encourages anyone to develop softwares that will make the iPod even more versatile. </p>
              <p>However, in the scenario that TS had suggested, the TS was not referring to the 17yo designing any softwares to make the iPod any better.</p>
              <p>Instead, TS was raising the subject of a 17yo cracking the protective code of the iPod and enter the "resident memory area" that has iPod operating system and electronic codes embedded - which Apple lay claim to its Intellectual Property Rights.</p>
              <p>As mentioned, in my post - anyone who buys a product and send in the Warranty Card with clauses that limit the Buyer's Rights in using the product in some ways -  must be clear and satisfied that such limits to the Buyer's Rights will not infringe or place any limits to the full satisfaction in using the product.</p>
              <p>Such limits to the Buyer's Rights may require the Buyer to respect the Manufacturer's "Intellectual Property Rights" to the product operating system, even though title of the product may have passed on to the Buyer. </p>
              <p>In this scenario, the TS had shown Apple requiring any iPod Buyer not to access the electronic codes that allow the iPod to function, or face prosecution by Apple.</p>
              <p>If the Buyer feels that this demand by the Manufacturer prevent the full enjoyment of using the product, the Buyer should then either not buy the product in the first instance, or return the product for a full refund.</p>

              <p>How did capitalist or capitalism enter your vision to have "protectionism" benefitting the capitalists and not motivating the capitalists to improve their products ?</p>
              <p>Can capitalism thrive in a world that is partitioned by protectionism, or is it not a fact that Capitalists and Capitalism will thrive better in a world that allow capital to move freely, and with venture capitalists nurturing "innovation hubs" that are too high risks for Commercial Bankers ? </p>

              <p>Since Bill Gates produced his "operating system" for the PC and made the PC into a product that started a global socio-technological revolution, there have been others that used the PC platform to harness the global energy of PC users to innovate new approaches that had continuously brought social and technological change.</p>
              <p>These include the bright "young kids" that developed Yahoo! and Google, introduced Amazon as an electronic platform for commercial transactinos - even as the "older kids" continue to improve the CPU and chips to further reduce the physical size and weight to make it portable, and encourage its use as a modern lifestyle need.</p>
              <p>Has "protectionism" in the various forms of "intellectual property rights" and "market domination by sheer size" prevent innovation ?</p>

              <p>Do companies get rich from patents alone ?</p>
              <p>Surely, a product that is patented and is not marketable, with no demand - cannot be of any use to any companies ?</p>
              <p>Patents have a time limit - anywhere from 10 to 15 or 20 years, and without any further improvements that can be seen as substantially upgrading the original patent design - the patent will simply run out.</p>
              <p>It is during this tenure of the Patent that a company can "get rich" - and this is subject to the patented product finding useful applications to be accepted or needed by any market place.</p>
              <p>Patent in itsel cannot possibly protect a company even during the tenure of the Patent Right - as competitors can study the patented design, reverse engineer to make improvements or the same with a tweak difference to serve the same application.</p>
              <p>It will require the Company to continuously invest in Research &amp; Development, and to stay ahead of the pack.</p>
              <p>It will require the Company to have success and immediate wide penetration of the product on a global basis, so as to recover costs in the shortest time before the life cycle of the product goes flat.</p>
              <p>Patents can hardly be enforced in all corners of the globe, and it is only smart for patent holders to consider lowering its selling price to reach a wider market, or have multi-level pricing for different market place, so as to beat patent infringements.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is amazing that you never fail with your habit in selling your grand vision of the event as seen in your grand standing statements. </p>
              <p>Somehow you have the consistent skill to loose yourself on that big stage that exist in the big hall of your mind.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the recommendations, but I do have a library of my own as well as better and more credible sources for research and comprehension. Utimately, protectionism boils down to one thing - the creation of inefficient monopolies. The writers and those wannabe writers can author long thesis , wall of texts daily, but in the end, what is the critical point?</p>
              <p>The TS provided a simple and relevant presumption - Protectionism DOES NOT kill innovation, and had kindly offered his perception and opinions. But does it hold?</p>
              <p>Others had offered their counter- opinions, and will be respected except for known self admitted piece of Turd, for she admitted her warped and twisted perceptions are based on dung and anyone who does not agree to dung is wrong.</p>
              <p><br>Let me share an example:-</p>
              <p>1. Rice from Vietnam costs only S$6 per 5kg pack due to productive efforts and economies of scale. Rice cultivated and processed in Thailand costs $10 per 5kg pack. But in order for Thais to buy the cheaper Viet rice, a tariff is imposed, making it cost $11/kg to buy.</p>
              <p>This is protectionism, to protect the thai farmers, but at the expense of the thai consumer, denying him the right to progress and evolution, and be content paying fat cat inefficient practices of the thai farmer and the industry.</p>
              <p>If the viets can be efficient, why not the thais? ( This is only an example for simple illustration, for real world situations are far more complex than perceived )</p>
              <p>2. Microsoft has intellectual property rights to its OS and IE. It is respected. But when MS attempts to force computer manufacturers and distributors to bundle its software for sale, this is protectionism. ( How MS did it is another 'you scratch my back, i'll scratch yours' story)</p>
              <p>It inhibits other software designers to come up with different OS, for other computer makers will not use their OS.  We know there is Linux and a whole host of other OS, programmes that does better than MS, but due to protectionism, they never stood a chance, and the consumer deprived of progress and evolution.</p>
              <p>In the end, does protectionism enhances innovation or stifles it? I leave it to the readers to ponder, without a wall of text.</p>

              <p>I'm with you on this - trade barriers such as taxes, tarriffs, etc.</p>
              <p>Incubation units for creativity to bloom such as the model used by Singapore are protected based on intellectual property rights, to be respected and honoured by WTOs around the world.</p>
              <p>No harm if the 17 year old can create a programme that will help make the ipod a best seller. This had been the way and how capitalists had prospered and even bought over companies that had helped.</p>
              <p>No sense in charging or jailing the growing adult, unless he uses and profits from it without respecting intellectual rights of the owners. That would be criminally wrong regardless of whatever country he hailed from.</p>
              <p>If he meant should Protectionism kill innovation, then Protectionsim will in fact stifle creativity, simply because the capitalists will presume they have an infinite market share, and will not bother to improve.</p>
              <p>It took research into agriculture yields to make the farmers squeal in pain like pigs when other nations could plant crops with bi-annual harvests back in the 60s. And they had to spend more on their own research to compete against others, when combined with other improved productive processes from the farmer to the <strong>consumer with a household budget to adhere to.</strong></p>
              <p>Similarly, if hi-tech endeavours go the protectionists way, they will only grow fat and never improve. And it will take another 17 year old bright spark to get them off their arses.</p>
              <p><strong>Thus Protectionism is wrong and MUST never be adopted, if we are to progress and evolve, regardless of whatever country one comes from, and the amount of unions they have.</strong></p>
              <p> Patents alone will enrich companies on a world wide scale, <strong>IF</strong> intellectual property rights is respected as China, africa, latin american and some asian states must be brought to heel with.</p>

              <p>Your example of netscape is an example of protectionism at its worst, because of protectionist measures adopted by MS stifled Netscape and others who would want to attempt another browser.</p>
              <p>Should anti protectionist measures be widely adopted as pledged during apec, then progress and evolution will occur. The bottomline is, who dont want to prosper.</p>
              <p>Free trade could NEVER stifle innovation, because we are talking about competition from EVERY corner of the market place. Only the best and the brightest in the industrial and commercial process will survive parting bucks from the consumer. I am not even talking about one aspect such as the pricing of product alone.</p>
              <p>But I am sincerly interested to know more of your views, on how protectionism will NOT stifle innovation, given that without competition, unhealthy regression will only occur. Some may claim additional funds would be created for better research and development, but looking at the financial crisis that happened, such funds were actually lining the pockets of shareholders than bettering the lives of consumers.</p>
              <p>It would be the popularity of a product that will ensure there are funds for innovation, and it can only happen in a non-protectionist environment where competition is rife, a necessity for survival that will get capitalists off their butts.</p>
