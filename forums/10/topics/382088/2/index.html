              <p>When i attended those international  trade conferences, protectionism is alway on the table, basically, it evolve mostly on farming issues and other commodities, not much a concern for Singapore, we are in WTO, freetrade in many organisation, it is more on farming economy sense, therefore protectionism got nothing to do with a boy ability to hack computer, those are domestic issue. Yes, TS may be right that given more freedom to roam, people can be more creative, but it is 2 side of the coins we are talking about, one being creative, the other being creative of social problems, just like free shooting spree is also a creation of too much freedom on the negative side of the society.</p>
              <p>To end it, when all these delegates talks about protection of their rice, meat, sugar etc etc...in the conference, i will be snoring or eating at the free buffets outside..Yummy!</p>

              <p>Who is the Taiwanese "hum" attempting to impress ?</p>
              <p>Will anyone invite a Taiwanese "hum" without any integrity to any trade conferences that involve WTO issues ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, the Taiwanese "hum" is no more then another FRAUDSTER - with its characteristic of dishonesty, vanity, and total lack of INTEGRITY.</p>
              <p>Only a Taiwanese "hum" with no integrity will imagine itself to be attending BIG TIME Conferences involving WTO issue - when it attempt to hide from its real world working in the sleazy bar and surviving on the flesh trade of its own kind of "hum".</p>
              <p>Can a Taiwanese "hum" - who knows nothing about INTEGRITY - get itself involve with WTO issues ?</p>
              <p>It is not surprising that it will boast that - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">it will be snoring or eating at the free buffets</span></em>" - while spreading garbage about itself attending a conference on WTO issue.</p>
              <p>The real purpose is not to contribute anything positive in any thread, but simply to spam the idiocy of a "hum" and to derail the thread with its flippant 'one-liner' loaded with its toxic verbiage.</p>

              <p>Wait wait... social protectionism??  I'm sure theres another word for it somewhere out there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In any case, there is a lot to be said about innovation, but I've yet to come across anything about protectionism.  Maybe there is a link somewhere, but it may not be as positive as you claim it to be. </p>
              <p>Innovation is a lot to do with close partnerships between industries, universities and governments these days.  Look at silicon valley.  Stanford university is there, so are all the leading high-tech industries.  They cluster around there for a reason, access to R&amp;D. </p>
              <p>A lot about innovations and creativity is about building up people's knowledge and getting them to think critically and out of the box. I think maybe your definition of "the social aspect of protectionism" is a little too broad. Maybe you should narrow it down to something more concrete?</p>
