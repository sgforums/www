              if I had wished every day that someone murdered Lee Kuan Yew, his Prime
              Minister son and their entire family! Yet, I am not guilty.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Listen to this. Even I had wished every
              day, that someone would please drop a ten ton Weapon of Mass
              Destruction over the house of Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew in No. 1 <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Oxley</span> Road, Singapore and killed them all instantly; Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and all, dictators all of them; turning them into roast flesh;
              still I am not guilty under the law! Indeed I will rejoice and pop a
              bottle of Dom <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Perignon</span> 1959 and party all night!<br><br>This fact may be shocking to you but true nevertheless.<br><br>I am saying this in relation to the ongoing suspense over the disappearance of Mr. Mas <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Selamat</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kasatri</span>, the hero who escaped from Lee's prison Whitely Detention Center.<br><br>The Lee Administration keeps up the drum beat day after day, telling us that Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kastari</span>,
              the escaped prisoner is guilty of all sorts of heinous crimes, like
              wanting to fly an aeroplane filled with explosives and crash it into <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">Changi</span> Airport, Singapore; and therefore Lee has a right to detain him in
              Whitley Detention Center Singapore without trial for an indefinite
              period. Does Lee think the entire Singapore population are imbeciles
              without any brains who can be told any cock and bull story and lock up
              anyone he pleases?<br><br>Well, will he lock me up because I have always wished to see him and his entire family as dead meat?<br><br>My
              dear Mr. Lee, stop trying to fool Singaporeans. They are not as stupid
              as you think. Just as I am innocent of any crime even though I pray
              every day that someone would fly that very plane with explosives and
              crash it over your head; similarly Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kastari</span> is not guilty of any crime under the law for wishing someone would crash a plane into <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">Changi</span> Airport, Singapore.<br><br>Correct
              me if I am wrong but here comes the law. The law of attempt. A man is
              guilty of the crime of attempt when a plan is conceived to commit a
              crime and preparations has gone ahead to a point where the principal
              crime itself is imminent.<br><br>A man wants to kill his wife. No crime
              yet. He dreams about it. No crime yet. He buys a gun. No crime yet. He
              drives some distance towards his wife's work place. No crime yet. If he
              proceeds, after this point; somewhere along the line the crime of
              attempt will be committed. Perhaps at the point where he has sighted
              his wife in his gun barrel. At this point, I am sure the crime of
              attempted murder has been committed. But not before then.<br><br>Take the case of Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kastari</span>. Lee says Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kastari</span> has to be detained because he wanted to blow up <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-error">Changi</span> with a light aircraft. Well where is the evidence. Did he purchase a Cessna 152, 2 <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_13" class="blsp-spelling-error">seater</span> light aircraft and modified it so the right wing can carry TNT instead
              of blue high octane aircraft fuel? Was the aircraft flown from Darwin
              Australia to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_14" class="blsp-spelling-error">Tanjong</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_15" class="blsp-spelling-error">Pinang</span> airstrip for this purpose, and waiting? Did Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_16" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kastari</span> personally go to Darwin to oversee the modifications? Did he fly the aircraft back. Did Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_17" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kastari</span> only learn to take off and fly straight and level without bothering to
              know how to land? What ratings has he obtained? Visual Flight Rules,
              Instrument Rating, Multi Engine, Boeing 757 type rating, what?<br><br>Was the date fixed for the bombing of <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_18" class="blsp-spelling-error">Changi</span> ? Who were his advisers and collaborators, Tom <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_19" class="blsp-spelling-error">Whiteman</span>, Blue <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_20" class="blsp-spelling-error">Blackman</span> and Ahmad Ahmad Ahmad? Were the movements of all these people also monitored?<br><br>Were pictures taken of the plane, his fight ratings, his flight log book, of the modified right wing, of Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_21" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kastari</span> and his accomplices; were videos taken of their movements? Nothing.
              Absolutely nothing. Just a whole load of hogwash. All just a detective
              story. We might as well go to Lido Theater and watch Indiana Jones!<br><br>I suspect the Singapore government has nothing on him. Nothing at all, except the ability to tell us ad <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_22" class="blsp-spelling-error">nausum</span> that Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_23" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kastari</span> was up to all type of mischief, deserving to be incarcerated for an
              indefinite period without trial. This sort of logic is what one can
              expect in places like Rwanda, not Singapore. Nothing doing Mr. Lee. You
              have no right to detain Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_24" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kastari</span>, an innocent man.<br><br>Second
              the whole idea of detention without trial is unacceptable. Anathema.
              Unjust. A travesty of justice. Lee cannot be allowed to detain anyone
              without trial. The Constitution specifically requires that every man be
              given due process of law; meaning if there is <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_25" class="blsp-spelling-error">prima</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_26" class="blsp-spelling-error">facie</span> evidence of guilt he must be charged within 48 hours before a judge, be
              be informed of the charges, provided competent legal counsel; the
              burden of proof being on the prosecution of proof beyond reasonable
              doubt; the case be proceeded in a speedy manner and if convicted
              imprisoned; if acquitted released. This is the law.<br><br>Telling us a whole load of hogwash and fantasy that Mr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_27" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kastari</span> wanted to do this and that, arresting him and detaining him without any
              trial is not first world at all. It is worse than Rwanda!<br><br>If anyone is to be detained now in Whitley Detention Center Singapore, it should be Wong Kan <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_28" class="blsp-spelling-error">Keng</span> and the entire Lee family. They should be locked up and the keys thrown
              away. As for me, I would prefer that someone flew a plane from <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_29" class="blsp-spelling-error">Selatar</span> Airport runway 030, flying north into the wind, then over the water,
              flight level three thousand feet, then turned it south over the island
              straight over <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_30" class="blsp-spelling-error">Oxley</span> Rise No. One and crashed it there, just when Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_31" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew was having dinner at 6 pm eating his Char <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_32" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kwey</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_33" class="blsp-spelling-error">Teow</span>! Wouldn't that be nice!<br><br>But even after my saying all this, I cannot be arrested. Not in any country where there is rule of law, like in California, USA.<br><br>And neither should Mr. Mas <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_34" class="blsp-spelling-error">Salamat</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_35" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kastari</span>, the hero of Whitley.<br><br><span class="blsp-spelling-error">Gopalan</span> Nair</p>
