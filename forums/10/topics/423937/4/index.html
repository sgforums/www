              <p>the above after leaving out the last two adds up to 1700/month, shall remove 300 from here for companies too small to be taxed by GST assuming all merchants are honest enough not to 'factor' them in.</p>
              <p>oh maybe i'm spent too much, i should not have a phone nor internet, walk my children to school, restrict the whole family to 2 meals a day etc..</p>
              <p>anyway, i have donated 98 monthly to the taxman on GST. so when i get 800, it seems i can still get to christmas? that's great, i must send the taxman a thank you note this christmas then. at least, i can still last to year end</p>
              <p>oh no, i am reminded at home i also need to pay town council, property tax, oh &amp; income tax, the one i used to pay the above. i guess one can't get more objective &amp; charitable than that right? i feel i'm a star in the president star charity<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>sound good. but i guess they will, like what you said, give all sorts of excuse on the implementation. when collecting taxes, they can crack their heads to think of all the first in this world methods like electronic road pricing &amp; COE and if you remember when gst is first introduced, they go through the trouble to mint lots of 1 cent &amp; 5 cent coins. but when it is to collect less tax, the same fervour is suddenly missing.</p>

              <p>Below is an example:</p>
              <p><em>Items below $50 are taxed 1%<br></em><em>Items above $50 to $200 are taxed 3%<br></em><em>Items above $200 to $1000 are taxed 7%<br></em><em>Items above $1000 to $5000 are taxed 15%<br>Items above $5000 are taxed 20%</em></p>
              <p>While most people cannot avoid the taxations, it is a rather interesting implementation.</p>
              <p>So on and so forth. However, this poses a challenge for most standard POS systems and the tax collecting systems.</p>
