              <h1>PAP MPs rebut Workers' Party Chairman<br></h1>
              <p><br>A small battle of words emerged during the debate on Budget 2011, as MPs
               from the ruling People's Action Party rebutted criticism by Workers' 
              Party Chairman Low Thia Khiang. <br><br>Mr Low, who's also the MP for 
              Hougang, had described the Budget as a "pre-election sweetener, designed
               to win back the hearts and minds of people". <br><br>Nee Soon Central MP Ong Ah Heng said Mr Low is always criticising the Budget and should give credit when it's due. <br><br>Mr Low retorted that he did praise this year's Budget for putting four billion dollars back into the Reserves. <br><br>He also asked if Mr Ong was finding fault with him. <br><br>To that, Mr Ong apologised for missing the compliment. <br><br>Mr
               Low also called on the government to reduce the Goods and Services Tax 
              by two percent, to help Singaporeans cope with rising cost of living by 
              bringing down the prices of essential goods. <br><br>But Holland-Bukit Timah GRC MP Christopher De Souza flatly turned down this suggestion. <br><br><strong> "It is surprising that Mr Low is suggesting to lower the GST. Who does 
              the Workers' Party really want to help? High income earners, as we know,
               consume more, and therefore pay higher GST. And we know in that pool of
               tax collected, it gets redistributed to lower-income earners." <br><br>Source:<a href="http://news.xin.msn.com/en/singapore/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4675238"><br>http://news.xin.msn.com/en/singapore/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4675238</a><br></strong></p>

              <p>Wah this chris de souza....if he wants to talk like that...does he have stats to back it up? ie do the rich consume more due to higher income as compared to the middle and low income as a whole?</p>
              <p>It has already been acknowledged in business books around the world that GST or VAT are regressive forms of tax. The lower income ones actually suffer more.</p>
              <p>Go on a live TV show like that and be prepared to be whacked!</p>

              <p>If you are rich, you only spend part of your income on purchases, the rest you invest or bank in. You don't get tax for investments. Then from investments, you purchase companies. You don't get tax for companies. From companies, you get money. You then invest again.</p>

              <p>Yup... Tats why, GST actually killed the poor, rather than helped them. <br><br>Middle income group worstly affected most of the time though. <br>Like GST credits, the lowest income group get some handouts.... and they dun spend tat much... can get free rice etc... <br><br>Middle income group, you are left on your own. <br><br>The rich always happen to be the businessmen, so they just need to tax their customers more. Only exception is the rich who are of the working class.</p>

              <p>Imagine your Utility BILL monthly is $190/- With 7% GST it will be $13.30 per month. For 1 year you are paying $159.60 GST to government.  Not including other appliances which we need to replace wear and tear. (All these items also need topay GST)  How about our telephone bill 7% it can turn out to be $100/year</p>
              <p>Come back to the MP Ong, not sure if he sides the residents or the PAP? With such approach, i am certain he will always say good things about PAP policies....So do you think he will help the residents 100%? He will probably give excuses for not writing a stronger letters to assist the residents.</p>
              <p>Some people just know how to do surface work, smile in front of PRESS, at the back. $#@!^%()  Hence a person heart content is very important. Do you see MP Ong raise any policies which can be improve in the parliament? His own constituency, residents has night  parking problem issues, has he given any solutions or bring to HDB attention?  Or jus pass the baton to someone else jus because he is retiring.</p>
