              <p><br>shall bring this to the front. overwhelming support for our lonely voice in parliament on such a critical issue deserves front page attention during this important period. this is what i've learnt from the excellent marketing team of the govt, the media.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/sleep.png" alt="sleep.png"></p>
              <p>from what i see around me, friends &amp; relatives, there are mainly 2 big groups voting for them. the possibility of identification by the serial number on the voting slip has a huge psychological effect on one group, i suppose mainly civil servants &amp; special interest group. of course, there is the diehard pap supporters group among these.</p>
              <p>the other group is one that largely ignorant about politics and is totally mesmerised by the marketing done by the media &amp; may have possibly not travelled outside of the country to do good comparison. 'this govt is doing quite well mah' is what i've heard frequently. seems like we got to do some marketing on our own.</p>
              <p>no use forcing our opinions on them, i realised, may have opposite effect, just raise their awareness. this leaves the rest of the 33.3% of us who on internet which they cannot control, who are objective enough to decide what is right or wrong </p>

              <p>mr MP de souza, i am not stupid to believe that GST are tax for the rich. there is so much the rich can eat and drink.</p>
              <p>govt should abolish the GST system altogether and use other tax methods such as someone mention luxury tax, higher property tax for second home.  </p>
              <p>These GST are only means of despot govt trying to expand civil service population that ensure their vote come election. higher president , MP, minister salary.</p>

              <p>the huge power of GST is that, it cause other expenses which does not show GST is being charged to increase as well.</p>
              <p>-merchants use the excuse of GST to increase prices whether or not they are affected</p>
              <p>-food, milk powder &amp; diapers at supermarket </p>

              <p>-child care centres to increase citing 'costs'. children school bus to increase</p>
              <p>-phones and utility charges (these 2 are shown but just to show how far GST can reach me)</p>

              <p>If you want higher prices and inflation vote for PAP.</p>
              <p>I am not trying to say, if you vote for opposition prices will come downbut at least we need someone in parliament other than the 2 opposition members to fight and question the necessity of various taxes.</p>
              <p>i admire the courage and chiam for daring to continue to voice up for singaporeans. If we dont show them equal support there will be non left to fight for average joe like us. fighting for our survival against inflation, raising property prices( in my opinion a bubble), fighting jobs against foreigners. why do we need this kind of govt?</p>
              <p>if we compare to gaddafi,yeah probably PAP is better.</p>

              <p>the true economic powerhouse has forever been the country that has freedom, lotsa freedom , do not stifle the mind of its ppl. china is exception because of its sheer population, the initial stage of developemnt will be fast, my question is can china maintain the momentum in the next stage of development?</p>

              <p>trust me, the 800 is really nothing. with the taxes that we have listed above, it can easily add up to at least 200 a month and up to more than 500 a month.</p>
              <p>if we were to lose our job to an FT, we cannot even last up to polling day at the rate we are taxed with this 800.</p>
              <p>if we were to do a detailed calculation on what the govt owe us up to age 55 as compared to what other first world nations are doing for their people,</p>
              <p>the true figure is much closer to a high 6 figure sum than this meagre 800.</p>

              <p><br>You are damn right. paying them $1800 might be a forecast on the downside.</p>
              <p>If you drive, you are already paying govt 27x of $1800 for a piece of COE.</p>
              <p>The property has risen so much in last 5 year,in fact you had already started paying them back xx times of $1800.</p>
