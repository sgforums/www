That is selfish in every sense. If anyone have the guts, the capability to move the masses and prove to be a good leader, pen your name down, join the politic and we will elect you. But if you are going to keep mentioning about old past, there is nothing we can do but just sympathise it.</p>
              <p>LKY is not worrying that his past actions, right or wrong, will not make his downfall, if so, he will not had released people like Lim. He knows it is a different ball game now, by telling the youngs not to expect a govt change already tell you a story of his stand in this coming election.</p>

              <p>Only the dumbness of a Taiwanese "hum" will want to determine the weight of "integrity" - as it has nothing of any worth to be mentioned about its own integrity.</p>
              <p>What if the integrity weights only 0.5 grams - will the Taiwanese "hum" trample on it ?</p>
              <p>It will not be a surprise if the Taiwanese "hum" will sell its "hum" for 0.5 grams of gold - as its integrity means littel to the "hum" ?</p>
              <p>The answer is obvious considering the lack of integrity in the "hum" to even appreciate what integrity is all about.</p>
              <p>Your understanding of the history is as bad as your understanding of the politics of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Was Chiang Kai Shek naive to listen to his advisors, or was he simply incompetent to lead those who had believed in him, and with him having no ability to control his ego to defeat Mao - even when Mao was pressed to make the Long March into near oblivion ?</p>
              <p>You have no business to associate any of the Singaporean loyalists to be Communist when you have no knowledge of the politics of Singapore during the 1950s, and depend only on the filth that was fed into your "hum" brain.</p>
              <p>Mao succeeded as he was able to seize the upper hand in exploiting Chiang's failure to manage his own opportunities by attacking his own corrupted subordinate generals that abuse China's citizens through the barrel of the gun.</p>
              <p>Singapore politicians of the 1950s were all similar in spirit as Sun Yat Sen efforts to modernise China and take it away from the clutches of the corrupt Empress that destroyed China single-handedly.</p>
              <p>Singapore will similarly be destroyed by LKY's skewed vision and political ambitions that project only the interest of the PAP first and Singaporeans second.</p>
              <p>A Taiwanese "hum" will be the cause of internal strife with its continued idiocy to distort the political history as designed by the PAP.</p>
              <p>Do we need a Taiwanese "hum" to teach Singaporeans our history when its own knowledg of Taiwanese history is as bad if not worst ?</p>

              <h2><br></h2>
              <h2><span class="fullpost"><strong>The lost history of Lee Kuan Yew</strong></span></h2>
              <p><span class="fullpost"><strong></strong><br> After his education in Britain, Lee Kuan Yew returned to Singapore in 1949 to practise as a lawyer in the law firm <em>Laycock and Ong.</em> He became the honorary legal adviser for several trade unions after
                      being acquainted with their leaders (in 1951) and subsequently caught
                      the public eye in February 1952, when the Postal Workers Union
                      succeeded, with his guidance, in obtaining important concessions from
                      the colonial government.<br> <br> According to his memoirs and this <a href="http://www.cabinet.gov.sg/CabinetAppointments/Mr+LEE+Kuan+Yew.htm">website</a>,
                      Lee Kuan Yew then proceeded to form the PAP with the help of the
                      communists. Yet these sources conveniently neglect to mention Lee Kuan
                      Yew's involvement in the Singapore Progressive Party in the 1951
                      legislative elections. In fact, Lee acted as the election agent for his
                      boss John Laycock, helping him to manage his campaign and canvass on
                      his behalf. (See <a href="http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1150_2008-11-30.html">here</a> and <a href="http://hellosingapore.info/lee-kuan-yew/">here</a> for proof) He had thus entered into politics even before he became
                      involved in the trade unions' dispute with the British. (Polling day
                      for the 1951 legislative elections was on 10 April, we can assume that
                      his political activities with the SPP started months before that)<br> <br> If I may speculate, LKY joined the SPP initially to build up his
                      political career there. However when the Rendel Constitution expanded
                      the electoral rolls to include all local-born as voters, resulting in a
                      significant increase in Chinese voters, LKY decided to jump ship and
                      formed the PAP in 1954 because he saw that the SPP lacked the support
                      of the Chinese working class. (So the next time LKY condemns
                      politicians who change political parties, you know where he's coming
                      from)<br> <br> Yet the problem isn't solely that LKY jumped ship and didn't care to
                      tell anyone about his great experience in his memoirs. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The bigger
                      problem lies in the fact that LKY supported the SPP despite the fact
                      that it was A) pro-British in both its policies and in its composition
                      of members (mostly English-speaking upper class professionals) B)
                      unsupportive of achieving independence (it merely paid lip-service to
                      the idea by declaring in October 1952, its objective of Singapore
                      achieving independence through a Singapore-Malaya merger without
                      setting a target date)</strong></span></span><br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> LKY's miraculous change of heart on these issues when he joined the PAP
                      only demonstrates how the pursuit of power can sometimes make one very
                      flexible about their beliefs. </strong></span></span>Unfortunately for us, this flexibility of
                      LKY's did not extend to the area of political freedoms.</span></p>

              <p>For a X-rated Fraud that has been proven for its lack of honesty by plagiarizing the works of others without any qualification and without any shame to pass it as its own, it is amazing that it even knows about the word "<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">virtue</span></strong>" in its vocabulary.</p>

              <p>It is not surprising that the X-rated Fraud will even dare to be strident to the extent of being an alarmist - with its 24 nuclear bombs - to blast its dishonest opinion based on its deliberate lack of diligence to research on a subject that it has no knowledge about, but will make absurd claims to lull Singaporeans to sleep - even as the Kra Canal is being seriously considered by different countries with deep concern to the strategic passage through the Staits of Malacca being closed for any reasons.</p>
              <p>Can anything pathetically be more originally forthcoming from a X-rated Fraud - who can only satisfy its own ego with a piece of turd, which its pseudo-intellect cannot even hope to create, but will have to plagiarize it from one who is as "zwei-siao" as the X-rated Fraud, and still the X-rated Fraud will hang on to the plagiarized turd for what its own X-rated life is worth ?</p>

              <h2><span><strong>The lost history of Lee Kuan Yew</strong></span></h2>
              <p><span><br>After his education in Britain, Lee Kuan Yew returned to Singapore in 1949 to practise as a lawyer in the law firm <em>Laycock and Ong.</em> He became the honorary legal adviser for several trade unions after being acquainted with their leaders (in 1951) and subsequently caught the public eye in February 1952, when the Postal Workers Union succeeded, with his guidance, in obtaining important concessions from the colonial government.<br><br>According to his memoirs and this <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cabinet.gov.sg/CabinetAppointments/Mr+LEE+Kuan+Yew.htm">website</a>, Lee Kuan Yew then proceeded to form the PAP with the help of the communists. Yet these sources conveniently neglect to mention Lee Kuan Yew's involvement in the Singapore Progressive Party in the 1951 legislative elections. In fact, Lee acted as the election agent for his boss John Laycock, helping him to manage his campaign and canvass on his behalf. (See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1150_2008-11-30.html">here</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://hellosingapore.info/lee-kuan-yew/">here</a> for proof) He had thus entered into politics even before he became involved in the trade unions' dispute with the British. (Polling day for the 1951 legislative elections was on 10 April, we can assume that his political activities with the SPP started months before that)<br><br>If I may speculate, LKY joined the SPP initially to build up his political career there. However when the Rendel Constitution expanded the electoral rolls to include all local-born as voters, resulting in a significant increase in Chinese voters, LKY decided to jump ship and formed the PAP in 1954 because he saw that the SPP lacked the support of the Chinese working class. (So the next time LKY condemns politicians who change political parties, you know where he's coming from)<br><br>Yet the problem isn't solely that LKY jumped ship and didn't care to tell anyone about his great experience in his memoirs. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The bigger problem lies in the fact that LKY supported the SPP despite the fact that it was A) pro-British in both its policies and in its composition of members (mostly English-speaking upper class professionals) B) unsupportive of achieving independence (it merely paid lip-service to the idea by declaring in October 1952, its objective of Singapore achieving independence through a Singapore-Malaya merger without setting a target date)</strong></span></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>LKY's miraculous change of heart on these issues when he joined the PAP only demonstrates how the pursuit of power can sometimes make one very flexible about their beliefs.</strong></span></span> Unfortunately for us, this flexibility of LKY's did not extend to the area of political freedoms.</span></p>

              <p>I said many times already, when it comes to Lee Kuan Yew, only some sort of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>idiotic moron</strong></span> would go and believe in what he says.</p>
              <p>Only those political idiots, naive morons; thinking is like a three year old child would actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">go and believe</span></strong></span> <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">i</span>n</strong> Lee Kuan Yew.</p>

              <p>Did LKY's memoirs include the snippet that "after liberation, he went into contracting business, undertook work ranging from house repairing to supplying labourers - and saved enough to leave for Britain in 1946 ?</p>
              <p>The post-WW2 face of a "Contractor and Labour supplier" seem to have been etched on the face of a Cambridge trained Lawyer - as seen in a photo taken in 1959.</p>

              <p>As a young Lawyer working in Laycock and Ong, LKY represented locals of various Chinese, Malay, or Indian origins, and represented individuals on criminal charges, as well as Trade Unions for infringing public laws.</p>
              <p>Was LKY already planning his political future with his seemingly magnaminous efforts displayed that had him even offering to pay for the lost sum in a Criminal Breach of Trust case involving a Chinese clerk accused of embezzling a sum of $1000+ from its employers ?</p>
              <p>On his ascension to political success - the magnamity of a wanna-be politician changed into a Machevillian demon freely imposing draconian laws that include whipping and death by hanging - punishments that date back to the ancient days.</p>
              <p>Its insatiable desire to control will continue with increasing penalties for mundane offenses on normal citizens that step out of his harsh laws, as he continue to tighten the laws to make it an illegal act even for an assembly of one to protest in public.</p>
