              <p>Synopsis of Dr Lim Hock Siew's speech:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Today they are asking us to be magnanimous. What does magnanimity mean? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Only those who have suffered have the moral right, the moral standing to be magnanimous, not the culprit. The culprit can seek forgiveness if they admit their mistakes and apologize for it. Not for the victims of this torture to seek forgiveness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We are the ones who have to be magnanimous and we are prepared to be magnanimous provided the culprits admit their mistakes and seek our forgiveness." </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"On that question of release unconditionally – that we stood firm. I stood firm and had to suffer for two decades. That is the price we had to pay for our integrity. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In Singapore we have a situation where <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the government leaders said they have integrity that has to be sustained by the highest pay in the world</span></span>, but yet they demand from political opponents and detainees an integrity that has to be sustained by the longest imprisonment in the world. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">These kind of two types of integrity – to compare them is to compare Heaven and Earth. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Why should anybody has to sacrifice so much just to sustain his integrity and his beliefs? And the government have to reward themselves with so much high pay. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This is the immorality of the political situation in Singapore today."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Detention without trial is not a peaceful action. It is an act of violence. They come to see you not in the daylight with an invitation card. They come in the morning at 4am that is the time when decent people sleep, and when political terrorists and tyrants strike. And when you are detained you are subjected to all kinds of mental and even physical torture." </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Some of you may have heard that when you are young, you are idealistic, when you’re old , you are realistic. Now this is the kind of rubbish that is used by those who have either lost their ideals, or have sold their ideals for self-interests. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Each should not wither one’s ideals or convictions. If anything, it should only consolidate and make it more resolute. If age has anything to do with it, it is only by way of expression and application of these ideals and convictions having the benefit of youthful experiences. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">And a Life without convictions, without idealism is a mere meaningless existence."</span></p>

              <p><br>20 years, not only me dun understand, u ask any 20++yo or even 30++ yo singaporeans, they also dun understand or not even bother to understand.</p>
              <p>Sympathy aside, isn't is plain stupid for guys to hold on to their intergrity just because of pride and ego??? why not just go along with them, leave this country and fight for another day. At time, when you are an egg, dun think you still a solid rock, play the game and then, after early release,  from behind strike LKY out of his life. Now already old old with full of sickness, how to fight, talk until cow come home also no use.</p>

Alway think of Lim Yew Hock, i think he is more famous than Lim Hock Siew, name sound like the same, are they related??</p>
              <p>Anyway, either Yew Hock or Hock Siew or Pig Hock, I am going to say once again, if you are not ruthless, cunning, smart and have a good foresight of things to come, you better dun join politics, I think all these peoples do not have that capability. Sad, but it is true. They will be better off if they had either joined LKY in PAP or be some lecturers or businessmen and live happily everafter with 3 to 4 wifeys.</p>
              <p>Just a question for my Uncle Flash Atobe, how much does per kg of intergrity worth? If you tell me that intergrity is intangible, I said it is worth nothing. In many a times, in history of kingdoms and dynasties, you had read about princes and ministers kowtow to it master (king or emperor) with an ulterior motives, they dun losing all their intergrity for the objective of success when time for coup de grace arrive. And when you are on top of it, that intergrity lost is worth the cause. Hock Siew, should had been smarter, so are others, I should had been their female advisor then, perhap then, they would not had suffered so badly.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, I dun really blame them for holding on their intergrity for the sake of being bravery for nothing. Why? Because, Communism at that time, incalcated trustworthiness, heroicism, uphold of intergrity and Bravery. An exact opposite of the British(west) educated/trained people like LKY who are trained in skrewness and yet with the ability to tapped on communist weak point.</p>
              <p>My taiwan former president, Chiang Kai Shek was a direct opposite of what had happen in Singapore, he was too naive and believed his advisors too much. And Mao, the shrew and cunning communist, paved all the way to chase him out of mainland china. If both all the Lims politicians of that time in singapore is like Mao, who incalcated all these stupid communism philosophies of righteous and uphold intergrity but never practice himself, today, my Uncle Atobe might be a  Prime Minister of Singapore, Hock Siew might be the MM and so on. 4sg will still remain to clean the parliament house. And me, Angel would had more business. UNDERSTAND!!!</p>

              <p><br>This part of the speech seems to be an error in the first public speech ever made by the venerable 80 year old Dr Lim Hock Siew since his release from ISA detention - and remained silent from the public.</p>
              <p>I believe he had intended to mean "<em>the process leading to the Referendum</em>" towards merger with Malaysia was designed to destroy the Opposition Parties, and not the merger itself.</p>
              <p>The process leading to the Referendum was a torturous route taken with negotiations bilaterally and multi-laterally between so many players including the British Colonial Government, the Malayan Prime Minister and his Cabinet, LKY and his comrades in the separated PAP that he controlled, Dr Lee Siew Choh and his team of ex-PAP members that formed the Barisan Sosialis - which included Lim Chin Siong, Dr Lim Hock Siew, Chia Thye Poh as well as the other ISA detainees.</p>
              <p>Each group of players had their own views and it was near impossible to come to any agreement when Dr Lee Siew Choh refused the terms of merger with Malaysia that left so many issues unclear, and which he and his colleagues felt that Singapore was placed at a disadvantage.</p>
              <p>To overcome the road block in negotiations, and to pre-empt the charisma of Lim Chin Siong to begin public actions to torpedo the outcome of a false Referendum, it left LKY with a final plan to play on Tunku's fear of an independent Singapore turning Communist - and "recruited" the Tunku to convince the Colonial Government to support the plan to activate Operation Cold Store.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If one is to study the words of the Referendum towards Merger with Malaysia - it is clear that the Referendum is a false referendum that leaves no option for anyone to vote against merger.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Singapore_national_referendum,_1962">‘Singapore National Referendum of 1962’ (*1) </a>had only the following three options:- </p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Option A</strong>: All Singapore citizens would automatically become citizens of Malaysia, and Singapore would retain a degree of autonomy and state power, such as over labour and education. Singapore would also get to keep its language policies, such as to retain using all four major languages, <a title="English language" href="/wiki/English_language"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">English</span></span></a>, <a title="Mandarin Chinese" href="/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mandarin</span></span></a>, <a title="Malay language" href="/wiki/Malay_language"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Malay</span></span></a> and <a title="Tamil language" href="/wiki/Tamil_language"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Tamil</span></span></a>. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Option B</strong>: Singapore would become a <a title="Federation" href="/wiki/Federation"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">federal</span></span></a> state like that of the other eleven states, with no more autonomy than the other states would, thus ceding control over issues such as labour and education policies to the federal government in <a title="Kuala Lumpur" href="/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Kuala Lumpur</span></span></a>. This also meant that there would be less multilingualism - only English and Malay would be used for official purposes, and possibly education. Only those born in Singapore or descended from the Singapore-born would become citizens of Malaysia. There would also be proportionate representation in Parliament from Singapore. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Option C</strong>: Singapore would enter on terms no less favourable than the Borneo territories, <a title="Sabah" href="/wiki/Sabah"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Sabah</span></span></a> and <a title="Sarawak" href="/wiki/Sarawak"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Sarawak</span></span></a>, both whom were also discussing merger with Malaysia. This was to ensure that Malaysia would not discriminate along racial lines, as that would mean discriminating against Sabah and Sarawak, which were predominantly <a class="mw-redirect" title="Bumiputra" href="/wiki/Bumiputra"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Bumiputra</span></span></a> as well. </li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The process of Referendum was just another political act when the dishonest intent of the Referendum can be seen in the manner that it was designed.</p>
              <p>It was part of a larger step-by-step structured plan put into action that bought time for all parties interested in preventing those Singaporean Nationalists who had Socialists leanings but not ncessarilty to be Communist.</p>
              <p>Left wing or Right Wing, Socialist or Capitalists, Liberal or Conservative - whatever the shades of politics - the Singaporeans who lived during that period after WW2 were mostly anti-colonialists, and were all Nationalists at heart.</p>

              <p>Only the dumbness of a Taiwanese "hum" will want to determine the weight of "integrity" - as it has nothing of any worth to be mentioned about its own integrity.</p>
              <p>What if the integrity weights only 0.5 grams - will the Taiwanese "hum" trample on it ?</p>
              <p>It will not be a surprise if the Taiwanese "hum" will sell its "hum" for 0.5 grams of gold - as its integrity means littel to the "hum" ?</p>
              <p>The answer is obvious considering the lack of integrity in the "hum" to even appreciate what integrity is all about.</p>
              <p>Your understanding of the history is as bad as your understanding of the politics of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Was Chiang Kai Shek naive to listen to his advisors, or was he simply incompetent to lead those who had believed in him, and with him having no ability to control his ego to defeat Mao - even when Mao was pressed to make the Long March into near oblivion ?</p>
              <p>You have no business to associate any of the Singaporean loyalists to be Communist when you have no knowledge of the politics of Singapore during the 1950s, and depend only on the filth that was fed into your "hum" brain.</p>
              <p>Mao succeeded as he was able to seize the upper hand in exploiting Chiang's failure to manage his own opportunities by attacking his own corrupted subordinate generals that abuse China's citizens through the barrel of the gun.</p>
              <p>Singapore politicians of the 1950s were all similar in spirit as Sun Yat Sen efforts to modernise China and take it away from the clutches of the corrupt Empress that destroyed China single-handedly.</p>
              <p>Singapore will similarly be destroyed by LKY's skewed vision and political ambitions that project only the interest of the PAP first and Singaporeans second.</p>
              <p>A Taiwanese "hum" will be the cause of internal strife with its continued idiocy to distort the political history as designed by the PAP.</p>
              <p>Do we need a Taiwanese "hum" to teach Singaporeans our history when its own knowledg of Taiwanese history is as bad if not worst ?</p>

              <p>The<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Progressive Party was heavily backed and made up of English-speaking upper class professionals. </strong></span>Its campaign ideology was to advocate progressive and gradual reforms, rather than sudden, quick, radical ones, which fell in line with British policy at the time, to slowly let Singapore gain full self-government. This approach was criticised vehemently by David Saul Marshall,leader of the Labour Front who instead wanted rapid reform. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The locals (especially the Chinese), and the communists also blasted the Progressive Party, claiming that they are Hanjian, or traitors in chinese.</strong></span></p>

That is selfish in every sense. If anyone have the guts, the capability to move the masses and prove to be a good leader, pen your name down, join the politic and we will elect you. But if you are going to keep mentioning about old past, there is nothing we can do but just sympathise it.</p>
              <p>LKY is not worrying that his past actions, right or wrong, will not make his downfall, if so, he will not had released people like Lim. He knows it is a different ball game now, by telling the youngs not to expect a govt change already tell you a story of his stand in this coming election.</p>
