              <p><strong>This study analyses the inflation hedging effectiveness of residential real estate over the 1969-94 period. The results indicate that residential real estate is a significant hedge against both expected and unexpected inflation.</strong> These results indicate that since financial assets are not good inflation hedges in periods of high unexpected inflation, including real estate in a portfolio should decrease the variance of the portfolio returns. These results were made possible by the use of the Added Variable Regression Method (AVRM), a measure which has yet to be employed in this context. There are nine variables included in the AVRM framework which are also found to have significant explanatory power relative to residential real estate returns.</p>

              <p>U mentions other variables..."location,supply and demand, market liquidity....etc"</p>
              <p>The statement"<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">inflation is a function of property price,.....</span></span>" implies u are saying because of other factors/variables, property price cannot be A variable of inflation.</p>
              <p>Unless the person u are rebutting use "Inflation is THE function of property price", then ur statement makes logical sense.</p>
              <p>U cannot base on other factors and rebutt the existence of a certain factor.</p>
              <p>I hope u understand what I am saying.</p>

              <div><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The variables u are putting in are</span> "location, supply and demand, natural disaster, economic growth and stability, government policies etc" </span></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #0000ff;">And u are using the existence of these variables to disprove property price as a possible potential variables.</span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #0000ff;">What u should do is to show cases of examples that property prices is not a variable. Not by merely showing the existence of other variables.</span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I <span style="color: #0000ff;">am not saying ur variables are wrong! But ur argument form!!</span></div>

              <div><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is like u saying, Tom cannot be a boy, because he wear skirts, wore lipsticks and eyelashes.</span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes  wear skirts, wore lipsticks and eyelashes are usually done by girls...but these are not sufficient conditions to ensure tom cannot be a boy.</span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #0000ff;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="color: #0000ff;">What u should say would be like Tom was verified as a girl infant when born. Tom was just a name given . This sufficiently shows Tom is a girl.</span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>U should stop using the F words since I have stop using them. And be more polite next time.</div>

              <p><br> 5125, you mean you dont know what are the variables but you know
              there are potential variables? Just like trying to sell traditional
              medicine at Peoples Park?</p>
              <p>So am I right to say that whatever you said are only good to
              classroom exercise and cant be use in practically because there is
              no way you can come out with an complete equation that explain
              the relationship between inflation and property price?</p>
              <p>So based on the same principle, can I <span style="color: #ff0000;">also say that many things
              in life and be simplified to y - f(x)? like Eagle = <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/243072">Mostwanted5125</a></span></p>
