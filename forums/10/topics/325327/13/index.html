              <p><br>Broken doesn't refers to family not intact. Family plays the major part and directly affects the moulding of a person, and a person's behaviour can be traced back to their family background.</p>
              <p>It would be interesting to find out who are really affected by that comments, and people will know who are the broken ones. Of course I know you are not one of them my dear. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>The difference between gambling and investing is investing uses information to gain an advantage, whereas gambling you just go in to punt (like what Temasek did).</p>
              <p>Facts of the case is still, it is cheaper to buy Merrill Lynch now than it was to buy in December 2007. Why? Because of the sub prime crisis unraveling itself in 2008.</p>

              <p><br>Dear Maurizio13,</p>
              <p>I believe I have told you before that I have lost the thrill and excitement of making a fool out of you.</p>
              <p>And this is why.</p>
              <p>1) These quote will mean nothing to you because you have ZERO experience in trading stock and thats why you believe you have the ability to time the market like Mr. AndrewPKyap in this forum.  </p>
              <p>Let me put you a challenge here. Instead of continuing with your armchair critics stuns of reporting yesterdays news like its your prediction, let me ask you. Do you think ML share price will head north or south in 3 months time? ie. Oct 2008.</p>
              <p>I really hope you will take this opportunity to prove to us that you are as smart as what you said.</p>
              <p>2) When I posted the quotes, I did 2 things intentionally, first is to remove one of the quote and 2nd I didnt show you the link. The reason is because, I am wait for you  to sprout more nonsense to argue about timing the market.</p>
              <p>I am not sure why you quoted George Soros, did he teach you to time the market? Or are you trying to use BIG NAME to repackage your bulllshit? </p>
              <p>And BTW, dont twist words here, I am comparing gambling to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> timing the market</span>, not gambling to investing in stocks. You should know thats a whole lot of difference if you have the any experience trading share on th xchange.</p>
              <p><strong>“I never have the faintest idea what the stock market is going to do in the next six months, or the next year, or the next two.”</strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><a href="http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/research_strategies/market_insight/investing_strategies/portfolio_planning/the_biggest_mistake_you_can_make.html">The pro's predicament</a></strong>. For market timing to be an effective investment strategy, you have to be right twice: once when you sell to exit the market, and again when you buy to re-enter. Being correct on the first call is challenging, but twice in a row is even more difficult. Although professional market timers—those who offer informed buy/sell advice to their clients—often claim success, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">decades of research have found little theoretical or empirical evidence that active market timing works</span></strong>. Indeed, a study that analyzed the five-year performance of 25 experienced professional timers found <span style="text-decoration: underline;">luck</span> to be just as important as the timers' skill in determining performance results.<sup>1</sup> And while market timers can reduce portfolio volatility (simply by being out of the market for periods of time),<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <strong>researchers have found no evidence that they consistently boost returns. </strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) The FACTS of the matter is that Temasek acquisition into ML is a marriage deal, whereby the ML <strong>INVITE</strong> Temasek to take up a stake in the company. Hence please dont confuse yourself with trading stocks through the xchange. If Temasek refused to take up a stake in ML 6 months ago, do you think Temasek will be given a chance to increase their stake now? Since ML desperately need to raise fresh capital 6 months ago, if Temasek pass that opportunity, I am pretty sure some other SWF would have taken up the stake. If that happen, can you tell us, what is left for Temasek?</p>
              <p>4) If you are wondering why I switch my nickname, its not because I am banned, its because FireIce disable some feature in my account to slow me down.</p>

              <p>I believe I have told you many times already. In order for this challenge to be effective it is important that we are both clear about the what we are talking here. So I am asking you</p>
              <p>Am I right to say that, you are claiming that in Singapore, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all property</span> price will sink <span style="text-decoration: underline;">together</span> and USA property will not?</p>
              <p>And if I could prove you wrong, you will eat shit and admit that you have been lying about your property investment in USA.</p>
              <p>If I cant prove you wrong, I will eat shit and apologies to you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope you will take up the challenge and prove to others that you are not lying, because if you dont, I believe many people who trusted you will be extremely disappointed to know that you are nothing but a student fantasing your property investment. In short BIG CANNON.</p>

              <p>Why dont I invite you to engage me on 1 to 1 discussion on the subject of a Temasek acquisition into ML and see who will be the first one to start talking like an 8 year old kid.</p>

                  If you are born stupid, you should just keep your stupidity to yourself instead of trying to spread it across the forum so that it will make you look "normal" in the eyes of others.
                  
                  I believe both LIES and Deerhunter have invited you to the shoutbox to clarify if what you claim is true. Unfortunately, you claim that you are able to create 10 different accounts on your own to chat at the SHOUTBOX all at the same time, which until today, you are unable to prove to us you could do that. So in short you are simply giving excuses after excuses to continue to believe in your little fantasy. 
                  
                  Please do us a favour, PM your God Mother, FIREICE and ask her to verfity if what you claimed is true. If not you should just shut the fuck up and stop behaving like a mad dog barking aimlessly in this thread.
