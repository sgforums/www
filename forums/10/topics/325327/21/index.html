              <p>    I just felt that if MM Lee could just retire for good without becoming minister mentor</p>
              <p>perhaps other minister could be given space to develop themselves. Coming back</p>
              <p>to investment made by GIC, if MM Lee is too busy with mentoring, perhaps he should</p>
              <p>give the deputy head of GIC to make decision on investment.</p>

              <p>The dividends are still considered as income to shareholders. When declaring income tax, these dividends are included, and any extra that has been paid in tax will be refunded, because usually income tax rate is lower than corporate tax rate.</p>

              <p>He's definitely not that smart. Saying that property price is a function of inflation (although he got confused and posted vice versa) does not equate at all to "property price depends solely on the variable inflation". This is simple secondary school maths which he seems not to understand at all, especially when he tells that property price depends on other factors. Gazelle self-pwnage once again.</p>
              <p>It's similar to saying that it is wrong to claim that the time taken by water to boil is a function of heat supplied, because it is also dependent on factors like pressure and impurities in the water =&gt; he just don't understand what is a function.</p>

              <p>Here, we were discussing about inflation and property price, so it is not wrong to say that property price is a function of inflation. The mathematical concept of a function is to express relationship and dependence between variables. Effectively, saying property price is a function of inflation merely means that there is a relationship and dependence between property price and inflation. It does not in any way says that it excludes other factors.</p>
              <p>Similarly, saying that Hamiltonian function is a function of time tells there is a relationship between Hamiltonian and time. Yes, it does not portray completely what it is, but it is not wrong to say that it is a function of time because, again, the mathematical concept of a function is to express relationship and dependence between variables; there's a relationship and dependence between the two.</p>
              <p>Let me give you a mathematical example.</p>
              <p>We can say that y = g(x,z), and f(x) = g(x,z).<br>This means y = f(x)</p>
              <p>Thus, it is also not wrong to say y = f(x)</p>

              <p>EAGLE, I am surprise that you even have the cheek to challenge me on that.. didnt you just give me the opportunity to show who is the biggest troll in this forum?</p>
