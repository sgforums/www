              <p>I attended a free workshop by Adam Khoo and conducted by this guy called Ron Ianieri. The basics of options were explained very clearly, but the intricate details, they say, need months to teach/learn.</p>
              <p>They did have an additional 3 nights online free webcast on him teaching more on trading, but then, I didn't hv time cuz it was my final exams.</p>

              <p>b) What coupon rate will be recommend to ensure that you bonds are fully subscribed?</p>
              <p>2) You claim that you predict that ML share price will fall from current level of US26 to US20 by Oct08 and under the condition of maintaining inflation level. So my question to you Mr. CEO is why you want to maintain inflation when you want banks share price to suffer? Isnt it better for inflation to rise and create havoc to the banking industry instead? Are you talking cock or what?</p>
              <p>3) I believe I have stated clearly that those are paper gain which are inmaterial for Temasek and only important to fools like you who like to praise yourself with your silly prediction just like AndrewPKyap.

              <p>&lt;Jim Rogers, who has traveled extensively in emerging markets
              and lives part of the year in Asia, says sovereign wealth funds in Abu
              Dhabi and Singapore that recently made large investments in failing US banks are likely to lose a lot of money on their ploys. "They're making a big
              mistake; these banks have many more problems still ahead. They should
              wait until these companies are really on the ropes a few years from now
              . . . and trading at $5 a share."</p>
              <p>But aren't they supposed to
              be the smart money? Maybe not. "I know these people, and they have
              never given me the impression that they're smarter than anyone else,"
              Rogers says. "They have gigantic amounts of money, but they've made a
              bad judgment in these cases."&gt;</p>
              <p>&lt;When asked whether he would take a big stake in Merrill or UBS late
              last year, Warren Buffet replied: " I don't see any value in those companies"&gt;</p>

              <p>Simply put, experts were saying " don't go, it's unsafe," bozos say " that's exactly the time to go in."</p>

              <p>A company can pay out share dividends to its shareholders. When the dividends are paid out, they are subject to an 18% corporate tax.</p>
              <p>The dividends are still considered as income to shareholders. When declaring income tax, these dividends are included, and any extra that has been paid in tax will be refunded, because usually income tax rate is lower than corporate tax rate.</p>

              <p>you mean sole proprietor can't change his business vehicle from sole proprietorship into partnership?</p>
              <p>sighs.</p>
              <p>your disagreement was, it is not possible for sole proprietor to give his wife half his shares in his business, so that he can reduce his tax charge.</p>
              <p>you really sound so pathetic now, arguing about the construction of the sentences, it's lame. when i wrote that statement i assumed that the company has been converted, that why i used company shares. the intention was to mean it was from a sole proprietorship converted to a partnership or company.</p>
              <p>so the issue is still, can the sole proprietor give 50% of his company to his wife?</p>

              <p><br>I guess we can add one more description to this troll</p>
              <p>extremely rigid</p>
              <p>No need to teach him anymore la. The faster minded would already have caught on to what you have just said. It's either our resident troll is slow minded, or he's just opposing for the sake of opposing</p>

              <p>first you ask me if i believe what eagle claim about logging into 10 accounts can be done.</p>
              <p>i told you yes.</p>
              <p>Next, i know you will ask me for proof and how he was able to do it therefore i teach you the method. and i even introduce you to this product call virtual PC which you can download for free and try it for yourself.</p>
              <p>but you choose not to believe it and  you even claim you could walk on air too.</p>
              <p>So, i ask you to read up on what a virtual PC can do and now you saying i have a lot of big talk.</p>
              <p>talk to you, you don't want to listen.</p>
              <p>teach you, you don't want to learn.</p>
              <p>ask you read up, you don't wan to believe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so who is living in denial now? microsoft for giving people fake product?</p>
