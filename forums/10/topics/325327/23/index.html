              <p>So u like to pick on small mistake like stock split, then can u tell me what is SP company's income hehe... Sole Proprietorship is sole proprietorship, company is company. Company has stocks but sole proprietorship dun, so I use stock split is kinda reasonable.</p>

              <p>As I have mentioned a Sole Proprietor Company is taxed though the owner personal income tax filing hence, it will be classified as personal income tax not company income tax.</p>
              <p>So what you claim is that by the end of the FY07, the only could switch the SP company over to a partnership and transfer 50% of your income from FY07 to the new partnership company shareholder and save on tax.</p>
              <p>That to me is rubbish!!</p>

              <p>As I have mentioned a Sole Proprietor Company is taxed though the owner personal income tax filing hence, it will be classified as personal income tax not company income tax.</p>
              <p>So what you claim is that by the end of the FY07, the only could switch the SP company over to a partnership and transfer 50% of your income from FY07 to the new partnership company shareholder and save on tax.</p>

              <p>Updated question:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The general question (principle) was, can a husband give his wife half his company (assuming future profits is $80,000) so that he can reduce his marginal tax rate of 5.375% to marginal tax rate of 2.25% for their future tax assessment?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">I admitted that the scenario was wrong, this is the updated scenario.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Only one simple question, which you OoOo aka Gazelle avoided and avoided.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Is this possible for a taxpayer to reduce his tax liability?</span></strong></p>

              <p>1) After all that talk about FRS 10.8 I am surprise that you didnt even use that to justify your arguement because isnt that the first TOOL you pull out to impress us?</p>
              <p>2) <strong>So now my question to you is, <span style="color: #ff0000;">how can you justify to IRAS to split</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">50% of the SP</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">company's</span> income</span></span> (or Personal income since its a SP company) with someone who never existed in the company during that last financial year?</strong></p>
              <p>As you can see, after realising that he has no FACTS to support what is said, he is now using what I call selective reading technique to create something out of nothing. Isnt it obvious that my statement about is talking about splitting 50% of <strong>INCOME</strong> and not splitting shares.</p>
              <p>And guess what, he is now using the word STOCK, as if the Sole Proprietor company has transform to be a public listed company....Kekeke..</p>
              <p>If you are color blind and you cant read text written in black, then I will forgive you for sprouting so much nonsense. However if you are doing this hoping that we are blind, then I must say that you are really pathatic.</p>

              <p>O o O o,</p>
              <p>U sure a not, there is something called post balance sheet event (FRS 10.8).</p>
              <p>If u don't know what is FRS, let me tell u. This is called the financial reporting standard of the Republic of Singapore.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FRS 10.8</span></strong></p>
              <p> a) Those that provide evidence of conditions that existed at the balance sheet date (adjusting events).</p>
              <p>An entity shall adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements to reflect adjusting events after the balance sheet date.</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Don't try to say balance sheet is only for "Company" and not "sole proprietorship or LLP". Because FRS is used to determine how much tax should IRAS draw from a self-employed.</p>
              <p>So long as the partnership's intent takes effect before the financial year 2007, the amount of taxable income will still be adjusted. So what u have try to argue has fallen prey to this FRS rule.  </p>
