              <p>question to those reading,</p>
              <p>Actually Merrill Lynch's source of funds is quite dubious, for a company lacking liquid funds, there are afew sources of funding available to it, but the two main source would be either 1) loans (bonds) or 2) equity from investors.</p>
              <p><strong>Looking at their annual report for 2007, it states:</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: MerrillDIN-Regular; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"In connection with the Temasek transaction, <strong>if Merrill Lynch sells or agrees to sell any common stock (or equity securities convertible </strong></span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: MerrillDIN-Regular; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>into commonstock) within one year of closing at a purchase</strong>, conversion or reference price per share less than $48.00, then it must make </span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: MerrillDIN-Regular; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">a payment to Temasek to compensate Temasek for the aggregate excess amount per share paid by Temasek, which is settled in cash or </span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: MerrillDIN-Regular; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">common stock at Merrill Lynch’s option."</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; "> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; "> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; "> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; "> </p>
              <p>Given that bond coupon rates are fixed and tax deductible. Bonds also carry less risk to investors due to the priority of payment in cases of bankruptcy, so therefore bond rates yield less returns as compared to equity share.</p>
              <p>Shares carry higher risk to investors, they partake in the profits and losses of the company. If there are losses, there is no need to pay dividends, whereas it is compulsory to pay bond coupons when it falls due. Failure to pay bond coupons would result in bond holders' filing claims against the company leading to bankruptcy order.</p>
              <p>When companies make public offering, they are also required to offer the same percentage that current shareholders hold for purchase, that is to maintain the current shareholding percentages. Else there would be changes in the control of shareholding in the company. From the news, it seems like Temasek took USD 3.4 billion of the USD 8.5 billion offered to investors. The only way that Temasek could have bought in excess of their current shareholding of less than 10% is, because other current shareholders have not taken up the offer by Merrill Lynch. Why have current shareholders not taken up the offer by Merrill Lynch? (Rhetorical Question, no replies needed)</p>

              <p>Maurizio13,</p>
              <p>After failing in trying to impress us with your little fantasy of market timing and brilliant investment strategy, you are now switching your role to become the CEO of ML talking about raising funds for the company..KEKEKEKE</p>
              <p>Since you suggest that you will issue bond instead of new shares to raise capital, I am sure you must have already taken into account of how to make your bond attractive so that it is not the underwritter who is going to end up holding them.</p>
              <p>So</p>
              <p>a) What do you think should be the coupon rate when you consider interest rate in US have already hit rock-bottom, depreciating US$, and global inflation is likely to interest rate around the world to rise?</p>
              <p>b) How are you going to convince Temasek or other SWFs to subscribe to ML bonds instead since most are more interested to acquire shareholding stakes?</p>
              <p>You can sell anything you want in your little dream and fantasy, however in the real world, the only person who will subscribe to it will be EAGLE. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p class="story">The United States remains firmly in an economic recession in spite of economic growth figures to the contrary, a leading economist has warned.</p>
              <p class="story">Merrill Lynch’s David Rosenberg, the first economist from a major bank to declare a US recession was underway back in early January, argues that recent unemployment figures show yet more evidence that the US economy is a deep recession.</p>
              <p class="story">Pointing to last week’s news that employment has now declined for six months in a row, Mr Rosenberg, Merrill’s chief North American economist, says that “at no time in the past 50 years has this happened without the economy being in an official recession.”</p>
              <div class="mpuad">The typical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth, something which the US has yet to have.</div>

              <p>b) A certain someone was talking about risk and rewards in the past. Shares more risk more rewards, bonds less risk less rewards. Whether someone buys bonds or shares is a subject of their risk appetites.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Investors are finally conceding that a global recession is on the horizon, if it is not here already, <strong>Merrill Lynch</strong>'s January survey of fund managers revealed.</p>
              <p>The survey showed 19 pct of respondents now believe a global recession is either likely or very likely over the next 12 months, while the percentage of those who feel a recession has already started doubled to 8 pct from 4 pct in December.</p>
              <p>This is a marked change from recent months, where investors had expressed fears of a slowdown rather than an outright recession.</p>
              <p>'The period of denial, by some investors, that the credit crunch could have serious repercussions for the real economy may be over,' said David Bowers, independent consultant to Merrill Lynch <strong></strong>(nyse: <a class="maintkrlink" href="http://finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/CIAtAGlance.jsp?tkr=MER"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">MER</span></span></a> - <a href="http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=MER"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">news </span></span></a>- <a href="http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&amp;name=&amp;ticker=MER"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">people </span></span></a>).</p>
              <p>'This month's survey shows an evolution of expectations from fears of a slowdown to fears of a major recession,' he said.</p>
              <p>Notably, whereas in previous months investors had consistently highlighted credit risk as the greatest threat to global stability, they are now perceiving business cycle risk to be equally significant.</p>
              <p>At the same time, the vast majority of fund managers expect corporate profit margins to shrink in 2008. A net 77 pct of those polled expect profits to grow by less than 10 pct in the next 12 months, compared with a net 66 pct in December and just 39 pct in October.</p>
              <p><strong>Although investors remain reluctant to switch away from their overweight stance on equities and underweight stance on bonds, there are clear signs that asset allocators are starting to make significant adjustments to reflect the risks to the global economy.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The number of asset allocators who are overweight equities tumbled to a net 6 pct in January from 20 pct in December, while the number who are underweight bonds fell to a net 28 pct from 40 pct in December.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>There has also been an 'aggressive shift' into cash over the past two months, with a net 32 pct of respondents overweight cash in January, compared with 26 pct in December and 20 pct in November.</strong></p>
              <p>Investors are particularly pessimistic about the outlook for Europe, where the strong euro and European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet's persistently hawkish stance on interest rates likely to be the main factors weighing on sentiment.</p>
              <p>A net balance of 80 pct of European fund managers expect the euro zone economy to weaken in 2008, while a net 80 pct also expect weaker earnings growth in the coming year, both the most bearish since the survey began over a decade ago. Only 4 pct are anticipating double-digit EPS growth in 2008.</p>
              <p>Notably, investors do not concur with Trichet's apparent conclusion that the risks of higher inflation outweigh the downside risks to the economy. Three months ago, Merrill's survey showed a net 36 pct of investors expected higher inflation in Europe in the coming year, but this has now fallen to zero. As a result, a net 28 pct believe monetary policy is too restrictive.</p>
              <p>'While arguments to be bullish on European equities persist, it is clear that investors are bracing themselves for a raft of earnings downgrades,' said Karen Olney, chief European equities strategist at Merrill Lynch.</p>
              <p>She noted, however, that the downside is limited, given that European markets have priced in earnings 'falling 57 pct of the way to the trough'.</p>
              <p>Accordingly, the survey showed investors have slashed their holdings in industrials to underweight and 'to levels consistent with the May 2006 period of panic', instead moving back into healthcare and oil and gas. They continue to be overweight on banks, which are still seen as a 'value trap', Merrill said.</p>
              <p>Financials and consumer discretionary (such as retail) are the only sectors recording a net underweight position in January, while the most overvalued sector is seen as global materials and the most undervalued is the pharmaceutical sector.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, on a regional basis, global emerging markets remain firmly in favour, with a net 17 pct of investors expecting to be overweight on the region over the coming 12 months. Emerging markets are also seen as the area where corporate profits are most favourable, with a net 47 pct of investors expressing this view.</p>

              <p>1) The problem about buying US$ bond is that for an investor, the income or interest is fixed, however you run a risk of losing that to desprciating US$, which for SWF like Temasek will be too risky unless the coupon rate is very attractive.</p>
              <p>So Mr. CEO of ML, what coupon rate do you think ML shoud offer for the bonds to ensure they will be fully subscribed?</p>
              <p>2) We are talking about inflation level not your "aggressive monetary expansion" (aka insurance to protect yourself from proven wrong).</p>
              <p>So can you explain to us, why while betting on ML share price to fall, you are hoping the inflation will maintain at the same time? Even to me (an average singaporean) it does sound contradicting and obvious that you might not even know what you are talking about. Am I right?</p>
              <p>3) The deal has already been signed, sealed and delivered, what option are you talking about? Somehow it is funny that you claim you could predict the market, while at the same time, you cant even get yourself update with latest news.</p>

              <p>1) You are giving yourself a US$7 trading band, which is about 26% margin based on yesterday trading price of US$26.

That my friend is a trading margin which is WIDER than what STI, DJIA, Nikkei, FTSE, KOSPI, HANGSENG have flunctuated over the past 12 months. Are you trying to be kiasu si boh?</p>
              <p>2)   Beside protecting yourself with averaging and wide trading margin, you also included unrealistic condition that there must be no <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">aggressive monetary expansion to stimulate the economy and inflation levels are maintained.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>Can I know is this is a new feature that you can select when you are short selling stocks over the X-change? And what is your meaning of AGGRESSIVE? e.g?</p>

Can I say it is US$20, since that is in the lower end of your prediction?</p>
              <p>As for your condition you stated in blue, I am very curious on why do you want to insist that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inflation level be maintained?</span> AFAIK, ML share price was trading at US$26 yesterday, (thats after they annouced they are getting rid of their TOXIC CDOs,) and you are betting that it will go to as low as US$20, which is a whopping 23%, down from yesterday closing price. Hence common sense will tell us that it should be in your interest to see inflation rising instead of maintaining, so that it will create more problem in the CDOs market which will result to more writedown for banks.  </p>

              <p><br>Maurizio13,</p>
              <p>I believe there are many question which is left being unanswered,</p>
              <p>1) Are you being KIASU by setting yourself such a  trading margin which is WIDER than what STI, DJIA, Nikkei, FTSE, KOSPI, HANGSENG have flunctuated over the past 12 months?</p>
              <p>2) Can I know if there is indeed an option that you can select when you are short selling stocks over the X-change. ie. you can indicated what are the condition to your trade e.g.<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> no </span></span><span style="COLOR: #0000ff"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="color: #0000ff;">aggressive</span> monetary expansion to stimulate the economy and inflation levels are maintained. </span></span></strong></p>

              </p><p><span style="COLOR: #0000ff"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><span style="color: #000000;">
              </span></span></span></p><p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">3) What is your definition of <strong>aggressive </strong>monetary expansion?</span></p>
              <span style="COLOR: #0000ff"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">
              <p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">4) How can you insist that inflation level is maintained when we all know that it will not because inflation is a moving target?</span></p>
              </span></span>
              <p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Since in the real world there is not such thing as setting economic conditions for your investment, will you allow me to take you on without those silly conditions?</p>

              <h4>U.S. corporate bond issuance sets April record</h4>
              <p>Fri Apr 18, 2008 10:31pm BST</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - U.S. high-grade corporate bond issuance hit a record in April as companies took advantage of improving market sentiment and strong investor demand for new deals.</p>
              <p>U.S. investment-grade corporate bond volume totaled $50.7 billion through April 18, according to research firm Dealogic. The previous record for this month was in April 2001, when companies sold $47.35 billion of high-quality debt.</p>
              <p>This week's issuance alone included a few marquee deals from a finance subsidiary of General Electric Co (GE.N: <a href="/stocks/quote?symbol=GE.N"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Quote</span></span></a>, <a href="/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=GE.N"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Profile</span></span></a>, <a href="/stocks/researchReports?symbol=GE.N"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Research</span></span></a>), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N: <a href="/stocks/quote?symbol=JPM.N"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Quote</span></span></a>, <a href="/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=JPM.N"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Profile</span></span></a>, <a href="/stocks/researchReports?symbol=JPM.N"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Research</span></span></a>), XTO Energy (XTO.N: <a href="/stocks/quote?symbol=XTO.N"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Quote</span></span></a>, <a href="/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=XTO.N"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Profile</span></span></a>, <a href="/stocks/researchReports?symbol=XTO.N"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Research</span></span></a>) and Lehman Brothers (LEH.N: <a href="/stocks/quote?symbol=LEH.N"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Quote</span></span></a>, <a href="/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=LEH.N"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Profile</span></span></a>, <a href="/stocks/researchReports?symbol=LEH.N"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Research</span></span></a>).</p>
              <p><strong>General Electric Capital Corp's $8.5 billion transaction was the fifth-largest U.S. corporate bond sale since 1995.</strong></p>
              <p><span id="midArticle_4"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Despite its jumbo size, the deal was oversubscribed and bonds traded up in the secondary market, prompting other issuers to follow suit</span></span>, said Jim Merli, managing director and global head of fixed income syndicate at Lehman Brothers, the lead bookrunner on GE Capital's deal.</strong></p>
              <p>"The market has a way of being self-fulfilling," Merli said. "The market felt better, therefore GE decided to do their transaction. The GE deal went so well that the market continued to improve and more clients decided to move forward with their deals. It feeds on itself."</p>
              <p>The credit market sentiment has been improving since late March after the Federal Reserve helped JPMorgan buy Bear Stearns &amp; Co BSC.N to save it from collapsing.</p>
              <p>The Fed's decision to give brokers the same access to liquidity that it provides commercial banks added weight to investors' viewpoint that the worst part of the credit crisis is over.  <span class='\"label\"'><strong><a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Continued...</span></span></a></strong></span></p>
