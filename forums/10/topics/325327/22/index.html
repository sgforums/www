              <p><strong>a) Even taking into consideration of FRS 10.8, how can you justify to IRAS you need to pay 50% of the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">company's profit</span></span> to someone who never exisit in your company during FY07? We are talking about a shareholder here, not some bad debts provision, WIP, stocks adjustment, assets reclassification etc</strong>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">You mean one cannot split his shares into various equal parts to his sons? wife? Even singapore television show got show father split his shares to his sons.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Is there a need to justify to IRAS about the stock transfer? Got then show link.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you have been reading with your eyes open, I am sure you wont be asking me such irrelevant question because I was never interest to know if you could split a sole proprietor company into partnerships with 10,000 shareholders and a zillion shares. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Since you claim to know so much about accounting and all that FRS, I am surprise that you are not aware the for a sole proprietor company IRAS doesnt tax your company's income but rather treat it as part of your personal income and is subject to the normal personal income tax (not corporate tax)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So my question to you again is, how can you justified to IRAS that you need to split your PERSONAL income (which is also your company income) with someone who never exist in your company in the last financial year?</span> </p>
              <p><strong> b) How would you do your income tax filing since, for Sole proprietor, you can only file through your personal income tax returns, while for a partnership company you must file through a Company Income tax returns which will send to the company seperately at the end of first financial year?</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Show me the link to substantiate your point that sole proprietor declare income tax via personal income tax and partnership declare income via company income tax.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">WAH for someone who can come here to tell me what is post balance sheets event, FRS10.8 etc, still have the cheek to ask me for the link? And the best part here is that, he didnt even realised that I have already posted the damn link for him. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So I guess your early comment was nothing more than some big talking huh? Or are you thinking that you could simply come here and walk all over me? </span></p>
              <span style="color: #000000;">
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I didn't jump into any conclusion. Open ur eyes big big and read what I comment. I merely doubt your sentence on "sole proprietorship switch to partnership" with FRS 10.8.</strong> </span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The only thing u can challenge me and any other forumers here is contradict FRS 10.8 principle which i use against u in the argument why one can evade tax liability by transfering shares</span>.</strong>   </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How could you not be jumping into conclusion when you dont even know that filing of income tax return for sole proprietor and partnership companies are different, and when this is the main issue with Maurizio13 suggestion of switching the company to a partnership to take advantage the lower taxes? Are you trying to act like some HERO by talking about something that is not related to what we are talking about here?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Since you are insisting that Maurizio13 suggestion is technically and legally possible, why dont you go straight to the point of answering my questions and concern instead of trying to <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>brag about your FRS 10.8</strong></span> </span> </p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you have been reading with your eyes open, I am sure you wont be asking me such irrelevant question because I was never interest to know if you could split a sole proprietor company into partnerships with 10,000 shareholders and a zillion shares.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Since you claim to know so much about accounting and all that FRS, I am surprise that you are not aware the for a sole proprietor company IRAS doesnt tax your company's income but rather treat it as part of your personal income and is subject to the normal personal income tax (not corporate tax)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So my question to you again is, how can you justified to IRAS that you need to split your PERSONAL income (which is also your company income) with someone who never exist in your company in the last financial year?</span> </p>
              <p><strong> b) How would you do your income tax filing since, for Sole proprietor, you can only file through your personal income tax returns, while for a partnership company you must file through a Company Income tax returns which will send to the company seperately at the end of first financial year?</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Show me the link to substantiate your point that sole proprietor declare income tax via personal income tax and partnership declare income via company income tax.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">WAH for someone who can come here to tell me what is post balance sheets event, FRS10.8 etc, still have the cheek to ask me for the link? And the best part here is that, he didnt even realised that I have already posted the damn link for him. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So I guess your early comment was nothing more than some big talking huh? Or are you thinking that you could simply come here and walk all over me?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I didn't jump into any conclusion. Open ur eyes big big and read what I comment. I merely doubt your sentence on "sole proprietorship switch to partnership" with FRS 10.8.</strong> </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The only thing u can challenge me and any other forumers here is contradict FRS 10.8 principle which i use against u in the argument why one can evade tax liability by transfering shares</span>.</strong>   </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How could you not be jumping into conclusion when you dont even know that filing of income tax return for sole proprietor and partnership companies are different, and when this is the main issue with Maurizio13 suggestion of switching the company to a partnership to take advantage the lower taxes? Are you trying to act like some HERO by talking about something that is not related to what we are talking about here?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Since you are insisting that Maurizio13 suggestion is technically and legally possible, why dont you go straight to the point of answering my questions and concern instead of trying to <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>brag about your FRS 10.8</strong></span> </span> </p>
