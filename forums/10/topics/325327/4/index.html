              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you want to look at housing prices versus inflation, you cannot take only 1 specific year and compare, take the historical price against inflation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In the past housing prices have been speculative in US, housing prices increase higher than the inflation rate, therefore prices of houses are extremely inflated. If you mark year to year of housing prices to inflation, at current levels the house prices are not supported, that's why prices corrected itself. But if you look at the figures provided, the growth rate of US housing prices far surpasses that of the inflation rate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Housing prices have been growing at an annualised rate of approximately 5.7%, but has CPI (inflation) increased at 5.7% every year? (A property bought in 1975 has increased to 6 times it's value in 32 years.) Go look at the CPI change column.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you had bought a house in 1975 and kept it till 2008, you will still have make gains against inflation. It's an effective hedge against inflation.</span></p>

              <p>You got your facts wrong again, it's not never invest, but to invest wisely taking into account the current and future economic situation.</p>
              <p>It's even possible to make profits in a bear market if you know how to.</p>
              <p>It's clear cut that government authorities who were never in the investing industry should never seek to make investment decisions. It's tantamount to asking a plumber to do a heart bypass surgery, doomed to failure and death.</p>

              <p>Judging from Temasek's past investments, it seems to be highly concentrated in a few sectors. Not sure how much diversification it has.</p>
              <p>A question lingers in my mind: Has Temasek been blinded by its pursuit for fat profits (by taking large bets in few companies) at the shareholder's (SG government's) expense?</p>

              <p>Maurizio, please take my advice and go back to school to learn about REAL economics and finance, instead of giving us all that stupid economics and finance theories which you cant back up with FACTS. I repeat <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">YOU CANT</span></strong>, back up with FACTS.</p>
              <p>Everytime when you are confronted with facts you will always end up asking me to check with this and that, e.g. IRAS, Big 4 accounting firms, and misquoting and abusing research articles to repackage your bullshit.</p>
              <p>Like I said before, I have already lost the thrill and excitement of making a fool out of you in this forum and I am sure many other forummers who have been reading what you post will know that you are only empty vessel trying to look "statistically smart" by using all sort of distorted statistic and misquote.</p>

              <p>Your reply was equivalent to me stating, "water does not
                  necessarily boil at 100 degrees celsius" and you saying "water as a
                  liquid has a density of 1 ton per meter cube". Alot like me talking
                  about the sun and you rebutting me telling me about the moon. You
                  should also write an email to the Associate Professor Dr. Sing Tien
                  Foo of Real Estate Studies in NUS, tell him that real estates
                  are not good hedges against inflation. His email is <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:rststf@nus.edu.sg">rststf@nus.edu.sg</a>.</p>

              <p>He's definitely not that smart. Saying that property price is a function of inflation (although he got confused and posted vice versa) does not equate at all to "property price depends solely on the variable inflation". This is simple secondary school maths which he seems not to understand at all, especially when he tells that property price depends on other factors. Gazelle self-pwnage once again.</p>
              <p>It's similar to saying that it is wrong to claim that the time taken by water to boil is a function of heat supplied, because it is also dependent on factors like pressure and impurities in the water =&gt; he just don't understand what is a function.</p>

              <p>Maurizio, please take my advice and go back to school to learn about REAL economics and finance, instead of giving us all that stupid economics and finance theories which you cant back up with FACTS. I repeat <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">YOU CANT</span></strong>, back up with FACTS.</p>
              <p>Everytime when you are confronted with facts you will always end up asking me to check with this and that, e.g. IRAS, Big 4 accounting firms, and misquoting and abusing research articles to repackage your bullshit.</p>
              <p>Like I said before, I have already lost the thrill and excitement of making a fool out of you in this forum and I am sure many other forummers who have been reading what you post will know that you are only empty vessel trying to look "statistically smart" by using all sort of distorted statistic and misquote.</p>

              <p>Here, we were discussing about inflation and property price, so it is not wrong to say that property price is a function of inflation. The mathematical concept of a function is to express relationship and dependence between variables. Effectively, saying property price is a function of inflation merely means that there is a relationship and dependence between property price and inflation. It does not in any way says that it excludes other factors.</p>
              <p>Similarly, saying that Hamiltonian function is
                  a function of time tells there is a relationship between Hamiltonian and time. Yes, it does not portray completely what it is, but it is not wrong to say that it is a function of time because, again, the mathematical concept of a function is to express relationship and dependence between variables; there's a relationship and dependence between the two.</p>
              <p>Let me give you a mathematical example.</p>
              <p>We can say that y = g(x,z), and f(x) = g(x,z).<br>This means y = f(x)</p>
              <p>Thus, it is also not wrong to say y = f(x)</p>

              <p>Oh dear, I did not say u are wrong but rather incomplete.</p>
              <p>1stly, a function is sufficient condition to ensure relationship. A relation is neccesarry condition for function but not sufficient though.</p>
              <p>So, it is really incomplete to say that a function is a function of "x" say if other variables are also of importance.</p>
              <p>From ur post about temperature of water, pressure and stuff are equally important physical variables.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">y = g(x,z), and f(x) = g(x,z).</span>means y = f(x) is correct only if "z" is not an explicit variable or the set "x" is capable of spanning the set "z" . In short, if 2 variables are independent, then it must be explicitly stated to give the true image.</p>
              <p>And pressure cannot be span by the basis of "heat supplied" set. That is why I say there is a need for greater clarification.</p>
              <p>BTW, this are not of importance now...I am way digressing too much. Sorry...</p>
