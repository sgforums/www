              <p>Oh dear, I did not say u are wrong but rather incomplete.</p>
              <p>1stly, a function is sufficient condition to ensure
              relationship. A relation is neccesarry condition for function but
              not sufficient though.</p>
              <p>So, it is really incomplete to say that a function is a function
              of "x" say if other variables are also of importance.</p>
              <p>From ur post about temperature of water, pressure and stuff are
              equally important physical variables.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">y = g(x,z), and f(x) =
              g(x,z).</span>means y = f(x) is correct only if "z" is not an
              explicit variable or the set "x" is capable of spanning the set "z"
              . In short, if 2 variables are independent, then it must be
              explicitly stated to give the true image.</p>
              <p>And pressure cannot be span by the basis of "heat supplied" set.
              That is why I say there is a need for greater clarification.</p>
              <p>BTW, this are not of importance now...I am way digressing too
              much. Sorry...</p>

              <p>1) The NUS Professor (Real Estate) did a study on the effects of Inflation on Real Estate. The relationship is between Inflation and Real Estate Hedging.</p>
              <p>2) It's probable that other things could have affected the price of real estate, such as political climate, scarcity building materials, cost of land, cost of property tax, weather, health conditions, availability of fashion, variety of entertainment, ease of transportation, environmental issues, etc. But in Social Science, it's hard to hold all these variables constant and manipulate a single variable to test it's impact, so we have to make certain assumptions.</p>
              <p>3) Yes. Property prices could be affected by temporal changes in demand and supply, but isn't it logical that if demand and supply varies (ceterus paribus), it will regress to it's mean (or average) in time.</p>
              <p>4) It's not wrong to say that the price of rice is affected by the supply of rice in the market, although the price of rice could be also affected by the money supply and consumer's attitude towards rice.</p>

              <p>1) The NUS Professor (Real Estate) did a study on the effects of
              Inflation on Real Estate. The relationship is between Inflation and
              Real Estate Hedging.</p>
              <p>2) It's probable that other things could have affected the price
              of real estate, such as political climate, scarcity building
              materials, cost of land, cost of property tax, weather, health
              conditions, availability of fashion, variety of
              entertainment, ease of transportation, environmental issues,
              etc. But in Social Science, it's hard to hold all these variables
              constant and manipulate a single variable to test it's impact, so
              we have to make certain assumptions.</p>
              <p>3) Yes. Property prices could be affected by temporal changes in
              demand and supply, but isn't it logical that if demand and supply
              varies (ceterus paribus), it will regress to it's mean (or average)
              in time.</p>
              <p>4) It's not wrong to say that the price of rice is affected by
              the supply of rice in the market, although the price of rice could
              be also affected by the money supply and consumer's attitude
              towards rice.</p>

              <p>Sure, lets talk about logic.</p>
              <p>Singapore current inflation is (x) 7% and Q208 private property price grew at a rate of (y) 0.2%. So based on your believe that <span style="COLOR: #000000">y = g(x,z), and f(x) = g(x,z).</span>means y = f(x) and it is guranteed by laws of mathematics, can I know what will be your investment decision to hedge against inflation? Would you invest in property?</p>
              <p><em></em>Or you need to figure out what are the 10 or 20 variable beside x and y?</p>
              <p>Academic maths are static, investment and economic conditions are dynamic, so please dont try to impress me with you maths when we are talking about economic.</p>

              <p>Sure, lets talk about logic.</p>
              <p>Singapore current inflation is (x) 7% and Q208 private property price grew at a rate of (y) 0.2%. So based on your believe that <span style="color: #000000;">y = g(x,z), and f(x) = g(x,z).</span>means y = f(x) and it is guranteed by laws of mathematics, can I know what will be your investment decision to hedge against inflation? Would you invest in property?</p>
              <p>Or you need to figure out what are the 10 or 20 variable beside x and y?</p>
              <p>Academic maths are static, investment and economic conditions are dynamic, so please dont try to impress me with you maths when we are talking about economic.</p>

              <p>Like I said before, you need to take it's housing price from inception and the rate of inflation from that period, make a historical comparison.</p>
              <p>It's stupid to do a specific period comparison. e.g. If I have a restaurant, the business for today was bad $0 sales. Am I suppose to use the figure today to justify my current year's profit?</p>
              <p>Sighs.</p>
              <p>Housing prices after successive periods of high growth will correct itself.</p>
