              <p>Pg 38...."The most important thing to note is that validity is a property of a<span style="color: #ff0000;">rgument forms."</span></p>
              <p>Pg 30...teaches u about truth tables and argument forms.</p>
              <p>Pg 33 ...teaches rules of inference.</p>
              <p>last but not least...pg41-43  some exercises for u to practice to convince urself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U see...I can dont know the truth of ur variables..ur premises. But from ur argument FORM... we can with certainty guranteed by mathematics to tell u that a certain form of argument is of wrong logic.</p>
              <p>The words lie in "ARGUMENT FORM".</p>

              <p>How do mathematicans prove theorems??? They<span style="color: #ff0000;"> do not even need to know</span> what it is talking about. They just use law of deduction reasoning..correct argument forms.</p>
