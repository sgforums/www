              <p>Sure, lets talk about logic.</p>
              <p>Singapore current inflation is (x) 7% and Q208 private
              property price grew at a rate of (y) 0.2%. <span style="color: #ff0000;">So based on
              your believe that </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">y = g(x,z), and
              f(x) = g(x,z).means y = f(x)</span> and it is guranteed by laws of
              mathematics, can I know what will be your investment
              decision to hedge against inflation? Would you invest in
              property?</p>
              <p>Or you need to figure out what are the 10 or
              20 variable beside x and y?</p>
              <p>Academic maths are static, investment and economic
              conditions are dynamic, so please dont try to impress me with you
              maths when we are talking about economic.</p>

              <p>Dont get me wrong and dont put words in my mouth. I never said what was highlighted red. I said if f(x) can be used to represent y, then z must be a variable dependent on x and the space containing z can be span by the basis of the space of x.</p>
              <p>Dont duan4 zhang1 qu3 yi4.  I said law of mathematics in logic can gurantee a certain form of argument is logically correct, not in governing dynamics. Governing dynamics is a tough area of research.</p>
              <p>I have never even state any comment about me bing an expert in real estate etc...in fact in my earlier post , I declare myself as a noob in real estate.</p>

              <p>Sigh....u are again taking only parts of ur post....refer to the post I have point out the logical error.</p>
              <p>Again
              u dont  understand my point of view. I am not saying WHICH VARIABLES
              ARE WRONG!!!!! I am only saying u cannot use the fact the existence of
              other variables to discredit the existence of a possible variable. Urs
              is an economic qns while what I am correcting u is a mathematical one.</p>
              <p>FYI,
              u need to brush up ur O level math. "y is a function of x" so
              "inflation is a function of property price" means Property price is a
              parameter( so call x) of inflation.</p>
              <p>What u implied in red is
              opposite of the statement u are saying....u are saying inflation now is
              the parameter or the so called variable.</p>
              <p>With such mediocre
              understanding in basic math, please stop arguing using precise words
              such as "function, variables etc" It only exposes ur lack of
              understanding in them.</p>

              <p>Maybe we could look at page B32 in today's MyPaper. It explains that people who like to throw insults frequently are insecure, and need to do that to feel some sort of security.</p>
              <p>What else can explain the fact that this troll, even after getting banned multiple times, registers a new nick again to come here to throw insults one after another. His main purpose is not discussion, but as he have said, to make others look like a fool because it is , even though he has never succeeded.</p>

              <p>Listen....since u accuse me of showing off and uses such crude
              words on me...I shall not refrain myself.</p>
              <p>Ur Fuc k ing result in O level shows how much ur intelligence
              is....ur A math sucks and yet u branch into econs where true
              economists spend years to polish their mathematical modelling
              skills.</p>
              <p>I am FUC KING telling u that ur STUPID ARGUMENT IS OF WRONG
              LOGICAL FORM. And because of that u cannot use that to discredit a
              potential variable. And hence not fair for ppl to swallow ur
              argument.</p>
              <p>Who are u to tell ppl to accept arguments that are flawed
              logically?? Instead, u should give cases to suggest that certain
              potential varaibles are wrong, not by the existence of other
              variables...</p>
              <p>If ur argument is logically wrong....I wonder how are u going to
              convince ppl to invest????</p>
              <p>If u wish me to speak to u in a manner of an ah beng ...I am
              more than capable....show ppl some respect if u want ppl to respect
              U!!!!!!</p>
