              <p>Isnt it obvious that my statement about is talking about splitting 50% of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">INCOME</span></strong> and not splitting shares.</p>
              <p>And guess what, he is now using the word STOCK, as if the Sole Proprietor has transform to be a public listed company..</p>
              <p>And btw, the term <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stock Split</span> is different from splitting shareholding and you need to get your FACTS right before coming here to big talk and make a fool out of yourself.</p>

              <p>However if you are doing this hoping that we are blind, then I must say that you are really pathatic. I REPEAT, PATHETIC, especially coming from someone who talk so big about Financial Reporting Standards lah, Busines Law lah, NTU lah, Headhunted by international banks lah.

              <p> </p>
              <p>Uncertain,</p>
              <p>1) After all that talk about FRS 10.8 I am surprise that you didnt even use that to justify your arguement. Isnt that the first  <strong>TOOLS</strong> you pull out to "impress" us?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">2) This is the <strong>exact</strong> statement I made,</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #000080;">So now my question to you is, how can you justify for IRAS to split <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000080;">50% of the SP</span></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">company's</span> income</strong></span></span> (<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">or Personal income</span></span></strong> since its a SP company) with someone who never existed in the company during that last financial year?</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As you can see, after realising that he has no FACTS to support what he said, he is now using what I call selective highlighting and reading technique to <strong>TWIST and</strong> <strong>CHANGE</strong> what I am saying just to create something out of nothing.</p>
              <p>Isnt it obvious that my statement about is talking about splitting 50% of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">INCOME</span></strong> and not splitting shares.</p>
              <p>And guess what, he is now using the word STOCK, as if the Sole Proprietor has transform to be a public listed company..</p>
              <p>And btw, the term <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stock Split</span> is different from splitting shareholding and you need to get your FACTS right before coming here to big talk and make a fool out of yourself.</p>
              <p>If you are bloody color blind and you cant read text written in black, then I will forgive you for sprouting so much nonsense.</p>
              <p>However if you are doing this hoping that we are blind, then I must say that you are really pathatic. I REPEAT, PATHETIC, especially coming from someone who talk so big about Financial Reporting Standards lah, Busines Law lah, NTU lah, Headhunted by international banks lah. All that are simply <span style="text-decoration: underline;">desperate</span> attempt to glorify himself without knowing that it make him look like a <strong>bloody wanker</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">SO MR. WANKER, TELL ME WHICH PART OF MY STATEMENT TALK ABOUT <span style="text-decoration: underline;">STOCK OR SHARE SPLIT?</span>        </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PLEASE ANSWER ME, YOU PATHETIC FOOL!!</span></span></strong></p>
