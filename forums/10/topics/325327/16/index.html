              <p>Maurizio, I am not sure if I should feel proud of you for taking up the challenge or should I be sad to see you making a fool out of yourself again by setting chidlish and unrealistic conditions just to show people that you CAN predict the market.</p>
              <p>1) You are giving yourself a US$7 trading band, which is about 26% margin based on yesterday trading price of US$26. On top of that you are using AVERAGING to measure your prediction, which means that potentially even if ML stock price trade as high as US$30.50 to as low as US$16.50, you will still have a good chance of being mathematically correct. That my friend is a trading margin which is WIDER than what STI, DJIA, Nikkei, FTSE, KOSPI, HANGSENG have flunctuated over the past 12 months. Are you trying to be kiasu si boh?</p>
              <p>2)   Beside protecting yourself with averaging and wide trading margin, you also included unrealistic condition that there must be no <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">aggressive monetary expansion to stimulate the economy and inflation levels are maintained.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>Can I know is this is a new feature that you can select when you are short selling stocks over the X-change? And what is your meaning of AGGRESSIVE? e.g?</p>
              <p>As an investor, I really dont see a point in talking about stock price without making a decision to buy or sell, so my  question to you is, if you are an investor like Temasek, can you tell us what is your target price to buy into ML from now to Oct08? Can I say it is US$20, since that is in the lower end of your prediction?</p>
              <p>As for your condition you stated in blue, I am very curious on why do you want to insist that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inflation level be maintained?</span> AFAIK, ML share price was trading at US$26 yesterday, (thats after they annouced they are getting rid of their TOXIC CDOs,) and you are betting that it will go to as low as US$20, which is a whopping 23%, down from yesterday closing price. Hence common sense will tell us that it should be in your interest to see inflation rising instead of maintaining, so that it will create more problem in the CDOs market which will result to more writedown for banks.  </p>
              <p>So Maurizio, can you explain to us the purpose behind maintaining inflation level?</p>

              <p><br>1) It's still below the USD 26 currently trade price. If you can give me a better price, then state your claims. You don't have the guts to take up the bet just say so. We will understand.</p>
              <p>2) If you don't understand expansionistic monetary policy, what more you want me to do. Teach you again? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> You need to go back to school to learn.</p>
              <p>Target price like any investor is .........the lower the better. A redundant question, as if Temasek can set buying price, you sure your maths got A and B? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Maurizio, I believe you should stop abusing the name of Warren Buffett like you know about his investment philosophy inside out.</p>
              <p>Warren Buffett is an investor that only go for long term investment, hence to him stock price flunctuation will not affect his long term strategy.</p>
              <p>I believe I have quote the below artcle and a quote from the man himself.</p>
              <p><strong>“I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span> have the faintest idea what the stock market is going to do in the next six months, or the next year, or the next two.”</strong></p>

              <p>If his investment strategy is about timing the market, then I am sure he would have sold his entired investment portfolio to take advantage of his ability to time the market isnt it?</p>
              <p>Maurzio, please stop contaminate the minds of other forumer here, because it seems to me that despite the fact that you have contradict yourself so many time, some fools here will be regards you are "Warren Buffett" of Speakers Corner.</p>

              <p><br>Maurizio, on paper, Temasek is already sitting on a profit with ML investment because after the recent new share issue, Temasek have managed to reduce their average cost from US$48 to US$21 and the stock price was trading at US$25-6 yesterday.

              <p>1) You have already been proven wrong that Temasek will be better off not talking up the deal in Dec07 because today, they are now seating on paper profit with an average cost of US$21 per share</p>
              <p>2) There is a reason why I asked your for eg? thats because I honestly doubt you know what the hell you are talking about when you said <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>aggressive monetary expansion to stimulate the economy.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>I bet you must have been doing quite alot of reading in the past hour didnt you?</p>
              <p>What you are simply doing is trying to use such vague conditions like this to protect yourself in case the average ML share price is outside your 20-27 range in Oct08</p>
              <p>Am I correct you little fool? kekeke</p>

              <p>Maurizio,</p>
              <p>Just to show how deperate you are, you actually took one of the <a href="http://www.warrenbuffettnewsletter.com/WBNNewsletterAug07.pdf"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sample</span></strong> </a>newsletter which has the word market timing update to tell us the Warren buffett investment strategy is about markting timing. Where in the article did he mentioned about a specific stocks or price, like your little fantasy prediction?</p>
              <p>If he is an investor who believes in market timing, then why is his company is still holding on billions worth of stocks when he was certain that its share price will go down? Why is he so stupid not to sell them and buy it back at a cheaper price?</p>
