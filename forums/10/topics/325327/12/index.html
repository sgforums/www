              <p>This is a true story..<br> <br> There was once I went to a friend's place to check out his new
              audio system..Â…..my friend was staying in the nice apartment
              together with his sister (who is Singapore supermodel <img title="Wink" src="http://politics.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink"> ) and parents, who were away on that dayÂ…Â….....when I
              first arrive, nobody was there accept for my friendÂ….....then at
              about 10.30 in the eveningÂ…......this tall, gorgeous looking girl
              walks inÂ…that was the first time that I see his sister in
              person...Â….she was stunning, wearing this worn out jeans and white
              T-shirt....Â…..she was very friendly and sat down with us for about
              15 mins before going to her room to take her showerÂ…Â…Â….(her sister
              room is actually linked to the common toilet that I have been using
              before she came back)Â…Â…..and after about 20minsÂ…..Â….her sister open
              the toilet doorÂ…..and I quickly make my way to the toilet cause I
              need to pee badlyÂ…. <img title="Embarassed" src="http://politics.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed"><br> <br> When I was enjoying my peeÂ…Â…Â….I was shock to see sometime lying on
              the laundry basket cover <img title="Shocked" src="http://politics.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked"> Â…..it was my friend sister's used panties and
              bra...she just remove a few minutes agoÂ…and you can see that the
              stain on it is still wet....(must have forgotten that I am in the
              house)Â…..when I see thatÂ…....my heart start to pump in double quick
              timeÂ…and without much thinking........my hands went straight down
              to reach for itÂ…Â…..the panties that I was holding is white in
              color......and it comes with some yellowish stain Â…...Â…while I am
              holding itÂ….....my mind was trying to picture her supermodel face
              together with the pantiesÂ…Â….man it was really mind blowÂ…...then I
              start to smell itÂ…Â….. <img title="Rolling Eyes" src="http://politics.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes"><br> <br> I know it might sound sick and crazyÂ…Â…Â…but the curiosity of knowing
              how a supermodel pu$$y smells like is just irresistible.<br> <br> Any one have the similar experience before?</p>

              <p><br>You can quote all you want, but facts of the case is, I was right about the impending drop due to sub prime effects on financial institutions.</p>
              <p>Facts of the case is, I said it was a bad time to buy in Dec 2007, it would be a better time to buy at the end of Dec 2008 when prices have stabilized.</p>

              <p>Jim Rogers, a former partner of George Soros in the famed Quantum Fund.<br><br>The fund manager, who has traveled extensively in emerging markets and lives part of the year in Asia, says sovereign wealth funds in Abu Dhabi and Singapore that recently made large investments in Citigroup and UBS AG (UBS, news, msgs) <span style="color: red;">are likely to lose a lot of money on their ploys</span>. "They're making a big mistake; these banks have many more problems still ahead. They should wait until these companies are really on the ropes a few years from now . . . and trading at $5 a share."<br><br>But aren't they supposed to be the smart money? Maybe not. "I know these people, <strong>and they have never given me the impression that they're smarter than anyone else</strong>," Rogers says.

                      You can quote all you want, but facts of the case is, I was right
                      about the impending drop due to sub prime effects on financial
                      institutions.</p>
                      <p>Facts of the case is, I said it was a bad time to buy in Dec
                      2007, it would be a better time to buy at the end of Dec 2008 when
                      prices have stabilized.</p>
                      <p>Some people can see the market, whereas others like you
                      can't.</p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p>Jim Rogers, a former partner of George Soros in the famed
                      Quantum Fund.<br>
                      <br>
                      The fund manager, who has traveled extensively in emerging markets
                      and lives part of the year in Asia, says sovereign wealth funds in
                      Abu Dhabi and Singapore that recently made large investments in
                      Citigroup and UBS AG (UBS, news, msgs) <span style="color: red;">are likely to lose a lot of money on their
                      ploys</span>. "They're making a big mistake; these banks have many
                      more problems still ahead. They should wait until these companies
                      are really on the ropes a few years from now . . . and trading at
                      $5 a share."<br>
                      <br>
                      But aren't they supposed to be the smart money? Maybe not. "I know
                      these people, <strong>and they have never given me the impression
                      that they're smarter than anyone else</strong>," Rogers says. "They
                      have gigantic amounts of money, but they've made a bad judgment in
                      these cases."</p>

                      You might want to know that timing the market is one of the biggest mistake that people always do in stocks trading, because it is as good as gambling. 
              
              If you claim you know what you are talking about, then how could you compare Temasek investment approach to high risk gambling, like timing the market? Are you shooting yourself in the feet and walking on your hands at the same time?
                      
                      beside that, we already have a AndrewPKyap in this forum to give us market prediction, do we need another one here? hahah..
                      
                      Like any armchair critics, it is always easy to say I predicted this and that but when being asked a simply question like, do you think ML stock price will be up or down in 3 months time and when is the best time to buy. You will say, it depends on this, that and bla bla bla. 
                      
                      Am I right? Or do you want to give it a shot?
                      
                      In case you dont know, are you aware that Temasek did have a capital protection clause in their earlier investment in ML, which is offered only to them and not any tom dick and harry who pick up ML stock from the exchange. 
                      
                      I have read it briefly, you might want to find out more information about that and tell us what is your comment.

              <p>Are they managing a fund equivalent to George Soro's Quantum Fund?</p>
              <p>The difference between gambling and investing is investing uses information to gain an advantage, whereas gambling you just go in to punt (like what Temasek did).</p>
              <p>Facts of the case is still, it is cheaper to buy Merrill Lynch now than it was to buy in December 2007. Why? Because of the sub prime crisis unraveling itself in 2008.</p>

              Jojo, as I have said before, in order to the challenge to be effective, it is important that we have a common understanding of what you are saying because my experience tells me that empty vessel in this forum will end up twisting the meaning of the words to get themselve out of the challenge. 
              
              So I am asking you,
              
              Am I right to say that, you are claiming that in Singapore all property price will sink together and in USA the property market will not?

              <p><br>ho ching is kaki lang, won't be sack one, therefore no accountability.</p>
              <p>anyway no need for them to be accountable, as Temasek receives it's funds from MAS. CPF deposited all it's funds with MAS, therefore there is no direct link.</p>

              <p><br> Jojo, as I have said before, in order to the challenge to be
                  effective, it is important that we have a common understanding of
                  what you are saying because my experience tells me that empty
                  vessel in this forum will end up twisting the meaning of the words
                  to get themselve out of the challenge. So I am asking you, Am I
                  right to say that, you are claiming that in Singapore all property
                  price will sink together and in USA the property market will
                  not?</p>

              <p>Hey you.. empty vessels... you say I lie about my properties.. PROVE IT !!</p>
              <p>How dare you accuse me of lying.. you better prove it.. or you're just a dumbshit empty vessels going around slandering people.</p>

              <p>PROVE IT !!!!</p>
              <p>So am I right to say that you disagree with my statement about the sinking ship part ? What is your theory then , if you have any ?</p>
              <p>You're simply too stupid to act smart anyway.... come come amuse me with your .. lowly intelligence. .. bwahahahhah !!!</p>
