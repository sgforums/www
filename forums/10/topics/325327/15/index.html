              <p>Changing of nickname is something that is beyond my control because there is an invisible hand that is trying to prevent me from exposing the nonsense post by the forummers here. So if FireIce decided that she wants to protect the interest and reputation for people like Eagle, whom she actively engaged in tuition activities, she will banned me.</p>
              <p>Instead of trying to crawl yourself out of the situation, why dont you just take up the challenge and say OK, I will post what you said I should post and let me get on with proving you wrong.</p>
              <p>Jojo, I am sure many people are waiting on the side line for you to say YES. and I am sure it will be in their interest to know that if indeed you are a liar.  </p>

              <p>Maurizio, I am not sure if I should feel proud of you for taking up the challenge or should I be sad to see you making a fool out of yourself again by setting chidlish and unrealistic conditions just to show people that you CAN predict the market.</p>
              <p>1) You are giving yourself a US$7 trading band, which is about 26% margin based on yesterday trading price of US$26. On top of that you are using AVERAGING to measure your prediction, which means that potentially even if ML stock price trade as high as US$30.50 to as low as US$16.50, you will still have a good chance of being mathematically correct. That my friend is a trading margin which is WIDER than what STI, DJIA, Nikkei, FTSE, KOSPI, HANGSENG have flunctuated over the past 12 months. Are you trying to be kiasu si boh?</p>
              <p>2)   Beside protecting yourself with averaging and wide trading margin, you also included unrealistic condition that there must be no <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">aggressive monetary expansion to stimulate the economy and inflation levels are maintained.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>Can I know is this is a new feature that you can select when you are short selling stocks over the X-change? And what is your meaning of AGGRESSIVE? e.g?</p>
              <p>As an investor, I really dont see a point in talking about stock price without making a decision to buy or sell, so my  question to you is, if you are an investor like Temasek, can you tell us what is your target price to buy into ML from now to Oct08? Can I say it is US$20, since that is in the lower end of your prediction?</p>
              <p>As for your condition you stated in blue, I am very curious on why do you want to insist that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inflation level be maintained?</span> AFAIK, ML share price was trading at US$26 yesterday, (thats after they annouced they are getting rid of their TOXIC CDOs,) and you are betting that it will go to as low as US$20, which is a whopping 23%, down from yesterday closing price. Hence common sense will tell us that it should be in your interest to see inflation rising instead of maintaining, so that it will create more problem in the CDOs market which will result to more writedown for banks.  </p>
              <p>So Maurizio, can you explain to us the purpose behind maintaining inflation level?</p>

              <p><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">2) Market timing is not for everybody, it's definitely not for people like you, who have insufficient knowledge and information. If your investment philosophy is the same as Warren Buffett or George Soros, then I guess you would have been a billionaire right now won't you. There is a difference between timing the bottom of the market and predicting the market (whether share prices will be substantially lower) based on economic fundamentals. The same person whom you quote, also made this prediction in 2007. It's not possible to predict the exact location of the stock market exactly, but it is possible to predict the general movement of the market based on leading indicators. If what you said is true, then those information that intelligent investors rely on would be redundant, everybody should just be like you, grab any investment and hold it forever. Geez! I think you qualify to be a portfolio manager now, given that there is nothing to distinguish you and Warren Buffett. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> You had basic knowledge from your Marketing Degree course, so don't purport to be be an expert in finance. So were you long or short in equities from 2007 to present?</span></p>

              <p>Maurizio, I believe you should stop abusing the name of Warren Buffett like you know about his investment philosophy inside out.</p>
              <p>Warren Buffett is an investor that only go for long term investment, hence to him stock price flunctuation will not affect his long term strategy.</p>
              <p>I believe I have quote the below artcle and a quote from the man himself.</p>
              <p><strong>“I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span> have the faintest idea what the stock market is going to do in the next six months, or the next year, or the next two.”</strong></p>
              <div>Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway</div>
              <p><a href="http://www.fivecentnickel.com/2008/03/25/investment-insights-market-timing">http://www.fivecentnickel.com/2008/03/25/investment-insights-market-timing</a></p>
              <p>If his investment strategy is about timing the market, then I am sure he would have sold his entired investment portfolio to take advantage of his ability to time the market isnt it?</p>
              <p>Maurzio, please stop contaminate the minds of other forumer here, because it seems to me that despite the fact that you have contradict yourself so many time, some fools here will be regards you are "Warren Buffett" of Speakers Corner.</p>

If they don't raise the required capital (Temasek had effectively shackled itself to Merrill Lynch, they can't don't exercise the option to purchase the shares, else they will lose more) assuming that no investors are bullish about the prospects of Merrill Lynch, then the shares will definitely drop further.</span></span></span></p>

              <p>Maurizio, before I go on to explain to you about why what you said will not work in real world, can you please tell us if you have any real life experience in stock trading and do you personally have a stock trading account with any broker in Singapore.</p>
              <p>1) On Wednesday, when the market heard that Temasek is exploring the possibility of acquiring the remaining stake in SCS, its share price surge from S$0.85 to S$1.08, which is 27% rise and trading was suspended. And that is exactly what I have been trying to tell you that such billion dollar deal like ML, Citi of UBS can never be done in the open market and they have to be arranged privately.  <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/268062.asp">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/268062.asp</a></p>
              <p>Hence based on the same principle, it will be wrong to say that Temasek can still acquire the a stake in ML at a cheaper price if the pass the opportunity in Dec07 in the OPEN MARKET </p>
              <p>2) Contrary to what you have been saying about how stupid is Temasek investment in ML, Temasek has managed to reduced their average ML share cost from US$48 to US$21 because of the capital protection clause when I mentioned earlier.</p>
              <p>So Maurzio, are you still going to continue to tell us that Maurizio13 &amp; Co is still the smarter investor?</p>

              <p><br>Maurizio, on paper, Temasek is already sitting on a profit with ML investment because after the recent new share issue, Temasek have managed to reduce their average cost from US$48 to US$21 and the stock price was trading at US$25-6 yesterday. And like I said, these are paper gain, which are important to only people like Maurizio13.</p>
