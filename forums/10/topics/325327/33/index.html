              <p>1. Those who believe the conclusions drawn by what TS posted and what A_drewyap posted obviously don't know what the fu ck Temasek (T) is doing. T increased their stake in Merrill Lync(ML), with US$3.5 billion. Of this US$3.5 billion, US$2.5 billion came from ML themselves, with T paying only close to $1billion. ML is actually compensating T for the loss that T didn't make when T invested in them initially. When T sign the purchase agreement with ML, there is a clause that says that is if T were to issue you equity shares later on, you have to compensate us an amount, which in this case, equals to US$3.5 billion.</p>
              <p>So for those who understand what I'm talking about, do you really really think GIC/Temasek is stupid?</p>
              <p>For those who do not know what the hell is happening, and am just jumping onto the bandwagon to blast the government to look cool, please use your head and think. You may look (and maybe even really feel) cool here, in this small forum. But in the real world, I guess you're just a laughing stock, that's not even worth laughing at.</p>

              <p>I don't believe ML is stupid, they have access to company information that Temasek lacks. In a buyer and seller market, the buyer will want to pay as little as possible, while the seller will want to sell as much as possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why did ML decide to release more equity shares this year instead of waiting another 5 months for the clause to lapse. I think ML is faced with liquidity issues, if they don't raise the required funds to tide them over these few months, they could be in deeper trouble. Why release equity shares instead of bonds? Dividends are not enforceable, whereas bond coupons are. You won't face chapter 11 filings if you don't pay dividends, failure to pay bond coupons could result in chapter 11 filings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's face it, Temasek haven't been spot on in almost all their overseas investments, there have been far too many losses to trust the judgement of Ho.</p>

              <p>I just stumbled on this from the CPF Life website, apparently the government agrees with me also, property prices increases with inflation. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>The LIFE scheme is only one part of your provision for old age. Your property is another very important part of your retirement savings. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">With inflation, the value of your property is likely to go up, both in selling price and rental value. </span></em></p>

              <p>I don't believe ML is stupid, they have access to company information that Temasek lacks. In a buyer and seller market, the buyer will want to pay as little as possible, while the seller will want to sell as much as possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why did ML decide to release more equity shares this year instead of waiting another 5 months for the clause to lapse. I think ML is faced with liquidity issues, if they don't raise the required funds to tide them over these few months, they could be in deeper trouble. Why release equity shares instead of bonds? Dividends are not enforceable, whereas bond coupons are. You won't face chapter 11 filings if you don't pay dividends, failure to pay bond coupons could result in chapter 11 filings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's face it, Temasek haven't been spot on in almost all their overseas investments, there have been far too many losses to trust the judgement of Ho.</p>

              <p>Yes yes!!!</p>
              <p>GIC and Temasek are gods!!!</p>
              <p>They have been doing very well with their investments in Global Crossing (USD 300 million losses every year since purchase, think it was 2002), Shin Corp, Optus, Suzhou Industrial Park and Merill Lynch.</p>
              <p>We should have blind faith in them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>If they were really gods.</p>
              <p>Then why is our inflation at 7.5%?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe their investments in Global Crossing is a lifetime investment, eventually the share price must rise in the company's entire lifetime (fyi, an incorporated entity has perpetual lifetime). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Unless it files for bankruptcy, but with ST Telemedia pumping in cash to support it's operation every year, I doubt that it will be insolvent. Insolvency is only for firms with no cash and losses.</p>

              <p>Well, there's no use telling certain stubborn minded people facts if they don't want to open their minds to other possibilities, no matter how small.</p>
              <p>If they like to remain limited even though the possibilities are laid out in front of them, let them be. Doesn't benefit you at all to convince them. That's one of the reasons why I'm less active here nowadays, other than at homework forum where it is for helping people who are willing to accept the help.</p>
