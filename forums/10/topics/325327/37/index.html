              <p>By Chen Shiyin</p>
              <p>Sept. 15 (Bloomberg) -- <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/apps/quote?ticker=TMSK%3ASP"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Temasek Holdings Pte.</span></span></a>, the biggest <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/apps/quote?ticker=MER%3AUS"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">shareholder</span></span></a> of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., may reap gains of $1.5 billion from the sale of the third-biggest U.S. securities firm to <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/apps/quote?ticker=BAC%3AUS"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Bank of America Corp.</span></span></a></p>
              <p>The biggest U.S. consumer bank said today it agreed to buy Merrill for $50 billion in stock, or $29 a share. The Singapore sovereign wealth fund paid $5.9 billion since December for about 14 percent of Merrill at an average price of $23.11 a share, based on Bloomberg calculations from exchange filings.</p>
              <p>Bank of America's purchase price is 70 percent more than Merrill's closing price of $17.05 in New York trading on Sept. 12. The <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/apps/quote?ticker=MER%3AUS"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">shares</span></span></a> fell 68 percent this year, after the company reported writedowns and credit losses of more than $52 billion, the second-most among the world's largest banks and securities firms, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p>
              <p>``It's a huge premium and I expect that there's been some discussion behind closed doors to come up with a price that is justifiable and that everyone is happy with, including Temasek,'' said <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Daphne+Roth&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Daphne Roth</span></span></a>, Singapore-based head of equity research in Asia at ABN Amro Private Bank, which manages about $30 billion of regional assets.</p>
              <p>Bank of America's purchase will help ensure that 94-year- old Merrill, which employs the largest U.S. brokerage force and owns about half of New York-based BlackRock Inc., won't become the next casualty of the global credit crisis. So far, Merrill has suffered $19 billion in <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/apps/quote?ticker=MER%3AUS"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">net losses</span></span></a> tied to mortgages.</p>
              <p>`Premature'</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.temasekholdings.com.sg/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Temasek</span></span></a>, which manages more than $130 billion, first paid $5 billion between December and February for about 10 percent of Merrill at $48 a share.</p>
              <p>The Singapore company said on July 29 it will invest a further $900 million in the securities firm, after receiving a $2.5 billion so-called reset payment for losses from its earlier purchase. The sum was used to pay for $3.4 billion of Merrill stock at $22.50 a share, according to <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/apps/quote?ticker=MER%3AUS"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">filings</span></span></a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
              <p>``It is premature for Temasek to comment,'' the Singapore company said in an e-mailed statement today.</p>
              <p>Other key investors who took stakes in the New York-based brokerage may also join Temasek in reporting gains from their investments.</p>
              <p>Korea Investment Corp., one of at least six investment funds that bought a combined $6.6 billion of convertible preferred shares from Merrill in January, said in a statement on July 29 that it converted 72 million Merrill shares at $27.50 apiece.</p>
              <p>Korea Investment's Gains</p>
              <p>The sale of Merrill to Bank of America will net the Seoul- based fund profits of about $108 million, according to Bloomberg calculations. An official at the sovereign wealth fund declined to comment today.</p>
              <p>Kuwait Investment Authority, a fund that manages the Middle Eastern emirate's wealth, held a 6 percent stake, or about 73.9 million shares, in Merrill after converting $2 billion of convertible preferred stock, according to an Aug. 6 regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. An official couldn't immediately be reached in his office and didn't respond to a e-mailed query.</p>
              <p>Davis Selected Advisors LP, a closely held money manager, and <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/apps/quote?ticker=7411%3AJT"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mizuho Financial Group Inc.</span></span></a>, Japan's third-largest publicly traded bank by market value, were among other investors who bought stakes in Merrill.</p>

              <p><a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BAC"><span style="color: #064cc0;">Bank of America shares tumbled 21%</span></a> Monday as investors reacted to the firm's blockbuster deal to acquire Merrill Lynch for $50 billion.</p>
              <p>"Acquiring one of the premier wealth management, capital markets, and advisory companies is a great opportunity for our shareholders,'' Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis said in a <a href="http://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=8255"><span style="color: #064cc0;">statement announcing the deal</span></a>.</p>
              <p>The Merrill transaction is “the strategic deal of a lifetime,” <a href="http://sacramento.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2008/09/15/daily22.html?ana=yfcpc"><span style="color: #064cc0;">Lewis said at a press conference</span></a> call Monday, further explaining the rationale. "This creates the company instantly that would have taken a decade to build."</p>
              <p>But this year has demonstrated companies built over decades -- even centuries -- can be dismantled in days, if not months.  On Monday, many wondered <a href="http://www.clusterstock.com/2008/9/bank-of-america-bac-stock-crushed-on-bizarrely-high-merrill-mer-bid"><span style="color: #064cc0;">whether Lewis just bit off more than his firm can chew</span></a>.</p>
              <p><strong>Bank of America "totally overpaid" for Merrill Lynch and Lewis was "reckless to buy [Merrill] at this price," says </strong><a href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~nroubini/"><span style="color: #064cc0;"><strong>Nouriel Roubini,</strong></span></a><strong> economic professor at NYU's Stern School and founder of RGE Monitor.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>In addition to the unknown "toxic" Level 3 assets on Merrill's books, Roubini notes Bank of America is still absorbing </strong><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22606833/"><span style="color: #064cc0;"><strong>its acquisition of Countrywide</strong></span></a><strong> from earlier this year - not to mention prior deals for LaSalle Bank in 2007 and MBNA in 2005.</strong></p>
              <p>In the accompanying video, Henry and I discuss the Bank of America-Merrill deal with Roubini and <a href="http://www.nypost.com/search/search.htm?q=Decambre&amp;s=news&amp;t=0"><span style="color: #064cc0;">NY Post reporter Mark Decambre</span></a>, who declares there will be "bloodshed on the street" if this deal were to come unwound for any reason.</p>
              <p>We also discus what the BofA-Merrill deal means for Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and other financial institutions like Wachovia and WaMu, which "look like IndyMac," according to Roubini.</p>

              <p>From <a href="http://www.clusterstock.com/"><span style="color: #064cc0;">ClusterStock</span></a>, Sept. 16, 2008:</p>
              Has anyone seen the language in the Bank of America-Merrill merger agreement? We haven't. But given that Merrill's stock continues to tank -- and take BofA down with it -- we wonder what kinds of "outs" Bank of America has. (<strong>Update: After ending virtually flat on Monday, Merrill shares were recently up 17% on Tuesday as Bank of America shares - remember, this is an all-stock deal - rebounded from Monday's shellacking.</strong>)<br>
              <p>Bank of America wasn't exactly a Rock of Gibraltar before the Merrill deal, and Merrill's toxic assets will now make its own capital situation even more tenuous. And CEO Ken Lewis still has yet to adequately <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/tech-ticker/article/58320/Roubini-BofA's-Lewis-'Totally-Overpaid'-in-'Reckless'-Deal-for-Merrill?tickers=BAC,MER,LEH,GS,C,WB,WM"><span style="color: #064cc0;">explain why he paid $29 per share for Merrill</span></a> when he likely could have had it for $15 by waiting a day.</p>
              <p>Merrill's stock is now below where it was trading before the BofA deal was announced...and the spread between the stocks is huge. The market, therefore, appears to think there is some risk to the deal, which seems a reasonable conclusion. Needless to say, if the deal falls apart, Merrill is likely toast.</p>
              <p><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> In the accompanying video, Henry discusses the Bank of America-Merrill deal with Portfolio senior writer Jesse Eisinger, who says it would be a "calamity" for Merrill if the deal falls apart.</p>
              <p>Eisinger also notes BofA was "not a particularly strong bank" prior to the Merrill transaction as it struggles to absorb Countrywide. But, he adds, Ken Lewis &amp; Co. are "under enormous pressure" from the Fed to get this deal done, strongly suggesting it was an arranged marriage.</p>
              <p>Concerns about the deal falling apart and/or Merrill becoming a millstone for BoA is putting additional downward pressure on financials like Morgan Stanley today -- as if <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/tech-ticker/article/60509/Today's-Crisis-AIG?tickers=aig,xlf,leh"><span style="color: #064cc0;">AIG's woes</span></a> and Goldman's weak earnings weren't enough to worry about.</p>

              <p>Following is an extract from the New York Times dated 16 Sep 2008:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/business/worldbusiness/17barclays.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">“As Bank of America bolstered its profile with its purchase of Merrill Lynch, Mr. Diamond may face added pressure to meet his goal of creating a universal bank that can compete directly with American-based giants like Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. But some analysts warned that Barclays may end up biting off more than it can chew. Any purchase must be thoroughly thought through and must not include any property assets but at the same time a deal must happen as quickly as possible to avoid employees leaving and the business falling apart, said James Hutson, a banking analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods in London. “If they can pick up some selected assets and people at a very fair price then that may be interesting,” Mr. Hutson said. “But there are some mixed views on Barclays structured finance portfolio with some arguing that their write-downs weren’t as stringent.”Barclays wrote down £2.8 billion, or $5 billion, of assets in the first half of this year. A rival, Royal Bank of Scotland, reported £5.9 billion of write-downs. Barclays said earlier this year that it does not need extra capital after raising £4.5 billion in a share sale in June that attracted investments from Qatar, Temasek Holdings of Singapore, China Development Bank and the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation of Japan. John Varley, chief executive of Barclays, said at the time the bank planned to spend half of the money raised to “take advantage of the current market circumstances.”.</a></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Following is an extract from the New York Times dated 16 Sep
              2008:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/business/worldbusiness/17barclays.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;amp;emc=rss">“As Bank of America bolstered its profile with its
              purchase of Merrill Lynch, Mr. Diamond may face added pressure to
              meet his goal of creating a universal bank that can compete
              directly with American-based giants like Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase
              and Bank of America. But some analysts warned that Barclays may end
              up biting off more than it can chew. Any purchase must be
              thoroughly thought through and must not include any property assets
              but at the same time a deal must happen as quickly as possible to
              avoid employees leaving and the business falling apart, said James
              Hutson, a banking analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods in London.
              “If they can pick up some selected assets and people at a very fair
              price then that may be interesting,” Mr. Hutson said. “But there
              are some mixed views on Barclays structured finance portfolio with
              some arguing that their write-downs weren’t as stringent.”Barclays
              wrote down £2.8 billion, or $5 billion, of assets in the first half
              of this year. A rival, Royal Bank of Scotland, reported £5.9
              billion of write-downs. Barclays said earlier this year that it
              does not need extra capital after raising £4.5 billion in a share
              sale in June that attracted investments from Qatar, Temasek
              Holdings of Singapore, China Development Bank and the Sumitomo
              Mitsui Banking Corporation of Japan. John Varley, chief executive
              of Barclays, said at the time the bank planned to spend half of the
              money raised to “take advantage of the current market
              circumstances.”.</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With Temasek's money placed with different
              counters, and different counters canibalising into some
              other weaker counters, does it not look as if Temasek is
              placing its bets at a roulette table ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If MM Lee's view is that the investments of Temasek and
              GIC are for the longer term, one will need to know
              what is their game plan during the shorter term to rescue
              their bets on the wrong horses.</p>
