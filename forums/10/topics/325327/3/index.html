              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">I Am Above
              Failure</span>: So you think that you are somehow far too talented,
              hard-working or knowledgeable and that everything you touch will
              turn into gold? Sorry to burst your bubble there, but we humans are
              flawed by nature so that, my friend, I?m afraid that you may just
              be living in denial if you have such a way of thinking.<br> <br></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">It's
              Impossible to Take Me by Surprise</span>: If you think that being
              taken by surprise is impossible if you have everything planned then
              I have one questions: how is life in that fantasy world of yours
              treating you? Yes, planning ahead is always recommended but
              thinking that you can actually be able to prepare for absolutely
              everything is just plain foolish on your part.<br> <br></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">If You Want
              Something Done Right, Do It Yourself</span>: Do you think that
              others should never be trusted and do you think that, if you want
              something done right, you should do it yourself? Aren't you giving
              yourself just a little bit too much credit there? It may just be
              me, but you most definitely don't strike me as a person with his or
              her feet on the ground.<br> <br></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">I'm Never at
              Fault</span>: Others are always at fault, aren't they? You keep
              doing everything right and they just ruin things for you, do they?
              Sorry to have to say this, but not assuming responsibility is one
              of the most obvious signs that you are living in denial.<br> <br></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">Everything Has
              an Excuse</span>: "I'm not going to do this because..." "I would
              have done that, if not for..." Do you somehow manage to find
              excuses for <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">everything</span>? Good
              for you, maybe you will find someone who pays you for that, but for
              the time being, your attitude is yet another sign that you are
              simply living in a fantasy world.<br> <br></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">Everyone Else
              is Wrong</span>: Are all of the people who don't agree with you
              clueless? Are they that ignorant, can't they understand your
              brilliance? I'm sorry but, if that's the way you see things, I am
              afraid that the problem lies elsewhere. <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">One tip: it's not with
              everyone else.</span><br> <br></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">It's All One
              Big Conspiracy I Tell You</span>: Does it seem that everyone and
              their dog is working against you? Are you just a poor innocent
              victim in what seems to be one huge conspiracy against you? In that
              case, have you considered getting some help? No, everyone is not
              conspiring against you, and it's about time you stopped living in
              denial and started seeing how things actually stand</li>
              </ol>

              <p>What M13 wrote is simply describing the market sentiment of wall street, hence can i know what is the message are you driving at when you quote that statement?</p>
              <p><br>I believe you have to take a look into past cases of succesful acquisition to understand exactly what Temasek and GIC are doing because if what really seperate the great investor from an average one is the ability to seize opportunities when everybdoy is staying away. or what separate the man from the boys when come to investing during crisis.</p>
              <p>Just to quote you an example, during the 2001/2 recession, when indonesia was still in a big mess, Temesek, through ST telemedia, acquired a 41% stake Indosat for US$630 million. During that time, the outlook were just a bleak, there is risk that the country will collapse due to riot, and the huge threat comoing from China for labour intensive manufacturing.</p>
              <p>And fast forward to 2008, STT sold their entire stake to Qatar Telecome for US$1,800m, or 285% US$ profits over a span of 6 years or about 45% per year.</p>

              <p>2) They paid Rupiah 12,950 per share for Indosat in 2002 December, the shares are currently trading at 6,450 per share. Therefore under normal market trading conditions, ST Telemedia made a loss of about 50% from the purchase price.</p>

              <p>3) There is one simple reason why someone is willing to pay Rupiah 38,528 per share for something which is currently traded in the Indonesia Stock Exchange for Rupiah 6,450 (6 times the current share price). There is a bigger idiot than ST Telemedia on the block. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>4) Without this bid from Qatar Telecoms, if ST Telemedia were to off load the shares in the stock exchange, the share price will plummet below the current share price of Rupiah 6,450.</p>
              <p>5) My wish is for Qatar Telecoms to buy over, then Singaporeans don't have to suffer so much losses due to the incompetencies of LKY's investment strategy.</p>

              <p>What M13 wrote is simply describing the market sentiment of wall street, hence can i know what is the message are you driving at when you quote that statement?</p>
              <p><br>I believe you have to take a look into past cases of succesful acquisition to understand exactly what Temasek and GIC are doing because if what really seperate the great investor from an average one is the ability to seize opportunities when everybdoy is staying away. or what separate the man from the boys when come to investing during crisis.</p>
              <p>Just to quote you an example, during the 2001/2 recession, when indonesia was still in a big mess, Temesek, through ST telemedia, acquired a 41% stake Indosat for US$630 million. During that time, the outlook were just a bleak, there is risk that the country will collapse due to riot, and the huge threat comoing from China for labour intensive manufacturing.</p>
              <p>And fast forward to 2008, STT sold their entire stake to Qatar Telecome for US$1,800m, or 285% US$ profits over a span of 6 years or about 45% per year.</p>

              to see that occasionally, the Singaporeans make bum investment
              decisions and end up losing (a lot) of money.</p>

              <p>If they want to average down, Citi is a safer buy. Dunno what those imbeciles thinking. If the crisis worsens, Merril Lynch will fall before Citi does, because Citi is a consumer bank and too big to fail.</p>
              <p>Is averaging down wise? Most traders will tell you no. But Temasek is a 'long-term investor'. So is my mother btw. She still has some M'sian stocks stuck for 12 years still underwater :P</p>

              <p>Just to pause the Temasek and GIC bashing for a short while...</p>
              <p>I am quite surprised that everybody just focused on the fact that Temasek is investing another $3.4 billion into ML but not remember the fact that <strong>Temasek has been compensated $2.5 billion by ML due to an anti-dilutive clause.</strong></p>
              <p>Anyway, Temasek had little choice but to pump in $900 mil more into the company. The story is simple, as long as ML doesn't go bankrupt or gets taken over there's a very high chance (~90%) that the trade will breakeven or make profits no matter how low ML stock drops due to this clause. That's why Temasek is throwing in more money to save the sinking ship, coz if they don't and ML goes down. Temasek management will definitely have to face a lot of issues on accountability.</p>
              <p>At this stage, by not pumping in more money and staving off ML's bankruptcy, that would be the worst decision Temasek would probably have made! What's the chance of a big US bank like ML failing? The risk/reward ratio probably justifies the liquidity injection and I agree with the decision.</p>
              <p>However, to rush head in during the midst of the credit crunch and invest 10-20% of the whole fund in the financial sector, though armored with protective clauses may still be a tad aggressive for a sovereign fund answerable to the people.</p>
              <p>But to give Temasek or GIC some credit, they had the option of injecting liqudity into Bear Sterns, Citigroup, ML and UBS during the height of the credit crunch. And intelligently they didn't choose Bear Sterns which of course got bought over a couple of months later.</p>
              <p>Ok guys, you all can continue bashing Temasek and GIC now =)</p>
              <p>Below are the details:-</p>
              <p>July 29 (Bloomberg) -- <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=TMSK%3ASP">Temasek Holdings Pte.</a>, the biggest
              <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=MER%3AUS">shareholder</a> of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., agreed to invest a further
              $900 million in the securities firm after getting compensated for
              its initial investment in December.</p>
              <p>The Singapore state-owned investment company will use a <strong>$2.5
              billion so-called reset payment for losses</strong> from its earlier
              purchase toward buying $3.4 billion of Merrill stock, it said in a
              statement today. Merrill said it will book the reset as an expense,
              as well as $5.7 billion of additional writedowns.</p>
              <p>``It looks like a good deal for Temasek,'' <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Teng+Ngiek+Lian&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Teng Ngiek Lian</a>,
              who manages $2.6 billion as chief executive officer of Target
              Asset Management in Singapore, said today. ``It's quite cleverly
              structured to protect their interest from future dilution and
              lower price placement.''</p>
              <p>Merrill's <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=MER%3AUS">shares</a> have fallen 55 percent since Dec. 24, when
              it announced that Temasek, which manages more than $100 billion,
              would invest as much as $5 billion in the third-biggest U.S.
              securities firm. The sale would push Temasek's stake beyond the 10
              percent limit for foreign investors, and the Singapore company
              said a portion of its new stock requires regulatory approval.</p>
              <p>Merrill was contractually bound to compensate Temasek and the
              other investors who bought shares in offerings in December and
              January. ``You must have some reward for the risk they are
              taking,'' Teng said. ``That deal was done under exceptional
              circumstances. It was a scary time.''</p>
              <p>Shoring Up Capital</p>
              <p>Merrill Chief Executive Officer <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=John+Thain&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">John Thain</a> is pushing to
              shore up capital as banks including Citigroup Inc. were forced to
              sell assets and seek new investors amid a global credit
              contraction that triggered more than $468 billion in writedowns
              and losses.</p>
              <p>Other than Temasek, Government of Singapore Investment Corp.,
              which manages more than $100 billion of the country's reserves,
              has invested about $18 billion in UBS AG and Citigroup following
              writedowns by the two banks.</p>
              <p>Thain, 53, is trying to stave off credit-ratings downgrades
              and demonstrate to regulators that the firm can withstand losses.
              Standard &amp; Poor's on June 2 cut Merrill's rating to A from A+ and
              assigned a ``negative'' outlook, indicating additional downgrades
              were possible.</p>
              <p>Korea Investment Corp., a Seoul-based fund that manages part
              of the country's foreign-exchange reserves overseas, also said
              today that it converted $2 billion of preferred shares in Merrill
              bought in January into common stock at half the price it had
              initially agreed to.</p>
              <p>Merrill on July 17 reported a second-quarter <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=MER%3AUS">net loss</a> of
              $4.65 billion, or $4.97 a share, on $9.7 billion of credit-
              market writedowns that totaled about $46 billion before today.</p>
              <p>Thain cut about 4,200 jobs in the first half of the year and
              is selling assets to replenish the firm's capital. Merrill
              completed the $4.43 billion sale of its stake in Bloomberg LP
              this month and said it signed a letter of intent to sell a
              controlling interest in Financial Data Services Inc., a mutual-
              fund administrator valued at $3.5 billion, to an undisclosed buyer.</p>
