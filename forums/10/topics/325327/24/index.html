              <p>Uncertain,</p>
              <p>1) After all that talk about FRS 10.8 I am surprise that you didnt even use that to justify your arguement. Isnt that the first  <strong>TOOLS</strong> you pull out to "impress" us?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">2) This is the exact statement I made, </span></p>

              <p>As you can see, after realising that he has no FACTS to support what he said, he is now using what I call selective highlighting and reading technique to <strong>TWIST and </strong><strong>CHANGE</strong> what I am saying just to create something out of nothing.</p>
              <p>Isnt it obvious that my statement about is talking about splitting 50% of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">INCOME</span></strong> and not splitting shares.</p>
              <p>And guess what, he is now using the word STOCK, as if the Sole Proprietor has transform to be a public listed company..</p>
              <p>And btw, the term <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stock Split</span> is different from splitting shareholding and you need to get your FACTS right before coming here to big talk and make a fool out of yourself.</p>
              <p>If you are bloody color blind and you cant read text written in black, then I will forgive you for sprouting so much nonsense.</p>
              <p>However if you are doing this hoping that we are blind, then I must say that you are really pathatic. I REPEAT, PATHATIC, especially coming from someone who talk so big about Financial Reporting Standards lah, Busines Law lah, NTU lah, Headhunted by international banks lah. All that are simply <span style="text-decoration: underline;">desperate</span> attempt to glorify himself without knowing that it make him look like a<strong> bloody wanker</strong>.</p>

              <p>If you really really know what you are talking about, I would expect you to engage me to challenge you wrong.</p>
              <p>However if you are just an empty vessel bragging about your brother's property investment like they are yours, then I am sure you NEVER take up the challenge.</p>

              <p>A company can pay out share dividends to its shareholders. When the dividends are paid out, they are subject to an 18% corporate tax.</p>
              <p>The dividends are still considered as income to shareholders. When declaring income tax, these dividends are included, and any extra that has been paid in tax will be refunded, because usually income tax rate is lower than corporate tax rate.</p>
              <p>Thus, a company owner can decrease the total tax paid by transferring some shares to his wife, such that in total, less tax (due to dividends, etc) is paid.</p>
              <p>Somehow, our resident troll has no idea how to calculate properly. Can't blame him since he had likely gotten an A2 for E maths and a B4 for his A maths; many O level students can calculate better than him.</p>

              <p>Maybe we could look at page B32 in today's MyPaper. It explains that people who like to throw insults frequently are insecure, and need to do that to feel some sort of security.</p>
              <p>What else can explain the fact that this troll, even after getting banned multiple times, registers a new nick again to come here to throw insults one after another.

              <p>He's definitely not that smart. Saying that property price is a function of inflation (although he got confused and posted vice versa) does not equate at all to "property price depends solely on the variable inflation". This is simple secondary school maths which he seems not to understand at all, especially when he tells that property price depends on other factors. Gazelle self-pwnage once again.</p>
              <p>It's similar to saying that it is wrong to claim that the time taken by water to boil is a function of heat supplied, because it is also dependent on factors like pressure and impurities in the water =&gt; he just don't understand what is a function.</p>

              <p>Here, we were discussing about inflation and property price, so it is not wrong to say that property price is a function of inflation. The mathematical concept of a function is to express relationship and dependence between variables. Effectively, saying property price is a function of inflation merely means that there is a relationship and dependence between property price and inflation. It does not in any way says that it excludes other factors.</p>
              <p>Similarly, saying that Hamiltonian function is a function of time tells there is a relationship between Hamiltonian and time. Yes, it does not portray completely what it is, but it is not wrong to say that it is a function of time because, again, the mathematical concept of a function is to express relationship and dependence between variables; there's a relationship and dependence between the two.</p>
              <p>Let me give you a mathematical example.</p>
              <p>We can say that y = g(x,z), and f(x) = g(x,z).<br>This means y = f(x)</p>
              <p>Thus, it is also not wrong to say y = f(x)</p>

              <p>They did have an additional 3 nights online free webcast on him teaching more on trading, but then, I didn't hv time cuz it was my final exams</p>

              <p>Well, it's also not that easy cuz it is going to involve companies all the way at the US. And that's going to affect any fundamental analysis part.</p>
              <p>Btw, what module is it that you are taking? Interesting that it has options included too</p>

              <p>A company can pay out share dividends to its shareholders. When the dividends are paid out, they are subject to an 18% corporate tax.</p>
              <p>The dividends are still considered as income to shareholders. When declaring income tax, these dividends are included, and any extra that has been paid in tax will be refunded, because usually income tax rate is lower than corporate tax rate.</p>
              <p>Thus, a company owner can decrease the total tax paid by transferring some shares to his wife, such that in total, less tax (due to dividends, etc) is paid.</p>
              <p>Somehow, our resident troll has no idea how to calculate properly. Can't blame him since he had likely gotten an A2 for E maths and a B4 for his A maths; many O level students can calculate better than him.</p>

              <p>He's definitely not that smart. Saying that property price is a function of inflation (although he got confused and posted vice versa) does not equate at all to "property price depends solely on the variable inflation". This is simple secondary school maths which he seems not to understand at all, especially when he tells that property price depends on other factors. Gazelle self-pwnage once again.</p>
              <p>It's similar to saying that it is wrong to claim that the time taken by water to boil is a function of heat supplied, because it is also dependent on factors like pressure and impurities in the water =&gt; he just don't understand what is a function.</p>

              <p>You must have misunderstood my post. In no part of my post did I mention that a function cannot be multi-variables.</p>
              <p>In short, I'm saying that by telling us it is wrong to say A is a function of factor B just because factors C and D are involved definitely shows an insufficient understanding of functions.</p>

              <p>Here, we were discussing about inflation and property price, so it is not wrong to say that property price is a function of inflation. The mathematical concept of a function is to express relationship and dependence between variables. Effectively, saying property price is a function of inflation merely means that there is a relationship and dependence between property price and inflation. It does not in any way says that it excludes other factors.</p>
              <p>Similarly, saying that Hamiltonian function is a function of time tells there is a relationship between Hamiltonian and time. Yes, it does not portray completely what it is, but it is not wrong to say that it is a function of time because, again, the mathematical concept of a function is to express relationship and dependence between variables; there's a relationship and dependence between the two.</p>
              <p>Let me give you a mathematical example.</p>
              <p>We can say that y = g(x,z), and f(x) = g(x,z).<br>This means y = f(x)</p>
              <p>Thus, it is also not wrong to say y = f(x)</p>

              <p>You know mental retardation and intelligence is hereditary, if <strong>someone's parents</strong> are not too bright, it's likely that they will have stupid kids, but sometimes results do differ. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>"Intelligence is of primary interest to human genetic research. The first methodical set of experimental observations can be traced back to Galton’s work in 1865, a year before Mendel’s influential article on the laws of heredity [5]. Galton evaluated the transmission of several traits in families using statistical tools. <strong>He concluded that many traits including mental ability are genetically transmitted and normally distributed in the general population.</strong> He did not analyze the role of the common environment within the families, biasing his conclusions towards the genetic. He did, however, recognize significant general principles such as regression to the mean in children of parents with extreme phenotypic traits."</p>

              <div class="Abstract"><a name="Abs1"></a><span class="AbstractHeading">Abstract  </span> Two boys from separate families presented with hereditary multiple exostoses (EXT) and autism associated with mental retardation. Their fathers both expressed a clinical phenotype of hereditary multiple exostoses milder than those of the patients and without the associated mental disorder. The <em>EXT1</em> and <em>EXT2</em> genes from lymphocytes of the affected individuals were analyzed by using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing. A novel deletion mutation, 1742delTGT-G in exon 9 of <em>EXT1</em>, causing a frameshift was detected in one boy and his father. Another novel deletion mutation, 2093delTT in exon 11 of <em>EXT1</em>, causing transcription termination was detected in the other affected boy and his father. <em>EXT1</em> is expressed in the brain, and both EXT1 and EXT2 proteins are associated with glycosyltransferase activities required for the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate, which also has activity in the brain. The coincidental association of mental disorders in the boys was not completely excluded. However, these results suggest the involvement of EXT1 in the development of mental disorders, including mental retardation and autism.</div>

              <p><strong>Common hereditary neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia are, most likely, both genetically multifactorial and heterogeneous.</strong> Because of these characteristics traditional methods for genetic analysis fail when applied to such diseases. To address the problem we propose a novel probabilistic framework that combines the standard genetic linkage formalism with whole-genome molecular-interaction data to predict pathways or networks of interacting genes that contribute to common heritable disorders. We apply the model to three large genotype-phenotype datasets, and identify a small number of highly-significant candidate genes for autism (24), bipolar disorder (21) and schizophrenia (25), and predict a number of gene targets likely to be shared among the disorders.</p>

              <h1>What is Autism?</h1>
              <p>Autism is a severe developmental disorder that begins at birth or within the first two-and-a-half years of life. Most autistic children are perfectly normal in appearance, but spend their time engaged in puzzling and disturbing behaviors which are markedly different from those of typical children. Less severe cases may be diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) or with Asperger's Syndrome (these children typically have normal speech, but they have many "autistic" social and behavioral problems).</p>
              <p>It used to be thought that autism is just a fate that you accept.<strong>The good news is that there are now a wide variety of <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/forums/10/treatable/index.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">treatment options</span></span></a> which can be very helpful.</strong> Some treatments may lead to great improvement, and others may have little or no effect, but a good starting point would be the <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/forums/10/treatable/form34qr.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">parent ratings of biomedical interventions</span></span></a>, which presents the responses of over 25,000 parents in showing the effectiveness of various interventions on their own child.</p>

              <p>As for your condition you stated in blue, I am very curious on why do you want to insist that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inflation level be maintained?</span> AFAIK, ML share price was trading at US$26 yesterday, (thats after they annouced they are getting rid of their TOXIC CDOs,) and you are betting that it will go to as low as US$20, which is a whopping 23%, down from yesterday closing price. Hence common sense will tell us that it should be in your interest to see inflation rising instead of maintaining, so that it will create more problem in the CDOs market which will result to more writedown for banks.  </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">So Maurizio, can you explain to us the purpose behind maintaining inflation level?</span></strong></p>

              <p>I thought I already explained to you in a previous post long ago, which you can't understand, therefore keep repeating and repeating.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There are three distinctive behaviors that characterize autism.    Autistic children have difficulties with social interaction, problems with verbal and nonverbal communication, and repetitive behaviors or narrow, obsessive interests.  These behaviors can range in impact from mild to disabling. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The hallmark feature of autism is impaired social interaction.  Parents are usually the first to notice symptoms of autism in their child.  As early as infancy, a baby with autism may be unresponsive to people or focus intently on one item to the exclusion of others for long periods of time.  A child with autism may appear to develop normally and then withdraw and become indifferent to social engagement. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Children with autism may fail to respond to their name and often avoid eye contact with other people.  They have difficulty interpreting what others are thinking or feeling because they can’t understand social cues, such as tone of voice or facial expressions, and don’t watch other people’s faces for clues about appropriate behavior.  They lack empathy. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Many children with autism engage in repetitive movements such as rocking and twirling, or in self-abusive behavior such as biting or head-banging.  They also tend to start speaking later than other children and may refer to themselves by name instead of “I” or “me.”  Children with autism don’t know how to play interactively with other children.  Some speak in a sing-song voice about a narrow range of favorite topics, with little regard for the interests of the person to whom they are speaking.  </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Many children with autism have a reduced sensitivity to pain, but are abnormally sensitive to sound, touch, or other sensory stimulation.  These unusual reactions may contribute to behavioral symptoms such as a resistance to being cuddled or hugged.   </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Children with autism appear to have a higher than normal risk for certain co-existing conditions, including fragile X syndrome (which causes mental retardation), tuberous sclerosis (in which tumors grow on the brain), epileptic seizures, Tourette syndrome, learning disabilities, and attention deficit disorder.  For reasons that are still unclear, about 20 to 30 percent of children with autism develop epilepsy by the time they reach adulthood.  While people with schizophrenia may show some autistic-like behavior, their symptoms usually do not appear until the late teens or early adulthood.  Most people with schizophrenia also have hallucinations and delusions, which are not found in autism.</p>

              <p><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">2) Market timing is not for everybody, it's definitely not for people like you, who have insufficient knowledge and information. If your investment philosophy is the same as Warren Buffett or George Soros, then I guess you would have been a billionaire right now won't you. There is a difference between timing the bottom of the market and predicting the market (whether share prices will be substantially lower) based on economic fundamentals. The same person whom you quote, also made this prediction in 2007. It's not possible to predict the exact location of the stock market exactly, but it is possible to predict the general movement of the market based on leading indicators. If what you said is true, then those information that intelligent investors rely on would be redundant, everybody should just be like you, grab any investment and hold it forever. Geez! I think you qualify to be a portfolio manager now, given that there is nothing to distinguish you and Warren Buffett. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> You had basic knowledge from your Marketing Degree course, so don't purport to be be an expert in finance. So were you long or short in equities from 2007 to present?</span></p>

If they don't raise the required capital (Temasek had effectively shackled itself to Merrill Lynch, they can't don't exercise the option to purchase the shares, else they will lose more) assuming that no investors are bullish about the prospects of Merrill Lynch, then the shares will definitely drop further.</span></span></span></p>

              <p>Maurizio, before I go on to explain to you about why what you said will not work in real world, can you please tell us if you have any real life experience in stock trading and do you personally have a stock trading account with any broker in Singapore.</p>
              <p>1) On Wednesday, when the market heard that Temasek is exploring the possibility of acquiring the remaining stake in SCS, its share price surge from S$0.85 to S$1.08, which is 27% rise and trading was suspended. And that is exactly what I have been trying to tell you that such billion dollar deal like ML, Citi of UBS can never be done in the open market and they have to be arranged privately.  <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/268062.asp">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/268062.asp</a></p>
              <p>Hence based on the same principle, it will be wrong to say that Temasek can still acquire the a stake in ML at a cheaper price if the pass the opportunity in Dec07 in the OPEN MARKET </p>
              <p>2) Contrary to what you have been saying about how stupid is Temasek investment in ML, Temasek has managed to reduced their average ML share cost from US$48 to US$21 because of the capital protection clause when I mentioned earlier.</p>
              <p>So Maurzio, are you still going to continue to tell us that Maurizio13 &amp; Co is still the smarter investor?</p>
