              <p>Uncertain,</p>
              <p>1) After all that talk about FRS 10.8 I am surprise that you
              didnt even use that to justify your arguement. Isnt that the
              first  <strong>TOOLS</strong> you pull out to "impress"
              us?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">2) This is the
              <strong>exact</strong> statement I made,</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #000080;">So now my question to you is,
              how can you justify for IRAS to split <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000080;">50% of the
              SP</span></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">company's</span> income</strong></span></span> (<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">or Personal
              income</span></span></strong> since its a SP company) with someone
              who never existed in the company during that last financial
              year?</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As you can see, after realising that he has no FACTS to support
              what he said, he is now using what I call
              selective highlighting and reading
              technique to <strong>TWIST and</strong> <strong>CHANGE</strong> what I am saying just to create
              something out of nothing.</p>
              <p>Isnt it obvious that my statement about is talking about
              splitting 50% of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">INCOME</span></strong> and not splitting
              shares.</p>
              <p>And guess what, he is now using
              the word STOCK, as if the Sole Proprietor has transform
              to be a public listed company..</p>
              <p>And btw, the term <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stock Split</span> is different from
              splitting shareholding and you need to get your FACTS right before
              coming here to big talk and make a fool out of yourself.</p>
              <p>If you are bloody color blind and you cant read text
              written in black, then I will forgive you for sprouting so much
              nonsense.</p>
              <p>However if you are doing this hoping that we are
              blind, then I must say that you are really pathatic. I REPEAT,
              PATHATIC, especially coming from someone who talk so big about
              Financial Reporting Standards lah, Busines Law lah, NTU lah,
              Headhunted by international banks lah. All that are simply
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">desperate</span> attempt
              to glorify himself without knowing that it make him look like a
              <strong>bloody wanker</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">SO MR. WANKER, TELL ME
              WHICH PART OF MY STATEMENT TALK ABOUT <span style="text-decoration: underline;">STOCK OR SHARE
              SPLIT?</span>        </span></strong></p>

              <p><br>FACTS</p>
              <p>ST Telemedia paid US$634 million for 41.9% of Indosat in 2002 and sold the entire 41.9% stake to Qatar Tel for US$1,800 million and made a profit of US$1,166 million over 6 years.</p>
              <p>STT bought the 41.9% stake at 12,950 rupiah per share, however this is before the 5 for 1 Stock split. During that time of the stock split, the share price was traded at around 16,000 Rp.</p>

              <p>On the other hand if ST Telemedia had bought the SGX (or stocks composite of the SGX Index), which was trading at SGD 1.22 on 2 Jan 2003. It would have increased to SGD 7.71 on 9 Jun 2008.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">price</span>.So,it is genius for Temasek,share price up,it will

              <p>Share price drops,it will be compensated!!</p>
              <p>Will u all guys pl be more professional in discussion.</p>
              <p>Dunt just copy and paste without digestion.</p>
              <p>Temasek is not so stupid just to buy shares blindly and
                                      becomes</p>
              <p>Merrill's largest shareholder.</p>
              <p>When Temasek bought US$5 b shares sometimes back ,</p>
              <p>there was a reset provision</p>
              <p>that if Merrill issue share later at price lower than what

              <p>bought,Merrill has to compensate Temasek fully.</p>
              <p>Now Merrill compensates Temasek US$2.5 b,</p>
              <p>though Temasek uses all 2.5 b to buy new issued shares.</p>

              <p>Up to today,Temasek are just lenders ,BUT NOT SHARE HOLDERS</p>
              <p>OF UBS and CITI.The reasons are many,among them</p>
              <p>is Temasek dunt know the full picture of subprime.</p>
              <p>But it is a once in few decades chance to get a big share in big

              <p>but not a share holder.</p>
              <p>Previoulsy, it is suprised to me that Temasek bought</p>
              <p>Merrill share without protections.</p>
              <p>The truths are it incorporates price protection and ,i read</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Temasek said its new commitment "includes a sum of US 2.5
                                      billion dollars arising from a reset payment which Merrill Lynch
                                      has agreed to pay to Temasek as an adjustment to the price of
                                      Temasek's original investment made in December 2007."The Singapore
                                      firm is putting that 2.5 billion back into Merrill, along with
                                      another 900 million dollars.</p>

              <p>Why it will become Merrill share holder without protections?</p>
              <p>U can be blind physcially,but not in mind.</p>
              <p>Face the reality lah.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Merrill compensates Temasek US$2.5 billion for drop in share</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">price</span>.So,it is genius for Temasek,share price up,it will gain.</p>
              <p>Share price drops,it will be compensated!!</p>
              <p>Will u all guys pl be more professional in discussion.</p>
              <p>Dunt just copy and paste without digestion.</p>
              <p>Temasek is not so stupid just to buy shares blindly and becomes</p>
              <p>Merrill's largest shareholder.</p>
              <p>When Temasek bought US$5 b shares sometimes back ,</p>
              <p>there was a reset provision</p>
              <p>that if Merrill issue share later at price lower than what Temasek</p>
              <p>bought,Merrill has to compensate Temasek fully.</p>
              <p>Now Merrill compensates Temasek US$2.5 b,</p>
              <p>though Temasek uses all 2.5 b to buy new issued shares.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>UBS and CITI deals are just creditors</strong></span></p>
              <p>Up to today,Temasek are just lenders ,BUT NOT SHARE HOLDERS</p>
              <p>OF UBS and CITI.The reasons are many,among them</p>
              <p>is Temasek dunt know the full picture of subprime.</p>
              <p>But it is a once in few decades chance to get a big share in big and great</p>
              <p>companies.</p>
              <p>Temasek is vey cautious in UBS and CITI deals by becoming just a lender,</p>
              <p>but not a share holder.</p>
              <p>Previoulsy, it is suprised to me that Temasek bought</p>
              <p>Merrill share without protections.</p>
              <p>The truths are it incorporates price protection and ,i read</p>
              <p>from other news,that Temasek get dilutions protections also.</p>
