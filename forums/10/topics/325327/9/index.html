              <p>Jojo, please dont make assumptions just to make yourself look smart.</p>
              <p>In property you must always factor in supply and demand hence by saying that USA is a bigger than Singapore as country that will not mean a thing to me if you dont factor in the demand.</p>
              <p>However big or small, I believe property investment is still govern by the same principle of location location and location, so please dont try to use size to make yourself look big. it doesnt work here.</p>
              <p>During our discussion at the other threadm, which was dedicated to you, I have asked you a several time, which real estate in America beside the highend luxury apartment in Manhattan, are not affected by the economic crisis caused by subprime? And you have failed to answer me that question even though you could claim that your investment is not affected. (WAH,,,Like real)</p>
              <p>Plus, you claim that YOU personally bought a property in USA for US$200,000, that to me is definitely on the lower end of the market, which I believe will be hit hard because of the income disparity.</p>

              <p>I will answer this. This is a good question.</p>
              <p>Since u distrust me...u should trust the book" Discrete mathematics by susanna 3rd edition"</p>
              <p>Read pg 29..."A valid argument is that the truth follows inescapably by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">logical form</span> alone from the truth of the premises"</p>
              <p>Pg 38...."The most important thing to note is that validity is a property of a<span style="color: #ff0000;">rgument forms."</span></p>
              <p>Pg 30...teaches u about truth tables and argument forms.</p>
              <p>Pg 33 ...teaches rules of inference.</p>
              <p>last but not least...pg41-43  some exercises for u to practice to convince urself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U see...I can dont know the truth of ur variables..ur premises. But from ur argument FORM... we can with certainty guranteed by mathematics to tell u that a certain form of argument is of wrong logic.</p>
              <p>The words lie in "ARGUMENT FORM".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How do mathematicans prove theorems??? They <span style="color: #ff0000;">do not even need to know</span> what it is talking about. They just use law of deduction reasoning..correct argument forms.</p>

              <p>5125, is maths the only thing you know in life and thats why you need to always use TEXT BOOK as reference? Btw, applying maths equation to daily life, will it improve your sex life and make you feel more powerful to your partner?</p>
              <p>What I am asking you is to comment on Maurizio13 statement and ask if it imply that  "Inflation is THE function of property price". If you cant even give me an simply YES or NO reply on that simply question, how on earth am I going to believe that your maths is POWERFUL?</p>

              <p>Jojo, please dont make assumptions just to make yourself look
              smart.</p>
              <p>In property you must always factor in supply and
              demand hence by saying that USA is a bigger than Singapore
              as country that will not mean a thing to me if you dont factor
              in the demand.</p>
              <p>However big or small, I believe property investment is still
              govern by the same principle of location location and location, so
              please dont try to use size to make yourself look big. it doesnt
              work here.</p>
              <p>During our discussion at the other threadm, which was
              dedicated to you, I have asked you a several time, which real
              estate in America beside the highend luxury apartment in Manhattan,
              are not affected by the economic crisis caused by subprime? And you
              have failed to answer me that question even though you could claim
              that your investment is not affected. (WAH,,,Like real)</p>
              <p>Plus, you claim that YOU personally bought a property in USA for
              US$200,000, that to me is definitely on the lower end of the
              market, which I believe will be hit hard because of the income

              <p><br>Jojo, is this what you usually do when you run out of ideas and words to defend yourself and what you claimed in this forum?</p>
              <p>Maybe CHITCHAT might be a better forum for you since most people there couldnt care much if you are lying through your nose.</p>
              <p>I hope you are not comparing your US$200K <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INVESTMENT property</span></strong> to those who are living in the deep south of A hor.  </p>
