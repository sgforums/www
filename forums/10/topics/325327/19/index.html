              <p>surprised at your rigid interpretation, alot like a robot.</p>
              <p>you mean sole proprietor can't change his business vehicle from sole proprietorship into partnership?</p>
              <p>sighs.</p>
              <p>your disagreement was, it is not possible for sole proprietor to give his wife half his shares in his business, so that he can reduce his tax charge.</p>
              <p>you really sound so pathetic now, arguing about the construction of the sentences, it's lame. when i wrote that statement i assumed that the company has been converted, that why i used company shares. the intention was to mean it was from a sole proprietorship converted to a partnership or company.</p>
              <p>so the issue is still, can the sole proprietor give 50% of his company to his wife?</p>

              <p><br>Maurizio,</p>
              <p>Lets not go around the bush on this one.</p>
              <p>1) Is there such thing as SHARES in SOLE proprietorship company?  If he include his wife as a partner in the business, then it will not be call giving 50% of this SOLE propertorship company share, it will be call Partnership or LLP shares</p>
              <p>2) AFAIK as a sole proprietor, your tax filing is through your personal income tax return, while for a partnership company you will be filing your company income through a seperate partnership income tax returns.</p>
              <p>Hence when you say that by the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">end</span> of the financial year 2007, the owner of the sole proprietor could convert his company into a partnership to save on tax is pure bullshit because the company's income for financial year 2007, or before the converstion will be treated as, the sole proprietor personal income. And any sharing of income among the newly established partnership company will only start in financial year 2008.</p>
              <p>I would like to see what other "creative" accounting ideas you are going to come out with to defend your stupid little tax evasion ideas.</p>

              <p><strong>Autism</strong> is a brain development disorder
              that impairs social interaction and communication and causes restricted
              and repetitive behavior, all starting before a child is three years
              old. This set of signs distinguishes autism from milder <strong>autism spectrum disorders</strong> (<strong>ASD</strong>) such as Asperger syndrome.</p>
              <p>Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by multigene interactions or by rare mutations. In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects. Other proposed causes, such as childhood vaccines, are controversial; the vaccine hypotheses lack convincing scientific evidence. Most recent reviews estimate a prevalence
              of one to two cases per 1,000 people for autism, and about six per
              1,000 for ASD, with ASD averaging a 4.3:1 male-to-female ratio. The
              number of people known to have autism has increased dramatically since
              the 1980s, at least partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the
              question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved.</p>
              <p>Autism affects many parts of the<a title="Human brain" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain"></a>;
              how this occurs is poorly understood. Parents usually notice signs in
              the first two years of their child's life. Early behavioral or
              cognitive intervention can help children gain self-care, social, and
              communication skills. There is <strong>no known cure</strong>. Few children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, but some become successful, and an autistic culture has developed, with some seeking a cure and others believing that autism is a condition rather than a disorder.</p>

              <p>Ask this of you, a businessman with a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">chargeable income</span> of $80,000 for year of assessment 2007 and tax charge of <span style="color: #0000ff;">$4,300</span>, decides to keep away from paying tax by giving his wife a 50% of his <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sole proprietorship company shares</span>, thereby reducing their total tax payable from <span style="color: #0000ff;">$4,300 to $1,800</span>. <span style="color: #0000ff;">(My original figures for tax payable was wrong as pointed out by jojobeach in page 16, corrected figures in blue.)</span></p>
              <p>The businessman effectively cheated IRAS by avoiding the difference of the two tax payable, which is $2,500.</p>
              <p>Did he commit tax evasion?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>I am fully aware what is required by IRAS as they are clearly stated in with website, including the part on balance sheet. <a href="http://www.iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page01.aspx?id=1262">http://www.iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page01.aspx?id=1262</a></p>
              <p>Since Maurizio13 suggesting here is about one could evade tax by switching a company from sole proprietor status to a partnership and splitting the income between 2 person. hence my question is,</p>
              <p>a) Even taking into consideration of FRS 10.8, how can you justify to IRAS you need to pay 50% of the company's profit to someone who never exisit in your company during FY07? We are talking about a shareholder here, not some bad debts provision, WIP, stocks adjustment, assets reclassification etc.</p>
              <p>b) How would you do your income tax filing since, for Sole proprietor, you can only file through your personal income tax returns, while for a partnership company you must file through a Company Income tax returns which will send to the company seperately at the end of first financial year?</p>

              <p><strong>Autism</strong> is a brain development disorder that impairs social interaction and communication and causes restricted and repetitive behavior, all starting before a child is three years old. This set of signs distinguishes autism from milder <strong>autism spectrum disorders</strong> (<strong>ASD</strong>) such as Asperger syndrome.</p>
              <p>Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by multigene interactions or by rare mutations. In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects. Other proposed causes, such as childhood vaccines, are controversial; the vaccine hypotheses lack convincing scientific evidence. Most recent reviews estimate a prevalence of one to two cases per 1,000 people for autism, and about six per 1,000 for ASD, with ASD averaging a 4.3:1 male-to-female ratio. The number of people known to have autism has increased dramatically since the 1980s, at least partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved.</p>
              <p>Autism affects many parts of the<a title="Human brain" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain"></a>; how this occurs is poorly understood. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. Early behavioral or cognitive intervention can help children gain self-care, social, and communication skills. There is <strong>no known cure</strong>. Few children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, but some become successful, and an autistic culture has developed, with some seeking a cure and others believing that autism is a condition rather than a disorder.</p>

              <p>U sure a not, there is something called post balance sheet event (FRS 10.8).</p>
              <p>If u don't know what is FRS, let me tell u. This is called the financial reporting standard of the Republic of Singapore.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FRS 10.8</span></strong></p>
              <p> a) Those that provide evidence of conditions that existed at the balance sheet date (adjusting events).</p>
              <p>An entity shall adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements to reflect adjusting events after the balance sheet date.</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Don't try to say balance sheet is only for "Company" and not "sole proprietorship or LLP". Because FRS is used to determine how much tax should IRAS draw from a self-employed.</p>
              <p>So long as the partnership's intent takes effect before the financial year 2007, the amount of taxable income will still be adjusted. So what u have try to argue has fallen prey to this FRS rule.  </p>

              <p>The general question (principle) was, can a husband give his wife half his company (assuming future profits is $80,000) so that he can reduce his marginal tax rate of 5.375% to marginal tax rate of 2.25% for his future tax assessment?</p>

              <p>Uncertain, you have once jump into conclusion without reading the details of my discussion with M13, hence I believe it is better if I ask if you have read the following statement from Maurizio13</p>
              <p><br>I am fully aware what is required by IRAS as they are clearly stated in with website, including the part on balance sheet. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page01.aspx?id=1262">http://www.iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page01.aspx?id=1262</a></p>
              <p>Since Maurizio13 suggesting here is about one could evade tax by switching a company from sole proprietor status to a partnership and splitting the income between 2 person. hence my question is,</p>
              <p>a) Even taking into consideration of FRS 10.8, how can you justify to IRAS you need to pay 50% of the company's profit to someone who never exisit in your company during FY07? We are talking about a shareholder here, not some bad debts provision, WIP, stocks adjustment, assets reclassification etc.</p>
              <p>b) How would you do your income tax filing since, for Sole proprietor, you can only file through your personal income tax returns, while for a partnership company you must file through a Company Income tax returns which will send to the company seperately at the end of first financial year?</p>
              <p> </p>

We are talking about a shareholder here, not some bad debts provision, WIP, stocks adjustment, assets reclassification etc</strong>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">You mean one cannot split his shares into various equal parts to his sons? wife? Even singapore television show got show father split his shares to his sons.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Is there a need to justify to IRAS about the stock transfer? Got then show link.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you have been reading with your eyes open, I am sure you wont be asking me such irrelevant question because I was never interest to know if you could split a sole proprietor company into partnerships with 10,000 shareholders and a zillion shares. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Since you claim to know so much about accounting and all that FRS, I am surprise that you are not aware the for a sole proprietor company IRAS doesnt tax your company's income but rather treat it as part of your personal income and is subject to the normal personal income tax (not corporate tax)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So my question to you again is, how can you justified to IRAS that you need to split your PERSONAL income (which is also your company income) with someone who never exist in your company in the last financial year?</span> </p>
              <p><strong> b) How would you do your income tax filing since, for Sole proprietor, you can only file through your personal income tax returns, while for a partnership company you must file through a Company Income tax returns which will send to the company seperately at the end of first financial year?</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Show me the link to substantiate your point that sole proprietor declare income tax via personal income tax and partnership declare income via company income tax.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">WAH for someone who can come here to tell me what is post balance sheets event, FRS10.8 etc, still have the cheek to ask me for the link? And the best part here is that, he didnt even realised that I have already posted the damn link for him. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So I guess your early comment was nothing more than some big talking huh? Or are you thinking that you could simply come here and walk all over me? </span></p>
              <span style="color: #000000;">
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I didn't jump into any conclusion. Open ur eyes big big and read what I comment. I merely doubt your sentence on "sole proprietorship switch to partnership" with FRS 10.8.</strong> </span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The only thing u can challenge me and any other forumers here is contradict FRS 10.8 principle which i use against u in the argument why one can evade tax liability by transfering shares</span>.</strong>   </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How could you not be jumping into conclusion when you dont even know that filing of income tax return for sole proprietor and partnership companies are different, and when this is the main issue with Maurizio13 suggestion of switching the company to a partnership to take advantage the lower taxes? Are you trying to act like some HERO by talking about something that is not related to what we are talking about here?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Since you are insisting that Maurizio13 suggestion is technically and legally possible, why dont you go straight to the point of answering my questions and concern instead of trying to <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>brag about your FRS 10.8</strong></span> </span> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>If you have problem understanding what Maurizio13 was saying you can always ask you know. It is better to ask then pretending to know.</strong></p>
