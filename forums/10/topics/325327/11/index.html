              <p>I am just responding to what some forumers (might include you) are saying that they can make better returns from putting money in Australia fixed deposit than CPF 3.5%. So I am asking why didnt the australia pension fund deposit their money in fixed deposit? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are confident about Temasek and GIC making wrong decision on ML, Citi, and UBS, are you willing to bet against this investments?</p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p>Place you bet here and we revisit this thread in 12 months time?</p>

                  challenges that you put forth to them.</p>
              <p>So before I go ahead and prove you wrong and see you eat
                  shit and admit that you are lying about your property investment, I
                  would like you to agree with my following statement.</p>
              <p>Am I right to say that, you are claiming that in Singapore all
                  property price will sink together and in USA the property
                  market will not?</p>

              <p>Didn't I say it's a bad investment? Another reputable investor also thought it was a bad buy, but you seem to claim otherwise.</p>
              <p>Temasek holding on hopeful for a gain, if they back out now, there is zero chance of recuperating their loss. It's like they are stucked in that investment.</p>
              <p>Not a matter of short term targets, but it's a matter of timing the market. They bought Merrill Lynch when everybody else in the market thought it was a bad buy. If they had bought it today or end of Dec 2008, they would have paid alot less. Don't tell me they don't know the market, maybe they are just stupid that's why they didn't know, or maybe they were just punting like hedge funds.</p>
              <p>I don't know where I can find out about the exchange rate, maybe you can shed some light on it.</p>
              <p>I really admire you, despite all of sgForums disagreeing with you, you can still managed to carry on. You are really something else. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I once remembered oxford mushroom, a staunch P4P supporter calling you something stupid. Even folks in your P4P camp thinks you are stupid, that must have been depressing, but I guess it has no effect on your hide.</p>
