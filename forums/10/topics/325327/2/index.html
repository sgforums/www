              <p><br>Do you have a basic degree in finance and economics?</p>
              <p>Then as a layman, how would you know the right timing. Does a plumber know what medication to prescribe for various ailments?</p>
              <p>From the onset, lots of people already know it was a bad purchase. If Temasek were smart enough, they would have waited till end of this year to make the purchase, it would have been alot cheaper than what they paid for.</p>
              <p>I already knew it was a bad buy in the first Merrill Lynch thread. It's just that stubborn leaders like LKY and his cronies don't see it and insist on plunging billions of dollars on sure to fail investments.</p>

              <p><span>Don't count your chickens before they are hatched, Temasek is tied down in the investment for a year, meaning cannot sell off the investments till a year has passed. The shares was sold at a discount (so obviously the share price will be above discounted price) to Temasek, close to 2 months have passed and the share is still trading $50.39 (yes, since you last posted 2 hours ago @ 9.58AM the share price has dipped $1.07). Maybe if you had posted this immediately after Temasek bought over, the shares of Merril Lynch would be trading around $53, which you can claim that Temasek made a worthwhile investment, because the shares was sold at a discount. The share price is on a downtrend, not an uptrend since Temasek's purchase.</span></p>

              <p><em>Temasek will buy $4.4 billion worth of Merrill stock with an option for $600 million more by March 28. Merrill gave Temasek a discount partly in exchange for a lock-up agreement that keeps the investor from selling shares for a year.</em></p>

              <p>Anything can happen in a year, if the US recession becomes a reality (which I most often think it will), there will be more job losses and defaults on mortgages exacerbating the already traumatised financial sector.</p>

              <p>An initial purchase price of US$4.4 billion of US$48 per share has dropped to a price of $24.33 per share, a lost of US$2.2 billions just for Merill Lynch.</p>

              <p>Revenue Breakdown of Merril Lynch</p>
              <p>If you want to buy one of the banks, UBS or Citi bank would be a better choice as ML dervies bulk of its earnings from US. UBS i last checked  dervies more of its earnings from overseas than US.</p>
              <p>Looking at how Fed is printing money to solve problems, a US dollar fall may erase the gains from buying ML.</p>
              <p>I am considering making a purchase on UBS or Citibank but i am still doing research. This most important thing is to limit your exposure to banks at a max of 20% of your investments. If i decide to go ahead, i would split the investment into 4 or 5 tranches to be bought over a period of 1-1.5 years.</p>
              <p>There is a risk that they can go "Kaput" like bear stearns. you dont
                          know what kind of things they can hide in their balance sheets.</p>
              <p><strong>Anyone has any tips/info/advice on whether to buy the banks?</strong></p>

              <p>The only time when such banking stocks will not recover is when the company goes belly up. And as long as Singapore government has reasonable amount of confident and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ability </span>to prevent banks from folding, then I am 99% certain that the stock price will recover.</p>
              <p>You have got to remember that banking stocks are usually the one that recovers ahead of the rest and in good times, these banks are making billions every quarter. And also in time of high inflation and slow economic growth like now, the opportunities for high return investments will also get rarer and rarer and the risk of investment across the board will also get higher.</p>
              <p>If not banks, where else should Singapore government be increasing their investment? </p>

              <p>The only time when such banking stocks will not recover is when
                          the company goes belly up. And as long as Singapore government has
                          reasonable amount of confident and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ability</span> to prevent
                          banks from folding, then I am 99% certain that the stock price
                          will recover.</p>
              <p>You have got to remember that banking stocks are usually the one
                          that recovers ahead of the rest and in good times, these banks
                          are making billions every quarter. And also in time of high
                          inflation and slow economic growth like
                          now, the opportunities for high return investments
                          will also get rarer and rarer and the risk of investment
                          across the board will also get higher.</p>
              <p>If not banks, where else should Singapore government
                          be increasing their investment? </p>

              <p><strong>I took a post from M13</strong>. This is a possible scenario</p>
              <p><strong><em>Anything can happen in a year, if the US recession becomes a
                                                  reality (which I most often think it will), there will be
                                                  more job losses and defaults on mortgages exacerbating the
                                                  already traumatised financial sector.</em></strong></p>
              <p>The kind of analysis you are giving is self justification for holding for a losing stock. Believing that a stock would definitely go up.</p>
              <p>In investments there are no certainties, only <strong>Risks versus Rewards</strong>.To prevent a complete wipe out of investment like bear stearns, one has to control the percentage of exposure of a portfolio.</p>
              <p>Whether to buy banking stocks depends on your current portfolio. If you have zero exposure, maybe now its a time to consider buying a little.<strong>(if you have an appetitie for risks)</strong> If you bought at the same timing as GIC or Temasek, its simply foolish to average down your losses.</p>
