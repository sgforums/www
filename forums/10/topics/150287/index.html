            <div class='col-md body'>Felt rather sad after reading this article in singaland.blogspot.com:<br><br>Malaysiakini<br>S'pore: Consumer spending not central to economy<br>Robert Schwatrz<br>Aug 24, 05 11:30am<br><br>Writing about Singapore's economic outlook is boring. It's not that there is nothing to say, it's that there is nothing to say about Singapore itself.<br><br>In 2001, the trade and industry ministry published a paper that looked at the four primary long- term drivers of Singapore's economy. The number one influence was growth in the United States.<br><br>Number two? Growth in the economies of Indonesia and Malaysia. Third was global semiconductor sales. And rounding out the top four was domestic construction.<br><br>But wait, you might say, what about Singaporeans' love of shopping? Certainly that has to count for something? You're right it does.<br><br>The problem is that SingaporeansÂ’ love of shopping is usually done someplace other than in Singapore. The fastest growing component of private consumption over the past decade or so has been Resident Expenditure Abroad.<br><br>Of the spending done in Singapore, the fastest growing type of retailer (by far) has been motor vehicle dealers. From 1997 to the third quarter of last year, dealership sales had increased by a total of nearly 260 percent, not including the effects of inflation.<br><br>The next fastest growing category was supermarkets, which grew by a total of nearly 32 percent. Overall, non-motor vehicle retail turnover grew, excluding inflation, by a total of 7.1 percent from 1997 through September 2004.<br><br>The key to Singapore's retail sector is not the average Singaporean. The key to retail in Singapore is the overseas visitor. If you want to get a handle on how well the sector is doing, look at the growth in visitor numbers. These have traditionally led the retail numbers.<br><br>No political voice<br><br>So again, where does this leave the people of Singapore? In their government housing units voting for the PAP every so often and that's about it. As far as making the economy move forward, the average Singaporean is a non-event. And as such, he or she has little say in the political environment. No economic clout =no political constituency = no audible political voice.<br><br>The consumer's share of Singapore's economy is around 42 percent. This compares to about 55 percent in Japan, a country notorious for saving, and close to 70 percent in the US. It is not coincidental that the average American, who is such a vital part of the US economy, has such a central role in the political sphere.<br><br>In fact, the average consumer in the US has more power over the direction of the Singapore economy than does the average Singaporean. It is the continually increased spending on ever more gadget-filled electronics equipment or on a new lifestyle drug done by a typical American that drives the sales which drive Singapore's production.<br><br>To be fair to the government, it knows that any money spent on boosting the consumption of average Singaporeans is money that will very quickly find its way to foreign shores. As such, the PAP has decided that it would prefer not to spend its hard-earned tax revenues boosting the local economies of Batam, Johor or Bangkok.<br><br>This is also why the government's interest in the domestic consumer economy is limited to construction. This is a section of the economy that can't be taken out of the country.</div>

Just recall what the government has done during the recessions of 1990s - constantly denying problems and pushing them away to external forces beyond their control. They tried to give a lot of excuses and even put the blame on the workers except themselves.<br><br>If our leaders are some leaders of nation, people might just understand and try to go along with what they say. But our leaders have been constantly claiming their talents and leadership and have paid themselves the world's highest wages.<br><br>So naturally people are asking them to be responsible and to deliver. If they are no economists they are still responsible and should know how to manage the macro- and micro- aspects of the economy. If they cannot trust the economists, then they should employ the right people with implementation abilities and not all the conceptual academicians to run the country.</div>
