Many people living in this region are attracted to Singapore. Especially the Indonesians. With people like them putting their wealth in Singapore, Singapore will surely "maju". No doubt about that.<br><br>Migration wise, people come and go. Thats the way of life. In fact, people started moving around since ancient times.... Therefore, this is nothing new.<br><br>But comparing with Hong Kong, Singapore CAN NEVER and WILL NEVER outbeat HK. Hong Kong is like a "gateway" to China for many foreign investors and the recent results showed that Hong Kong is ranked No.1 as the World's Freest Economy whereas Singapore is a couple of No. below that. And on top of that, the lifestyle in Hong Kong is much better than compared to Singapore. Eg, the food is hell lot of better in HK... Bigger market=more business opportunities etc.<br><br></div></blockquote>Hong Kong people smarter. They tend to think much further ahead of Singaporean.
