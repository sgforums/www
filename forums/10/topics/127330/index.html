            <div class='col-md body'>From The Electronic New Paper<br><strong>ABOUT MONEY, NOT MORALS</strong><br><br>It all boils down to this, they argue.<br><br>Even if 'the world has changed', as pro-casino advocates put it, Singapore CAN afford to take a different path from regional competitors like Malaysia and Macau, and yet not be left behind.<br><br>Why? Because, ultimately, long-term risks matter more than short-term ones. And, yes, they insist - we're talking money here, not morals.<br><br>Even with a resort-cum-casino projected to pull in nearly $5 billion a year in revenues and taxes, adding as much as 1 per cent GDP growth and spinning off 10,000 jobs or more, the economic numbers eventually won't hold up.<br><br>The simple reason: Long after the high-rolling visitors have left our shores, the locals will end up mopping the bill for the broader fallout - bankruptcies, job losses, crime, divorces, dysfunctional families, rehabilitation programmes.<br><br>Australian and US studies, after all, have shown that even if tourists are the prime targets, some two per cent of locals will almost always become problem gamblers - with or without 'social safeguards' in place.<br><br>In the Singapore context, according to a government survey released this week, that adds up to 55,000 residents, not counting the spillover impact on their families.<br><br>So no, society won't 'break down' overnight. But looking ahead, the casino's detractors stress, it's not a gamble worth taking.<br><br>Has the Government heard them loud and clear? Well, their hope is, once D-Day is over in the next 24 hours, it'll be a case of 'all bets are off'.<br><br>Literally.<br><strong></strong></div>
