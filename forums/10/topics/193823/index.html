            <div class='col-md body'>After two recent severe economic recessions of the 1997-1999 and 2000-2002, we have heard from the Minister of Finance of formation of Economic Restructuring Committees and their recommendations.<br><br>What have happened to the works of these two ERC. Anyone answerable? Have we reached the target of creating new technology start-ups to manufacture international products and create international brand names as done by Acer of Taiwan over the period 1970s - present.<br><br>Let's face it, we need creative and entrepreneurial ministers in this larger area of government not so many lawyers to impose more controls over the populations to ensure law and order.<br><br>Learn from Stanley Shih of Acer of Taiwan who recently was interviewed by CNA on how he built up Acer. He said this: When I was a young graduate, I began to dream of (1) How to manufacture international products needed by the world and (2) How to build International Brand Names to market the products.<br><br>If only we have such ministers who know how to build these dreams we would have done well. Right now, we have none despite claim by our leaders of having engaged many scholars over the years to restructure the economy to "value-adding" technology-driven new economy. Nothing like this has happened yet and there is no regular report made to citizens that our ministers or someone with the passion is doing so.<br><br>Then why are we paying them million dollars in salaries and bonuses to do routine maintenance?</div>

For 1/10 of our minister's pay, he might do plenty more to restructure the economy.<br><br>Our kopitiam king was an Ah Pek before but has now set up many stores in China. Can anyone of our ministers claim to have half of his entrepreneurship. It is the opportunity given to our leader that makes him what he is but he cleverly makes it look like he has so many talents.<br><br>Many local talents simply are denied the opportunity and could not do much. Some are driving taxis.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was just joking.... but true that this is a land of opportunities repressed rather than a land of opportunities.<br><br>To be a land of opportunities, there cannot be this orderliness. Orderliness means that many people are suppressed and many rules and regulations in existence. These rules and regulations then kill the spirit of enterprise or makes it impossible to survive.<br></div>

If subordinates cannot quote do it as the report calls for too much complex actions. ministers might just think of some excuses and still approve their 8 months' bonus to say "well done".<br><br>That is why we keeping seeing justification look-good images with so many ministers and senior civil lords talking so eloquently on TV even (CNA 3.6.2006) as they put aside these last two ERC nicely done reports and say no more but very quick to tell Singaporeans they have done well in some other areas like computerization.<br><br>Who cannot do it - buy more computers and employ more programmers !!! This is the meaning of Talents and ERCs in the context of Singapore.</div>

One is perhaps Mr. Wong of Venture Group who trained his managers to keep up with latest world trends in various technology. Another is the Popiah King who knows how to make our Popiah skin international cuisince.<br><br>There is also the Banking tycoon and others but sadly by our leader's tunnel vision of talents the assumption is that a talent is someone who has passed examination well.<br><br>So Mr. Wong, Mr. Sim may not qualify for tea sessions. Leaders do not want to look wrong in their policies or assumptions. Moreover leaders had intended to make use of scholars as political tool to control population so they will not likely welcome anyone offering as practical talents to upset his theory about talents.</div>
