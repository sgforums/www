              <p>When you are being molested, you felt cheated and betrayed, life can go into an depression with sudden bout of anger. At this moment, they need lots of caring and understanding....just like those gals who get break off with bf or divorced, they are easy prey for the next wolf in human skin who can give sweet talk which utimately, these gals will fall for them. So, i think George Yeo is also another wolf, he hopes that molest victim can talk to him or his gangs, which will provide and opportunity for him or his colleagues to take advantage of it.</p>

              <p>Hey B1tch,women get molested many a times also their fault.Like sometimes ago,got report that a gal get molested in Sentosa by Bangala or something.From what i see on the picture,she was dancing near those men,n might flirt with them.Thats why she get molested.If a women dont want to get molested or rape,she wont do any seducing move.</p>
              <p>I hate some women who intentionally act b!tchy n then pretend innocent and accuse ppl of molesting them or assault them.They are just trying to catch other ppl attention or hope it can report in the newspaper n make them famous.Damn fuking attention seeking whores,we men would care less about these kind of fuk up things.We are not stupid.</p>

              <p>I remember many a times,i saw some Chinese gals who dating other races like Indians or Cacausians,then,they purposely talk loudly n laugh loudly in the public or buses just to catch other ppl attention.Just like trying to tell others"Hey,i am dating other races,look over here".Jesus....really attention seeking whore,who give a damn about this thing?</p>
              <p>I am not against inter-racial marriage,n it is common in here.But,i really hate some b!tchy women who like to "publicize" themselves.They are acting so immature.I also know many guys whom i met before who also dating other races or married to other races,but they act normally or stay low profiles.Unlike those attention seeking b!tch.</p>
              <p>But then again,i also saw many Cacausian women married to other races like Indian,Chinese n other Asian ppl.But they behave normally,not like some attention seeking b!tch.</p>

              <h1>Netizens continue to hurl brickbats at George Yeo despite his “apology” to molest victim</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">January 17, 2010</span></p>
              <p>Despite his apology to a molest victim for his earlier curt reply on his Facebook, netizens continue to hurl brickbats at Foreign Minister George Yeo.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">On 11 January 2010, a Miss Ang posted a comment on Mr Yeo’s Facebook seeking help to expedite police investigations in a pending molest case. Miss Yeo had lodged a report in November last year and had yet to receive a reply from the police.</span></p>
              <p>Mr Yeo’s immediate reply was:</p>
              <p><strong>“Please see your MP”.</strong></p>
              <p><span>After we published the story, a massive furore was sparked in cyberspace with many netizens lambasting Mr Yeo for his lack of empathy and sensitivity. The post has since been deleted from Mr Yeo’s Facebook.</span></p>
              <p><span>Mr Yeo subsequently apologized to Miss Ang in a private message on her Facebook:</span></p>
              <p><span> </span><span><span id="intelliTXT">“I must also apologize to you if my original reply on FB sounded curt. Such cases are always better handled face to face, discreetly.”</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>It seemed that Mr Yeo’s apology wasn’t quite enough to placate the lingering anger of some netizens.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><strong>The Patriot</strong> felt his apology lacked sincerity:</span></span></p>
              <p><em>“TR, you are too kind to give credit to Mr Yeo’s apology. But apologizing and still not making immediate effort to solve Miss Ang’s problem after knowing the outcry of the public is only perpetuating his apathetic, careless and ‘you-die-is-your-business’ attitude towards we peasant Singaporeans….Does GY’s second statement sounds that he has make any effort to help Miss Ang in the form of action or advice or sounds more that ‘Pls don’t disturb me, I just came from an exotic country for holiday. I need to see my kids first.”</em></p>
              <p><strong>Wui </strong>wasn’t surprised by Mr Yeo’s initial reply at all:</p>
              <p><em>“A curt reply that perhaps reflects well in reality the attitude of many members of the ruling party.”</em></p>
              <p><strong>helplesslydependent </strong>felt it is a shame that he apologized only an outcry by netizens:</p>
              <p><em>“To appologise after an outcry by netizens is a Big Disappointment! What a shame.”</em></p>
              <p><strong>bullshits</strong> believed there is a political motive behind Mr Yeo’s apology:</p>
              <p><em>“Alamak! all these moron PAP MPs are just doing it now cos the election is near. They are not sincere lah! That’s how this bunch of<br>papaya monkeys operate…..they want our votes! that is the main reason why they are so nice and humbug (ops!humble)”</em></p>
              <p>While some netizens remain skeptical about Mr Yeo’s apology, others applauded him for doing so.</p>
              <p><strong>MV</strong> wrote:</p>
              <p><em>“Guess to be fair, he did apologize, it does take a real man to do it, especially one of a public stature like his. Trust me, it does: not once have I seen an even more public Singapore figure even remotely apologetic for doing even more dastardly deeds (say, jailing opponents unjustly without trial for personal ends, and ruining their God-given lives). Talk about being a real man?? I’d like to think though, that Mr. George Yeo is a big-hearted enough man to (would have) apologize(d) upon self-reflection rather than after public pressure?”</em></p>
              <p><strong>CPT </strong>related from his own personal experience that Mr Yeo is a “good” man:</p>
              <p><em>“BG George Yeo as a person is a good man. I interact with him in quite a few occasion in the those SAF days. Things might change when he enter politics and become a politician. he might not have a choice but to adapt to pap environment.”</em></p>
              <p><strong>cy </strong>hoped to see more ministers emulating Mr Yeo’s example:</p>
              <p><em>“After Khaw has apologized for the KKH medical error, now we have the 2nd minister to apologize all thanks to TR, expect to see more of these cases of ministers’ apology after they are exposed on the internet, for those ministers like WKS ,yaccob, MBT,etc. who haven’t apologize for even serious mistakes than george yeo or khaw, we netizens will keep on harping until you apologize or are kicked out.”</em></p>
              <p>Singapore’s leaders are not known for their humility. Few have ever bothered to apologize for their mistakes which are often blamed on the hapless Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>When famed terrorist Mas Selamat made his outrageous escape from a detention center two years ago, MM Lee Kuan Yew put the blame on Singaporeans for being “complacent”.</p>
              <p>The Geylang Indian Rojak mass food poisoning was blamed on the “poor hygiene habits” of Singporeans by Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan.</p>
              <p>As for first-time home buyers who are unable to obtain a unit of their choice, they are faulted for being too “choosy” by National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan.</p>
              <p>Are Singaporeans supposed to apologize collectively to their millionaire ministers for making life “difficult” for them?</p>
              <p>In other first world countries, ministers are regarded as no more than public servants subservient to the will of the people. It seems to be the other way round in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Though Singaporeans are paying the salaries of their leaders, they often behave as if we owe them a living which is not surprising since there is no political pressure on them to do otherwise.</p>
