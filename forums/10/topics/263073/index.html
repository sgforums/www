            <div class='col-md body'>[quote="We Sue Men"][size=18]<span style="color: darkred;"><br>June 21, 2007<br><strong><br>Ex-steward cleared of molestation charges</strong><br><br>A FORMER flight steward was cleared on Tuesday of two counts of<br>molesting a woman colleague after the court allowed the matter to<br>be compounded.<br><br>Mr Francis Gerard Han Khai Meng, 34, now an assistant director with the<br>People's Association (Now I know what people meant when they say,<br>" I am making a 'strategic career move' "...), was charged in March this<br>year with two counts of outraging the modesty of the 24-year-old woman<br>on board a Singapore Airlines flight on April 26, 2004.<br><br>On both counts, he was said to have grabbed her right hand and placed<br>it on his private part. He had also earlier been accused of insulting her<br>modesty twice that day. It is not known why he was charged only this<br>year.<br><br>His case was originally fixed for a three-day hearing before District Judge<br>Roy Neighbour.<br><br>Yesterday, Assistant Public Prosecutor Simran Toor told the court that the<br>alleged victim and the accused had agreed on terms for composition of the<br>two molestation charges, and the prosecution had no objection.<br><br>As part of the settlement, Mr Han gave $10,000 to the victim as<br>compensation, apologised to her in open court, and will publish an apology<br>in The Straits Times. He was given a warning on the two charges of insult<br>of modesty.<br><br>Mr Han was acquitted of these charges after the prosecutor withdrew<br>them. The alleged victim, who was in court yesterday, declined comment.<br><br>Outraging of modesty, voluntarily causing hurt and criminal intimidation<br>are charges that can be compounded. Composition is the same as an<br>acquittal. The alleged victim and prosecution must agree to this but the<br>judge has the final say. [/size]</span><br><br>This Han Khai Meng was a Returning Officer in GE2006.<br><br>http://www.elections.gov.sg/gazette/20060420f.pdf<br><br>So, I think he must have some very good connections.<br>May be, he is one of the PAP inner circle people?<br>Who really knows?<br><br>Does BigCannonKing's MP knows?  Good to have friend, hah?[/quote]<br><br>Earlier, Phey Yew Kok slipped the dragnet of the law. Then came some influential pianist and high-profile drug offender. Lately NKF Richard Yong.<br><br>It looks like the high-profile offenders can have special corridor to slip off because they are well connected. The ministers still want the world to believe their policy to ban public rallies or free speeches spoken in the course of electioneering is for maintenance of law and order or rule of law as publicized to the whole world in the tiff with peaceful WTO demonstrators.<br><br>If this is not governing by justification and hypocrisy then what is?</div>

There was consensus on the first two items on the agenda, but less on the last two. The built-in agenda of the Uruguay Round agreements constituted the main framework for the future work programme.<br></div>
