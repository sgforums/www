              Wong Kan Seng in Parliament, 28 February 2008</em></div>
              <div>
              <div><em>There has been a security lapse at the Whitley Road
              Detention Centre, which allowed Mas Selamat to escape. He was taken
              out of his cell to go to the family visitation room to wait for his
              family. He requested to go to the toilet and escaped. This
              should never have happened. I am sorry that it has.</em></div>
              <div><em> </em></div>
              <div><em>An independent investigation is underway. We should
              not speculate now. Security at the centre has been stepped
              up. </em></div>
              <div><em> </em></div>
              <div><em>Mas Selamat is a security threat which is why he was
              placed under preventive detention. However, there is no
              information that he has any plans that threaten public
              safety. Nevertheless, we are not taking any
              chances.</em></div>
              <div><em> </em></div>
              <div><em>Our security agencies assessed that he was of no imminent
              danger to the public. The focus then was to lockdown the immediate
              vicinity of the detention centre and start a systematic search. The
              priority is to find and arrest Mas Selamat. No efforts will be
              spared to track him down. Security at our land, sea and air
              checkpoints have been tightened, including areas where there may be
              a possibility that he may leave from places which are not the
              normal checkpoints.</em></div>
              <div><em> </em></div>
              <div><em>In the meantime, I urge the public to stay calm and to
              report any suspicious sightings to the Police
              immediately. Anyone who renders assistance to him is
              committing a grave offence.</em></div>

              <p>yah, did that minister quit when the airport is under attack? he quit after the thing ends. this should round up the immediate statement by WKS.</p>
              <p>let's move on to whether WKS should quit. let's compare the mumbai airport terrorisim to the mas selamat escape. 195 dead. wow, suddenly the comparison is not very viable anymore.</p>
              <p>let's come up with a closer example of ministers quitting their jobs to compare instead.</p>

              <p>i find it hard to compare 195 deaths, the shutting down of an international airport to the escape of a lame terrorist.</p>
              <p>i think you can compare that to maybe micheal scoffield and alot of others breaking out of prison and the warden had to resign. by contrast, the superintendent of the whitley detention had to resign.</p>
