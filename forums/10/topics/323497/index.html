              <p>Liquor store owner Navtej Singh, 30, was fatally shot at his shop on June 7.</p>
              <p>A week later, Yan Ping Yang, 80, died after having been attacked by an intruder in her home three days earlier.</p>
              <p>On June 16, Joanne Wang, 39, was knocked down by a stolen vehicle in
              a shopping mall car park after her handbag was snatched. She died in
              hospital.</p>
              <p>The New Zealand Herald newspaper said in an editorial this month
              that the Asian Anti-Crime Group should not be advocating a sort of
              vigilante action where violence is met with violence.</p>

              <p>Protest organiser and group founder Peter Law said Asian people were
              being ignored by the police and the march "probably made history".</p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p>"We
              have never had a protest of this size involving the Asian community and
              so I hope we are heard today," said Law. "This is not only about crime,
              it is about the poor justice system that breeds criminals and ignores
              the needs of the victims.<span style="color: #888888;"> <br></span></p>

              <p>&lt;Canada reported recently that there are 26,100 applicants from S'pore
              for their economic visa category. (That is the skilled workers and
              business class). I find this a shocking number, as this number DOES not
              include the family class applicants from S'pore. I estimate both
              categories should be at least 40,000 applicants. If we assume equal if
              not greater number of S'poreans are applying for Australia, US, and UK,
              we can estimate that a number approximately 150,000 or more are
              applying for overseas emigration. Taking the NAtive born singaporean
              population at 2.7 million, greater than 5% of the entire native
              singapore population is trying to leave the country. Majullah

              <p>Reported in our NewPaper</p>
              <p>'They came out of nowhere'</p>
              <p>THE parang attack ended as swiftly as it had begun.</p>
              <p>In less than five minutes, the attackers had fled the scene after pouncing on a group of seven friends.</p>
              <p>The silence was telling too. It was as if the gang of around eight male attackers was focused on just slashing their victims.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>One victim said the attackers were so quiet that all he could hear was the sounds of parangs slicing their bodies.</strong></span></p>
              <p> But the ferocity of the attack was never in doubt.</p>
              <p>It left two victims lying in a pool of their own blood.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>One had his left hand nearly chopped off - he "could feel it dangling".</strong></span></p>
              <p>Another victim managed to flee the scene, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>but not before getting a deep cut that stretched from his right ear to his mouth.</strong></span></p>
              <p>A fourth man and the three women who were with them escaped unharmed.</p>
              <p>All three victims, men in their mid-20s, survived the vicious attack, which happened outside Liang Court shopping complex near Clarke Quay at about 4am on Sunday.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">It was the latest in a string of similar horrific incidents.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The trio, who are colleagues at a pest control company, and their family members declined to be identified when The New Paper spoke to them in hospital.</p>
              <p>All three victims claimed the attack had been unprovoked and that neither they nor their friends had offended anyone recently.</p>
              <p>They also insisted they had not stepped on anyone's toes while partying at the nearby Ministry of Sound (MOS) on Saturday night, shortly before they were attacked.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Singapore Tyrannosaur, i think you are missing the whole point of the protest... the protestors in NZ are protesting against a perceived crime wave aginst asians... not against crime in general.. so comparing the crimes in SG against those in NZ is a bit different, since crimes in SG tend to be less motivated by race, though i don't deny some may be motivated by that..</p></div>

              <p>Hmm pigsticker, I think if you look at lionnoisy's posts, you'll realize that it's not so much a post to do anything with the actual crime situtation in Australia then simply lionnoisy's usual attempt to find any random negative article on Australia and then starting a new thread about it in here.</p>
              <p>The best part is that virtually everyone in here is not even interested in what is happening in Australia to begin with, and the starting of such threads by lionnoisy seems to me less motivated by actually wanting to engage in meaningful discussion and actually more of "letting off some steam" by trying to get over his inability to win anything in here by copying and pasting some irrelevant media article that nobody cares about but that somehow makes him feel better.</p>
              <p>Basically the gist of what noisylion is trying to tell lionnoisy is this: since lionnoisy's threads are also not about any meaningful discussion by simple copy and pasting of media articles and then entering several poorly worded lines to support some paper-thin argument derived from the media articles, it is PRECISELY what his threads will become, and that is a thread in which media articles are simply copy and pasted and backed up with shallow and poorly worded single-line arguments.</p>
              <p>lionnoisy didn't come</p>
              <p>At least we can attribute the crimes in Australia to the challanges of dealing with social issues that stem from many complex factors. What can be said about the random and vicious crimes that happen in, if lionnoisy is to be believed, our safe and clean city state?</p>
              <p>Unfortunately lionnoisy is always at an disadvantage when it comes to copy and pasting media articles... his articles are simply about things that are too far out and irrelevant for the average person in here, and it certainly won't deter any person who is seriously considering to moving to Australia. BUT what does strike home for us is not if Australia has crime or whatever, but our dengue situtation, the random parang attacks and all that stuff. Worse, we all know all this things happen practically at our doorstep, given we are all crammed in a tiny 700km square place.</p>
              <p>As you can see, lionnoisy is feeling the strain, that's why he bothered to ask noisylion not to post any negative articles on Singapore in here to counter him, claiming he already knows. But noisylion on the other hand, is perfectly comfortable with lionnoisy posting whatever articles on Australia.</p>
              <p>But of course we all know that it's not about knowing, lionnoisy is simply here to show off, and even in that he can't win.</p>
