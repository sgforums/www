              <p><span class="postbody">Doctors are require to swear on oath they would do everything to save and prolong life.
              <br> In the case of an over-confident autocracy, it will do everything
              unpopular as necessary to save a few dollars for the state coffer.
              <br> <br>The poor cannot expect any help as there will be no free lunch.
              Ministers however can take monies as they like from the people's taxes
              and GST to be paid on par with Sim Wong Hoo or Wee Chaw Yao because by
              not paying them such equivalents citizens may lose the talents
              possessed by these ministers else ministers may also turn corrupt.
              <br> <br>Worse if anything should go wrong with the economy it will just
              take in lower-wage foreign workers to replace the local who would have
              to collect empty bins to carry on living.
              <br> <br>Worse still such a government will say :Don't expect us to use tax
              payers' monies to prolong your life. If you are in a coma it is better
              to switch off the machine .. Does such a society still value life as it
              claims on other occasions like talking to foreign journalists about the
              Zichuan quake disaster. Does such a society still insist doctors in
              signing up for his profession must take the hypo oath to save and
              prolong life ... or must the young doctor now be asked to switch off
              the machine to save public tax monies for government to hoard a bigger
              surplus.
              <br> <br>This is the kind of inhuman society we are building and we are told
              government will send its rescue team to Myanmar or China - don't know
              for what purpose.</span></p>

              <p>It is amazing how your thought process moved furiously from one line to another in one blind slide - like the 'careless bear' that slipped and skid on the slippery ice surface in your '<em>avatar'</em>.</p>
              <p>With MIW claiming to be the few talented Singaporeans in control of Singapore - and is actually in control of 82 seats in Parliament - is this not a fact that they are responsible for all the events that happen in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Every aspect of Life in Singapore is in the hands of this Ruling Political Party that manipulated the big and small events affecting every Singaporean across all ages - from cradle to grave.</p>
              <p>What you see as Bobby's nonsense may not necessarily be seen as the same by others who are less articulate in expressing themselves, and have to suffer in abject silence without the means to bring their experience to the attention of anyone.</p>
              <p>Your vehement derogatory words thrown at Bobby seems to be typical of a frustrated person embroiled in the same boiling soup as all other Singaporean. Your anger reflects your sense of impotentence or incompetence to offer anything better to resolve your own position, and simply prefer to live in the boil and not be reminded by Bobby's diligent efforts.</p>
              <p>If you cannot accept his views, why stop him from exercising his Rights to his views ?</p>
              <p>Why will you draw your circle of criticism to insult the larger Singaporean community that still support the Alternative Parties - including CSJ and the SDP ?</p>
              <p>Sadly, and if at all - it seems that you are the one that do not know how to differentiate between caviar and CSJ's shit, and perfume from his fart - as even a kindergarten child will know how to instinctively withdraw from the pungence.</p>
              <p>As usual your remarks are insulting and more then condescendingly disrespectful towards others in this forum who may or maynot be diehard anti-MIW.</p>
              <p>If you cannot accept Bobby's views, why will you even want to click on his thread ?</p>

              Atobe and bobbies are only ordinary citizens offering their 2 cents' worth of views to check on government's wrongful acts and policies.
              
              They are not too concerned with countering anyone's views to the extent of wanting to debunk them and persuading them not to post their views in any way.
              
              Can you and bear say the same. If there were more Atobes and Bobbies during the past 40 plus years we might not have gone through such problems like NKF and Shin Corp.
              
              Whether you and bear are persistent in intercepting the more articulate views of Atobe or Bobbies, let all forumers here be the judge.
              
              Please do report back to the leaders who sent you here that their counter-insurgency itself might be evil and illegal and anti-progress and anti-people as there is no basis for a government being paid to do its duties to stop people from questioning their wrong doings openly or covertly in the press or internet media.

              You have now acted like you are the protector of past 40 years of glories refusing to see the same glories of the past are no longer glories but liabilities. Within the first 10 years the leaders have done well but thereafter due to their autocracy and insensitivities to people's needs and aspirations they have taken the route as posted in "Our Elitist Governing Philosophy".
              
              For years now people want a more caring governing system as enunciated by Dr. Catherine Lim or Ex-civil servant Ngiam Tong Dow.
              
              Have the leaders changed their elitist governing self-glorifying philosophy one bit ? GST was increased by another 2% in years of bigger surpluses just for self-glory and more of people's monies are splurged on grandiose projects and ministers and public servants are getting a few months of bonuses on top of NKF type of peanut rewards and more monies are being hoarded to be lost on Shin Corp and Global Crossing. What have the leaders done to deserve silent support of Atobe or Bobbies?

              <p>Wrong! What the people want is continued prosperity for the nation in the midst of rising competition from China and regional nations. The ruling party has delivered that. Nobody agrees with all of the government's policy and even I have gone on record criticising the government's support for Thaksin, for example. I thought Thaksin was a spent force and we should have hanged him in favour of the military junta who had the support of the Thai king. I was wrong and Thaksin's faction is now back in power.</p>

              In my tinted glass I still see government as behaving like hypocrite and a big bully so this is the gist of my criticisms of government who of course up to now is still too thick-skinned to accept errors and is trying to counter such criticisms adopting a negative attitude towards such criticisms playing with their so-called 40 plus years of great achievements benefiting themselves at the expense of the ordinary people who are struggling and are losing their CPF retirements due to government's immoral attitude and wrong policies.

              <p>Similarly, I do not generalise that the 66.6% Singaporeans that voted PAP - as apple-polishers or carpet beggars, as most Singaporeans are 'apolitical' and are mere 'passive' opportunists numbed by the threats and acts of ''political abuses'' that the PAP Leadership had unashamedly used to demolish anyone who dare to oppose them.</p>
              <p>The majority of the passive Singaporean prefer to turn a blind eye to the feast on the table reserved for the Elitist Ruling Class, and are resigned to only hope for the crumbs to fall off from the Elitists' tables at their own leisurely pace.</p>
              <p>Why will I want to antagonise the larger Singaporean population, who wish to continue with their deep slumber ?</p>
              <p>I will engage only those who are prepared to be engaged, and will challenge anyone's position that I see to be flawed, and will open myself to the same treatment in this SgForum.</p>

              <p><br>The Ruling Party has managed to gain their political position to govern Singapore by dishonest means at every election, and won each Election through guile and unprincipled means that any First World Country will be ashamed of.</p>
              <p>This little Red Dot of 4.5 Million persons has less then two-thirds being Citizens, and less then half are eligible voters, yet there are 84 members of Parliament to be elected, or which on Nomination Day - almost half are already considered walk-over win for the incumbent Ruling Political Party.</p>
              <p>The purposeful use of the enlarge parliament, grouped in enlarged GRCs under the pretext of ensuring representation of the minority ethnic groups in Parliament, coupled with a high election deposit fees - are all designed to prevent any candidates from an already impoverished Alternative Political Parties from creating any upset to the incumbent political party.</p>
              <p>With legislations in place that prevent any large anonymous donations from Singaporeans - as many would have been targeted for petty political reprisal by the Ruling Party - and this legislation was designed to hit the treasury of the Alternative Political Parties.</p>
              <p>The control of the broadcast and print media - including attempts to even control the internet during the election - have resulted in an unbalanced public exposure in favor of the incumbent Ruling Political Party. This situation is made worst by the bias and lop sided exposure of negative news concerning the Alternative Political Parties, and with such news given extra prominence over an extended period.</p>
              <p>Still, it was remarkable that for a group of 'political newbies' seen as light weight politiicans from the WP, its GRC for Ang Mo Kio was able to make a big dent to the PAP GRC for the same constituency led by PM LHL.</p>
              <p>If the entire election was held with a more level field, Singapore would have seen a more open and fairer election.</p>
              <p>Bias, prejudice, vitriol from my postings ?</p>
              <p>You see what you wish to see - which surprisingly you seem to be blinkered to the same acts from the PAP Elites towards members of the Alternative Political Parties 24/7 throughout the year - before, during and post-Election.</p>
              <p>Compare the Political Environment with that in the UK - it is more than a world apart, yet MM LKY can dare claim to have brought Singapore into the First World.</p>

              <p>Inflation has reached an all time high of 6.7% for the month of March - and the middle-income group has shrunk in size, with more down-grading to near the Standard of Living of the lower-income group.</p>

              <p>The insecurity of the Ruling Political Party has led to the persecution with such venom on political challenges from the former Solicitor-General Francis Seow, and the other loyal Singaporean Citizen Tang Liang Hong, which led them to exile themselves from Singapore or resulting in their permanent imprisonment after a political show trial.</p>

              <p>The insecurity of the Ruling Political Party has led to the persecution with such venom on political challenges from the former Solicitor-General Francis Seow, and the other loyal Singaporean Citizen Tang Liang Hong, which led them to exile themselves from Singapore or resulting in their permanent imprisonment after a political show trial.</p>
              <p>The political venom is nothing compared to the seeming vitriol that you see in the posts from Robertteh and Atobe.</p>
              <p>If you cannot stand up to such political debate, you are still a virgin taking a walk in a Red-Dot district where you do not belong.</p>
              <p>Stay on in the UK, where you are safer.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000080;">I am not surprised that you will avoid what you - and the MIW goons - cannot face as the truth, and bankrupt of logical defensible arguments will then deride the Philippines in the usual characteristic manner, in a vain attempt to hide the failures of Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Why will you and the MIW not compare the pathetic political and economic state of affairs in Singapore at this time, with the other First World Nations that MM LKY has boasted Singapore belong to ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Are you not like the Filippinas, having to sell your services to work in the UK, which probably is due to the fact that no one in Singapore - including the Government - had found your skill to be of no use ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Should we say ''good riddance to bad rubbish'' - when at least most garbage in Singapore are still worth alot more being recycled ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Firstly, before you talk about having any balls - do you have the brains then the balls to have said your piece against the Singapore Government supporting Thaksin, by transferring S$3 Billion to Thaksin's private account to buy over his Shin Corp ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">It was a disaster in the making, as there were already early signs rumbling amongst the civilian and military elites in Bangkok - before the deal was concluded - and they were very angrily looking at the zealous ambition of Singapore to control all the satellite assets in South-east Asia.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Where were you before the coup ? Am I to believe that you still have the temerity to continue supporting Thaksin even to the extent to believe that his Group is still influential ? This surely confirms your living in a cloistered world - when Thaksin has already vowed staying clear of politics, as he and his wife is up to their necks with law suits over the corrupt sale of government land to his wife while he was in office.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Did LKY believe that the Thai Military Coup was illegal ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">These are surprising words coming from LKY, who had stated that the SAF should intervene in any ''freak election outcome'' that allow an Alternative Political Party to form the next Singapore Government.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Surely, you are not putting your words into LKY's mouth claiming the Thai Military Coup is illegal ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000080;"> Yes, the entire world is facing a period of high inflation and economic slowdown - do you know that Singapore inflation rate is higher then other First World Nation ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Singapore inflation in March 2008 was 6.6% which hit a 25 year high.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Borrowing the data from marizio13's diligent work in his thread : ''CPF Interest @ 2.5%, and Inflation @ 6.7%'' - you may wish to review the following and tell me again that other First World Nations are experiencing similar levels of inflation:</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #800000;">The US inflation for 3 months ending April 2008 was 2.3% while an unadjusted 12 months rate was 3.9%.</span></em></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000080;">On the Employment front, other First World Nations have population size that are far bigger then Singapore, and yet have been able to either hold their rate of employment position, or improve the number of unemployed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">In the USA, even as unemployment had increased to 5.0 percent, it was a narrow increase of 0.5 percent. However, total employment at 146.3 million, and the employment-population ratio, at 62.7 percent, were little changed in April. Over the month, the labor force participation rate held at 66.0 percent ... was the same rate a year earlier.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">According to the UK Department for Works and Pension - employment in the UK is at an all time high, with the ILO unemployment rate determined at a historical low of 5.2% :</span> <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/2008/mar/stat-190308.asp">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/2008/mar/stat-190308.asp</a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Australia's February 2008 unemployment report of 4.0 percent showed the best unemployment rate in 33 years.</span> <a href="http://news.sbs.com.au/worldnewsaustralia/unemployment_rate_sinks_to_33year_low_542689">http://news.sbs.com.au/worldnewsaustralia/unemployment_rate_sinks_to_33year_low_542689</a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">The New Zealand unemployment rate fell to a national unemployment rate of 3.6 percent - from the previous 3.7 percent in the year ended March 2007.</span> <a href="http://www.dol.govt.nz/lmr/regional/joint/index.asp">http://www.dol.govt.nz/lmr/regional/joint/index.asp</a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">So much for your effort at exaggerating the big picture for the MIW runned Singapore by deriding the performance of others with the size of their population and economy far larger than Singapore - and with their government costing their respective nationals far less for the better performance achieved.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Pray that you do not feel impotent sitting on your chair thinking you are the mouth piece for some BG - who is no better then a Baby God rather than a Brigadier.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000080;">For your information, it is the MIW that have time again bend the laws, and have the Attorney-General conveniently re-interpreting the laws when they themselves have over stepped the legal boundary. It is the MIW under the tutelage of MM, who have abused the laws of Singapore and use the judiciary to terrorise Singaporeans into law fearing Citizens.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">It is educated carpet beggars like you, who will eagerly prostitute your principles simply to gain an invitation to have tea with the devils dressed in Red and White.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Try harder if you wish to gain recognition for your vain and futile effort to be seen as some potent force in representing the MIW thinking, as your thoughts are nothing more then rehash of the same old worn out propaganda from HMV at MIW HQ.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">With your vast years of experience as a semi-permanent UK resident, surely we can believe you that it is <em>''safer to come and prostitute yourself to angmos in UK''</em> ?</span></p>
