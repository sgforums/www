              <p>Where’s the coordination?<br>It appears the right hand didn’t know what the left was doing, creating unnecessary uncertainty in people’s minds. By Seah Chiang Nee<br>Apr 3, 2008<br><br>On Mar 23, Temasek Holdings said it is “not a sovereign wealth fund” and therefore not covered by an agreement by Singapore, Abu Dhabi and the USA on the transparency of these funds.<br><br>A week later the Ministry of Finance contradicted it by saying that Temasek should abide by the agreement since the government had crafted it with the two other parties.<br><br>In real life, of course, the Finance Ministry wholly owns Temasek.<br><br>The contradiction between the two organisations, which are renowned for efficiency and transparency, has come as a surprise to many people.<br><br>At the time of this writing, there has been no official explanation as to how the contradiction arose.<br><br>‘Uneasy’ Singaporeans<br><br>The Temasek statement saying it is not a state fund bothered some Singaporeans, and they raised strong objections over the Internet. The mainstream media did not cover the controversy.<br><br>If Temasek’s money is not considered state fund, people ask uneasily, who then are the owners? Are the people’s mega-billions now in private hands?<br><br>One correspondent wondered what could be the motive that drove Temasek to declare that it is “not a state wealth fund” since no country or government is going to agree with it anyway.<br><br>”They can shout that it is an independent investment fund until they are blue in the face, no one will believe them,” he added.<br><br>Was Temasek trying to exclude itself from being subject to an international agreement that clearly covers Temasek and GIC (Government Investment Corporation)?<br><br>“It only creates unease among Singaporeans who are already worried about whether their reserves, invested or not, are safe.”<br><br>What bothered blogger ‘Under the Willow Tree’ is not just a matter of definitions or of whether Temasek is a Sovereign Wealth Fund.<br><br>The writer added in a letter sent to the Straits Times Forum, the following (which he blogs): -<br><br>“Rather, it suggests that for at least a brief week and a half, Temasek was a corporate entity that was able to decide on its principles of corporate governance, ahead and independently of its sole shareholder and owner, the Government of Singapore.<br><br>“Temasek’s corporate governance framework has implications that go far beyond standards of financial disclosure, into the realm of critical issues such as Temasek’s investment mandate and the decision-making process that Temasek uses to make or dispose of investments.<br><br>“These issues, amongst others, have as great an impact on allaying foreign suspicion and lowering the risk of protectionist measures, as the levels of disclosure adopted by Temasek.<br><br>“The process of determining a company’s principles of corporate governance is a principal issue for every corporation, particularly a company like Temasek that invests its funds on behalf of the country.<br><br>“Thus, I certainly hope that the two contradicting statements to the press were the result of an honest miscommunication between the two parties, and that my concerns are misplaced.”<br><br>Read in full:<br>http://utwt.blogspot.com/2008/04/apparent-lack-of-coordination-between.html</p>
