              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">US should quickly place tariffs on Chinese goods to improve its own economy.</span><br> Their delays in doing so only tell me what a bunch of wafflers, profligate capitalist they are.<br> To instruct China to revalue the Yuan is going overboard and beyond the pale.<br> You CANNOT order China what to do, but you can impose fair tariffs on 
              Chinese goods (to the extent on what is fair to your citizens) by 
              imposing tariffs at your OWN ports which are under your own control.<br> You may preempt China about your intentions however you may NOT order 
              another sovereign state (China) to do your bidding (revalue Yuan).<br> <br> Anyhow, China has 1.3B mouths to feed, and it is their opinion that 
              keeping their factories humming is the way forward to that goal. Not 
              everything China produces, though cheap, is fit for consumption though 
              (lead paint toys, melamine milk, fake chicken eggs immediately come to 
              mind).<br> <br> Unlike Chinese leadership, US politics, being premised much upon 
              political donations from oil companies and the like, seems mired in the 
              navel gazing excesses of capitalism. <br> Forgetting the modern option of pursuing proper causes such as 
              environmentally sustainable farming/ alt energy industry, research and 
              development, the US govt has been distracted to take the lowly road of 
              blaming China for its economic woes- one which the Chinese leadership 
              (well researched in environmental and leadership concerns) is ought to 
              defend if not ignore.<br> <br> Americans must learn to work smartly and eat properly (stop eating 
              unhealthy fast food)- a healthy worker is a productive one- both in mind
               and spirit. Farm subsidies for meat production and on other 
              environmentally unfriendly farming methods used must end. Organic 
              farming methods should get subsidies- both for their beneficial impact 
              on human health and their preservation of the surrounding environment- 
              maintaining soil integrity, preventing soil erosion/ freshwater 
              depletion whilst providing job whilst commanding higher prices for both 
              their beneficial health and environmental effects- not least sustained 
              soil viability and the future of farm land in general.<br> <br> Over-zealous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill">oil exploration</a> and profligate consumption too must end- US has enough enemies in the 
              Muslim world, does the US need more bad rep for it's denial of CO2 level
               concerns and its consequential sea level rises, not to mention the 
              instability caused by many environmental refugees- their lands ruined by
               floods and inundation, soil salinity making their lands uncultivatable.
               <br> <br> The sub-prime crisis must be the bane of the American life and to that, 
              lax financial lending rules and the dalliances of greedy wall street 
              bankers must end, less the US economy get further ruined.<br> <br> Meat farming subsidies, once the political highway to power through the 
              electorate's perceived QOL improvement should by now be passe- given 
              mounting literature- both environmental as well as health, describing 
              the ills of meat production and consumption- global warming, 
              deforestation, cancer and heart disease etc. (Many meat animals are 
              abused- fed unnatural diets and contained in cramped, unhygienic 
              conditions). According to the recent CNA Sunday 9Oct2010, 7pm 
              documentary <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eKYyD14d_0">'Food Inc'</a>-
               much of US tax payer's revenue is expanded on insecticides, farm 
              subsidies and genetic engineering to the detriment of environmentally 
              sustainable farming practices. <br> <br> With a poor public educational system, weak/ inefficient social 
              security/ Healthcare system, and an ignorant population indulging in 
              either vice or the hamburger to pass their time, and in competition with
               China for lower classed jobs and produce, has the US considered begging
               China to raise the Yuan?<br> <br> If the following <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/Health/News/Story/A1Story20100316-204955.html">perverse picture</a> of misguided idealism, Koran burning et.al is indeed the new face of 
              the average American worker/ dream, then I'd say that the end for 
              glorious America is soon if not now.<br> <br> So yes, tariffs to control American waist lines should be in, as must 
              public education be improved to improve the quality and output of the 
              American worker.<br> Down with American military manipulation of foreign economies.<br> In with American technological innovation.<br> In with healthy diets.<br> The American economy needs a revival.<br> "But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it."

              <p>It is traditional for politicians to blame foreigners for problems that their own policies have caused. And in today’s zero-sum economies, it seems that if America is losing leadership position, other nations must be the beneficiaries. Inasmuch as China has avoided the financial overhead that has painted other economies into a corner, nationalistic U.S. politicians and journalists are blaming it for America’s declining economic power.</p>
              <p>I realize that balance-of-payments accounting and international trade theory are arcane topics, but I promise that by the time you finish this article, you will understand more than 99% of U.S. economists and diplomats striking this self-righteous pose...</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 20px;">
              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 3px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 3px; padding: 0px;">One needs to have a basic understanding of the nature of the United States and its global strategy in order to comprehend its recent provocations in the Yellow Sea and the South China Sea. The 2010 US defense report said first and foremost the U.S. is a nation at war.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 3px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 3px; padding: 0px;">From a historical perspective, the U.S. has continuously found enemies and waged wars. It has become part of its social formula. Without wars the US economy loses stimulus. Without enemies the U.S. cannot hold the will of the whole nation.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 3px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 3px; padding: 0px;">Its recent military drills in the Yellow Sea and announcement to intervene in the South China Sea affairs were efforts made to encircle China. It is attempting to build the "Asian NATO" with Japan, South Korea, Australia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 3px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 3px; padding: 0px;">China is becoming the world's wealth centre. The U.S. could benefit from China's economic development. For China, with its backward military force, development is the top priority. It has neither the intention nor the capacity to challenge the global hegemony of the U.S.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 3px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 3px; padding: 0px;">China is unlikely to take a tough line against the strategy of the U.S. China is bound to stand side by side with the U.S. in the international arena. It will not tolerate the U.S. closing in forever, though.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 3px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 3px; padding: 0px;">In order to prevent the U.S. from surrounding it, China needs to draw a clear bottom line. The U.S. is not allowed to coerce China to give in on matters concerning China's territory and maritime sovereignty, national solidarity and regional issues. And it is not allowed to jeopardize China's national interest by collaborating with neighboring countries.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 3px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 3px; padding: 0px;">China has never done anything with the enemies of the U.S. that would harm the country's security. The U.S. has no right to unscrupulously engage in activities that threaten China's security time and again. As a responsible power, China's priority is safeguarding its own dignity.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 3px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 3px; padding: 0px;">If the U.S. is adjusting its global strategic emphasis, China needs to reevaluate its strategy toward the U.S. China loves peace, but it will staunchly safeguard its national interests.</p>

              <p>There may be moves to shift away from pricing oil in dollars in future:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;"><strong>Will the Dollar get an “Arab oil shock”?</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>
              </p><p class="text" style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><strong>Arab oil producing nations and the some world’s largest oil consumers including China and Japan are reliably reported to be secretly planning a long-term exit from pricing their oil trade in dollars. If true, it would spell the death knell for the dollar as world reserve currency, and for the USA as “the” global economic power.</strong></p>
              <p class="text" style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">Ever since Washington tore up the Bretton Woods treaty in August 1971 and went onto a “dollar paper reserve system” instead of a dollar backed by gold, the United States, as the world’s most powerful military power, has been able to dictate financial terms to the world. Nations like Japan and later China, dependent on US export markets, would dutifully invest their trade surplus dollars into US Government debt, in effect financing wars such as Iraq or Afghanistan they opposed. They saw no choice. Arab oil producing countries, under US military pressure, were forced to sell oil only in dollars, a direct prop to the dollar when the US economy was in terminal decline. That may be rapidly about to come to an end.</p>
              <p class="text" style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">According to a leaked report from Arab Gulf oil producers, there have been a series of secret meetings in recent months between the major Arab oil producers, including Saudi Arabia, and reportedly also Russia, together with the leading oil consumer countries including two of the three largest oil import countries—China and Japan.</p>
              <p class="text" style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">Their project is to quietly create the basis to end a 65-year long “iron rule” of selling oil only in US dollars. Following the 400% oil price shock of 1973, which was deliberately blamed by US media on “greedy Arab Shiekhs,” a senior US Treasury official made a secret trip to Riyadh to tell the Saudis in blunt terms that if they wanted US military defense against potential Israeli attack, that OPEC must privately agree never to sell oil in currencies other than the US dollar. That “petrodollar” system allowed the US to run staggering trade deficits and remain the world reserve currency, the heart of its ability to dominate and control world financial markets, until the crisis of the sub-prime real estate securitization in August 2007.</p>
              <p class="text" style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">The participants in the oil pricing project reportedly envision using a basket of currencies reflecting producer-consumer trade relations, one backed by gold as a solid backbone. It would not initially be a new currency as some have surmised, but rather an arrangement that would eliminate the risks of pricing oil sales in fluctuating and likely depreciating dollars.  </p>
              <p class="text" style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">Iran announced recently that in the future it would sell its oil for euros not dollars. According to these reports, the basket of currencies would include a mix of yen, euros, Chinese yuan, gold. Brazil would reportedly join as both a producer and consumer country.</p>
              <p class="text" style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">The secret plan was first reported by Middle East correspondent, Robert Fisk, in the UK<em>Independent</em>.</p>
              <p class="text" style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">I have confirmed from very senior and well-informed Gulf sources that the talks are in fact real. The oil producing countries have been fed up for years about having to price their oil in dollars or face US reprisals. They are steadily losing as the dollar depreciates against other currencies and against gold. As most Gulf Arab oil countries depend on imports for  much of their economy, dollar pricing de facto introduces serious inflation into their economies as well. Most of their trade is with the EU or other countries outside the US, but now that trade must be mediated through a sinking currency, the dollar.</p>
              <p class="text" style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">Following the US declaration of the War on Terror by the Bush Administration after September 11, 2001 most leading Arab oil producing countries privately saw US policy as being aggressively aimed at them. The un-justifiable US invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003 merely confirmed that as well as subsequent US threats against Iran.</p>
              <p class="text" style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">Initially various governments involved in the leaked plan have publicly denied vehemently such a plan. That in no way invalidates that such moves are afoot. The participating countries are well aware that the United States as a wounded tiger can be far more dangerous. The leak of the plans in the world media, whether every detail reported by Fisk is true or not, feeds what is an inevitable decline in the dollar as a reliable reserve currency for world commerce.</p>
              <p class="text" style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">What is not clear is what the potential response of Germany and France, the two pivot powers within the EU will be. If they decide to cast their lot with oil producing and consuming countries, they open their doors to vast new trade and investment potentials from the countries of Eurasia. If they cringe from that and decide to remain with the British Pound and US dollar, they will inevitably sink along as the dollar Titanic sinks. </p>
              <p class="text" style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">With that decline of the US dollar goes the lessening of the political power of the United States as sole economic and financial superpower. We face very turbulent waters ahead and gold not surprisingly is gaining in this uncertainty.</p>
