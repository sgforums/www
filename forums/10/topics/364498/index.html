              <p>By Dr. Mahathir Mohamad </p>
              <p><span class="byline vcard"><abbr class="published" title="2009-06-15T15:10:43+07:00">June 15, 2009</abbr></span></p>
              <p><br>1. Ancient China considered itself the centre of the world and called itself the Middle Kingdom. And well it should. It was far more advanced in every way than Europe of the Dark Ages. Maybe China is thinking of making a comeback.<br><br>2. But we already have a new Middle Kingdom now. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>During Lee Kuan Yew's triumphant visit to Malaysia he made it known to the Malaysian supplicants that Singapore regards the lands within 6000 miles radius of Singapore as its hinterland.</strong></span></span> This includes Beijing and Tokyo and of course Malaysia.<br><br>3.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Of course this self-deluding perception places Singapore at the centre of a vast region.</strong></span></span> It is therefore the latter day Middle Kingdom. The rest are peripheral and are there to serve the interest of this somewhat tiny Middle Kingdom.<br><br>4. Kuan Yew also explained that the fear Singapore Chinese would control Iskandar whatever is not justified. Malays can also work there.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> It is good to know that Malays can also work in their own country. I wonder as what?</strong></span></span> Maybe someone should make a study of the Malays of Singapore just to know what it is like to be a Malay minority in their own country.<br><br>5. As for the 3 sen per 1000 gallons of raw water supplied to Singapore Lee says it was absurd for the former Prime Minister of hinterland Malaysia to ask to increase it to RM8 per 1000 gallons. I don't know where he got this. Some Malaysian officers did suggest this figure but we were ready to bargain and maybe settle for RM3. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And why not? Johore sells raw water to Melaka for 30 sen, 1000% higher than to Singapore. And Melaka is, I believe, a part of Malaysia! Some Malaysians may see the irony of this.</strong></span></span><br><br>6. The great 5th Prime Minister has decided that since the people of Johore did not want to sell sand to Singapore, Malaysia would not build any bridge, straight or crooked, or negotiate and settle the other issues like the Central Provident Fund, the Railway land. Maybe the 5th Prime Minister thinks he is punishing Singapore. Actually he is giving Singapore what its wants including the 3 sen per 1000 gallons water until 2061. Think of how many grains of nasi lemak we can buy with 3 sen in 2061. Imagine what 1000 gallons will earn for Singapore at that time. Can't think of a more astute PM for Malaysia.<br><br>7. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>All those who met the great man from the little country were lectured on how Malaysia should be run.</strong></span></span> We should not have anymore problems now. We have been told the direction to take. MCA must help UMNO to win because Singapore does not want an Islamic Party like PAS to win. We must ensure this. Sorry PAS. Working with the DAP, the offspring of PAP has not endeared you to Mr Lee.<br><br>8.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> I have a lot more to say about this little Emperor but I will reserve it for later. </strong></span></span></p>

              <p>Wednesday, 17 June 2009</p>
              <p><em>Asia Sentinel</em></p>
              <p><em>Lee Kuan Yew ventures into the Malaysian thicket, finds Mahathir hasn't mellowed</em> <br><br>Lee
                  Kuan Yew, the 85-year-old patriarch and minister mentor of Singapore,
                  might have thought he was taking a pleasant eight-day valedictory lap
                  across several Malaysian states last week, but it has turned out to be
                  anything but.<br><br>On Monday, Lee came under blistering attack by his
                  old adversary, the 84-year-old former prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad,
                  who referred to him acidly in his blog, Che Det, as "the great man from
                  the little country" and later called him a "little emperor." The full
                  force of his comments on Lee can be found in his blog here.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>It was Lee's first visit to Malaysia
                  in four years and his first outside of Kuala Lumpur since 1989, and any
                  visit he makes is certain to kick off a round of invective from
                  Mahathir and others. There has been no love lost between the two
                  octogenarians, both of whom ruled their countries with an iron hand,
                  Lee for 31 years, Mahathir for 22, and who have never passed up an
                  opportunity to slag each other off. But the current round is surprising
                  for its vitriol.<br><br>Not only did Mahathir release a blazing attack
                  on Lee, but Mahathir's former political secretary Matthias Chang,
                  writing in a publication called Suara Keadilan, said even worse, saying
                  that, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"To many anti-colonial fighters of the third world, Lee Kuan Yew
                  was contemptuously referred to as "ivory-skin Englishman" who "was and
                  still is perceived as the lackey of the British power elites."</strong></span></span><br><br>The
                  Federation of Malaya and Singapore split into two countries in 1965,
                  and Malaysian has never failed to gleefully bring up the fact that Kuan
                  Yew burst into tears at the dissolution. <br><br>Kuan Yew's dream,
                  Chang wrote, of <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"being the Overlord of Malaysia, comprising of
                  Peninsula Malaya, Sarawak and Sabah was shattered and he has to be
                  content with being a bully of a city state! Given such a traumatic
                  experience, and possessing a vindictive disposition, it is a given that
                  Lee Kuan Yew would harbor a secret agenda against Malaysia. And over
                  the years, he has sowed and continues to sow discord among the races in
                  Malaysia."</strong></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>Reading various reports of Kuan Yew's visit, he doesn't
                  seem to have done any such thing, instead arguing for more stable
                  relations between the two countries. "It makes no sense for bilateral
                  ties to be sunny one day, stormy the next," he was quoted as saying.<br><br>"I
                  leave Kuala Lumpur with some optimism, guarded optimism, because we
                  have to see the words translated into action," he said as he was
                  leaving for Ipoh. "I had to emphasize that it cannot be cooperation
                  today, non-cooperation next year and then back again, backwards and
                  forwards, because these are very big investments both in the Iskandar
                  region and the third bridge to Desaru and the east coast, from Desaru
                  up to Mersing, up to Kuantan and Pekan, massive projects requiring huge
                  investments, the returns can only be calculated in decades, not in
                  terms of years."<br><br>Lee's visit appears bound to stir up additional
                  tensions between Mahathir and Najib Tun Razak, Malaysia's prime
                  minister, who extended the invitation to Lee and who has publicly said
                  he wants cooperation with the island republic, especially over the
                  massive Iskandar development at the bottom of Johor state which was
                  begun by former Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, which is being
                  built partly on Singapore money.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mahathir was quoted last year
                  as saying Singaporean investors could force Malays out of the project.
                  "After the land is sold, the Malays will be driven to live at the edge
                  of the forest and even in the forest itself," he was quoted as saying
                  last May. "In the end, the area in Iskandar Malaysia will be filled
                  with Singaporeans and populated with only 15 percent Malays." </strong></span></span><br><br>"Kuan
                  Yew also explained that the fear Singapore Chinese would control
                  Iskandar whatever is not justified. Malays can also work there,"
                  Mahathir wrote in his blog. "It is good to know that Malays can also
                  work in their own country. I wonder as what? Maybe someone should make
                  a study of the Malays of Singapore just to know what it is like to be a
                  Malay minority in their own country."<br><br>During Lee's visit to
                  Malaysia, Mahathir wrote, "he made it known to the Malaysian
                  supplicants that Singapore regards the lands within 6000 miles radius
                  of Singapore as its hinterland. This includes Beijing and Tokyo and of
                  course Malaysia.<br><br>"Of course this self-deluding perception places
                  Singapore at the centre of a vast region. It is therefore the latter
                  day Middle Kingdom. The rest are peripheral and are there to serve the
                  interest of this somewhat tiny Middle Kingdom." <br><br>Badawi,
                  Mahathir continued, "decided that since the people of Johor did not
                  want to sell sand to Singapore, Malaysia would not build any bridge,
                  straight or crooked, or negotiate and settle the other issues like the
                  Central Provident Fund, the Railway land. Maybe the 5th Prime Minister
                  thinks he is punishing Singapore. Actually he is giving Singapore what
                  it wants including the 3 sen per 1000 gallons water until 2061. Think

                  what 1000 gallons will earn for Singapore at that time. Can't think of
                  a more astute PM for Malaysia."<br><br>All of those who met Lee,
                  Mahathir said, "were lectured on how Malaysia should be run. We should
                  not have any more problems now. We have been told the direction to
                  take. MCA must help UMNO to win because Singapore does not want an
