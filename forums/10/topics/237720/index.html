            <div class='col-md body'>no one will know the REAL figures<br><br>1) suicide is viewed very negatively around the world. and whenever possible, people would rather have their loved ones to have died of some other causes other than suicide whenever possible<br>2) sometimes we dont know IF accidents are actually suicides. we can say the driver lost control of the car and therefore got into the car accident and died. for all we know, its actually a suicide<br>3) suicides are one thing. suicide ATTEMPTS are something else. there are LOTS of pple who ATTEMPT suicide and are not able to successfully commit suicide.<br><br>yes. suicides are mainly caused by depression.<br>but the society has a MAJOR role to play in why so many pple in that country are depressed and suicidal<br><br>and btw...i strongly believe that the number of suicides (and definitely suicide attempts) are on the rise especially for youths</div>

It was highest among Indians (19.5 per 100,000), followed by Chinese (16.2 per 100,000) and Malays (2.3 per 100,000). The suicide rates were higher in elderly people (aged 65 years and over) than in younger age groups (10 to 64 years) and in males than in females. For the elderly, the mean annual suicide rate for this period was 52.0 per 100,000. However, it was highest among Chinese, with 59.3 per 100,000, followed by Indians at 33.9 per 100,000, and, again, lowest among Malays, with 3.0 per 100,000.
