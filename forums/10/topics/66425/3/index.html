            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>My organ is part of mine.<br>I could decide that my organ will not be the profiteering tool of some business. </blockquote>If u felt so bad about it, u can opt out. It is not compulsory<br><br><blockquote>No other country in the world has ever legislate the opt-out system. Not even the Communist China. </blockquote>So wat ?<br><br><blockquote>Why not PAP force the Muslims covered by the opt-out system? </blockquote>Just a question... r u a muslim ?<br><br><blockquote>What if they not use the "divide &amp;rule " strategy??? </blockquote>Wat is tat ?<br><br><blockquote>In China they steal the organs of the executed, then sell it illegally. </blockquote>Wat has tat got to do with singapore ? Singapore aren't selling the organs, the only price u will likely to pay is the transplant money for the surgeon to take out and put in. U can't expect tat to be free isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>Now after the failure of Ladan&amp;Lalei operation,and after losing clients from SEA, Human Organ Hub is the new hope??? </blockquote>Tat is funny... why accused base on your own instinct ? Plese try not to be emotional...<br><br><blockquote>Utilitarians disguised as Humanitarians!!!!!!!!!</blockquote>Your argument seems more toward emotion than logics.<br><br><blockquote>Well...

The only hope is for a transplant, which none of your family members can donate. The pain, the time and the money spend on treating u costs a bomb. U cannot exercise, u feel tired easily and u cannot take any food with salt etc. Your expenditure is dragging your family fiancial significantly. Even if u can afford it, your life is limited in the sense tat u can at most live 10 years.<br><br>Have u ever wonder how will u feel if u r the one suffering from the diesease tat need the organ ?  Just because of your... I don't know, pride ?  Hatred for gov ? Religion ? Tat u refuse to donate out the organs for other people. U r as good as murdering them. U r as good as depriving them a chance to live a proper life.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kool it...and stay focus. We support the HOTA, but feels that there are needs to understand more, those of u not concern at all, please understand that there are people who do. This topic is NOT about whether who like to opt in or opt out, what pple like to do with their organs after death. It is NOT about whether 2 trust or distrust the government(to wide &amp; far 4 now)... no point arguing over these.<br><br>This topic's main objective is to get Singaporeans to be aware of HOTA, finding the facts, discussion, sharing of information about the proceedures and transparency issues. Only with good understanding, we can then say it's up to individual's decision, whether to stay opt in or opt out.<br><br>So far have any ministers, doctors or any written letters from MOH or government to assure Singaporeans &amp; PRs that :<br>1) The waiting list is fair.<br>1a) The waiting list priority are given to Singaporeans &amp; PRs<br>1b) waiting is base on medical conditions, not only on wealth &amp; status.<br><br>2) All organs are meant only for transplants to save life. Not other purposes.<br><br>Just a thought, if MOH need organs for medical research or education it should not use organs donoted under HOTA. This should be for volunteer donor under other new act?<br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br>Other questions<br>1) Any watchdog to monitor and guards against loss, waste, theft, or undesirable practices?<br>2a) What is being done to monitor the transparency of organs transplant and usage?<br>2b) organs not enoughÂ… how to trace where the organs end up?<br><br>3) Will the hospital give the decease's family member a list of organs that have been taken out?<br><br>Always remember even if we are donors, there are no assurance that organs are given priority to us in case of an organ transplant. Maybe due to better profits the organs goes to overseas patient first???<br><br>The fact we know is that most patients have to wait up to three years or more, and what about those died waiting, are they not cover under HOTA?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Always remember even if we are donors, there are no assurance that organs are given priority to us in case of an organ transplant. Maybe due to better profits the organs goes to overseas patient first??? </blockquote>Although I do not myself know whether we singaporean r given priority to the organ, I do believe tat they will not purposely give to foreigner so tat they can get better profits. If u want to know more about tis like kohi, I suggest u personally called up MOH and ask.<br><br>But at least I am sure of one thing. If u do not donate your organ, u r certain of hurting someone, be it singaporean or foreigner. And wat is your lost if u donate ? Nothing. Maybe the only thing u manage to achieve is not let the hospital in singapore earn any money at the cost of indirectly killing someone.<br><br><blockquote>The fact we know is that most patients have to wait up to three years or more, and what about those died waiting, are they not cover under HOTA? </blockquote>In the past, the number of organ collected is very few compared with the number of people with kidney failure. In the past they only include kidney, and they must be involved in some fatal accident and their kidney must be well and healthy at tat time. Because of tis, the probability is few. If tat act is not passed in 1987, then the patients not only have to wait for 3 years. They have to wait forever. Thus if u really care about them, then I suggest we try to increase the number of well kidneys tat can be donated to them.<br><br><blockquote>i agree with kohi with different conditions&amp;reasoning.<br>Although HOTA is unconstitutional by legislating against the individual principle of free will ,in the context of Singapore.<br>it is the de facto enacted law.And constitutional protection of human rights is mere words. </blockquote>I don't really get your english here... anyway it will be unconstitutional if they make it compulsory for their organs to be donated. Now u have a choice on whether your organs be donated or not. Nothing is done against their free will isn't it ? Do u really know wat is the term constitutional ?<br><br><blockquote>The difference between China &amp; Singapore is what is illegal in China would be legal in Singapore,and in China it's the criminal<br>who gets the money &amp; in Singapore the listed private hospital Co. </blockquote>China is just plain selling of the organs to other people. They do not ask the consent of the prisoners nor their relatives. Singapore is not. U r only paying for the services of transplanting the organs from the decease to u. The donaters and their relatives have themrselves given their consent  for such an act to be committed. The money the listed private hospital earned is clean, because they r giving u professional medical attention in the transplanting of organs.<br><br><blockquote>MOH claimed that the costs of transplant the the poor in need would be helped with Medi fund.<br>But how about the three year waiting period???? </blockquote>I don't know about u think but the 3 years period is because of the lack of organs, not because they wanna play a fool and ask u to wait for 3 years just for the kick of it. Even the rich have to wait for 3 years too. Why do u think the rich will get to have their turn immediately ? If u feel tat 3 years is too long, then support this law to activate. Then will the waiting time be shortened.<br><br><blockquote>If the poor cannot afford the medical fares during their waiting,<br>is there any possibility of transplant???? </blockquote>They can get loans. They can get help from charity organisation. There is an equal probability of transplant as the rich.<br><br><blockquote>In my humble view ,only public health care countries such as Norway,Finland&amp;UK(criticised by LKY) has the basic eligibility<br>to enact opt out system as law without being held as constitutional. </blockquote>Why do u feel our system r more inferior compared with theirs ?<br><br><blockquote>One further question.<br>If my brother opt out ,could he get my organ after my death??<br><br>If not , it still is unconstitutional. </blockquote>If it is voluntarily donating your organ while u r alive, then u can get to choose who get it. If u died then u can't decide who to get it. Tis is very important because it prevents relatives from selling the organs of their deceased relatives to the higher bidders. Imagine Mr A had died and his family members can decide who to get the organs. Wat is to stop his family members from secretly selling it to Mr B who need Mr A's organ ? Think further, and u will realise tat Mr A and Mr B r close friends. If Mr A let Mr B get to have his organs when he died, then don't u think there is a possibility tat Mr B will try to murder Mr A ? Desperate people call for desperate measures.<br><br>So u should be thankful such a system is in place instead as it ensures fair allocation according to the waiting list.<br><br></div>
