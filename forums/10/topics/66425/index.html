            <div class='col-md body'>Hi oldbreadstinks, dumbdumb! &amp; weidev, this HOTA topic main focus is about questions on tranparency issues, to find out more about the act. I very much support organ donation for a GOOD cause. I could have just choose to opt-out, why bother 2 post this topic. Like u dumbdumb! &amp; weidev, I also believe in helping people if I can, the only different is that maybe I hv become paranoid toward life. Decision can be simple and easy to some, not 4 me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Even if it is a good deed, one must contribute with knowledge and not blindly. Neo hv good points, hope that there are more being done/ educate the general public on the act. (To be honest, I understand only about 50-70% wat Neo wrote  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">   )<br><br>For those who like myself who support the HOTA, yet concern about the tranparency, please help to find out more and share it.</div>
