It may end up being in a old, low IQ, evil, rich, undeserving, unfaithful, scumbag foreigner's body, but it sure beats it being left in decay if left in the body...

            <div class='col-md body'><br>From the ST Forum Page, Tuesday - 20 January 2004<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkred;"><span class="large">We gave away our daughter's organs</span></span></strong><br><br>THE debate in Parliament on the amendments to the Human Organ Transplant Act recently caught my attention. It brought me back to the tragedy I had experienced just days before.<br><br>My beloved daughter collapsed and died from a rupture of an aneurysm in her brain at the young age of 34 on Dec 21. It came without warning for she had been a very active and healthy woman. Seconds before her collapse, she was talking and joking with her cousins.<br><br>She was rushed to Singapore General Hospital where she was put on life-support. A brain scan showed massive blood clots in the left hemisphere.<br><br>The next morning, the doctors told my husband and me that the few tests that had been done pointed to brain death, but that they would have to do two more tests when certain conditions in her body had stabilised before they could certify her brain dead.<br><br>On Christmas Eve, two neurosurgeons did the tests and officially declared her brain dead. The ward doctor then told us that her brain actually died the moment she collapsed and that she did not suffer any pain.<br><br>Even as we were grieving over our great loss, we decided to donate her organs to save others, because she had once mentioned that in the event of her death, she would like to donate her organs for the advancement of science or to save others.<br><br>Even as we decided to donate her organs we were still praying and hoping for a miraculous healing. We were just not ready to let her go.<br><br>But when the doctors told us that her organs would deteriorate if we delayed having them removed, we finally accepted the fact that she was no more with us and consented.<br><br>Watching her being wheeled away to the operating theatre to have her organs removed, I felt as though my heart was being wrenched out of my body. The only comfort was that I knew many lives would be saved. Ironically, not all her organs were taken though we had indicated that all her organs could be taken for transplant. It could be that the doctors could not find a patient with the same blood group.<br><br>If our daughter could save others in her death, then she had not died in vain. I know how very painful it is to lose a loved one but think of the many lives one would be saving and how much happiness one would be bringing to the recipients' families.<br><br>As for my husband and myself, we had signed up to donate all our organs as early as 1982.<br><br>I fervently hope that people will not opt out so that they can save those who are suffering or dying from organ failure. Who knows? One day we might even be at the receiving end.<br><br>Y. C.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: red;">Would poor lose out on transplants</span>?</strong><br>I AM all for the Human Organ Transplant Act (Hota) as long as it saves lives.<br><br>However, will it exclude the poor just because they cannot afford the cost of a transplant?<br><br>People can bequeath their organs upon death but does the person on the waiting list who is a good match always gets to have the transplant, under all circumstances?<br><br>Take a hypothetical example. Jeffrey suffers from last-stage kidney failure and his life can only be saved if he undergoes a transplant. A man dies in an accident and his kidney is available.<br><br>However, the cost of a transplant is beyond Jeffrey's means. The doctor cannot wait because the kidney will deteriorate if it is not transplanted within a certain time. Would Jeffrey lose the kidney to the next person on the waiting list, who is able to foot the bill?<br><br>To save lives or not is solely a personal decision on the part of a donor. Hence if a donor gives up his organs upon his death, that's because he wanted to save lives, lives of people whom he will never know.<br><br>Thus if a patient is denied a transplant because he is unable to foot the bill for the operation, we are diminishing the effort to save lives.<br><br>NG PENG CHEW<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/forum/story/0,4386,231032-1074635940,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/forum/story/0,4386,231032-1074635940,00.html?</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think he just brought out an issue not just concerning organ transplant, but whether should medical fees be free or have to pay with a price. Lets say a Mr Lim is very sick and can only be cured using Drug A, which is too expensive for him. The inventor of Drug A want it to saved lifes and not earn a profit, however the company he worked for doesn't think so. Thus Mr Lim died.<br><br>Thus if a patient is denied the medical attention because he is unable to foot the bill for the operation, we are diminishing the effort to save lives.<br><br>Well... I guess in singapore there is still some insurance or loan available to those who really are poor and need medical attention. Such is the facts of life... if we don't pay medical fees, who will want to be doctors, nurses, researchers and companies producing medicine ?<br><br>At least if HOTA is implemented, Jeffrey still has a chance for an organ transplant. If HOTA isn't implemented, Jeffrey will still die too isn't it ?</div>

Wat has it got to do with anything ?<br><br><blockquote>Have u studied ABC in sociology?! </blockquote>Wat tat something about sociology tat I should know?<br><br><blockquote>Is it so-called justice when the poor gets exploited even after death? </blockquote>Then is <span style="font-style: italic;">one own selfishness, ignorance and superstitious tat indirectly cause other people death and misery</span> justice ?<br><br><blockquote>Do the underdogs except Muslims know how to opt out??? </blockquote>Everyone can opt out. Why do u think everyone should opt out then ?<br><br><blockquote>Or the organs are supposed to enhance the Medical Hub status after Ladan&amp;Lalei????? </blockquote>Do u lose out anything if singapore enhances its medical hub status ? Wat have u got to lose if u help the living Mankind ? The implementation also helped our own citizens too isn't it.<br><br><blockquote><br>These are the questions ST Forum dare not ask!!!!</blockquote>Point is... I don't understand why u ask these questions... If u really wanna discuss tis topic, why don't u log in another original nick. Otherwise other people will think of u as nothing but an impersonator.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The not well educated underclass get exploited with their Organs after death. </blockquote>Sad to say, it it often the rich well educated people tat donate their organs while the not well educated underclass being superstitious refuse to donate their organs. Instead they sent their organs to be burnt or buried.<br><br><blockquote>Are foreigners in the waiting list? </blockquote>Singaporean are in the waiting list, tat is for sure. And to find matching organs isn't easy. I say many times again, if all donate their organ, it will saved many lives including the rich, the poor, the bad, the good and the ugly. If u r so pissed off with foreigners getting the organs, then maybe u can start off a topic asking Gov to give priority to the singapore people when it comes to receiving organs. In fact it may already be in place now.<br><br><blockquote>Are private hospitals to have mor CLIENTS&amp; EARNINGS????</blockquote>Then does the people who had kidney problems deserve to pay and suffer dialysis every week just because healthy organs from r left to burnt in crematorium ? U deprived the people a chance to see because u rather bury your cornea than let other people use it ? And your reason why not is because u do not want hospital to earn money ?!?! Why do u want hospital to go bankrupt in the first place ? Now is a win win situation isn't it ?<br><br><strong>PROS</strong><br><br>People get to benefit from the organs they donate. It means a new lease of life for those people who suffer from many ailment such as kidney failures etc.<br><br>Singapore may get to improve their economy since their healthcare services had improved.<br><br><strong>CONS</strong><br><br>I can't get to think of anything to be out in here... Maybe the dead people get to have more beautiful corpse ? The crematorium can burn better with extra pounds of flesh in it ?<br></div>
