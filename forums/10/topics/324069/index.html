              <p>Well, this is what i think</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>within 10-20 yrs from now, China and India will probably take over Singapore's status</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>probably 30 yrs ltr from now, Singapore will start to see prosperous times declining</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>by 45-60 yrs from now, Singapore will just collapse and fail, ending the prosperous times and into the downfall times</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>history has shown that city-states dun survive for long, so for Singapore to survive longer, its abt the government</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi friends,</p>
              <p>There are many things one can predict.</p>
              <p>For me, I just like to suggest that</p>
              <p>in the <span style="color: #0000ff;">next 1 to 3 years</span>, we could see</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">more opposition-like groups of people speaking on behalf on the people, providing them richer views from multiple angle.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Opposition-like but may not be registered political parties. As to what is their agenda, they people need to find out.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As to whether this phenomenon is / will be good for the Opposition remains to be seen. </span></p>
              <p>I sense that the garment has already realised the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">formidability of youtube , blogging Face Booking and internet capabilities</span> in general.</p>
              <p>To survive, political parties now embrace the internet.</p>
              <p>In fact , their immediate future depends substantially on it. Their ricebowl as well.</p>
              <p>The Mainstream Media (MM) is not sufficient anymore.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is boggling me right now is, who is saying the truth , given that to understand 1 truths, one may need to read about / understand more than 1 truth. What can ensure that the people get access to all the relevant and necessary truths to understand a truth?     </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So, people can be giving truths to understand a truth. But some other relevant truths may , by 'accident' , not given to the information consumers at the time of printing. Thus, FREEDOM of INFORMATION or news freedom is important. Without it, some truths may not reach the news consumers in one report. Multiple sources of reliable news and commentaries can give more full-bodied contents.</span></p>
              <p>So far, many or majority are not aware of things like TOC, Siew Kum Hong, Reform party and current affairs, especially political issues. They could have come across these names in the news but it is usually a case of left-ear-in, right-ear-out - They FORGET.  Who are supporting the activities organised by the people who run the new blogs and websites that discuss and comment on political issues? Who are sponsoring them? These needs to be transparent. The people can then better decide.</p>

              <p>Let me make a prediction... just guess guess only huh..</p>
              <p>Singapore is not gonna be going towards democratic until LKY dies. I am not cursing him or anything but tis is basically how people have been exerting power politically sine donkey years. Only when chiang in taiwan died, then democracy start shaping in taiwan. Only when ci xi died, then china can be ruled by sun yat sen (for the shortest of time). Similarly in europe, only when a ruler of great repute died, then there is reform to their political system.</p>
              <p>Then LHL will gradually open up the opposition. However the progress will be slow until maybe 15 years from now and when he steps down as prime minister, then singapore becomes democratic like taiwan. (if u study, singapore is following the taiwan model )</p>
              <p>Then it will be the start of the decline. Tis is wat u see from most democratic countries... u will realise u r being slowly replaced or outgrow by other countries in the region. It is also the end of respect for politician, and they will be treated like teachers or policemen where they get complained for anything. It is also the time where unpopular decisions will never be implemented and the politician becomes politician not because they like the job (because it becomes a shitty job) but because they like the power.</p>
              <p>China will become a big powerhouse in future and people have less reservation dealing with china. Feeling of past wartime grievances will be replaced by economic greed. A new ring of economy integration such as korea japan taiwan hongkong china may form (the group tat look like chinese/korea/japanese.. some economist proposed tis long time ago actually) . This is probably in 30 years time</p>
              <p>Then the world becomes more polarised..</p>
