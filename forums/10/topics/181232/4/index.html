Eventhough Singapore may never compete with US when it comes to weapon sophistication nor Russian for bargain price weapons.....Singapore have carve out it's own niche.<br>I think they are gearing themselves to become specialize in SE Asia weapon requirement.These are some examples.<br><br>Indonesia:<br>Ultimax100 saw<br>FH-88 artillery<br>CIS 40mm auto grenade launcher<br>AMX-13 upgrades<br><br>Thailand:<br>SAR-80<br>M16S1<br>45m patrol vessels<br><br>Philippines:<br>Ultimax100<br>CIS 40mm AGL</div></blockquote>R&amp;D in defence science DSO,is it funded by ST or Mindef budget. anyone can enlighten??</div>
