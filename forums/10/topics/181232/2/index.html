            <div class='col-md body'>Let me give you guys my take on this issue.<br>The government does not benefit from increased spending on defence one bit. They decided on what needs to be spent based on circumstances.<br>In war, you will pay any price to win. I will rather pay a high price for a powerful deterence now so that we don't have to go to war than to pay the price of a war. Thats Sun Tzu's highest level of strategem, the win a war without having to fight. The government is applying this wisdom when it comes to defence.<br><br>So how do you present a credible defence? Build a real deterence till it is obvious to the potential foe that they can never win. Send the message out loud and clear, in no uncertain terms.</div>
