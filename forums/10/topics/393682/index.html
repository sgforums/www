              <p>SINGAPORE
                  (AFP) - – Construction workers from Bangladesh, hotel staff from the
                  Philippines, waitresses from China, shipyard welders from Myanmar,
                  technology professionals from India -- Singapore has them all.</p>
              <p>For
                  years the rich but worker-starved city-state, built by mainly Chinese
                  immigrants, had rolled out the welcome mat for foreigners, whose
                  numbers rose drastically during the economic boom from 2004-2007.</p>
              <p>But
                  with one in three of the five million people living on the tiny island
                  now a foreigner and citizens complaining about competition for jobs,
                  housing and medical care, the government is taking a fresh look at its
                  open-door policy</p>
              <p>With the grumbling getting louder and general
                  elections expected to be called before they are due in 2012, the
                  government has unveiled measures to reduce reliance on foreigners and
                  assure citizens they remain the priority.</p>
              <p>"There are social
                  and physical limits to how many more we can absorb," Finance Minister
                  Tharman Shanmugaratnam told parliament in February.</p>
              <p>He said
                  the government will make it costlier for companies to hire foreigners
                  by raising the levies they must pay for every non-Singaporean or
                  non-resident they hire.</p>
              <p>The government also earmarked 5.5
                  billion Singapore dollars (3.9 billion US) over the next five years to
                  upgrade Singaporean workers' skills to boost their productivity, make
                  them more competitive and raise incomes.</p>
              <p>It imposed measures
                  to cool down rising home prices, also blamed on foreigners buying into
                  the property market, and pledged it will further tighten the process of
                  accepting permanent residents and new citizens.</p>
              <p>Of Singapore's
                  population of nearly five million last year, 533,200 were permanent
                  residents and 1.25 million were foreigners on employment passes, along
                  with their families, official statistics show.</p>
              <p>"I think it is shaping up to be one of the hottest issues in Singapore today," political commentator Seah Chiang Nee told AFP.</p>
              <p>Economist
                  Song Seng Wun of CIMB-GK Research said that apart from helping local
                  companies rise up the value chain, the new measures will also address
                  potential election issues.</p>
              <p>Singapore's last elections, held in
                  2006, saw the ruling People's Action Party returned to power for six
                  years, continuing its uninterrupted rule over the island since 1959.</p>
              <p>"The government has to be seen doing something in areas that are potential flashpoints," Song said.</p>
              <p>Disenchantment
                  over foreign workers gained momentum during a severe economic slump
                  that began in the third quarter of 2008, when trade-reliant Singapore
                  became the first Asian economy to slip into recession.</p>
              <p>Drastic job and salary cuts were implemented, affecting many white-collar workers.</p>
              <p>In
                  coffee shops, Internet forums, letters to newspapers and sessions with
                  members of parliament, citizens became more vocal about the rapidly
                  growing numbers of foreigners in their ranks.</p>
              <p>The most common complaint is that Singaporeans are losing jobs to foreigners who are willing to accept much lower salaries.</p>
              <p>"Foreigners
                  are a damn pain in the butt. I seriously wonder if they are here to
                  work or just snatch jobs from our locals," said one posting on the
                  popular online forum sammyboy.com.</p>
              <p>"The country is fast
                  becoming an unfamiliar place to many Singaporeans. The sense of
                  national pride is disappearing by the day," said a posting by Nur
                  Muhammad on The Online Citizen.</p>
              <p>Seah, who runs the political
                  website www.littlespeck.com, said much of the resentment comes from
                  Singaporeans who have to compete directly with foreign engineers,
                  accountants, hotel managers and IT professionals.</p>
              <p>"Most
                  Singaporeans do not feel angry against low-skilled foreign workers...
                  It is more aimed at those who come in as white collar workers and get
                  the jobs that Singaporeans can do," he said.</p>
              <p>Citizens have
                  also complained about having to share space in crowded trains with a
                  large number of foreigners, or compete with them for places in
                  government schools and public housing.</p>
              <p>Foreign labourers are
                  accused of loitering, spitting in public and leaving litter behind.
                  Another sore point for locals is dealing with waitresses and sales
                  people who can hardly understand English.</p>
              <p>Some employers have
                  argued they do not hire Singaporeans for certain jobs because locals
                  are choosy and often lack the natural social and communication skills
                  in service professions like manning hotel front desks.</p>
              <p>In some ways, Singapore is a victim of its own success.</p>
              <p>A
                  campaign in the 1970s for families to have only two children was so
                  effective that the country is now well below the 60,000 babies needed
                  per year just to naturally replace the resident population.</p>
              <p>Efforts
                  to reverse the trend have failed as increasingly affluent couples marry
                  at a later age and opt for just one child or none at all.</p>
              <p>Officials,
                  economists and business executives admit that with Singaporeans
                  procreating less, the country will need foreign workers in the long
                  term, while making sure citizens' interests are addressed.</p>
              <p>Singapore's
                  founding leader Lee Kuan Yew, who advises the cabinet of his son Prime
                  Minister Lee Hsien Loong, said in January that "we've grown in the last
                  five years by just importing labour."</p>
              <p>"Now, the people feel uncomfortable, there are too many foreigners," Lee said.</p>
              <p>"The
                  answer is simple: We check the flow of foreigners, raise your
                  productivity, do the job better, so that instead of two workers,
                  eventually you'll do it with one worker, like the Japanese do."<br><br>Source: AFP, 14 March 2010<br>http://sg.news.yahoo.com/afp/20100314/tbs-singapore-economy-society-immigratio-0b9af05.html</p>
