                  <p> Encouraged by the determination of fellow former political prisoner Said Zahari to unveil the other side of history, Singapore's Dr Lim Hock Siew has also decided to publish his memoirs.<br><br>"Although I have told my story in a documentary film many years ago, I have decided to write it down myself in the form of memoirs like my ‘good brother' Said," he told malaysiakini during an exclusive interview in Kuala Lumpur.<br><br>"I am now conducting research to find out more newly declassified materials in London to link up more dots," added the 76-year old founding member of Singapore's now ruling People's Action Party (PAP).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lim was detained without trial for almost 20 years from 1963 to 1982.</strong></span> (Which makes him the second longest-held political prisoner in Singapore after Chia Thye Poh)<br><br>According to him, although he was alleged to have participated in the activities of the so-called ‘Communist United Front' in Singapore from the mid-1950s to early 1960s, he was never formally charged in any open court of law for the allegation.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>"I still remember even my police interrogators told me that they knew I had never been a member of any communist party or group,"</strong></span> said Lim who was a central committee member of the opposition Socialist Front in Singapore at the time of his arrest.<br><br>He was detained during the 1963 Operation Cold Store, which saw more than 130 leaders of opposition parties, labour and student unions and journalists deemed to be left wing held as well.<br><br><strong>Serving British interests</strong><br><br>"Now, from all the already released records in London as well as other historical researches, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it is clear that in launching Operation Cold Store, Lee Kuan Yew was serving the then strategic interests of Britain which wanted Singapore to continue to provide a forward military base in Southeast Asia," said Lim</strong></span><br><br>"It is also now an undeniable fact that Lee worked earlier for the Japanese military during the Occupation making Britain's English materials available in Japanese-language for the occupiers," he added.<br><br>Lim was a graduate of Singapore's prestigious Raffles College and a medical doctor trained in University of Malaya, which was then located in Singapore.<br><br>"I was also a founder of University of Malaya's Socialist Club which became the cradle for many politicians and intellectuals in both Malaysia and Singapore who fought for independence," he recalled with a sense of pride.<br><br>"In those days, anti-colonialism was a very powerful and popular sentiment even in Singapore …<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> I helped found the People's Action Party (PAP) to fight for the freedom of Singapore from British rule and to reunite it with Peninsula to form an united, non-communal and progressive Malaya but when Lee turned right wing and started serving British interests, the party split and I left to join the Socialist Front," he explained.</strong></span><br><br>"We certainly opposed to Singapore being maintained as a military base for Britain and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>that was why Lee had to crush the Left in Singapore at all cost </strong></span>… The Left in Singapore also opposed to the 1963 merger because <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>we thought it was an opportunistic adventure on the part of Lee who wanted to exploit Tunku Abdul Rahman's anti-communism to suppress the Left in Singapore </strong></span>… we wanted merger but not in the 1963 version which proved to be an utter failure just two years later in 1965...</p>

                  <p>Mr Speaker: No, I will give you one minute.<br><br>Enche' Chia Thye
                          Poh: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sir, when the Prime Minister talks of defending our country, we
                          find it hollow. This Government has betrayed all the vital interests of
                          the people to the British. It has no right to talk of defending the
                          nation. This Government is oppressing the people; more than 200
                          political leaders and trade unionists are in the jails of Singapore. </strong></span></p>
                  <p>Our Secretary- General, Mr Lim Chin Siong, is in Changi <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and political
                          dwarfs like Mr Lee Kuan Yew can strut around and talk big only when
                          giants like Mr Lim Chin Siong are kept out of the political arena</strong></span> (interruption).<br><br>Mr Speaker: Do not disturb him.<br><br>Enche'
                          Chia Thye Poh: The Prime Minister has spoken about the communal riots
                          in Singapore. He says that the Indonesians and the Communists caused
                          it.</p>
                  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We are from Singapore and we know that this is just to cover up the
                          real culprits.</strong></span></p>
                  <p>The Prime Minister of Singapore is telling, in Europe,
                          that the UMNO politicians have caused it. The UMNO in Singapore says
                          that the P.A.P. has caused it.</p>
                  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> We who are in Singapore know that the
                          communal riots were the work of the UMNO and the P.A.P. who were
                          indulging in a bitter fight for power. </strong></span></p>
                  <p>All this nonsense about the
                          Indonesians and the Communists causing these riots is just to hide the
                          truth that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the main culprits belong to the ruling parties.</strong></span><br><br>SOME HONOURABLE MEMBERS : <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Nonsense! Lies</strong></span><br><br>Enche' Chia Thye Poh : We challenge the Government to have a public enquiry into this. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>When the riots started . . . .</strong></span><br><br>Mr Speaker : Order, order! Your time is up—it is already one minute.</p>

The US government like like all the other countries, want a pause in war to allow Tamil civilians to leave the battlefront, and US government like all the other countries wants the Sri Lankan government to start negotiations with Tamils, and NOT with LTTE because LTTE cannot be trusted since they are a terrorist organisation. They started off a rebels and since then gone in too transnational crime and activities against humanity. The war, the poor girl and boy soldiers in LTTE  fighting is not for freedom, it is for their leader prabakaran to go about earning millions in funds and illegal activities. These poor boys and girls are brainwashed by their superiors in LTTE to blow themselves up in the name of war and freedom.</p>

              who was assassinated in 2005. </strong>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SRI LANKA’S security forces appear to have redeemed their
              professional reputation with their resounding success in the fourth
              edition of the Eelam War, which has been going on since 2006 against
              the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), popularly known as the
              Tamil Tigers. They were not able to achieve decisive results against
              the LTTE in their three earlier outings.</p>
              <p>The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had rated
              the Tamil Tigers as “among the most dangerous and deadly extremists in
              the world”. The FBI said the LTTE’s “ruthless tactics have inspired
              terrorist networks worldwide, including Al Qaeda in Iraq”. So, the
              security forces’ success against the LTTE should not be underestimated,
              particularly when similar wars against insurgents and terrorists in
              other countries, including Afghanistan, have been dragging on.</p>
              <p>The LTTE, over the past 25 years, has built a 15,000-strong force
              that innovatively adapted its suicide war tactics to both land and
              naval warfare with deadly results. It mastered the use of terror
              tactics as a force multiplier. The LTTE’s charismatic and ruthless
              leader, Velupillai Prabakaran, built a loyal network of cadre – the
              Black Tigers – whose deadly suicide terror attacks changed the course
              of political history in Sri Lanka and to a certain extent in India
              also. Now the insurgents stand reduced to a few hundreds and have lost
              their entire territory of over 15,000 square kilometres and their
              equipment, weapons, armament and infrastructure so essential for
              survival as a viable entity.</p>
              <p>The LTTE demonstrated its prowess with a daring suicide attack on
              Colombo’s Katunayake international airport, destroying 26 military and
              civil aircraft, in July 2001, just four months before Al Qaeda’s
              dramatic 9/11 attacks in New York. It sent a strong message to Sri
              Lanka and the world at large that the LTTE was a formidable force not
              be trifled with. But the consequences of the 9/11 attack on the global
              attitude to terrorism was far-reaching. The U.S. marshalled forces for
              a global war on terror to destroy Al Qaeda and its roots in Islamist
              terror. And the LTTE was already listed in the U.S. as a foreign
              terrorist organisation.</p>
              <p>The late Anton Balasingham, a close confidant of Prabakaran’s and
              the political adviser to the LTTE, apparently understood the need to
              modify the LTTE strategy in the face of the rising tide against
              terrorism. He persuaded a reluctant Prabakaran to agree to take part in
              a Norwegian-mediated peace process, deferring the idea of an
              independent Eelam in favour of finding a solution to accommodate Tamil
              aspirations within a federal structure. That was how the 2002 peace
              process came into being.</p>
              <p>The LTTE signed the Cease Fire Agreement (CFA) with Sri Lanka in
              2002 as part of the peace process from a position of political and
              military strength, having weathered four wars – three against Sri
              Lankan security forces and one against Indian forces. It was at the
              pinnacle of its power at that time. To a certain extent, this enabled
              the Tamil Tigers to dictate the terms of the peace process, which
              recognised it as the sole representative of the Tamil minority, a
              status denied to it earlier. Thus, the peace process accorded parity of
              status to the LTTE at the negotiating table in its equation with the
              elected government of Sri Lanka.</p>
              <p>By then, the repeated stories of LTTE successes, propagated by its
              well-oiled propaganda machine that glossed over its significant
              failures (for example, the retaking of control of Jaffna by the Sri
              Lanka Army), reinforced the popular belief of Prabakaran’s
              invincibility in war. It also generated great political expectations
              among the Tamil population of his ability to satisfy their
              long-standing aspirations through the peace process although he had
              dropped the demand for an independent Tamil Eelam. All that has been
              proved wrong now.</p>
              <p>Winston Churchill once remarked, “Those who can win a war well can
              rarely make a good peace and those who could make a good peace would
              never have won the war.” This is very true in the case of Prabakaran’s
              handling of events leading up to the war. His monolithic and egocentric
              leadership style does not encourage the free exchange of ideas except
              with his trusted childhood friends. This has been the big roadblock in
              his strategic decision-making process. Prabakaran failed to use
              fruitfully the political talent at his disposal, among the seasoned
              members of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), in handling complex
              political issues during the period of peace. Their advice was neither
              sought nor paid heed to in taking decisions on key issues. The LTTE’s
              handling of the presidential poll of 2005 is one such instance when
              their plea for his support to elect Ranil Wickremesinghe, an architect
              of the peace process, went unheeded.</p>
              <p>Wickremesinghe’s rival, Mahinda Rajapaksa, had promised, in his
              election manifesto, to eliminate LTTE terrorism. Prabakaran not only
              ignored this but, on the basis of some convoluted reasoning, enforced a
              boycott of the presidential poll in areas under LTTE control. This
              action prevented a bulk of the Tamils from voting for Wickremesinghe.
              This enabled Rajapaksa’s victory with a wafer-thin majority through
              southern Sinhala votes. And the newly elected President went about
              systematically dismantling the LTTE.</p>
              <p>Similarly, Prabakaran’s handling of the international community
              lacked coherence. Apparently, he misunderstood the international
              involvement in the 2002 peace process and thought it was a vindication
              of the LTTE’s methods. Perhaps this made him complacent when it came to
              observing the ceasefire in spirit. The LTTE’s conduct, which was in
              utter disregard of international norms on human rights and humanitarian
              laws during the entire period of the ceasefire, came under severe
              criticism from international watchdog bodies and the United Nations.
              These related to a large number of issues, including the recruitment of
              child soldiers, illegal arrests and kidnapping apart from the
              assassinations and suicide bombings. This made the LTTE’s rhetoric on
              human rights hollow.</p>
              <span style="font-size: xx-small;"> </span><br> <img src="http://www.flonnet.com/images/20090522261001202.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="433" height="600" align="middle">
              <p> </p>
              <p>While the co-chairs were sympathetic to the Tamil struggle for
              equity, they were wary of the LTTE’s tactics and covert operations in
              their own countries. And the LTTE’s indifference to their counsel
              during the peace process eroded its credibility. Things came to a boil
              with the assassination of Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman
              Kadirgamar in August 2005. This wanton act compelled the European Union
              and Canada to ban the LTTE. Thus, the LTTE shot itself in the foot as
              it was banned in 32 countries. The ban also coincided with the
              introduction of strong international protocols in shipping and against
              money laundering to prevent the international operations of terrorists.</p>
              <p>Prabakaran probably failed to appreciate the implications of these
              developments when he gave the government a legitimate excuse to abandon
              the peace process after the LTTE made an abortive suicide attack in
              April 2006 on Lieutenant General Sarath Fonseka, the Army chief. It
              also enabled Rajapaksa to persuade the international community to crack
              down on the LTTE’s support network and front organisations in their
              midst. International cooperation was further enlarged in scope to
              intelligence sharing and economic aid, which indirectly underwrote Sri
              Lanka’s mounting burden of war.</p>
              <p>Similarly, Prabakaran never made any effort before the war to redeem
              the LTTE’s relations with India. He failed to tap the fund of sympathy
              for the Tamil cause that exists in India even among large sections of
              the non-Tamil population. Presumably, his dubious role in Rajiv
              Gandhi’s assassination prevented him from dispassionately examining the
              positive contribution India could have made in pushing the Tamil cause
              at the negotiating table. Apparently, he put his faith in the
              international community rather than in India to bail him out when the
              Sri Lankan government decided to go to war. This showed a lack of
              understanding of the complexities of international relations. On the
              other hand, successive Sri Lankan Presidents went out of their way to
              keep India in good humour and that helped the country politically and
              militarily in its war with the LTTE. In Eelam War III (1995-2002), the
              performance of the Sri Lankan security forces was far from
              satisfactory. By then, the LTTE had developed the Sea Tiger wing – a
              daring guerilla navy that played havoc with the Sri Lanka Navy. The Sri
              Lanka Army had suffered heavy casualties in defending Mullaithivu and
              suffered a huge setback in Elephant Pass despite its superior strength
              and firepower. In that operation, the LTTE acquired its modern
              artillery, armour and high-tech communication systems apart from
              capturing equipment.</p>
              <p>At the start of the peace process, the security forces were a
              demoralised lot. The terms of the peace process further added to their
              misery as it prevented them from retaliating when the LTTE’s pistol
              groups systematically eliminated the forces’ intelligence operatives
              and killed even military commanders during the first three years of
              peace. In this backdrop, no one was sure of the ability of Sri Lanka’s
              forces to sustain an offensive against the LTTE when Eelam War IV
              started in 2006.</p>
              <p>Even after the LTTE defeat in Mavil Aru in the Eastern Province in
              July 2006, the security forces were cautious in their optimism.
              However, the LTTE belied the defence analysts’ expectations when it
              floundered in the Eastern Province, offering stiff resistance only in
              patches. Perhaps, it was at this time that Rajapaksa and Fonseka made
              up their minds to go the whole hog against the LTTE in the north.</p>
              <p>Although Prabakaran has demonstrated strategic military capability
              in the past, he appears to have failed to draw two obvious strategic
              deductions in the developing war scenario, which put the LTTE at a
              disadvantage. The first was not factoring the impact of the defection
              of Karuna, his able military commander from Batticaloa, on the LTTE’s
              overall military capability. The second was in underestimating the
              determination of Sri Lanka’s political and military leadership to turn
              Rajapaksa’s promise to eliminate the LTTE into a reality.Prabakaran
              never made any effort to patch up with Karuna, who had grievances with
              respect to the poor representation of easterners in the leadership
              although they provided the bulk of the LTTE cadre. Instead, he
              dispatched killers to eliminate Karuna. The rebel leader commanded wide
              support among cadre in the east, particularly around LTTE strongholds
              in Batticaloa. A direct consequence of his defection was the disbanding
              of a bulk of LTTE cadre, other than Karuna’s core supporters. It also
              drove Karuna into the arms of the Sri Lanka Army for protection. So
              when the war started in the east, the LTTE’s strength as well as its
              manoeuvring space was reduced.</p>
              <p>In the course of time, recruitment from the east to augment LTTE
              strength petered out. Ultimately, when the security forces launched
              their offensive in the north with huge numerical superiority, the LTTE
              did not have the essential strength to face the onslaught. It was clear
              that the LTTE would not be able halt the security forces by
              conventional warfare.</p>
              <p>However, somehow Prabakaran failed to use his superior insurgency
              tactics to overcome his limitations in conventional warfare. Instead,
              the LTTE adopted a passive defensive strategy with a line of bunds that
              reduced the natural advantage of guerilla mobility enjoyed by the
              cadre. The bunds imposed a limited delay as they required heavy
              firepower to break up the offensive. This was a luxury that the LTTE
              did not enjoy.</p>
              <p>The second aspect was the LTTE leader’s failure to read the mind of
              Rajapaksa. In his first two years in office, the President had oriented
              his entire policy framework towards the goal of eliminating the LTTE.
              His strong support to the operations of the security forces, regardless
              of national and international compulsions, enabled the Army chief to
              plan and execute his offensive.</p>

              district on Women’s Day in March 2004. Prabakaran failed to take into
              account the impact of Karuna’s defection from the LTTE on its overall
              military capability. </strong>
              <p> </p>
              <p>His strategic direction of war, operational planning and neat
              execution undoubtedly paved the way for success. In the words of
              Lieutenant General Satish Nambiar, the distinguished Indian Army
              officer, Fonseka “displayed the qualities of a great military leader
              nations are blessed with from time to time”. In short, under Fonseka’s
              leadership, the demoralised armed forces reinvented themselves to
              become a well-knit and highly motivated force.</p>
              <p>As a result, when the security forces went to war in 2006, they were
              well-trained and enjoyed superiority in firepower and mobility.
              Learning from the past, they built up force levels on land, in the air
              and at sea to ensure success against the Tamil Tigers. The Sri Lanka
              Army went on a recruiting spree. For instance, in the year 2008 alone
              40,000 troops were added, to raise 47 infantry battalions, 13 brigades,
              four task force contingents and two divisions. The Army now has 13
              divisions, three task forces and one armoured brigade. Evidently,
              Prabakaran failed to read the sea change taking place in the
              capabilities of the security forces and adapt his tactics. Instead, he
              stuck to a conventional warfare mode that was doomed to fail although
              it inflicted casualties on the advancing troops.</p>
              <p>Fonseka adopted a multi-pronged strategy to split the defending
              Tamil Tiger ranks and keep them guessing. It aimed at pinning down the
              LTTE at the forward-defended localities astride the Kandy-Jaffna A-9
              road in the north from Kilali-Muhamalai-Nagarkovil and in the south
              along the Palamoddai-Omanthai line. This prevented the LTTE from
              thinning out the troops to reinforce its defences along other axes.</p>
              <p>Offensives along two broad axes were launched: along the
              Mannar-Pooneryn/Jaffna A-32 road on the west coast to block LTTE access
              to Tamil Nadu through the Mannar Sea and along the
              Welioya-Mullaithivu-Puthukudiyiruppu line on the east coast. Operations
              on these axes progressively cut off the external supply of military
              equipment and essential goods to the LTTE by sea. In tandem with ground
              operations, the Sri Lanka Navy progressively curtailed the freedom of
              movement of Sea Tiger boats and prevented LTTE shipments from reaching
              the Sri Lanka coast. In well-planned raids in international waters, the
              Navy destroyed eight ships of the LTTE’s tramp supply shipping fleet in
              2006-07.</p>
              <p>Despite faltering steps at times, the security forces maintained the
              momentum of their offensive in the north from the second half of 2007,
              which culminated in the dramatic capture in January 2009 of
              Kilinochchi, the so-called administrative capital of the LTTE. This
              capture contributed largely to the rapid advance of the security forces
              in areas east of the A-9 axis, which never gave the withdrawing LTTE a
              respite or permitted it to deliver a strong counterstroke.</p>
              <p>In the present Eelam war, except for a short-lived surprise
              offensive in the Jaffna peninsula in the early stages of the
              confrontation in the north, the LTTE was never able to launch
              proactively a major offensive or a sizable counteroffensive against the
              security forces that would have turned the course of the war.</p>
              <p>The LTTE strategy of carting off all the civilians from captured
              areas to areas under its control after the fall of Kilinochchi is
              questionable. This reactive defence strategy affected the mobility of
              cadre, pinning them down to static defences rather than allowing them
              to adopt a resilient mobile withdrawal strategy. This strategy neither
              prevented the security forces from using their heavy weapons or air
              force nor vindicated the LTTE’s use of civilians as human shields. It
              only generated adverse publicity, and that the security forces were
              also blamed for the same callousness in dealing with ordinary people is
              no consolation as they have emerged as victors.</p>
              <p>The performance of the LTTE in Eelam War IV glaringly displayed
              Prabakaran’s limitations in mastering the art of conventional warfare.
              As he is an astute military leader, if he survives the current ordeal,
              he will put on his thinking cap to reinvent the LTTE, just as Fonseka
              reinvented the security forces when he took on the monumental task of
              reviving them and leading them to war.•</p>

              <p>Having paid such a high price, and arriving at the soon to be concluded war - it is unlikely that the Tamils will get what they were fighting for.</p>
              <p>For the last 30 years, the Tamils were offered some form of autonomy or another, but these were rejected by the Chief of LTTE as the preceding article had shown.</p>
              <p>The best that the Tamils could get will be the same offer of autonomy as a federated state within Sri Lanka.</p>
              <p>Such a political arrangement exist all over the world, and one such example is the Federation of Malaysia - where each state has its own administration and some degree of autonomy to govern themselves within the framework of a Federal Law.</p>
              <p>It is sheer political vanity for the LTTE Chief to fight for an independent state for the Tamils that will result in the carving out of a land portion from Sri Lanka.</p>
              <p>It is tantamount to a minority group of Singaporeans demanding independence for the entire Changi-Bedok area from the rest of Singapore.</p>

              <p>The Sinhalese Army is also despicable. They come in their white vans - kidnapping young Tamil women and committing various war atrocities against the Tamil population. For all you know, the Tamilians they 'rescued' are actually in Sri Lanka concentration camps being tortured to keep their mouths shut.</p>
