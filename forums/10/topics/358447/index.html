The group is called the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) or the Tamil Tigers for short.<br><br>Needless to say, the Tamil Tigers are among the most dangerous and deadly extremists in the world. For more than three decades, the group has launched a campaign of violence and bloodshed in Sri Lanka, the island republic off the southern coast of India.<br><br><br><img src="http://www.fbi.gov/headlines/sri_lanka_map_011008.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="225"><br><br><br>Its ultimate goal: to seize control of the country from the Sinhalese ethnic majority and create an independent Tamil state. Along the way, it has launched suicide attacks, assassinated politicians (including a government minister this week and even the Sri Lankan President), taken hostages, and committed all of kinds of crimes to finance its operations. The resulting civil war has taken the lives of nearly 70,000 Sri Lankans on both sides of the conflict since 1983 alone. <br><br>Why should you care? Certainly because of the suffering and bloodshed that the Tamil Tigers have caused. And because its ruthless tactics have inspired terrorist networks worldwide, including al Qaeda in Iraq. But also because the group has placed operatives right here in our own backyard, discreetly raising money to fund its bloody terrorist campaign overseas, including purchases of weapons and explosives. <br><br>The U.S. government has designated the Tigers a foreign terrorist organization, so their activities here are illegal. And we’re determined to stop them, using the full range of our investigative and intelligence capabilities. <br><br>In April, for example, we struck an important blow when our Joint Terrorism Task Force in New York arrested the alleged U.S. director of the Tigers. The man supposedly held several fundraising events at a church and various public schools in Queens and in northern New Jersey in 2004. He is also accused of arranging high-level meetings between the group’s leaders and U.S. supporters.For More Information on Our Cases <br><br><br><br>We’ve also arrested another 11 Tamil Tiger-related suspects in the New York City region. And in Baltimore, following a multi-agency investigation, a pair of Indonesian men pled guilty and were sentenced recently for working with others to export surface to air missiles, state-of-the-art firearms, machine guns, and night vision goggles to the Tigers in Sri Lanka. <br><br>You can help by being careful with your donations. Like other terrorists, the Tigers have raised funds under a variety of cover organizations, often by posing as charities. A great deal of money, for example, was raised for the Tigers following the 2004 tsunami that devastated Sri Lanka and many other countries.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The fact's are clear other terrorist groups copy the LTTE in all sorts of way, it's time the world woke up to the international threat from the master's of terrorism the LTTE and started not just banning them but taking notice of the 70 thousand dead in Sri Lanka and thinking could they allow others groups who are clearly copying the LTTE's terrorist methods to commit 70 thousand dead in their own country's which have a bigger population than small island nation of Sri Lanka.<br><br>The worlds masters of teaching evil act's against civilians with massive numbers of deaths and casualties is the LTTE the question is when will the west take action against Al-Qaeda’s teachers and take the LTTE text books of terror away from the rest of the worlds terrorist organizations by closing down the LTTE offices based in many country's around the globe.<br><br>Someone has to come up with the idea's for terrorist group's like al-Qaeda to inflict pain on the west, and i would say the groups that inspire the leadership of al-Qaeda with text book terror tactics that work are the LTTE.</p></div>

              <p>I al heard they are nice people who helps the tamils  in their territory by maintaining law and order but what they doing is wrong too, they kill tamils who disagee with them too. The jekyll and hyde nature of this terrorist org is very unique. They are driven by schizopernic ideology just like AL Qaeda.</p>
              <p>The LTTE has also set up a parallel civil administration within its territory by establishing structures such as a police force, law courts, postal services, banks, administrative offices, television and radio broadcasting station, etc. The most prominent of the LTTE ‘state structure' is the ‘Tamil Eelam Judiciary’ and the ‘Tamil Eelam Police’. The ‘Tamil Eelam Police’, with its headquarters at Kilinochchi was formed in year 1993, and reportedly has several wings, including traffic, crime prevention, crime detection, information bureau, administration and a special force. LTTE cadres collect taxes, its courts administer their version of justice and the entire law and order machinery is LTTE-controlled.</p>

              <p>The tactics the employ reminds me of psychopaths and lunatics. Be very careful of this organisation. they have the potential to take over the world if they adopt the ideology of Al Qaeda.</p>
              <p>Yes i agree that what was done to them by the sinahalese is unfair. But LTTE just is so stubborn to negotiate. The stubborn nature has propelled them to the world's best terrorist group that ever existed.</p>
              <p>One Euro terrorism expert said that the war in Sri Lanka is not about rights and space. It is about people who want to gain control of the continent.</p>

              <p>U must understna the even Tamils hate the LTTE leader Velupillai Prabakharan. He has killed his own LTTE members and other Tamils as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> <em>The actions of Velupillai Pirabaharan, the leader of Tamil Tigers prove he is real tiger. The only business he knows is killing. He killed Kalvian Kaadu Chetty, the person who named the group "Tigers" and the original leader of the Tiger group<br><br>Then Pirabaharan tried to kill the next leader of Tigers, Uma Maheswaran in a shoot out in India . He killed the founding members of the Tigers, Michael and Pat Kunam. Pirabaharan himself tipped off the Police about the then leaders of Tigers, Kuttimani and Thangathurai and their whereabouts. This incident led to Kuttimani and Thangathurai’s incarceration until their terrible deaths in the Welikade jail.<br><br>Pirabaharan killed all the persons he worked with before he became the leader of the Tigers. He even killed the last surviving Tiger group founding member Sabalingam who was residing in France , because Sabalingam started writing about Pirabaharan's power hungry killings<br><br>After Pirabaharan became the leader of the Tigers, he started killing all Tamil political leaders, elected mayors, university professors and many innocent Tamils who had criticized Tigers. Pirabaharan banned all Tamil political organizations for the last twenty years and finally the international community including USA, Canada, European Union, India and Australia has banned the Tigers, mainly due to Tigers' continuous use of child soldiers and their terror activities.<br><br>Pirabaharan also killed hundreds of people who were members and supporters of Tamil political organizations. Pirabaharan killed the Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. He even killed the Sri Lankan President Premadasa who had provided helicopter loads of weapons and money to Tigers.<br><br>Pirabaharan clearly knows that under any circumstances except at gunpoint, majority of Tamils won't accept his leadership. That's why he killed all other Tamil Political leaders, to become as the so-called "Sole Leader of Tamils".<br><br>Ramachandran a.k.a MGR, former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu gave Pirabaharan more than 1.25 billion rupees in 1985. Tamils provided their support to Tigers at gunpoint only and never helped Tigers to grow to this extent. Without MGR massive financial support and Premadasa's supply of weapons and money, Tigers won't exist today.<br><br>Tigers are terror loving trigger-happy killers, created by MGR and Premadasa. Tigers' killings are severely affecting the future of Tamils since the killings created a huge political vacuum.<br>In 1990 Pirabaharan wanted 100,000 Muslims in the North of Sri Lanka to get out within 24 hours, leaving their belongings and treasured valuables - that was a text book example of ‘ethnic cleansing’. Prabhakaran made Idi Amin look like an angel as Idi Amin had a heart to give the Asians in Uganda three months to leave the country and not 24 hours.<br><br>Most of the young people who are younger than 35 years, do not know the history of Tigers. They believe that, Tigers became so powerful, because of continuous outpouring support from majority of the Tamils,<br><br>If Tamils like Tigers, why is Greater Colombo flooded with Tamils from Tiger controlled areas? If majority of Tamils like Tigers, Tiger controlled areas should be flooded with Tamils from other areas. Why are Tamils trying to escape Tiger controlled areas, rather than migrating to Tiger controlled area?<br><br>If Tigers lift the exit pass system and allow free movement in the Tiger controlled areas, except the people on Tigers' payroll, every body else will leave Tiger controlled area. The only supporters of Tigers are that they either do not know anything about Tigers or gain benefits from Tigers.<br><br>Why are none of the Tamil business people investing in Tiger controlled areas? Why are even farmers leaving Tiger controlled areas? Why are Tamils living abroad trying to help their relatives to leave Tiger controlled areas? In Tiger controlled areas nobody can express any political opinions or different ideas.<br><br>Only things allowed to say are those that support Tigers. No way can anyone criticize Tigers and live the next day in a Tiger controlled area. Tigers that do not care about human lives will never understand even the basics of human rights. Even the hardcore Tiger supporters are not willing to relocate to Tiger controlled areas.<br><br>Majority of the Tamil refugees, who claimed asylum in western countries, told the authorities that they were running away from Tigers. If majority of Tamils who live abroad support Tigers, why do they have to be threatened to collect money for Tigers as reported by the Human Rights Watch?<br><br>If majority of the Tamils who live abroad support Tigers, those Tamils would line up in front of the Tiger branch offices to drop off money. The major serious problem Tamils are facing right now is there are hundreds of very young terror loving trigger happy Tigers who know only one thing, which is killing another human. Last thirty years, Tigers killed more Tamils than any body else. Also more Tigers were killed by Pirabaharan than any body else.<br><br>Majority of Sri Lankan Tamils are patiently hoping, praying and waiting for a new young democratic political visionary as a leader. Until then, gunpoint Tiger culture and never ending killing spree by Tigers will grow and continue.</em><br></p>

              <h2>Ruthless, dedicated Tamil leader faces final assault</h2>
              <h3 id="deck">Velupillai Prabhakaran has always said he will die
                  fighting for a Tamil homeland, and if he cannot or will not fight, then
                  comrades have orders to shoot him, douse his body with gasoline and set
                  it alight</h3>
              <p class="byline">STEPHANIE NOLEN  AND ANTHONY REINHART</p>
              <p class="source">Globe and Mail Update</p>
              <p>May 1, 2009</p>
              <p>NEW DELHI and TORONTO - He called it, with no trace of irony,<em> thatkodai,</em> the Tamil word for "the gift of life." Velupillai Prabhakaran has asked
                  it of so many of his followers in the last 30 years, the hundreds of
                  Tamils who carried out suicide missions on his orders.</p>
              <p>Will he give <em>thatkodai</em> himself, today, tomorrow, this week,
                  as the horrifically violent showdown in Sri Lanka drags on? Today Mr.
                  Prabhakaran is pinned into a five-kilometre sandy patch, encircled and
                  outnumbered about 10 to one, as the Sri Lankan military pounds him from
                  air and ground and sea. Friday the government urged tens of thousands
                  of trapped civilians to flee the zone as it prepares for a final push
                  to wipe out the rebels.</p>
              <p>Mr. Prabhakaran has always said he will die fighting for Eelam, the
                  Tamil homeland, and if he cannot or will not fight longer, then
                  comrades have orders to shoot him, douse his body with gasoline and set
                  it alight, to deprive the Sri Lankan government of that prize.</p>
              <p>The grisly question of whether Mr. Prabhakaran, 54, the founder and
                  leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), is about to give
                  his life in the fight for Tamil independence is of relevance to more
                  than his loyal fighters and supporters.</p>
              <p>Rebel supporters by the hundreds of thousands have turned out in
                  cities around the world over the past weeks, including Toronto, where
                  they closed University Avenue for days.</p>

              <p> </p>
              </div>
              <p>Mr. Prabhakaran leads a movement that has at times been estimated to
                  be the largest, non-state fighting force in the world, one that has
                  successfully destabilized Sri Lanka for 30 years, that has assassinated
                  two heads of state and murdered countless civilians and embroiled a
                  region in bloody conflict for decades.</p>
              <p>And more than in any other nationalist movement, Mr. Prabhakaran's
                  is built in his image. He is no showman; he has not courted the media
                  to project a larger-than-life personality. He has given only one press
                  conference in 30 years. In fact, he is so soft-spoken that several
                  people given a rare audience have failed to realize they were in the
                  presence of the infamous leader of the Tigers until he stated his name
                  with a gentle smile.</p>
              <p>Rather, Mr. Prabhakaran's status stems from the loyalty of his
                  movement and his people — a potent mix of adulation and terror —
                  inspired by his total devotion to the cause and by his sheer
                  ruthlessness.</p>
              <p>"The movement as a whole can be described in two words, Velupillai
                  Prabhakaran," said M.R. Narayan Swamy, an Indian writer whose books on
                  Sri Lanka's war include a rare Prabhakaran biography called <em>Inside an Elusive Mind</em>.</p>
              <p>"The LTTE was Prabhakaran and Prabhakaran was the LTTE. It had only
                  one leader, only one god — that was Prabhakaran and everything that
                  happened in the LTTE in terms of major policy decisions all had
                  Prabhakaran's stamp."</p>
              <p>Mr. Prabhakaran, in his long struggle, came close to realizing his
                  dream of "Eelam," an independent homeland for the Tamil people in the
                  northern and eastern portion of Sri Lanka (Tamils make up about 13 per
                  cent of Sri Lanka's population). At one point, he ruled over a sort of
                  Potemkin police state in much of that territory as the Tigers set up a
                  parallel civil administration, police force, banks and tax collection.
                  He came even closer to Eelam when the strength of the rebel insurgency
                  forced the Sri Lankan government into a Norwegian-brokered peace
                  process, beginning with a ceasefire in 2002, in which real autonomy for
                  the Tamils was on the table. It collapsed in violence four years later.</p>
              <p>But as a bloody endgame of sorts plays out on a tiny strip of Sri
                  Lankan beach, it is clear that Mr. Prabhakaran's Eelam empire has
                  slipped away: The Tigers are all but destroyed as a conventional
                  military force and most of the people who once lived under their rule
                  are starving in squalid refugee camps or desperately trying to get into
                  one.</p>
              <p>Mr. Prabhakaran lost because he did nothing to convince Sri Lankans
                  or international brokers that he was serious about wanting peace, and
                  because the Sinhalese majority in Sri Lanka elected a leader, Mahinda
                  Rajapaksa, who was not remotely interested in making peace with him in
                  any case. Two years ago, President Rajapaksa launched an all-out
                  military offensive against the Tigers, pumping new soldiers and new
                  funds into armed forces demoralized by their losing battle against the
                  insurgency.</p>
              <p>Still, the person who may know Mr. Prabhakaran best, outside his
                  inner circle of fighting colleagues, doubts that he will be found if
                  soldiers overrun his last stronghold.</p>
              <p>"The noose tightens, but I would think he has already left that
                  little sliver of land," Anita Pratap said. Ms. Pratap, one of India's
                  leading journalists, is the author of <em>Island of Blood</em>, about
                  Sri Lanka's civil war, and the sole journalist of whom Mr. Prabhakaran
                  made something of a regular confidante. "He is an excellent military
                  strategist, a good chess player who anticipates his enemy's every move.
                  I don't see him doodling his thumbs and waiting for the army to advance
                  and capture him."</p>
              <p>Many others, starting with the Sri Lankan military, disagree with
                  Ms. Pratap. The army says that senior Tigers who were captured in the
                  past few days report that Mr. Prabhakaran is hunkered down with the
                  last rebel forces.</p>
              <p>A Tamil journalist based in Colombo who has covered the Tigers for
                  20 years — and who like so many others refuses to be quoted by name
                  talking about the rebel chief — said he doubts the vastly outnumbered
                  rebels would still be fighting if Mr. Prabhakaran were not in the
                  middle of them.</p>
              <p>Mr. Narayan agreed. "I have no doubts he is there. I'm sure they'd
                  like to take him alive, but that will depend on Prabhakaran and, if the
                  past is any guide, he will not let them take him alive."</p>
              <p>There was little in Mr. Prabhakaran's early life to suggest that he
                  was headed for such ferocity. He was the youngest of four children,
                  born Nov. 26, 1954, into a Hindu family of the low fisherman's caste in
                  a small town in northern Sri Lanka. His father was a mid-level civil
                  servant. He was a mediocre student, whose affectionate but stern father
                  despaired a bit of his prospects. But he was also an avid reader, who
                  devoured biographies, and in particular became fascinated with two
                  Indians, Subhash Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh, who were leaders in the
                  armed struggle for independence from Britain. He embraced Mr. Bose's
                  mantra, "I shall fight for the freedom of my land until I shed the last
                  drop of blood."</p>
              <p>Mr. Prabhakaran entered his teens at a time of rising Tamil
                  nationalism, after the Sinhalese-dominated government implemented a
                  series of measures — making Sinhala the official language; Buddhism,
                  the religion of the Sinhalese, the national religion; demanding higher
                  grades of Tamil students to let them into universities; and giving
                  Sinhalese priority access to government jobs — whose brutal chauvinism
                  the government remains unwilling to acknowledge today.</p>
              <p>Many Tamils, especially young people, were frustrated with the lack
                  of a radical response from their leaders, and small militant groups
                  began to form. After joining several political youth groups, Mr.
                  Prabhakaran founded the organization that would become the LTTE in
                  1972. Three years later, using a rusty, old revolver and bullets he
                  made from matches, Mr. Prabhakaran walked up to the mayor of Jaffna,
                  Alfred Duraiyappah, a Tamil considered complicit with the government in
                  Colombo, and shot him as he entered a Hindu temple. Mr. Prabhakaran, as
                  would become the Tiger signature, simply melted away in the melee. When
                  police came to his family home days later, he was long gone, and had
                  taken the precaution of burning any family photos in which he appeared,
                  Mr. Swamy writes.</p>
              <p>Mr. Prabhakaran began life on the run in earnest; he was never
                  caught in Sri Lanka, no matter how wide a net the government cast. He
                  was only jailed once, in one of his periods of operating from the
                  Indian state of Tamil Nadu, just a short boat trip from Sri Lanka, when
                  a squabble with another Tiger leader led to a shootout in the street.
                  But sympathy for the rebels in the Tamil state was strong; India would
                  not extradite him and soon enough he slipped away from house arrest and
                  was smuggled in a fishing boat back to Sri Lanka.</p>
              <p>Over the following years he cemented his hold on the Tiger
                  leadership and began to fund the organization with meticulously planned
                  but dramatic bank robberies. Mr. Prabhakaran vetted would-be rebels for
                  loyalty and stability, then put them through intense training in jungle
                  camps in India and in Sri Lanka. There was gruelling physical training,
                  military-strategy classes, target practice and lessons in the use of
                  the heavier weapons, which the Tigers began to acquire with stolen cash
                  and donations from sympathetic Tamils abroad. Recurring episodes of
                  anti-Tamil violence, and a lack of intervention by a hard-line
                  Sinhalese government, provided him with no shortage of recruits.</p>
              <p>In the midst of this, Mr. Prabhakaran got married. His relationship
                  with his wife, Mathivathani Erambu, began awkwardly when he had her
                  abducted — she was among a group of students on a political hunger
                  strike that the Tigers disrupted. She and the others were spirited off
                  to a Tiger base, where the others quailed but she, it's said, was
                  undaunted by the rebel chief and openly joked with him.</p>
              <p>The Tiger movement forbade relations between cadres at the time, so
                  Mr. Prabhakaran rewrote the rules to allow senior LTTE officers to wed.
                  He also had to conquer her family; she is from a much higher caste.
                  They had two sons and a daughter. Today his wife, younger son and
                  daughter are believed to be outside Sri Lanka — variously reported to
                  be in India, Ireland or South Africa — while his eldest son, Charles
                  Anthony, is reported to fight alongside him.</p>
              <p>Mr. Prabhakaran is described as a loving father, a warm host, a man
                  with a weakness for boiled crabs and chocolate who once gave his rebels
                  orders never to kill anyone while they were eating. But under his
                  leadership, the Tigers had no soft side. The LTTE quickly moved from
                  attacks on police and soldiers to bombing busloads of civilians and
                  Buddhist places of worship.</p>
              <p>One former LTTE fighter, who joined as an 18-year-old and rose to
                  the rank of military trainer, remembers a fierce, if warped, sense of
                  justice. "He grew up with the dharma thing [the Hindu idea of "a
                  righteous duty"], you know, fair or not," said the man, who spoke on
                  condition of anonymity. If Sinhalese killed Tamils, Mr. Prabhakaran
                  would take some Sinhalese lives in response "to show that you don't do
                  that. … Every country has a policy … to show that 'if you do that, I
                  will do this,' so that [their enemies] understand the language."</p>
              <p>And all tactics were fair, he told his supporters, given the
                  "asymmetrical" nature of the conflict that pitted a small insurgency
                  against a well-armed state force. The Tigers had a great many teenagers
                  in their ranks, leading to criticism of "child soldiers," although Mr.
                  Prabhakaran, who began fighting at 16, likely fails to see a problem
                  with that. When the recruits did not come voluntarily, the LTTE began
                  to conscript, forcing each household in the region it controlled to
                  send a fighter. Many Tamil families supported the Tigers, but whether
                  they did or not, they began to face regular pressure to supply funds.
                  Families that did not supply either fighters or cash might see their
                  children disappear in the night, their house burn, or one member return
                  shell-shocked from brutal Tiger interrogation or "political retraining."</p>
              <p>Mr. Prabhakaran, a few of whose cadres had been trained by the
                  Palestinian Liberation Organization in Lebanon, drew on the tactic of
                  suicide bombing then in early use by Hezbollah, and he pioneered the
                  use of the explosive vest. He called his bombers, those from whom he
                  demanded <em>thatkodai, </em>the Black Tigers, and nearly half of them were women.</p>
              <p>It was a young woman who carried out the mission that Mr. Swamy and
                  many others view as Mr. Prabhakaran's great mistake: She approached
                  Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi as he left a political rally in 1991
                  and offered him a flower garland, and then bent to touch his feet in
                  apparent respect, setting off her explosive vest as she did so. She
                  killed him, herself, and 18 others. The attack was intended to keep
                  India — which had sent a peacekeeping force, that wound up fighting the
                  rebels, to Sri Lanka in the late 1980s — from further meddling, but it
                  had the effect of permanently souring Indian sympathy for the Tigers.</p>
              <p>In 1993, Mr. Prabhakaran sent Black Tigers to kill Ranasinghe
                  Premadasa, the Sri Lankan president with whom he had been allied
                  against the Indian forces; he ordered the killing of the opposition
                  leader, Gamini Dissanayake, and he was equally ruthless in hunting down
                  Tamil politicians he considered insufficiently loyal. In 1996, several
                  squads of intended suicide attackers blew up the Central Bank in
                  Colombo, killing more than 100 people. He sent bombers in 1999 to kill
                  president Chandrika Kumaratunga, with whom he had been engaged in peace
                  negotiations, but the attempt failed, leaving her partially blind.
                  Thirty-five others were killed in the attempt.</p>
              <p>Why were so many willing to don the vest of the Black Tigers? And
                  why did so many in the Tamil diaspora willingly pour money into LTTE
                  coffers?</p>
              <p>Mr. Prabhakaran had no real ideology. He read about Che Guevera but
                  had little interest in socialism, even when the revolutionary ideology
                  was sweeping rebel movements in Latin America and elsewhere in Asia.
                  Mr. Swamy quoted him as once saying he had little interest in "isms"
                  but for one: "I want all these caste differences to go." (Mr.
                  Prabhakaran has been an unusual champion of gender equality, promoting
                  women through the highest ranks of the Tigers and not differentiating
                  between tasks given to male and female cadres.) Nor has Mr. Prabhakaran
                  relied on charisma or great skill as an orator. Ms. Pratap said that
                  when she first met him, her disappointment — the legendary guerrilla
                  leader was short, a bit dumpy and looked like a middle-aged merchant —
                  was so visible on her face that Mr. Prabhakaran laughed. But, she added
                  this week, within moments, she knew he was extraordinary.</p>
              <p>"There was no pretence or mendacity, hyperbole or chest-beating
                  patriotism. … There was no spin in Prabhakaran. His sincerity was
                  simple, direct, plain, transparent. That gave him a clarity of thinking
                  and purpose that I knew was unusual and exceptional," she said.</p>
              <p>"I realized during that first interview that no way this man could
                  be bought or bullied. … Prabhakaran was too tough to be browbeaten by
                  sticks and too detached from the trappings of power to be enticed by
                  the usual carrots that politicians salivate over —money, position,
                  titles, etc. … I also saw that he had the determination and the
                  intelligence, the courage and the ruthlessness to pursue his cause."</p>
              <p>Another Tamil Toronto resident who knew Mr. Prabhakaran well — and
                  who also refused to be quoted by name for fear his old association
                  would bring unwanted attention from Canadian security agencies —
                  described his own seduction by the Tiger leader. They grew up near each
                  other. When the man was young, Mr. Prabhakaran approached him to ask
                  for some help for the new rebel movement.</p>
              <p>"The first time I met him, I could see he is a different person,
                  that was my feeling throughout," the man recalled in a recent
                  interview. "Even when you look at him, his eyes are so powerful, you
                  know. He can just capture you. … I'm not exaggerating. These are my
                  feelings. From that time onward, I know he's the person who is going to
                  lead the Tamils from the slavery, from the injustice of the Sinhala
                  majority."</p>
              <p>The man soon found himself working closely with the Tigers from a base in India.</p>
              <p>And even his detractors have to acknowledge Mr. Prabhakaran's
                  extraordinary force of will, Mr. Swamy said. "Apart from all he has
                  done — negative or positive, depending on which side of the fence
                  you're on — there must be something," he said. "When you ask people to
                  die for you, there must be something in you that causes people to do
                  it. The fact that he could sit in the jungle and set up air strips and
                  make planes take off and bomb Colombo, that's something."</p>
              <p>Mr. Prabhakaran always had the ability to speak powerfully to Tamil
                  alienation; he offered angry people the promise of revenge, he tapped
                  skillfully into their frustration and he seemed always devoted to the
                  cause, with none of the tendency to pander that earlier leaders had,
                  the Toronto resident said. "They feel, 'This is right — we don't mind
                  supporting this man.' He had certain traits that made people follow
                  him, and quite blindly at that."</p>
              <p>And yet the most critical blindness, in the end, appears to be Mr.
                  Prabhakaran's own. He completely failed, for example, to gauge the sea
                  change after 9/11, when organizations using terrorist tactics lost all
                  support. Canada listed the Tigers as a terrorist group in 2006, and
                  barred any fundraising in Canada. By refusing to stop his attacks, Mr.
                  Prabhakaran eroded his support in international quarters — deeply
                  frustrating the once-sympathetic Norwegian negotiators, for example —
                  and moderate Tamils.</p>
              <p>"Prabhakaran didn't understand what he was in," said the one-time
                  Tiger activist who now lives in Toronto. "The Tigers didn't understand
                  how to build bridges."</p>
              <p>Mr. Prabhakaran repeatedly failed to rally world opinion behind the
                  Tamil cause; instead, he did the opposite through use of tactics such
                  as suicide bombings and conscripting children. He lacked the political
                  savvy of the African National Congress or the Irish Republican Army to
                  transition to a legitimate political entity, he said.</p>
              <p>That, he concluded, reflects several things. First, Mr.
                  Prabhakaran's own lack of education and his distrust of better-educated
                  people. His disdain for debate means that Mr. Prabhakaran has routinely
                  failed to anticipate the negative results of his just-do-it approach,
                  he said. "He is a very practical man. That is his strength … and a
                  limitation, too."</p>
              <p>Second, he survived as long as he has only by intense paranoia, and,
                  for the past several decades, by isolation. He has lived for decades in
                  a series of underground bunkers ringed by elite bodyguards drawn from
                  his extended family, emerging only once a year to speak to the faithful
                  on what he calls Heroes' Day.</p>
              <p>Mr. Prabhakaran's fighters are infamous for the cyanide necklaces
                  they wear: several crystals of poison suspended in a tiny glass vial,
                  hung on a cord. Faced with unavoidable capture, the wearer is to bite
                  down on the vial; cuts from the glass on the tongue and mouth will send
                  the cyanide quickly into the bloodstream. Mr. Prabhakaran once said
                  that he wears two capsules, just to be sure.</p>
              <p>If it comes to that, will the Tigers outlive him?</p>
              <p>He has groomed no successor, nor allowed anyone to rise to a
                  position in the organization where they might earn that role, except
                  possibly, Ms. Pratap noted, his son Charles Anthony. "But it's easy to
                  inherit the title, but very hard to inherit the mandate," she added.</p>
              <p>If she is wrong, and he is not now outside Sri Lanka plotting his
                  next move but rather trapped on the beach, then the Tigers as an
                  organization — the cult of suicide bombing, the Eelam-or-nothing
                  ideology, the determination to militarize the Tami struggle — may die
                  with him. But not, she noted, their cause.</p>
              <p>"Prabhakaran did not rise from nothing. There is a historical
                  context in which he grew and rose to what he became. If the Sri Lankan
                  establishment settles the grievances of the Tamils in a fair and just
                  manner, then even the diehard Tamil resistance will wither away. But if
                  there is no genuine political settlement, then it's a matter of time
                  when the Tamil resistance will renew."</p>
              <p>His one-time neighbour who later became a Tiger propagandist feels
                  much the same. "My intuition says you'll never be able to catch him and
                  you'll never be able to kill him," he said. But if they do? "They'll
                  never be able to eradicate this movement from the minds of the Tamils."</p>
