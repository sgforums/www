Please, common sense tell you that anyone will be shocked at that. It is understandable.<br>Look at how he responded after he woke up from his blur stage to reform and shape WTC, formulate tough new anti-terrorists laws and at the same time bring countries together in a bid to fight terrorism should be the mark of a great leader.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
