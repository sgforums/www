            <div class='col-md body'>Currently in NUS , there is 1 foreign talent out of every 5 students, dun u find that number too high for comfort ? IF the government's policy is to introduce NUS as a central area of learning for top talents from all parts of the world, i can understand it. But currently, the so called foreign talents are mostly, 90% from china! If u do not believe what i say, pls take a bus down to NUS and walk ard, everywhere u go , u will sure hear and see them! They seldom mix with the locals , they stay close as together in their own world, so where is the exchange of learning ?? I want to know the rationale of the government to include so many of the chinese nationals in NUS.<br>Are they really loyal to singapore ? will they stay on in singapore and contribute to our society after graduating? Most of them, even in their 3rd years , haven't even blend into the local environment, they do not speak like a local , behave like 1 , but still remained in thier own world.<br><br>For our locals to enter NUS, our GP scores are considered. What abt those china nationals? most of them, when i speak english to them, dun really understand wat i am talking to them. Even my lab tutor, a obvious china national ( since he is a lab tutor, he mus hav been here for years) can't even convey his messages properly to us. In the local context , GP is highly regarded and difficult to score. Some of my friends was rejected entrance to NUS due to that. So why isn't those so call china nationals jugde on the same level as us? i bet my lab tutor will not even pass the O-level english exams. Why is there the different standard of admitting students? Some of my friends was rejected entry to NUS, had to pursue their studies overseas, while their places are taken by all this china nationals. My frd's parents had a part to play in buliding the nation, but wat abt the china nationals? Are they loyal to us ? They dun even need to perform NS. NS was termed by the government as a necessity to prove loyalty and love for singapore. So why the different standard of judgement once again? make them serve NS ! tts the minimum they can do to blend in with us and show their loyalty.<br><br>My parents should have sent me overseas when i was borned. Then i can come back to singapore to study and earn my citizenship without NS. a loophole in the system?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>So foreign talents refers to anyone who is not singaporean but living in Singapore?<br><br>What are they doing in SG? Are they just there to study and when they are finished, they go back? How is that foreign talent? It's only overseas students.<br>Australia is facing the same problem with all the Asian students taking their places. The answer is simply economics and export of education. It put it simply -&gt; $$$$$$.<br><br>I think the phrase foreign talents is used too loosely.<br>It should be classified into<br><br>Foreign labour workers<br>Overseas students in sg<br>Imported 'menile' work -&gt; like in factories etc.<br>Foreign talents -&gt; expatriates here for a few years to fill a void in the company.. like director of an American company based in Singas etc.<br><br>Hope that makes sense.</div>

No doubt their results are much better.. we have much thing to learn from them.apart from loyalty, they do have to serve at least three to five years in singapore after their study.. that they proved themselves in way that they can accept jobs as long as they can learn and progress. question is, is there a need to prove their loyalty.. anyway if they get their PR, their next generation would definitely got to go for national service. and that would be 18 to 20 years down the road. and so does that do reflect on their loyalty.. Guyz.. we have to see in long term progress not short term ya..

Cliques full of local Singaporeans. I apologise, it was rash and was a spur of the moment when i made that remark.  Dont assume all of my kind is "to ego" about our race, as a matter of fact, i am fully ashamed. Yes i don't understand that well what you are driving at, because its quite disembled initally... knn...cb... and broken somewhat. But otherwise you say its good to mix around. Well mixing is reciprocal, perhaps not everyone wants to mix. E.g. when you want to mix with some PRC people, they dont want to, similarly, when some PRC people want to mix with you, you dont want to etc, it all boils down to the moment, time, place and initial attractions we all have for one another. This is precisely why one race is needed.</div>

Cliques full of local Singaporeans. I apologise, it was rash and was a spur of the moment when i made that remark.  Dont assume all of my kind is "to ego" about our race, as a matter of fact, i am fully ashamed. Yes i don't understand that well what you are driving at, because its quite disembled initally... knn...cb... and broken somewhat. But otherwise you say its good to mix around. Well mixing is reciprocal, perhaps not everyone wants to mix. E.g. when you want to mix with some PRC people, they dont want to, similarly, when some PRC people want to mix with you, you dont want to etc, it all boils down to the moment, time, place and initial attractions we all have for one another. This is precisely why one race is needed.</div>

Apparently the common folk are an nonissue other then a backup plan and a means of keeping the top dogs in power.<br><br>It's easy to say that the Singaporean worker has priced himself out of the market, but can it be said that the agent behind him being priced out is "himself"? I doubt it.<br><br></div></blockquote>I share similar views, though not entirely the same.<br><br>Just a personal view - with no offence to anyone, I think the term 'talent' in fact too hype up a word to describe anyone who just comes in to Singapore with more than a work permit and a different passport from another country.<br><br>If the two criterias are sufficient to justify the word 'talent', then by the same standards, we would readily have three million local talents ready for economic activation in Singapore at any moment right now.<br><br>So if we or the top brass wish to continue with the above defination, then I guess the contributions that FTs can contribute for Singapore, will probably be those that of ordinary achievements - made along the current curve of performance.<br><br>Ideally what we hope from an ideal FT might be something different.<br><br>Perhaps in face of the still grim and uncertain future, we would prefer FTs to contribute more differently from how they may be currently contributing now.<br><br>That could possibly be a reverse from the current trend of competing jobs with the local, to one which will help new contracts and hence, new job opportunities for locals through such new contracts' domestic spin-off effect on the domestic home front.<br><br>Perhaps in the drive for regional expansion and the emerging call for entrepreneurship, the role of FTs can be better reshaped into one which will enable local firms or businesses, to expand on their respective operations with greater effectiveness and efficiency as compared to a local might preform in the FT's country of origin.<br><br>The employment of FTs and locals must be managed as a balanced equation.<br><br>Given the unstoppable trend of globalization, Singapore has already danced too far deep into the rhythm of its rapid pace to have rendered the option of sanctioning off the existence of all FTs in the domestic context to be a sane and feasible option.<br><br>And just as unavoidable, there will also come this day when the global village will result in governments all over the world to find certain FTs being more loyal to their country, just as these same governments will also find growing numbers of their own citizens - being the FTs in another foreign land, to habour deeper loyalty for their host country as well.<br><br>And until the day that we reach that day, the FT-Local Equation would then have to undergo reconstruction and study so as to ensure on its role of relevance to us - in the same way as itmust be done so now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the chinese in my school have no problem mixing around with the local people, even the malays and indians. they have integrated to our culture very well, and though they can't speak english, they have the decency to speak standard chinese so the rest of us can understand them. there are also those that enjoy learning singlish and hokkien phrases.<br><br>if anything, the cause would be the elitism at NUS where some people think hanging around with the chinese makes them cheena.<br><br>the chinese, the malaysians, and hker have all been offered PR status. there are those who wish to stay and work, and there are those who are more practical; they will go where the money is.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally I find the Chinese from china friendly... It is the Singaporean that shun them away in the first place  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  It gives me the impression that some Singaporean, especially the older folks, impression of china is either like film by Zhang Yi Mou where they lives in small rural villages, starving or like the novel Wu Ya where they go around postituting.<br><br>Frankly in the big cities of China now, they r rich, if not richer than what singapore is now. They are also more liberal than singaporean too.<br><br>Talking about their command of English, a lot of them may sounds bad at speaking English but they appears to be good at hearing and reading it. Otherwise how do they get good grades when the media that were taught here were in English ?</div>
