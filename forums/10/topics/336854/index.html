              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>TW is quite messy. Its democracy is also criticised. Yes, it is messy and maturing. But it can have media that allows both views (Alternative party and Ruling party)  to be heard. How many country can have this level of democracy and maturity?  Today, i feel that TW has progressed. It proves that even an ex-president can be locked up based on solid evidence found by its investigators.</p>
              <p>A system can be perfect and unquestionable on paper.</p>
              <p>Lesson learnt from Ah Bian : Absolute Power comes with Absolute Responsibilities. Integrity of a person  determines how 'perfect' any system can be.</p>
              <p>No matter how perfect a system is claimed to be, it can have flaws. Absolute power should come with Absolute Accountability. It is possible for Humans to bypass systems that appear solid on paper.</p>
              <p><strong>But who can ensure a person will hold himself accountable?</strong></p>
              <p>I hope the Apathetic people of the world think about this and not remain naive any longer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>*note: 'apathetic people' excludes all singaporean. the post excludes singapore.</p>

              <p>he is trying to to play the political game to gain sympathy and support from the Green Camp supporters. there are still many die hard supporters for the pro democracy Green camp in taiwan. remember there is a big demostration by the green camp to the visit from china officials.</p>

              <p><br>Right on!</p>
              <p>TW island, unlike some places, has a strong opposition presence and culture and history. Also, the accused is an Ex-Presidente.There is a lot of rights and privileges bestowed on an ex. Being a super sensitive issue, only when the investigators have absolute hardcore evidence and proof can they act. Also, the alleged crimes involved are many many and complex involving many top officials. Financial meltdown also could be a factor.  </p>
              <p>Its easy to whine why TW prosecutors react slow. The fact is, TW island people are very politicised. Its not like a dictatorship where the dictator can do what he please anytime and his accusations will go unchallenged. He can do whatever he feels like it.</p>
              <p>This espisode proved beyond any doubt that TW democracy has progressed some more. Even an ex-president, having so much privilege can still be locked up given hardcore evidence. Its easy to criticise anything, anyone. The fact remains, TW boleh! TW has locked up an ex-President. </p>
              <p>This example will also keep the incumbent President (from KMT) on his toes, knowing that its proven TW can lock up the highest ranking official of the land.</p>
              <p>HOW  MANY COUNTRY can do this?</p>
              <p>1. S.Korea.</p>
              <p>2. TH.</p>
              <p>3. PH.</p>
              <p>4. TW</p>
              <p>5.  ?? </p>
              <p>Not many. Thus, it shows how difficult it is to lock up an ex-president.</p>
              <p>Imagine if TW has NO ONE to QUESTION the highest ranked officer of the land.</p>
              <p>Imagine.</p>
              <p>Let it be clear, there is solid evidence for all the 10 being locked down now.  This means TW has progressed. Even TW political commentators say nothing like this has ever happened in its history. Its Main Stream Media airs both Alternative party as well as Ruling party views making it a respectable media, though not perfect. How many country can only imagine to have such a matured democracy? </p>
              <p>It also goes to show that the route to mature democracy and fair justice system is a long and complex and tedious one. TW is still not perfect but  it has progressed, with more room to grow. </p>
