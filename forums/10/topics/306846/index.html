              <p>Let me see.. Where do I start? I guess this being a Singapore website where the 'blog police' are likely to read anything that would be deemed facetious to the interest of Singapore and The current Singapore Government, possibly read this then tracing the IP then turning up at my doorstep to question every word I wrote, I guess I have to choose my words CAREFULLY..</p>
              <p>Let me first impress on any readers of this post that I am a patriotic son of Singapore. I served my National Service like any typical complain-ridden Singaporean-born man. I am a Malay. I am a Muslim. I do not support terrorism of any kind. I believe in equal rights and opportunities in Singapore. Although and right minded Singaporeans would find that ideal rather deluded. Yes, deluded.</p>
              <p>Now the sentiment of this entry is not to blindly shoot in the dark. Nor have me ranting like Dr. Chee Soon Juan. At least if I did say something, I would like to think that I would be able to at achieve a decent follow through. No disrespects to Dr. Chee, but I personally think that the man has more aptitude to shoot off a round on his on foot rather than make a real difference. Now, with that said about Dr. Chee let me get to my point..</p>
              <p>Please Sir. If you want to say something, at least don't patronise us middle-income citizens. Because the current situation is really choking us.</p>
              <p>Sure, we understand about rising costs and world economics climates, but you keep saying we are doing well. I want to know, as a concerned citizen where you get your facts from? Because I sure as hell am not doing well. In fact some of us are barely surviving from month to month.</p>
              <p>No sane person would have the right mind to directly accuse you of our hardship and financial short comings. But then again, not everyone of us earns a paycheck like yours do we Sir? Heck! Some of us are working 3 jobs just to stay broke. Some of us have to sacrifice too much. Afraid to even take a day off of work because our children would go hungry. I won't be surprised if you start having Singaporeans living out of boxes. In fact, haven't we featured enough Singaporeans building tents by  our public beaches?</p>
              <p>You ask of us singles to get married. The nation running public announcements ads pouring on and on about the joys of marriage. When you have even more separating because, well because they are looking for someone who earns more.</p>
              <p>We start missing the point.</p>
              <p>We have Singaporeans who are rude and basically so single-minded that all they care about is not a person character, but what kind of money the person bring home. Then again, we can't blame our citizens aptitude for indifference to other Singaporeans to you now could we Sir?</p>
              <p>I actually understood the reason why the ERP charges were raised. But Singaporeans want to still delude themselves into thinking they could afford these things. Turning to the government yet again because the don't have enough money left to put their children to a decent University. But of course a person like you wouldn't have to worry about that right Sir? Certainly the pay raise that our ministers supposedly deserve would help in paying for them to afford any school their children decide to go to. The rest of us just look on, green with envy..</p>
              <p>The rest of us are just stuck in this vicious cycle.</p>
              <p>So are Singaporeans doing well? I don't know Sir. You tell me. I guess I'll have to get back to you when I start living out of a box.</p>
              <p>Maybe I made a point here. Maybe I rambled on and on about nothing in particular. Do what you have to do Mr. Lee. But please stop patronising the rest of us who keep trying and trying to claw our way to the top of the food chain..</p>
              <p>I pray this entry didn't offend you.. Just another one of your obscure loyal citizens voicing out his concern..</p>

              <p><br>He is being extremely superficial, and being superficial is very beneficial to him.  I don't see his sincerity to want to get to know what problems the common people are facing especially the middle income group.   All he does is saying the same things over and over again, this makes his job so simple and yet be paid millions of money for his overpaid salary.</p>
              <p>Frankly, he is gone case.   All we can hope for is we have a capable, competent, wise, compassionate, kind PM who places serving the public as his top priority for the next PM.</p>

              <p>Bush only serves two terms, but it is possible for lhl to serve for many years.  If he is serving the public well we will not received so many and endless negative feedback about him.   So sad to have a PM like him, it is really a disgrace!</p>

              <p>Many Singaporeans are doing well.</p>
              <p>But because many are getting more affluent, they raise GST, minister pay, bus fares, and ERP rates. Result: This brings those who got more affluent, those who got more successful, back to square 1. Just a trap, a vicious cycle that continues over and over again.</p>
              <p>Yet, what happens to those who could not get out of the poverty trap? They are worse off than ever. The rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer... And when the rich gets richers, so do the pay checks of the government; their pay check is pegged to the top 8 earners.</p>
              <p>Just wondering... why are the steps that the government take (if there are any) to reduce the burden of the needy not well publicised or transparent enough? Are they purely relying on donations from us, or other charity organisations who do not take any funds from the government coffers?</p>
              <p>Even for the old, why is there a need for compulsory annuity? How many old folks will live past the age of 85, and for how many years, such that our economy could not afford to support those who need help? Is it because the money of the young are being expected to get sucked up so much that they cannot afford to support their parents in the future?</p>
              <p>The number of cars on the road is controlled by LTA via COE. Thus, is it our fault when "there are too many cars on the road"? If not, why are ERP rates continuously increasing? To reduce the number of cars being used on the road because of a miscalculation by LTA?</p>
              <p>I wonder what can be expected next... A tax for breathing the fresh air in Singapore? Singapore is not only a "fine" country; it will soon become a "taxing" country, both on your brain and your wallet.</p>

              <p>Awesome post by TS.... even more impressive are the responses. Aside from a few snide remarks by disgruntled Sgs venting abit of steam.... a very good read <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You write well TS and I would assume you are educated... hard to imagine SG does not have the "space" to accomodate you comfortably.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SG has low unemployment but i have a feeling alot are "drones" as you speak of. Employed with enough income for a 99 year lease and the ability to produce more drones for the next generation.... little else.... after 99 years they go back to zero.... their kids start off with close to nothing and end up a drone again <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> .... free country ... if not for capitalism (as eagle pointed out rich get richer... poor lol o well).</p>

              <p>It's not that people like to suan the government or complain, but their track record in recent years have been getting from bad to worse.</p>
              <p>Years back, they were saying they will tackle the widening income gap.  And they have been saying it every year for the past few years.</p>
              <p>What do we have now? An even wider income gap (yes, even the Straits Times dare report this fact) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>So why should they be increasing their million dollar salaries when they cannot solve the day to day problems of majority of Singaporeans?</p>
              <p>From the transport system to the healthcare system to CPF to housing, more and more problems seem to be cropping up.</p>
              <p>And their solution is to increase prices.  Yes, from healthcare to transport to ERP to GST.  Want to retire? No way, you got to keep more and more funds in your CPF and cannot withdraw them till you are 80 or 90 or 100 (Yes, 100 could be a possibility at the rate things are going) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>If they could solve some of the problems or at least alleviate some of the pain that the majority of Singaporeans are experiencing right now, nobody would complain about their increasing salaries.</p>
              <p>But the problems keep resurfacing and in some cases become worse.  So can you blame the rising discontent from the general population? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
