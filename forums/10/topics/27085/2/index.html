You are right that Singapore is small, therefore we lack strategic depth, that is why the "strategy" has always been "attack to defend", and thus, the SAF is perfectly capable of launching an attack into enemy territory and bring the fight to THEIR land. This fact has been published to the public. If you think that we will stubbornly hold our borders and "defend", you are wrong.</div>
