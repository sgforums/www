            <div class='col-md body'>Saw this stupit articale, share with u all.<br><br>Malaysia harus waspada<br><br>Nations on the brink of war: Singapore &amp; Malaysia.<br><br>There is much resentment between the two nations, Singapore and Malaysia. The former is dominated by Chinese while the other, by Malay. Though both nations were at one time, a single country, racial tensions and riots had divided the entity into two countries. Singapore with its 1.8million population ceded from Malaysia (6 million population then) on August 15 , 1965. Both countries had gone their own separate ways but simmering tension and hate continued to grow with the passing of time. There is a need to recognize that Malays are totally different from Chinese is every respect, be it culture or religion. There is no way that both races can coexist peacefully, except when one race is willing to be subservient to the other.<br><br>In Singapore we have the Malays totally subservient to the Majority Chinese. There is thus no problem The case in Malaysia is different.The Chinese unlike the Malays in Singapore, do have a say in most issues of Government. The Chinese constitutes about 36% of the populatioin. They wield considerable political power, a fact that had not gone unnoticed by Singapore. From time to time, at the instigation of Singapore, the Chinese in Malaysia does raise issues that are extremely sensitive to the majority Malays. On the other hand, Singapore experiences no such probelms. Th Singapore Malays are politically dead. The PAP Government had ensured this, by not allowing its Malays to be the majority race in any constituency. Democratically speaking, the Malays has no representative at all in the Singapore Parliament. The few Malays that are seen in the Singapore Parliament are truthfully speaking, beholden Malays.<br><br>Malaysia could easily maginalized the Chinese, the way Singapore did. That it did not, is a victory for democracy.Malaysia has thus very good reasons to be very weary of this neighbour to the South.<br><br>The year 2000, has brought many sensitive issues to boiling points. It is the year of The Great Divide. The Custom and Immigration Checkpoints at Woodlands, the Malaysian Railways lands, the CLOB shares and the Water Rights are some of the issues that are causing much aggravations on both sides. Singapore has begun to take precautions. It has accelerated the Total Defence Concept on all fronts. Singapore plans to increase its population size to 5.5milllion by 2010. It had purchased submarines, frigates, sophisticated warplanes and state of the art weapons to beef ups its attack capabilities. Malaysia with its current population of 14 million, on the other hand, is taking many things for granted. Although some Malaysians of standing had voiced concern at the rate of Military buildups in Singapore, those in Authority appear to be both blind and deaf to the warnings voiced. The lessons of World War ll and the Korean War had been forgotten. This section of harimau.org website, propose to publish issues and updates in the hope that the Malaysian Government would wake up and take the necessary steps to counter all moves made by Singapore.

Based on the law that "whatever can go wrong, will go wrong", I will not dispute that, but the claims on both Governments are outrageous. I am a Singaporean, but I respect my Malaysian neighbours just as much, and so I find that article to be utterly baseless and if the typical Malaysian reads it, I think he or she would be just as amazed at how twisted it is.</div>

This is a forum afterall, and you can't tell someone to stop a discussion, because it'll never work.  We are simply discussing on the point that is being brought up. As in this case, the article is rubbish, that is the general consensus, as for those comments which went a little over the topic borders, the persons that posted them will have to reflect on those comments themselves.</div>

The keyword here is "article", I am not defending those who went over the topic borders and started talking about "real-world" scenarios, I am just maintaining that the forum is a place for people to express their views over points that are brought up by someone else. The seasoned posters, I believe, have enough self-control and general knowledge to judge for themselves what can be posted here.</div>
