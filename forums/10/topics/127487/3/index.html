            <div class='col-md body'>My first impressions of this 'scholar' are:<br><br>1) Nerdy, dorky, fat and ugly. Okay we have had fat leaders in the past. Bill Gates also looked like a nerd when he was in his 20s but at least you had a gut feeling that these pple could be leaders. Churchill was fat but he definately had chrisma.<br><br>But this guy gives an impression that he has none of that, none of the signs that he can be a good leader. He's probably a PAP loyalist and a racist one at that.<br><br>In the real world outside of S'pore, he won't survive. Case closed.<br><br>2) His privileage background has made him ignorant, arrogant and basically made him into an a$$hole. He thinks he's so smart just because he studied in RI and top class JC n therefore he has the right to trample over minority races as and when he likes it.<br><br>It's a sad and desperate case, this smart aleck is.<br><br>3) I will not pay taxes for this sort of scholar and later, this sort of civil servant. He doesn't inspire much confidence, in my opinion and never will he be able to do so.<br><br>It's just a gut feeling of course but I'm pretty sure about that. In any case, if that's the way PSC scholars think about minority races and other related matters, then I fear for the future of S'pore.<br><br>Take my word, these sort of guys &amp; gals will wreck S'pore's future. I'm sure of it.</div>
