            <div class='col-md body'>PSC scholar, Chua Cheng Zhan, studying in Northwestern University make at least two disparaging remarks about other races on his personal online journal. He used words like `repulsive' to describe some races and talked about their `irksome features' In defence, he said that he was not himself when he wrote these things. I did not use his own persona when he wrote on his blog.<br><br>What do you guys think? As a returning PSC overseas scholar, he will work as a civil servant - making policies that affect every Singaporean's life. Would you want a racist scholar to make decisions that affect you and your family?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That even a scholar spouts racist nonsense is probably an indication of an intolerant undercurrent in our society.<br><br>I myself have encountered these people at many turns, including my friends, some of whom are CCPs (Chinese Chauvanist Pigs). I keep quiet, and let them vent whatever unjustified anger, before shaking my head, and change the topic.<br><br>Trying to improve their perception seems to make things worse. They seek out every excuse and reason to vindicate their views. In my opinion, there are always 101 reasons why something is right, or something is wrong, and in the end, their nit-picking behaviour stems from their dislike for other races.<br><br>Surely this does not bode well for our society. The racial riots of 1960s still float to my mind whenever they engage in their racist pelting. Have we already started to forget the pain and agony that our parents went through during that time?</div>
