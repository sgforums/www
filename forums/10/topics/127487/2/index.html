If such seeds of discord are not removed immediately after their implantation, they will soon grow into something monstrous.<br><br>What's more, this is a person on government sponsorship, which makes it all the more paramount that he be of nothing less than exemplary attitude and conduct.<br><br>At least he has the decency to admit his wrong in this matter, and I really hope that he will sincerely accept other races as much as he is his own race.
