              <p><strong>Independent.ie, 18 Sep 2009</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Temasek ready to invest as rally reverses losses</strong></span><br> <br> Temasek, the parent of Singapore Technologies Telemedia (STT) which is
              poised to take over Eircom, recovered from most of its portfolio losses
              this year as markets rallied, giving it firepower for new deals.<br> <br> <img src="http://nimg.sulekha.com/Others/original700/ho-ching-2009-7-29-3-10-3.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> Chief executive Ho Ching said any dip in markets could be a buying
              opportunity for the $122bn (€83bn) investment firm that is still open
              to buying financials and investing in emerging markets.<br> <br> Temasek, which has telecoms investments across the globe, lost over an
              estimated $4bn on selling its stakes in Bank of America and Barclays,
              but said it had <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>benefited from investing in rights issues for its portfolio firms </strong></span>such as Standard Chartered, since these investments more than doubled by the end of July.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>"We are in a very good cash position,"</strong></span> Ms Ho said at Temasek's annual review yesterday. "We think there are
              lots of opportunities in (China and India) over the long term."<br> <br> The review showed Temasek's portfolio slumped S$55bn or around 30pc to
              S$130bn in the year to end-March. Its portfolio then rose 32pc to
              S$172bn by end-July, and its August performance was in line with market
              indexes, Ms Ho said.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The firm's value-at-risk was S$28bn at the end of
              March, meaning it had a 16pc probability it would lose that amount or
              more this financial year, down from a value-at-risk of S$40bn a year
              earlier</strong></span>, the review said.<br> <br> "We believe the worst of the global meltdown risks are behind us," said
              Ms Ho. "While there are some green shoots of growth, some structural
              risks still remain for the medium term," she said.<br> <br> Temasek is Singapore's second biggest sovereign wealth fund after the Government of Singapore Investment Corp.<br> <br> <strong>Differences</strong><br> <br> Ms Ho, the wife of Singapore's prime minister, said Temasek's board
              would still search for her successor after chief executive-designate
              and former BHP Billiton chief Chip Goodyear unexpectedly resigned in
              July over strategic differences.<br> <br> The investment company, whose sole shareholder is Singapore's Ministry
              of Finance, said net profit for the financial year fell two-thirds to
              S$6.2bn, as it was hit by losses on financial stocks and lower
              contributions from earnings by its portfolio firms, like DBS Group.<br> <br> "Like investors everywhere they're just relieved that the market pulled
              back from the brink," said David Cohen of Action Economics in Singapore.<br> <br> Eircom is preparing for its fifth change of ownership since its flotation to STT.<br> <br> Eircom's parent company, Australian fund Eircom Holdings (ERC), has
              recommended shareholders accept the AU$225m (€133m) cash and shares
              offer made by STT.<br> <br> The deal involves the transfer of the entire share issue of ERC to the
              new entity called Emerald Communications (Cayman) SPC (ECC) and values
              the firm at just over €132.5m.<br> <br> ----------------------------<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Latest updates @ Singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com<br> <br> 1.

              <p>no, you need to do your homework and your knowledge must be spot on. if you are expert in your field, you are able to predict future trends and events happening, which is what Jim Rogers did. He is bullish on china, gold, commodities and is bearish on US and the US dollars.</p>

              <p>if he is wrong, he loses his money, fortune and reputation, as he said it himself. you need focus, not diversification as many academic advocated, and if you are wrong, you lose your fortune, as simple as it. I dun think you even understand that.</p>
