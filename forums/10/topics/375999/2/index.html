              <p>well he still has a house in US and his relatives and friends are still in US. if you listened to his talks, Asia is the place to be in this century and the coming collapse of the US, UK and Western Europe. He moved to Spore because China and HK pollution are atrocious and he is bullish on China, the next superpower replacing the US in the coming decades if not years. China is on its way to replacing Japan as the second economic power very soon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway he shifted his family to Spore because he wants his children to learn mandarin, as when his 2 daughters are grown up to advantage his children, if they are going to do business or invest in China. What he said made sense in CNBC and Bloomberg made a lot of sense. Back in his interviews given in 2007, he was back then short on shares and US dollars and bullish on commodities and gold, which was proven right in 2009 before the implosion of this financial crisis originated from wall street. He also railed against the Fed and Treasurer, saying they made mistakes after mistakes, such as printing money is not going to solve the crisis. look at the Japan lost decade and its zombie banks in the 90s.</p>

              <p>these academics also can be called talents wow, no wonder Temasek go head in to invest in citigroup and merrill lynch in 2007. if they read about Roubini warning if the bubble of the housing market before it happened, or Jim Rogers warning of the collapse of the US dollars and inflation. do they even have experiences working in the industry. even if they are, are they even experts in their own field. There are many so called experts in wall street, but few of their judgement are ever correct.</p>

              <p>Does Leong Ching and her advisors even know what they are doing then and now. why on earth they didnt invest in good companies, like Warren Buffet Berkshire Hathaway and Google for instance, instead of investing billions in paper companies like citigroup, merrill and UBS. investing in one of them is considered a huge risks, but 3 of these banks were invested back in 2007.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In late 2002 when this book was published, in addition
                  to the massive thirteen year depression beginning towards the end of
                  the decade, it forecast that:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>
              <p style="margin-left: -20px;">The economy, as reflected by the DJIA, would resume its upwards march in late 2002 or 2003.
                          <strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is exactly what happened.</span></strong></p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p style="margin-left: -20px;">The
                  DJIA would have a snapback to 13,000 to 14,000 and the FTSE to 6,000 to
                  7,000 by 2004, but delayed possibly by
                  wars/politics/terrorism/scandals. <strong> This is exactly what has happened.</strong> Although the full
                  snapback has been delayed for the reasons described, the DJIA in 2007
                  reached over 14,100 and the FTSE over 6,700.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p style="margin-left: -20px;">The
                  inflation adjusted DJIA returns from 2003 to 2012 would average 7% to
                  8%. So far, with the delayed full snap-back, inflation adjusted DJIA
                  returns have averaged a more modest 5.8%, as would be expected.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p style="margin-left: -20px;">Interest rates would increase from 2003 onwards.
                          <strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is exactly what happened.</span></strong></p>
              </li>

              <p>the economy and the companies they invested in are slowly and gradually coming back to health compared to september last year when Lehman Brothers collapsed, but are still some way to go before the 2007 highs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I remembered Citigroup shares dropped to penny stock, ie below US $1 dollar last year, but now has risen considerably (dunno what share citi is trading now).</p>

              <p>Guy predicted economic crisis in 2002!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>http://www.amazon.com/Great-Bust-Ahead-Depression-Understanding/dp/159196153X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1252986104&amp;sr=1-1</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In late 2002 when this book was published, in addition to the massive thirteen year depression beginning towards the end of the decade, it forecast that:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>
              <p>The economy, as reflected by the DJIA, would resume its upwards march in late 2002 or 2003. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is exactly what happened.</span></strong></p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>The DJIA would have a snapback to 13,000 to 14,000 and the FTSE to 6,000 to 7,000 by 2004, but delayed possibly by wars/politics/terrorism/scandals. <strong>This is exactly what has happened.</strong> Although the full snapback has been delayed for the reasons described, the DJIA in 2007 reached over 14,100 and the FTSE over 6,700.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>The inflation adjusted DJIA returns from 2003 to 2012 would average 7% to 8%. So far, with the delayed full snap-back, inflation adjusted DJIA returns have averaged a more modest 5.8%, as would be expected.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>Interest rates would increase from 2003 onwards. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is exactly what happened.</span></strong></p>
              </li>
              <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br></span></strong></li>

              <p>guru of gurus, king of kings!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also predict there will be economic crisis in 2030-2035 period.</p>

              <p>she should joined academia or stick to electrical engineering, where she is expert in her field. what was her work experiences in and which uni she studied?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you should never appoint a beauracraut to a top position in investment or SWF, where the job overwhelm the incumbent. this job is way out of her league. does she even know what she is doing in the first place? there is only so much you can learn on the job and read.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>those advisors, do they also know what they are doing as well? its one thing to have good academic credentials, but do they have the midas touch in investing or know what to invest in?</p>

              <p>she should stayed at her old job. Temasek's CEO is out of her depth really. The CEO job should be someone in the banking, financial or investment industry for decades as a top management, like CEO, CFO or COO and not some engineer at MINDEF.</p>
