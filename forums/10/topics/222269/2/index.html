I think that's a practical approach.''<br><br>Pointing to France, he noted that the word Â“race'' is not seen anywhere and the official government line is that everybody's French.<br><br>Â“You can't say you're a Frenchman from Algeria, Frenchman from Morocco. You're a Frenchman,'' said Lee.<br><br>Yet, the reality is far from the ideal.<br><br>Frenchmen of different races and religions live in different areas, with the people of African and Arab origins congregating in the ghettos of Paris.<br><br>The people who live in the down-and-out places say this is make-believe. We are not all the same. You pretend that we're all the same<br><br>France was rocked by three weeks of riots when youths of African and Arab descent torched cars, looted and clashed with the police across the country.<br><br>To aggravate matters, Lee said, the French do not have statistics and data to help them identify the problems because it is illegal to collect statistics by race.<br><br>He also recounted MM Lee's experience when he was a student in Britain looking for a place to stay.<br><br>He would call up and say he was Â“ Mr Lee''. As some Englishman also share the same surname, the landlords would think he was white.<br><br>'When he shows up, they tell him, sorry, no flat, no vacancies, because actually they saw him: He's a Chinese.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><span style="color: darkred;">The origin of the quota system for HDB Estates has to do more with the fear of the Ruling Party with one particular minority ethnic community being concentrated in any constituency that is beyond their political influence, and has supported those from within their own community in past election of the late 1970s and upto early 1980s.<br><br>With the Ruling Party gerrymeandering with political boundaries at each election, what is there to stop them from diluting and disintegrating concentrations of one minority ethnic community, and preventing them from ever becoming a political force to lobby or challenge the authority of the Ruling Party ?<br><br>It is more correct to view the HDB quota system as being purposefully designed to defuse the racial element from local politics.<br><br>Can race ever be removed from politics ?<br><br>The Ruling Party has always had feelings of discomfort with one particular minority Singaporean ethnic group, and has always held extremely patronising and condescending opinions towards this community; which are quite loudly shown at every National Day Rally.<br><br>Since Singapore's short and nightmarish experience with Malaysia and its  politicians at Federal and State levels, politics in Singapore remains colored by those historical dealings.<br><br>Although small steps have been taken to remove barriers in the Civil Service, Police Force and the SAF, members of this minority ethnic group remains out of any gravity pulls for sensitive government and political positions.<br><br>Can racial harmony exist when government and political policies remain tainted ?<br><br></span><br><br></div>
