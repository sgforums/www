This is classical behaviour. It's not hard to miss.<br><br>Punitive measures to compel people to perform an act, is just a lazy excuse for failure to create an atmosphere that allows people to internalise their want to reach out and integrate. Atmosphere is influenced by pre-existing policy.<br><br>This is where we must tread carefully. Being the government does not mean you wield the heavy hand. The authority must be subordinate to the will of the people, ultimately.<br><br>Like I've said, if it's voluntary and good examples come out of this program, I'm all in support for it. In fact, I'm very supportive of community based projects which are citizen startups, this is because they would know the nuances and population/social dynamics of their own local precinct much better than a central planner.<br><br>However, your suggestion of forced participation is extremist and is quite unwarranted.<br><br>W.R.T to your last point, it's always been the case thus far, not just in the recent elections. Although, I must say that the current immigration policy might have some impact on their voting in the next elections, if not managed well.</div>

As for the greying population, the government is asking for foreign talents to become Singaporeans. The old "Stop at 2" policy is not reversed and has worsen the growth of Singapore on the whole. Sooner or later, it's going to become the "Hotel Singapore" scenario. Racial harmony is just a plain stopgap before anarchy breaks loose.</div>

Got invited to hari raya celebration, Deepavali celebrations or even weddings. I stayed over at their places as well . Some of them lifelong friends now. They pick up chinese from me and I pick up their slangs in their language when we were young. And all without a campaign like this. We all know the importance of social integration since history teaches us about the days of riots.<br><br>I noticed that some people have the tendency to make fun of other races regardless. This is because of their upbringing - parents passing on racist values to them instead of common courtesy to respect others different.  If any kid makes a racist remark , maybe it is time to look at the parents as well .<br><br>And look at your so-called foreign talents that the government invited in  as well i.e. PRCs, indians from india.  In Australia, I met alot of them - they just don't integrate well with the general population in terms of culture acceptance . Tell them that they did something wrong with a good reason why and you get labelled by their group a racist or something else. This is my example from Australia. They NEED integration themselves because they will be the cause of tensions if they fail to integrate. Whites- we no need to say lah - some locals still have colonial mindsets that white is always right .....even up in the echelons of power - they integrate on their terms.<br><br>I see no use in doing stupid campaigns like that . It sounds like more of a novelty item and has a tendency to put people on the guard if enforced - hence increasing tension.<br><br>The last time I heard someone say as  " long as it works , do it"  ..... stagnation was his downfall. We need someone to say " let's look at another angle on how to further improve harmony " .</div>
