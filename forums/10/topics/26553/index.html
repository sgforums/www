            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, I'm not a regular. I'm only a reservist but I believe I can advise you on certain stuff. Please note that I'm might not be 100% correct, guys, please correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>Although You dropout from poly, I believe you'll still receive your NS med checkup same as your poly friends. Meaning You will still serve NS at the same timeframe as your poly friends. I think it's the way they group us. It seems that if we made it to poly we'll be deferred for 3 years, even if we dropout from poly.<br><br>Secondly, Your chances of going to BMTC is much higher than going mono-intake cos your's is a special case. It is a usual thing that O' levels holder are mono-intaked to be troopers while Poly and above are going to BMTC to be leader of some sort (unless your performance fail you to be a leader). Although you dropout from poly, the military still consider you as a "poly student" and post you to BMTC. I think it's due to the timeframe thingy again.<br><br>The main problem is, even you try very hard and be as "siao on" as even or as "ar ga liao" as much wif your buddies and instructors, you'll still find you path in SISPEC. OCS is almost beyond reach. (That's the trend I see during my NS, I've got quite a few NS buddies like your case)<br><br>Your ECA will help you in your posting, but in BMT the most important thing is you peer appraisal, you dicipline and your fitness. Your must get at least a silver in IPPT to qualify OCS or SISPEC.....work hard. You must be capable of getting along well with friends and fellow buddies so you can get a good peer appraisal by your buddies. (I think that common sense :p)<br><br>But SAF is like any organization in Singapore......If you got the Cert, you can climb up high. Degree holders are almost guaranteed a place in OCS, if not SISPEC. Most Poly and A' Levels are "condemn" to SISPEC while the best are choosen to OCS. O levels are unless troopers while the best are choosen to go SISPEC. Your case is somewhat between Poly/A'level and O'level.<br><br>Going to police depends alot on your background. I dunno how Mindef checks but if you come in contact wif many ppl that might jeopadize national security, you might not be posted to the army.<br><br>During to old times, guys if "specs" are called "Specky". Now 7 out of 10 soldiers are "speckies!" .....So whether you are speced or not doesn't matter liao.<br><br>As regards to Signing On. My advise is....if you're in for the money DON'T SIGN ON!!! I'm sure you heard stories about it right? So don't waste your life to do something you might not like. You feel miserable, especially in your 6 years bond for stuff you hate.<br><br>If you are interested in the military, I suggest you can decide to sign on after you actually been through it. I heard now they got some "post-BMT recuitment" thingy so You can always decided after you go through BMT and see if you like it. Just are reminder, you are joining SAF, not the US army.<br><br>SAF is a civilian army were most ppl are obliged to join for 2.5 years, so you're bound to see and "experience" ppl to will do anything to make their OWN LIFE EASIER, even if it means "saboing" other. So you can imagine the morale of SAF, it's high no doubt, but definately not as high as those US troops you saw in Black Hawk Down, the others.<br><br>As on where you'll be posted to after BMT...I think it too early to tell.<br><br>As on whether a regular spec is good? I would say a spec is like a supervisor as an officer is like a Manager...........i believe you can figure it adv and disadv.<br><br>I always think being a officer is tough, you have to be analyactical, have a good foresight and able to make decision under the toughest conditions. Becos many lack these, I've seen many Officers/Specs who are incompetent in intense pressure conditions.......sigh...!!<br><br>Anyway..good luck</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Same here, just another reservist...but I do know someone close who is a poly dropout. Basically, I advice you to drop down to CMPB in person, and find out more. You can ask for early enlistment.<br><br>Officer...I am sorry to say this, but you can forget it. Cause the requirements is that you need poly or A level cert. Without it, you can't even go for the "Sit Test"...which is a critical requirement too.<br><br>There is another path, that is from sispec go to OCS....but the percentage is very small, and you need to be the cream of the crop.<br><br>As to the posting....no point worrying so much about it. Cause it's a big big mystery that blaffed tons of NSF/NSMan until now...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br>Also, you have no choice or say in the matter...so why kill brain cells?<br><br>As Silenthunter had said....a full time career in SAF is not for everyone. Go through you BMT, and then decide...it's not too late then.<br><br>Wearing specs...very common in SAF nowdays...but unless you are the type where you take down specs, blind as a bat...over 1000+ degrees....it's not a factor.<br><br>Being in scouts may help you a bit in learning the footdrill easier..and such...but trust me...SAF operates way much different from those ECA....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Do start planning for your future after SAF....even if you plan to sign on....the contract will run out...or you need to retire someday. I strongly advice you to pursue your education again....in Singapore, without certification...is hard to survive. Unless you got a super rich  daddy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I know it's hard....but keep your hopes alive. Failing to obtain a poly certification does not mean you are a failure in life. Far from it. My close friend (poly dropout)....after his SAF, went back to poly again, study 3 yrs...go work few yrs..save up...go overseas study...and now is a degree holder.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>So start planning further down the road....5 years...10 years...what do you want to do? Do you want to forever remain an O level? And you can ask those who gone through SAF....Mindef do look at your paper qualification when deciding to promote you or not...else you can only raise to a certain point... it sucks...but that's life.<br><br>Drop by CMPB in person soon to clarify your doubts. And if given information, do take note the name and rank of the person. Cause some NSF simply anyhow "bomb".<br><br>Do train up a bit...and best of luck in your future. Don't give up! You got a long life ahead !!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Not to scare you la, but my fren in the same situation waited for a year before finally being enlisted. Because when u quit school, you sort of get lost in their system and CMPB doesn't remember you exist. He called them like every month to ask for enlistment, yet still haf to wait so long! His fren even worst, waited 4 yrs  haha<br><br>Anyway, regarding yr first question. Although 80% u'll be posted to police or CD, there's still a chance of going tekong (like the guy who waited 4 years).  Depends on luck really... Even if u suay suay go police, still can appeal la.<br><br>As for the 2nd question, think they answered it liao. Since u oni haf O levels, then u juz haf to work very very very very very hard to get into OCS. Maybe like 1% chance??<br><br>Dun set yr hopes too high, give yrself other options.</div>
