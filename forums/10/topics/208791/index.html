            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, it makes a mockery of the entire system of law and order. People will begin to not take the system seriously if laws are not applied to the full extend. Even if there are grounds for redress or leniancy, that should be done through procedure.<br><br>In this case, the Malaysians are just reducing fines to plascate the public for raising fuel prices. It is true that this will reduce the burden of drivers. However, the purpose of these fines are to punish drivers who have contrivened traffic rules. As such, the law stipulates that a transgression be met with a penalty to serve not only as a deterent, but also a conscience reminder to the offender of his transgressions. If the punishment is reduced in such a case, the public will just not respect the existence of a system and goes on to undermines it's practical applications.<br><br>Yes, it is a good thing for the government to take the well being of it's citizens at heart by reducing the fiscal purden they have to carry. However, they have to do it through means which does not undermine systematical processes as in this case. What the Malaysian government could do is to pherhaps put up rebates on road taxes or subsidies on toll levies. These reprieves not only bring about the intended goal of reducing the burden of the everyday man, it does not in anyway undermine any of the existing systes. This is something our government does, which some will argue is not enough.<br></div>
