              <p>Saturday, 03 May 2008</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Singapore Democrats<br><br>A group of
              Singaporean activists marked World Press Freedom Day by staging a
              protest outside the Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) building at Toa
              Payoh today.<br><br>The SPH controls all the local newspapers except <em>Today</em> which is published by MediaCorp. The organisation is run by former deputy prime minister Dr Tony Tan.</p>

              <p>Activists unfurl a protest banner outside the SPH building</p>
              </div>
              <p><br>The
              activists comprising of Mr Chong Kai Xiong, Mr Ho Choon Hiong, Mr
              Isrizal, Ms Noora Zul, Mr Seelan Palay and Mr Shafiie released the
              following statement:<br><br>Today is World Press Freedom Day, an
              opportunity to reflect upon the principles of press freedom. Press
              freedom must be championed and protected as it comprises the
              fundamental Freedom of Expression (Article 19, Universal Declaration of
              Human Rights). UNESCO's 2008 themes for this day are Access to
              Information and Empowerment.<br><br>In resonance with this, we as
              independent activists marked World Press Freedom Day 2008 this morning,
              with a series of messages to share our thoughts on the state of press
              freedom in Singapore.<br><br><strong>Censored news is no news</strong><br><br>It's
              no big secret that Singapore, though proudly claiming to be a
              'First-World' country, is ranked 141 out of 167 in 2007's World Press
              Freedom Index (Reporters Without Borders). 142 is Afghanistan. For the
              same year, Singapore is ranked 157 out of 195 countries in the Freedom
              of the Press World Ranking (Freedom House). 158 is Iraq.<br><br>Freedom
              House clearly establishes Singapore's status as "Not free". Not free.
              Shackled. Clipped. Censored? A common criterion to these indices is an
              evaluation of the level of censorship. Though news in Singapore may not
              be overtly censored, the problem is self-censorship. <br><br><strong>Free press, free minds</strong><br><br>A
              freer press empowers people as it gives them pluralism in sources of
              information as well as access to diverse points of view. All of us have
              the right to form and express our opinions and respect should be
              accorded to this right through freedom to access information. <br><br><strong>Newspapers and Printing Presses Act = Repression</strong><br><br>The
              Newspapers and Printing Presses Act was introduced in 1975. In effect,
              the Act enables the State to impose such restrictions as:<br><br>•
              Permits (to be renewed every year) granted on a discretionary basis for
              locally published newspapers. In addition, these permits may be granted
              with conditions such as the State's specification on the language in
              which the newspaper may be published.<br><br>• Permits required for the
              sale and distribution of foreign newspapers. In addition, individuals
              will need to comply with this permissibility for any papers brought in
              which may be for personal consumption. Complementary provision for
              powers of examination of packages and articles is included. <br><br>Other incidents of repressive media management include lawsuits against foreign newspapers such as the <em>Asian Wall Street Journal </em>and the <em>Far Eastern Economic Review</em> (FEER), a publication currently banned in Singapore. Yet let us not
              forget one of the most glaring examples: persecution of journalists.
              Most notable was the 17-year detention under the Internal Security Act
              of Said Zahari, editor of then-locally published <em>Utusan Melayu</em>. <br><br><strong>No to media monopoly</strong><br><br>Today,
              the press in Singapore is monopolised by the Singapore Press Holdings.
              It publishes all but one of the dailies (the exception is <em>Today</em> published by Mediacorp) – a far cry from a lively press and publishing
              history in Singapore (pre-1975). There were several papers published in
              Malay, Indian and Chinese languages as compared to just these main
              non-English newspapers: <em>Berita Harian</em>, <em>Tamil Murasu</em>, <em>Lianhe Zaobao</em> (&amp; <em>Wanbao</em>) and <em>Shin Min Daily</em> respectively.<br><br><strong>Get alternatives, get online</strong><br><br>Though
              press freedom in the professional arena should be safeguarded,
              individuals can overcome a restrictive and biased press through citizen
              journalism. Through the new medium of the Internet, citizen journalism,
              which increases participation in the exchange of news and information,
              is on the rise. Alternative sources are available on the internet on
              web portals and blogs that allow individuals to express themselves and
              engage with others in open discussion.<br><br>Open discussions and
              dialogue on all human issues are vital for us to engage with each other
              in an environment of respect and dignity. The role of a free and
              pluralistic press as such a forum enshrines the fundamental freedom of
              expression for everyone. <br><br>To continue this dialogue on press freedom and efforts to promote it in Singapore, email Noora at
