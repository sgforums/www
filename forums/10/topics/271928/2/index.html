            <div class='col-md body'>That why that is a lot less Singaporeans than last year during NDP yesterday. The bus I board was crowded with Indian and china foreigners, from the languages they speak, and every bus stop , the bus drive pass, it is full of foreigners. Singaporean are mainly old people. One of the Indian board the bus had not bath, he smell. They are here to stay.<br><br>From what I see, more construction workers is recruited than talents. A double decker bus can filled the foreigner from yesterday situation. The bus is packed already, so a lot foreigners can't get in.<br><br>Taking buses will be always be full during peak hour. People are going to wait a much longer time to board the buses when the population increases.</div>

A typical Chinaman will get around RMB 1,000 to RMB 2,000 in China, depending on the industry he works in. In Singapore, if he gets SGD 1,000, it will translate to RMB 5,000.
