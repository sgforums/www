              <p>Nine out of ten jobs created under Labour went to foreign-born workers, astonishing figures revealed.</p>
              <p>Official statistics showed the vast majority of the rise in the
              employment total under Labour was accounted for by foreign workers.</p>
              <p>Just as startlingly, the figures also revealed that the proportion of
              the foreign-born workforce nearly doubled under Labour – from 7 per
              cent to 13 per cent.</p>
              <p>It means 88 per cent of the rise in employment was accounted for by
              workers born abroad, and just 12 per cent by those born in the UK.</p>
              <p>Former PM Gordon Brown said migration would fall by 12 per cent. But foreign workers increased 20 per cent and
              foreign students by over 30 per cent.</p>

              <p><br>My dear Foolrer,</p>
              <p>In actual fact, all developed countries takes in skilled and talented foreigners to help their economy, this have been going on for years, in fact, singapore have been doing it since industrialisation, we got lot of foreigner expatriates from Brit, Jap, US, Canada, france..the only different today is that instead of taking these people, we got india, china, mynamar, philippine, vietnam..an almost influx of asian peoples, and if these peoples cannot make it in their countries due to their own country poor state and poor managment, do you think that they can do well in singapore with a mentality and a working culture of their home land?? In recent years, singapore immigration policy objective is shifted to increase population, so as to take in more taxation, levy, gst, property booming  rather than for the economy. If it is for the industry economy, we dun need so much people.</p>
