              <p>TS saw only one side of the picture yet so agitated.birth control MUST be implemented.despite the recent myanmar/sze chuan tragedies...humans are still too many.this is bad for the planet and there will be no more planet soon if humans run amok.more humans means increased food prices, property prices,more fuel, resources consumption. all this leads to deforestation on a huge scale and other negative effect thanks to "human improvement" to the planet. to us small timers, it simply means everything becomes very expensive. so much that we will be overwhelmed. also means more excuse for your gabrament to rise this and that taxes and fees for even now.</p>

              <p>1-child policy.....critize so much for what...?  In other developing countries,  alot of them apply  2-children  policy......is that also inhumane? In fact, contraception, and family planning, is that also all inhumane? Maybe we can say it that way, but is that true?</p>
              <p>You said slowly naturally people will have lower birthrate, yes, but isnt that also true in other countries, why did they encourage 2 children policy? Could it be because they are far-sighted and forced to make choices? And could it be that also in the case of China use of 1-child policy because it has the world's highest pop while millions live in poverty?</p>

              <p>Human society is very different from the past,there are too many ways to avoid pregnant.So nowadays,human are not like animals,have sexual intercourse then got baby comes out.Also,if you now want to have baby,u also must see your partner(whether be it man or woman) agree or not.If he/she dont want baby,you also LPPL(cannot do anything).</p>
              <p>Conclusion is,better let the nature do a check on the population.So if someday,your country die too many ppl you still can blame the Heaven.But if lets say you go and act smart n impose birth control,and later on find that your country has not enough population,then how?Who can you blame?Blame yourself lar.</p>
