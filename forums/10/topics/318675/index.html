              <p>The number of births in Beijing alone is several times the death toll of the si chuan quake. But it wont put a dent to the population. </p>
              <p>I agree that when countries modernise and develop... birth rates start to decline. But China still got a huge proportion of people living in rural areas that rely on farming. Such families have the tendency to have lots of children especially boys that can help out in the farms.</p>
              <p>Although there is the one child policy and the population of China is 1.3billion. They never tell you the number of é»‘äºº. These are the "extra kids" that some families have but never officially report their existance to the government. If they are found out, guess what the government do.... I heard its NOT very plesent.</p>

              <p>Whether there will be a food crisis is something obscure,those Communist politicians just use their imaginary mind n dream of a picture that if our population is so many blah blah blah,our country food supply cant sustain such a figure.</p>
              <p>But,they didnt open up their view onto the whole world market.When China becomes richer n richer,they will have the capital to buy food(whether it is rice or grain) from other countries,why worry so much?Even if there is a population crisis,it should be the whole world issue,not China alone.Therefore,it should be all the countries around the globe to implement birth control at the same time.Why Communist China must go n act smart n implement birth control on their side?</p>
              <p>Another thing is,asking ppl to not born so many children is very easy,but later on,if the Communist government change their mind n ask ppl to born more,you think ppl will listen?Look at Singapore,its a very good "bad example" for China to learn from.Now Singapore government is sooo desperate for babies that they anyhow import foreign talents.</p>
              <p>Yet another thing,on the human side,if let say i can only have 1 child.And i painstakingly breed n bring up the child till he/she is around 15-16 yrs old.And if there is an accident happen,lets say in this case,an earthquake n he/she die.What will happen to all my effort that i have put on him/her.All gone!!!By that time,i also too old to have another child.Dont you think it is one of the most tragedy thing that could ever happen to a person?</p>

              <p>There are too many human! China is right to impose 1 child policy. India should learn from China and try to control its population too.</p>

              <p>The number of births in Beijing alone is several times the death toll of the si chuan quake. But it wont put a dent to the population. </p>
              <p>I agree that when countries modernise and develop... birth rates start to decline. But China still got a huge proportion of people living in rural areas that rely on farming. Such families have the tendency to have lots of children especially boys that can help out in the farms.</p>
              <p>Although there is the one child policy and the population of China is 1.3billion. They never tell you the number of é»‘äºº. These are the "extra kids" that some families have but never officially report their existance to the government. If they are found out, guess what the government do.... I heard its NOT very plesee</p>
