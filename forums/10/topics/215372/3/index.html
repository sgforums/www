Or do you expect someone to do it for you?<br><br>Know what that's called? The 'MM' or 'maid mentality'.<br><br>Granted some good habits go the way of the dodo after a while. And with no proper designated disposal points in food courts or hawker centers, one can be forgiven if they promptly leave their leftovers all over the table, expecting paid cleaners to do their job.<br><br>But if you have it in yourself to maintain some dignity and cleanliness, you can pack up your finished plates neatly and clean up the leftovers on the table with the used utensils. Unfortunately, few if any are prepared to 'dirty their fingers' and will defer all such responsibility to the cleaners.<br><br>I certainly do not kowtow to ang mohs, but where diginity and good habits are concerned, they will always be several rungs above us. I can possibly understand how many of them still view Asians as primitives, even if i resent that ideal.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>Well, at this point I agree with you. some canteens in science parks had all food served on trays, and proper disposal points for tray returns, very much like the army camps, and I see everybody left bones and shell on the trays and trays are returned. I see this happened automatically, whether those who came in workers overall or suit and tie. If we do that for all hawker centers, I agree we should and I believe singaporeans will, return all trays leaving the tables clean without the need for cleaners. I will join you in shooting those who don't.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

One doesn't have to be pro-PAP or anti-PAP, go with the flow or think differently in order to make our society a more pleasant place to live in. Courtesy, politeness and simple considerations for others are societal issues that we can change on our own.<br><br>To Sgdiehard, don't take it too personally that some offensive words appeared in the course of the debate. You keep saying that its we or some of us "bad-naming" you.  But I think that in such discussion, what is important is that there is [b]no you or me, only us</strong>, and it goes the same to all my fellow Singaporeans.<br><br>As a society, we cannot keep segregating ourselves, working class from ruling class, or freedom seekers from opressors. Dude, we are only talking about changing our own behaviours to make things and live easier for all of us. And I think Lazerlords did mention a few of these very simple things that we can do, like putting the bones back into the plate after we finish our meals.<br><br>There may be differences in our experiences in the society, some of us see more people who perform courtesy deeds, some less. Doesn't matter, so long we pass on a simple smile to each person who performed a courtesy deed and remind those around us not to perform the rude ones, things can change within time.<br><br>Every society has its problems and some of us suits in one better than the other. There's absolutely nothing wrong in leaving for another place if one finds that Singapore absolutely doesn't suit his/her lifestyle, but neither can we just leave everytime a problem is observed in a society. I mean, you see something that you don't like and you run away? When will you be able to settle down then? Nothing is improved by those who run away from a problem but by those who actively seek to change it.[/b]</blockquote> actually, so far none of the people in the discussion of this thread had resorted to name calling. I am only refer to the angmoh friend of whoever wrote to the papers. Have not taken anybody personally, but am willing to answer to those who think the angmoh ways are better ways. There are good and bad in every society, no one society is better or superior than the others. Leave out the angmoh and I will leave you guys argue about the dynasty.</div>
