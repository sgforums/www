I disagreed, saying that at most it's a small minority who behaved that way.<br>He challenged me to a test. I accepted his challenge, determined to prove him wrong. I was bitterly disappointed.<br><br>Here is an account of what happened.<br><br>My friend, my wife, our one-year-old son in a pram and I (wearing a neck brace and with my arm in a sling from injuries sustained in a car accident) went for an MRT ride. My wife and son couldn't get into the station for some time because other commuters kept using the gate meant for the disabled, ignoring her and the pram.<br><br>When the train arrived, people rushed in while alighting passengers rushed out. No one gave way to my wife and the pram. She had to compete with the horde to get onto the train. To make things worse, those standing at the doorway refused to move in, making it even more difficult for her.<br><br>Once on board, no one bothered to give up his seat to my wife, who was carrying our son. Those seated were young, able-bodied and educated (executive-type) adults. Finally, it was two Thai workers who gave up their seats to us.<br><br>Later, an old woman boarded the train. Again, no one gave up his seat until a man in a neck brace and an arm sling did so.<br><br>When we reached our destination, we tried to take the lift from the platform to the ticket concourse. The lift was packed with able-bodied people. My friend asked that my wife and the pram be allowed in but one man turned around and remarked rudely, 'Why can't you take the next lift?'. I was shocked beyond words.<br><br>We went to a packed food court for lunch. No tables were available. We waited and finally noticed a couple leaving. We inched our way towards their table but, with just 5m to go, a group of office girls ran ahead of us and took the table.<br><br>When we finally got a table, it was unbelievably messy. There were chicken bones, spilt sauces and prawn shells all over the table.<br><br>I turned red in the face when my friend, who was helping to clear the table, asked, 'So, do you still think that it's only a minority of Singaporeans that behave this way? If so, take a look around you. Look real hard at the tables when they leave... You guys eat like pigs.'<br><br>Martin Goh Lye Thiam<br><br>Actual Article: <a href="http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:e94ff5445a24e010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD:STForumArcIOID:02c10ada2f24e010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD:STForumArcDate:1160863140000" rel="nofollow">ST Forum</a><br><br>There's your 4 million smiles for you... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>This Martin Goh Lye Thiam is one stupid pathetic Singaporean who does not know about singapore and its culture and his guest is certainly arrogant and his remark uncalled for.<br><br>First of all, woman with baby in the pram should not expect seat to be given to her, especially Mrs God, young, able-body, probably not so educated, unless she carried the baby out of the pram.<br><br>If the lift is full when the door opens, you wait for the next! Imagine you take a lift from B1 to level 4, do you get out at level 1 just to give way to a lady or anybody? no, you queue by standing next to the door!! thats what this stupid martin needs to tell his guest. Don't expect anything from your host if you don't even practice it in your own country.<br><br>There is one significant diff between Asia and Oz in the way food is served, here fish, chicken, lambs comes with bones, prawn come with shell, in Oz, bones, shells are all taken out, nothing much is left to be thrown away. In Asia, food is served in small plates and bowls, as a result, leaving bones on the table is an acceptable table manner, but this is not the case in Oz, there they use bigger plate. So don't expect the tables to be clean, especially those in the food courts, crowded with office workers during lunch hour.  Even if you want it to be clean, wait for the cleaner to come clean them.<br><br>If you don want to see a messy table, go to a restaurant, where you will be asked to wait at the door, until the table is clean before you are seated. why go an rush with the poor office workers, during their lunch hour, in the busy food court??<br><br>In food court, there is no reservation of seat, 5 m is a long way to a table, again, Martin must have thought that he, with his wife and an angmoh friend, should have priority to the seat?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Yes, singaporeans are under pressure of time, we have poor quality living, and we need to slow down, give way, take time...and but it is typical arrogance of some westerners to say that we eat like pigs. I don't want to compare what I saw in australia with what i see here, or I will say that they eat like....<br><br>There is no need to feel sorry for what he encountered here.<br><br>To Martin Goh Lye Thiam, you are the pathetic singaporean, do you eat like pig?? the one in the pram a piglet??   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is hardly a perfect place. Despite the material comfort that we Singaporeans are enjoying, there is still social disatisfactory in our way of lives. It is good that such disatisfactory exist and people are bringing them up on forums for discussion for it contributes to the effort of making us better people.<br><br>What is worrying however is the attitude to this social disatisfaction. We have people like shutterbug who thinks the society is just incorrigible because of the government. So what? Everything is the fault of the government? What happen to the courtesy campaign? There is also a misconception of trust and reliance. Singaporeans rely a lot on the govt, but that doesn't mean that we trust them a lot. In fact, the usual statement heard in coffee shops and in this forum is always that the govt=PAP and it is always up to some no good. But despite this lack of trust, we continue to rely heavily on them, expecting them to do everything for us, in relation to this thread, including our courtesy level.<br><br>The normal respond would then be since we pay so much money to our government, it is the least that we can expect of them. True? Did we pay them to become our nanny including making sure we become courtesy? No, most social contract only requires the government to provide the maximum opportunities to its people within a safe and stable government, to which the present government had delivered to a fair degree. As member of a society, at times we must also take the blame in our own acts and not conveniently shift the blame to the people we most dislike.<br><br>On the other hand, we also have people like sgdiehard who seems to have a different standard of courtesy expectation than the rest of us. The scenarios were hideous protrayal of Singaporeans and we should all be ashame that Singaporeans are acting in such ungentlemen manner. Refusing to give up seats to mums, rushing into MRTs, the lack of social friendly gesture such as a small amount of self-sacrifice to make our fellow Singaporeans feel better!?!?<br><br>What is it that we can do to make ourselves better than? Complaining on ourselves on the forums is a good start, but its not going to lead to anywhere if we remain at this stage. We should also remind ourselves not to be any of those that do not give up seats, and we should also remind those around us to do the same. Come on, people, we are a society and we are meant to be dynamic, not passively waiting for the socital environment to be changed by itself as if there's some sort of miracle.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahahaha... lets begin our courtesy with ourselves, how many of us here give up seats on MRT? lets begin by giving up seats to the very young, the sick, the pregnant, the handicapped, the aged, and I must say that I have seen that happened many times on MRT, seats given to the handicapped and the pregnant. Of course we can stretch our courtesy a little by giving up seats to all ladies, as gentlemen, but I wouldn't consider not giving up seats to young mother as ungentleman. I am not sure if a 40 over man more able body than a 30 over lady on an MRT.<br><br>rushing into MRT, happen everywhere in big cities. the problem with singaporean is that many do not stand on the left on elevators to allow those who rush to move on the right side, many stand at the door even though there is much space inside the train to accommodate more people. It will take a while, for singaporean to cultivate the habits of moving in and out of MRT, standing or running on elevators. Rushing into MRT is not a hideous protrayal of Singaporeans that I would be ashamed of. I don't drive to work and I rush on MRT, underground, metro, MTR or even Jie Yun, all the time.<br><br>Anybody who talks about courtesy should know that they should be considerate of others instead of focusing on their own perceived rights and convenience. This you can begin by giving way to those who need to rush, do not complain, and calling them names is certainly BAD BAD MANNER.</div>

I once saw a young JC boy on an MRT during evening peak hr, he din't give up his seat to anybody, but imagine he left his home since 620am to take a feeder bus, then MRT and walked all the way to school (must be from St Andrew), now it is 640 in the evening, he must be completely used up for the day. I can sympathize with him for not giving up his seat to any woman above his age.<br><br>The room for argument is very big indeed.  Courtesy means you try to understand the others instead of jumping to conclusion that such behavior is ungentleman, or like pigs.<br><br>Millions of people squeezing in and out of Metro, Underground, Subway, MTR in major cities cannot be doing the wrong thing the same time day in day out. The only thing wrong is that they were born in places when over 10 millions people have to live in one city, whereas in australia the same population live in one continent!! They have to squeeze in MRT, in buses, in markets, and even in their own home if they can't afford a bigger apartment. The Brits and the French are supposed to be very gentleman, try taking a subway during peak hours in London or Paris, with a baby in a pram! This is not to say that the Londoners and the Parisians are equally rude, but people just avoid the peak hour train ride at all costs. Ever try taking a subway in Tokyo in the morning?  especially when you are not sure when is the next stop <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Will agree with you to some extent on giving way to those who are getting out, may be there should be a rule to have one door in and the others out, like the bus service.<br><br>What is the singaporean norm? go to the bus interchange at 615 and you will find buses are already crowded with students and those working in Jurong or Woodland, this will be followed by the office workers crowd from 730. I take my son to school at 630 and then from there take a train to office, ended up having breakfast by myself at Maxwell market every morning, I actually prefer taking breakfast with my wife at home then come to office. try to understand the working people, don't tell us how to live our life, when to wake up and when to sleep.<br><br></div>

Doesn't the act of protecting Singapore's sovereighty show that Singapore's nationhood has been established?<br><br>Leaving alone the benefits that Singaporeans stand to gain with a dual citizenship system in an era of globalisation, the ICA's statement only serves to weaken the faith of Singaporeans in our loyalty to the state in the eyes of other nations.<br><br>Our ministers owe Singaporeans an explanation on the ICA's stand.<br><br>Vincent Goh Tong Leng<br><br>Don't this show that Singaporeans still have to be told what to do and what not to do...Pathetic.....<br><br>Many of us are leaving....including me....better yet, keep the single citizenship policy, else we can't withdraw our CPF if its dual citizenship....why should we leave our hard earned money with them, which is RIGHTFULLY OURS!<br><br></div>

Imagine you take a lift from B1 to level 4, do you get out at level 1 just to give way to a lady or anybody? no, you queue by standing next to the door!! thats what this stupid martin needs to tell his guest. Don't expect anything from your host if you don't even practice it in your own country.<br><br>There is one significant diff between Asia and Oz in the way food is served, here fish, chicken, lambs comes with bones, prawn come with shell, in Oz, bones, shells are all taken out, nothing much is left to be thrown away. In Asia, food is served in small plates and bowls, as a result, leaving bones on the table is an acceptable table manner, but this is not the case in Oz, there they use bigger plate. So don't expect the tables to be clean, especially those in the food courts, crowded with office workers during lunch hour.  Even if you want it to be clean, wait for the cleaner to come clean them.<br><br>If you don want to see a messy table, go to a restaurant, where you will be asked to wait at the door, until the table is clean before you are seated. why go an rush with the poor office workers, during their lunch hour, in the busy food court??<br><br>In food court, there is no reservation of seat, 5 m is a long way to a table, again, Martin must have thought that he, with his wife and an angmoh friend, should have priority to the seat?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Yes, singaporeans are under pressure of time, we have poor quality living, and we need to slow down, give way, take time...and but it is typical arrogance of some westerners to say that we eat like pigs.

That doesn't give our people the license to place bones on the table and assume that a cleaner will always 'clean up' after us.<br><br>What's wrong with allocating a section of your plate for bones and unwanted food?

            <div class='col-md body'>HEY PEOPLE!! Lets not politicalise the subject here. One doesn't have to be pro-PAP or anti-PAP, go with the flow or think differently in order to make our society a more pleasant place to live in. Courtesy, politeness and simple considerations for others are societal issues that we can change on our own.<br><br>To Sgdiehard, don't take it too personally that some offensive words appeared in the course of the debate. You keep saying that its we or some of us "bad-naming" you.  But I think that in such discussion, what is important is that there is <strong>no you or me, only us</strong>, and it goes the same to all my fellow Singaporeans.<br><br>As a society, we cannot keep segregating ourselves, working class from ruling class, or freedom seekers from opressors. Dude, we are only talking about changing our own behaviours to make things and live easier for all of us. And I think Lazerlords did mention a few of these very simple things that we can do, like putting the bones back into the plate after we finish our meals.<br><br>There may be differences in our experiences in the society, some of us see more people who perform courtesy deeds, some less. Doesn't matter, so long we pass on a simple smile to each person who performed a courtesy deed and remind those around us not to perform the rude ones, things can change within time.<br><br>Every society has its problems and some of us suits in one better than the other. There's absolutely nothing wrong in leaving for another place if one finds that Singapore absolutely doesn't suit his/her lifestyle, but neither can we just leave everytime a problem is observed in a society. I mean, you see something that you don't like and you run away? When will you be able to settle down then? Nothing is improved by those who run away from a problem but by those who actively seek to change it.</div>
