            <div class='col-md body'>LKY may not be as senile or insensitive as some think when he was making those statements about the marginalisation of the Chinese in neighbouring Malaysia or Indonesia.<br><br>He might have made a slip of the tongue being under pressure by probing team of journalists in which case he should have just admitted his remarks as a mistake and make apology to the people offended.<br><br>By making those statements he has made, on the other hand he could be plumming new depths for his current crops of younger leaders.<br><br>He could have sensed that most or all of them are compliant technocrats, chosen by his party to enter politics rather than people with the fire in the belly.<br><br>It would appear that none among them really possess that purposeful deep-seated quiet determination to be protective of the territory, required for Singapore's future survival.<br><br>Someone among the leaders have got to be the Zhu Geliang or the Song Jiang who are able to command the larger than life respect of the people to plan, sustain and defend the territory with the keenest survival instinct which the current crops of leaders might not possess.<br><br>It would be a plus if he could leave a more enduring legacy by mentoring a good crop of of leaders among the present team who could be like Zhu Geliang or Song Jiang to ensure future survival of the little red dot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I disagree. There is no need to mentor. Those people are not teenagers. They are mature men in their 40s and 50s. In fact they need to be given their own space. Not to be 'mentored'. This mentoring can in fact be stifling for change and progress. Times are different. Let each next generation take full charge.</div>

"In all honesty, it should be right for them to say that they are sorry. ... But we will wait."<br><br>Lee, Singapore's founding father who holds the Cabinet post of minister mentor, told a forum in Singapore on Sept. 15 that Malaysia and Indonesia "have problems with the Chinese. They are successful, they are hardworking, and therefore, they are systematically marginalized."<br><br>Singapore's High Commissioner T. Jasudasen met with Malaysian foreign ministry officials Thursday, and Singapore "will respond through appropriate channels in due course," a Singapore High Commission official said on condition of anonymity.<br><br>Indonesia also summoned Singapore's envoy earlier this week to explain Lee's remarks that Malaysia and Indonesia "want Singapore, to put it simply, to be like their Chinese - compliant."<br><br>Malaysia's prime minister has expressed displeasure at Lee's remark, suggesting that it could stir up Malaysia's Chinese, who make up about a quarter of the country's 26 million population and are its second largest ethnic group after the Malay majority. He has also noted that race relations in ethnic Chinese-majority Singapore are also not perfect.<br><br>Malaysia and Singapore have close cultural and economic ties, but a history of quarrels, bad blood and rivalry. In recent years the neighbors have sparred over the price of water, and took a territorial spat over a tiny islet to the World Court.<br></div>
