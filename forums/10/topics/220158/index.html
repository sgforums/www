            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>A P65 PAP MP believes that each citizen must feel his views matter. Another government MP, Dr Mohd Maliki Osman (Sembawang GRC) urges Singaporeans to stop just being 'problem identifiers'.<br>He asked: 'Are we turning Singapore into a nation of people whose problem-solving skills solely rest on the mechanism of asking someone else to solve their problems?' (ST, Nov 10). What mixed signals are we citizens getting? Are we supposed to take the law into our own hands?<br><br>Like children who are taught to seek help from parents or teachers to resolve problems, Singaporeans turn to the relevant authorities to look into the problems that they can't solve themselves.<br><br>For example, when students are not using technology in the right way, we hope that the Ministry of Education will look at the issue.<br><br>Why do we appear to be 'whining and whingeing'? It's all about perception. Imagine this: You climb a tall tree. When you are at the tree top, you set your sights far and get used to seeing the big picture. When you hear voices from the ground, you look down and the things below appear small. In fact, they are partially blocked by the branches and you see only what you can see. You think it is not worthwhile going down to find out more. When the voice gets louder, you shout: 'Stop making noise while I'm looking at the big picture. Why are there voices coming up from the bottom? You have many measures in place but if these are not properly linked, or are too difficult to achieve, they are as good as useless.<br><br>Singaporeans are asked to play their part to help build the nation, and there are telephone numbers to call the government departments when we need to make enquiries or to report things that we think are not right. Who will remember the long list of phone numbers? When people find it too difficult to get access and do their part, it's only natural that they get angry and complain in the hope that someone will hear them. What do you think the children who feel helpless do when they are being treated unfairly? You should be glad that Singaporeans are willing to speak up and not resorting to violence the way people do in some countries.<br><br>Benny Tan Seng Hee<br><br>I DISAGREE that Singaporeans have become 'a nation of complainers' and 'a society increasingly reliant on the Government for help' - a view shared by some MPs.<br>We voted for a particular party as it was competent in solving problems. Naturally, we have high expectations. The Government has been the main engineer of policies and active community participation in shaping them is limited. It was only recently that it encouraged citizens to voice their opinions. These are now deemed as complaints. The MPs with this view should understand grassroots sentiments and do soul-searching.<br><br>Wang Tiancheng<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Get a life Sillyporean and stop leeching on the gahmen or you shall pay dearly with GST increase</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
