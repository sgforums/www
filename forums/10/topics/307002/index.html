              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Singapore. Education comes with responsibilities.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>When one becomes educated, with it comes
              responsibilities. And it is dishonorable for the educated to remain
              silent when a dictator misleads, deceives his fellow citizens but yet
              remains silent; even though he knows the truth. Even though, by virtue
              of his education, he is in a position to stand up to the dictator and
              stop him from carrying on with the mischief.<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew in
              Singapore runs the country as a dictatorship even though it was meant
              to be a democracy. Singapore has a constitution which gives citizens
              their basic fundamental rights. A constitution which guarantees the
              citizens rights against excesses by the government. A constitution
              which is meant to allow the citizens through elections to change the
              government. A constitution which guarantees a free press, free speech
              and expression; which guarantees the rule of law and the right to
              equality among people; the right to be protected from racial and
              religious discrimination. The citizens of Singapore have the right to
              live as free men and women. This is the right that they are guaranteed
              under the constitution.<br><br>Before their very eyes, deliberately and
              without any shame, Lee Kuan Yew has denied the citizens of Singapore
              each of these rights, making the citizens of Singapore live at the
              whims and fancies of the supreme dictator, Lee Kuan Yew. All these
              guarantees in the constitution are openly and shamelessly broken and
              violated. There is no free speech. To speak you need a license and if
              it is speech that the government does not like to hear, you will not
              get the license. And not getting the license, you will be arrested,
              sued, impoverished and bankrupted in that order, by a pliant and
              corrupt judiciary, if you did speak.<br><br>Although the constitution
              guarantees the right to assemble, a license is needed to do it; if it
              is an assembly to criticize the government, no license will be granted
              and if you assembled anyway, you will be punished in the above order;
              even though the assembly did not even hurt a fly.<br><br>Every aspect
              of freedom is denied; if the intent is to criticize the government. In
              Singapore people are permitted to go about their lives, do their work,
              go about their occupations and recreations, go about their living, but
              with one caveat, which is this. Do not criticize the government. Do not
              complain even if Mr. Lee Kuan Yew and his son steals $3.7 million of
              your money each year, for each of them; which by the way he does
              claiming it to be a salary.<br><br>If you wish to live in peace, do not
              criticize if the government refuses, as they do now, to pay your
              retirement CPF money when you reach 60 years; which by law they are
              required to do.<br><br>You have no right to criticize if the government
              is building gambling dens next to your homes which they intend to do.
              You have no right if the government permits prostitution in Geylang by
              the massive influxion of Peidu Mama, single mothers from Communist
              China whose children are given scholarships at government expense.<br><br>You
              will be punished if you complained about racial discrimination and
              ethnic rearrangement though the massive importation of Communist
              Chinese so as to maintain the illegal racial quota of 75 % Chinese.<br><br>To
              put it simply, the Constitution of Singapore is a dead letter. It is
              intended to fool the rest of the world and Singapore citizens into
              thinking it is a Constitutional Parliamentary democracy. Nothing can be
              further from the truth. Singapore is nothing more than a country run by
              the Lee family, the Lee Kuan Yew family, assisted by their corrupted
              minions, who decide what the lives of an average Singaporean will be,
              day by day.<br><br>I know this fact, the fact that it is nothing more
              than a dictatorship of Lee Kuan Yew. But I am not the only one who
              knows this fact. Every educated person, if he bothers to find out,
              knows all that I have said. Every educated person in Singapore knows
              that Lee Kuan Yew has brought Singapore to what it is now; a place
              where he and his family can make as much money as they want without
              complaint from anyone. A place where decisions are made by them and
              them alone. A place without any set rules for government, the rules
              being made by the Lee family as time goes on. A place where the people
              have to live entirely at the mercy of what Lee may or may not decide
              tomorrow.<br><br>Every educated Singaporean knows this. They know that
              their rights have progressively been diminished over the years until
              today, when they have none. A self respecting Singaporean would feel
              outraged at this denial of his rights which are guaranteed to him under
              the Constitution. Any self respecting Singaporean should take back his
              rights that Lee has stolen; how dare Mr. Lee Kuan Yew take away the
              rights that belong to them. The educated Singaporeans should ask who
              this man thinks he is is. God? Any self respecting Singaporean should
              not tolerate this. They should demand redress. They should demand the
              right to live as men again, not sheep.<br><br>There are those whom Lee
              has deliberately kept only partially educated and who may not be aware
              that they have more power than they think. If these people did not see
              their lives being in bondage, it is possible to understand. But how can
              one forgive those with an education, those who are aware of the damage
              being done, and yet remain silent. These people cannot be forgiven.
              These are shameful people, fearful people who do not have the
              confidence to stand up to a tyrant, so they continue with their
              sheepish lives.<br><br>Within this group of shame; that is the educated
              people who lack the courage to do thief right thing; I include the
              lawyers, all of them; I include all the other professionals; I include
              the professors and lecturers at the universities who claim to have a
              lot of gray matter in their heads but not the courage to stand up to
              tyrants; I include the school teachers, the engineers, the scientists;
              in fact I include everyone with any amount of tertiary education.<br><br>If
              I know this much, they too know this much. If I know Lee Kuan Yew is a
              thief, they too know this. If I know that all their rights are denied,
              they too know this.<br><br>I know of a professor at the SMU who was my
              classmate at Raffles Institution. I should not say too much about him;
              so as not to give away his identity. Needless to say, he lives in fear
              of Lee Kuan Yew. He reads a lot, literature, poetry and English. He
              wants us to believe that he is a man of letters. He even wrote a
              comical poem to me once. He even told me once, how far true I do not
              know, that he had lunch with Vaclav Havel. He attends theatrical
              performances, symphony performances. In other words he wants me to
              believe that he is part of the educated polished elite. But in spite of
              all this; in spite of all his accomplishments; in spite of the fact
              that he knows full well that in Singapore, he is nothing more than Lee
              Kuan Yew's subject to do as he pleases; this professor does not dare to
              raise a single complaint, openly against this dictatorship. It is such
              people who live lives in disgrace, in denial and in cowardice. He knows
              that if Lee so desires, his entire career, his wine sipping and
              theatrical performances would disappear overnight. So like a cowardly
              goat, he remains silent as Lee rules over him.<br><br>Not only him, the
              entire educated class deserves contempt. Contempt because they as
              citizens of Singapore, are prepared to stand idly by, as Lee and his
              family continue to steal from them at will; steal their money, their
              rights, their everything.<br><br>As for me, I have a stake in
              Singapore. I was born there. My father spent almost his entire life in
              Singapore, building up the country to what it is today. I have a right
              to complain and to expose these dictators. And like myself, I ask
              others in Singapore and elsewhere to cry out against these dictators
              and these tyrants.<br><br>The wheels of change have begun to turn. The
              Lee government is finding it impossible to stifle the criticism that is
              outpouring against this dictatorship; but so far, except for a few, the
              criticism has been only incognito, hiding behind pseudonyms and false
              pretenses. The educated should stand out now, openly identifying
              themselves in criticism. Being educated, they will always manage to
              survive. Therefore they should have more courage. Remaining silent is
              not an option in these circumstances.<br><br>The professor at the SMU
              should not only be writing poetry, but like Vaclav Havel, be a beacon
              for truth and freedom. Like it was in Czechoslovakia.<br><br>These
              blogs that I write and others write will continue to prick the minds of
              their readers, and even if a single person was moved into some thought
              process to demand change, even in a very small way; this blog would
              have served its purpose.<br>Each reader even in a small way can be part
              of the movement for change by small efforts, such as distributing these
              blog posts to others and disseminating the information in them
              throughout the island. These small efforts by all of us combined will
              help towards political change in Singapore.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>I think continuing education has a place in our society.</p>
              <p>I think we should excercise our options of learning about economics, world and domestic politics, sociology, anthropology, psychology, current affairs, and other human sciences after our school going years to give us a better understanding of the world we live in.</p>
              <p>I find there is a fair bit of ignorance in these forums and I am myself ignorant of quite a lot of stuff. I'm trying to catch up and I'd surely like to see classes or courses so we can round off our education and become more worldly citizens.</p>
              <p>I think as we age, we go through phases where we become more interested in different topics and I'd like to see some kind of part time adult courses available to cater to this.</p>
              <p>The British style curriculum fails in Singapore's context because it presupposes that we'd be entering the civil service where we'd be restricted in the duties we perform, hence only need to study certain courses. In the modern era, sometimes we find it's the dropouts that actually succeed in making an impression on the business world, those who were guided more appropriately in their choice of courses or got their learning though apprenticeships or from experienced mentors.</p>

              <p>migrating to a new country is never easy. there are alot of challenges and if u are up to adapting to a new country like those youngsters, then u are alright. Not for me, i had alot of difficulty in adjustment and still face it today after staying here for 1 year. one has to put up with the changes in ones' lifestyle, routine and talks with people.</p>
              <p>im not worry too much about cost coz i earn the local ozzie dollars here and they pay much better as compared to sg.</p>
              <p>but like i say, open your eyes before u jump into this bandwagon. Some will like the change of environment, others dont. for those sporeans that heads back to sg, there is no defeat. they have tried and find it not suitable. bottomline; THEY TRIED.</p>
              <p>But i would rather face the roughs and tumbles here in OZ than to live under the PAP rules. that is my push factor.</p>

              <p><br>Dear pearlie,</p>
              <p>I agree with you but seeing how you link education with colonisation by party affiliation in your own words, I have to warn you that you have been already been indoctrinated.</p>
              <p>Education is not party related.</p>
