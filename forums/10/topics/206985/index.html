The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) has said it will consider favourably an appeal from her to stay here after her time in jail.<br><br>But Wilasini Maniwan will have to serve four weeks in jail, even as the end of a couple's long and winding road to living together legally as man and wife in Singapore is in sight.<br><br>The saga of Maniwan, 21, and her Singaporean husband, Or Chee Koon, 30, has spanned close to three years, two illegal entries, one baby, and six appeals to the ICA.<br><br>It began in November 2003, when Maniwan came to the Republic to visit relatives. She overstayed, and in February the next year, met and fell in love with Mr Or, a salesman.<br><br>She became pregnant, and the couple planned to get married. So, in an effort to become legitimate, she gave herself up to the ICA in December that year.<br><br>However, she was deported to Thailand, where she gave birth to a baby girl in April last year. That was when the couple's attempts to marry and live here got more complicated.<br><br>She managed to sneak into Singapore with her daughter on June 16 last year, and they made plans to marry. But after a trip to Batam, Maniwan's status as a prohibited person was detected, and she was denied entry.<br><br>Mr Or appealed to the ICA and she was allowed to stay in Singapore for a week to sort out her return to Thailand.<br><br>In all, he wrote six appeals - three via his Member of Parliament.<br><br>Maniwan re-entered Singapore in February with a new passport and new name: Naphatson Or.<br><br>Her new name and identity did not fool the ICA, and she was arrested at Changi Airport on Feb 8.<br><br>In sentencing her to four weeks' jail on Friday, District Judge Danielle Yeow said Maniwan should have known better, and noted that it was the second time she had entered Singapore illegally.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by killstyle:</div><div class="quote_body">yes brings us back to the question: who benefited from higher worker productivity.<br><br>i would say its the rich capitalists, definetly not your day to day workers. they only get to enjoy thier fixed-and-ever depressing wages, which will only be depressed further once the Flood gates are open wider. the employers will justify it for cost competiton, ie they can hire an FT to replace singaporeans anytime.<br></div></blockquote>By theory, everyone should have benefitted from higher productivity. On workforce level, higher productivity will translate to higher wages, and hence higher mSoL. On producer level, cost advantages increases, hence they become more competitive and get higher profits in the long run. On society level, aggregate supply rises and hence the country gets potential growth. This is followed by a rise in demand due to income increases, thus there is real growth too.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br><br>Yet, in Singapore, we do not observe such trends. The government seems to be biased towards the society and producer level by inviting FTs which have less demand for wages, so the immediate effect of a rise in domestic wages is not seen. So, you are right to say that the welfare goes to the rich capitalists, while compromising that of local Singaporeans.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br><br>The problem with FTs have been depicted many times in this thread already. FTs take higher pay than Singaporeans, are better valued, are easily supplied, and have other social advantages (eg no NS).<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br><br>Still, in the NDP rally, PM pointed out that "FTs come to Singapore to create more jobs for us, so in fact they are not stealing jobs, but are further boosting our economy." The fallacy in this statement is that the FTs have no incentive to create more jobs for us, and even if they did, it would be largely profit motivated. There'd be transfers of welfare from the locals to the FTs, and if the FTs chose to leave Singapore, they'll take the cash and leave the dirt behind.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br><br>Thus, FTs can only work as an effective stopgap measure. To replace our gaps in the workforce, yes. But to permanently make FTs a part of Singapore to replace Singaporeans, 100% no.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

"Tying up their limbs" isn't giving them an opportunity. Even so, we're digressing from the main topic already.</div>
