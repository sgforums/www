            <div class='col-md body'>long term planning my fren, many many years ago, when they start collecting taxes, did they foresee that today, we will have an economic slump? and if our government did not have all those so called reserves, would we have come out of this economic slump better than most countries? dun look at thing so short term lah, the increment, if u ask me to explain to you in details, i cant, they have all the details, but i am absolutely sure its for a long term effect on us.<br><br>I am glad you know its a time of saving in times of retrenchment. But instead of putting the blame on the government, why not check our own lifestyle to see where we can save? aircon, excessive use of electricity, tv, internet, handphone, cigarettes, taking taxis and many other stuff. shouldnt we consider cutting down on such expenses? i have a fren whose whole family agree to cut down on electrical bills. they stop using the aircons and the bills went down by more than half! so before you blame the government for everything, think that they were the one who gave you an environment to be so comfortable in, you are not the only one who suffer, as i mentioned i come from an average family too, many people suffer but quit complaining, cos are you dying of poverty? i guess not cos you still have time to come on the net and still have  internet connection. shows ur life aint that jia lat yet.</div>
