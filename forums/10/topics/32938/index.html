            <div class='col-md body'>I was really worried with the increase in GST. But it has  been 2 weeks into the new year and yet i see that in most cases I am not very affected by the increase. Most foodcourts did not increase their prices. Many small retail outlets did not increase also. So are we really affected?<br><br>Anyway, if these small items, daily expenditure is not increased...then we should be quite ok what... i think its time we stop depending so much on the government  and depend on ourselves. Cut down on expenses...but of course there will be cases where people will still suffer because of all these increment but how many, frankly? I think out of 10 singaporeans, 8 or 9 would still be living quite well, though not as good as last time. We just  need to adjust lah...<br><br>Anyway increasing GST is for long term benefits to our country's economy which will be difficult to explain becos to be frank whats immediate is more important for pple like us but then our government needs to see Singapore survive in  50 yrs, 100 yrs, 200 yrs.. just ask urself, in these times of economic slump, did we really suffer as  much as other  countries did? i think government  has done quite a good job here.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Collecting GST is like taking small teaspoon of water out from a Big Bath Tub.<br><br>After a while, the bathtub will have only half (or lesser still) of the water left.<br><br>Then to allow for a good satisfactory bath, more water has to be returned (ERS), so that hopefully the water can reach a higher level, so that more teaspoonful of water can be taken out of the bathtub again - later.<br><br>With each teaspoonful of water taken periodically, no one will see the water level drop suddenly.<br><br>However, over time, the water level must drop.<br><br>GST was first introduced to allow for a tax collection system that will cover every single person who has money to spend Â– which means that if you have money to spend but "miss" paying Income Tax, and NEVER pay income tax; then THIS TIME with GST, you will pay tax each time you spend your money.<br><br>This was compared to the previous tax payment system when it was calculated that at least 25 percent of the population do not pay tax, as they are self-employed, or do not have a steady occupation to report any income return.<br><br>Hence, there was a leak in the Tax Collection System.<br><br>However, when the 3 Percent GST was first introduced, the Government was not prepared to have a Budget Surplus from its GST Tax collection that amounted to over S$1 Billion at the end of the first GST Collection Year.<br><br>It was a "surprise".<br><br>This 3 Percent GST Collection System had a positive revenue report at the end of every Financial Year since its implementation.<br><br>With an increase of the 3 Percent GST by an Additional ONE Percentage Point, it has effectively increased it by 33.3333 Percent.<br><br>This means the previous surplus of S$1 Billion, will increase by 33.3333% to an additional sum of S$1,333,333,300  by simply changing GST from 3% to 4%.<br><br>Even with the earlier Tax Collection System (before GST), the Government was able to accumulate Budget Surpluses at the end of every Financial Year, which resulted in our National Reserve reported to be at least US$100 Billion.<br><br>Now that the Singapore Economy has gone into another recession within 5 Years, and with more Citizens expected to loose jobs until mid-2003, it is surprising that the Government should increase the GST instead of relaxing its collection to an already bloated reserve.<br><br>By mid-2003, unemployement is anticipated to increase by another 0.5 percent more, adding to an already big pool of 4 percent jobless from a population of 4,500,000.<br><br>While Workers' Salary and CPF has been cut, increases have been made on charges for Public Transport, Electricity, Water, Postage, Telephone, Hospital Fees, and some other miscellaneous Government Services - including Court Hearing Time.<br><br>One seriously wonder if the Government has not started a Â‘self-contradictoryÂ’ policy that takes more money out of circulation from the Economy, while at the same time is trying to encourage Entrepreneurship from its Citizens.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>considering that if 1.5million people is eligible in our 3 million citizens (not counting the other 1 million who mite  be PR or wat), it is a sizeable 600 million they are giving out.<br><br>I mean no one is denying the increase in price. Everything increases anyway. You may find it hard to believe, but what Singapore achieve today has  alot to do with all these "SURPLUS" you have been lamenting about. Alot may feel tat they are sacrificing  the poorer people. I can tell you that my household income is  less than $2500. you can hardly call that rich or even  above average. but i guess in our family, we believe in being contented, if we  have $10, we eat $10, if  we have $2, we eat $2, no complaints.<br><br>the other thing, i mean is  that, ARE  you really affected as in, you see your  monthly expenditure spiralling out of proportion, i mean when i go foodcourt, when i go shopping, when i go grocery shopping and in many places, i find my expenditure pretty much the  same as when it was 3%...of  course when it goes to 5%, 6%, 10% the impact will be as great now, thats the reason why we are  given time to adjust to it. Do you remember the times when bus fares are just 15cents? when it was to be increased, everyone complains and it is natural but if  the increase  is gradual  and necessary, MOST of us are coping quite well with the  increment isnt it?  Adjustment is the key word here.</div>
