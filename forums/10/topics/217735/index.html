Going by economic status, they are the top two super-elites and the biggest winners of our times.<br><br>However, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett's attitude towards charity and philanthropy couldn't have been more different than the view held by locally bred elites who consider themselves as winners in the game of life. Warren Buffett is donating 85% of his 46 billion wealth to charity and Bill Gates has gone even further -- he pledged to eventually give away his entire fortune (save a tiny fraction for his children). In fact, he has already given away 29 billion in the last five years alone.<br><br>In life, we do not need tonnes of $$$.  Our elites and ministers have got wrong values for life.<br>Just look at the amount of $$$ that they are getting; salaries, perks, dividends, self declared shares dividends and bonuses(of course with board of directors of own people), fees and etc.<br>Now, with these amount of $$$ they are drawing....we know how much disruption to Earth is going to be.<br>Hypocrisy, they still have the balls to tell us that the earth is depleting in resourses and deterioting if we do not start to do something to protect our Mother Earth.  What the Fark!!!</div>
