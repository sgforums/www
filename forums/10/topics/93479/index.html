            <div class='col-md body'>Why did bin Laden declare a Â“fatwah,Â” or religious decree, against the United States?<br>U.S. intelligence officials believe bin Laden began to turn against the United States in the mid-1980s Â— a time when he still took aid and training from the CIA, which was then helping bin Laden and other Islamic groups fight the Soviet Army in Afghanistan. The CIA funneled its aid through the Pakistani secret service, the ISI, to various cells in Afghanistan, one of them known as the MAK. In 1984, bin Laden broke with the MAK and formed a separate, more radical splinter group that espoused a harsh, fundamentalist version of Islam that was dedicated to the liberation of Islamic nations from any foreign influences, from Israel to the United States to the Soviet Union. Particularly infuriating to him is AmericaÂ’s coziness with the Saudi Royal family since the Gulf War. But bin LadenÂ’s first public Â“fatwahÂ” came only after the Gulf War. Specifically, he railed against the presence of American and European troops on the soil of the Arabian peninsula, site of IslamÂ’s holiest cities, Mecca and Medina. Since then, U.S. intelligence officials say, bin Laden has been behind an unprecedented campaign of attacks on U.S., European, Israeli, Russian and other interests around the planet. In 1998, he broadened his Â“fatwahÂ” to specifically include civilian targets:<br><br>The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies Â— civilians and military Â— is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Asqa Mosque [in Jerusalem] and the holy mosque [in Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim. This is in accordance with the words of Almighty God, Â“and with the pagans all together as they fight you all togetherÂ” and Â“fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God.Â”<br><br>It adds, Â“We with GodÂ’s help call on every Muslim who believes in God and wishes to be rewarded to comply with GodÂ’s order to kill the Americans and plunder their money wherever and whenever they find it. We also call on Muslim ulema, leaders, youths and soldiers to launch the raid on SatanÂ’s U.S. troops and the devilÂ’s supporters allying with them, and to displace those who are behind them so that they may learn a lesson.Â”<br><br>http://history1900s.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.msnbc.com%2Fnews%2F627355.asp</div>
