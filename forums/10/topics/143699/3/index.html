            <div class='col-md body'>It's not a waste of money<br>Marina Bay rebranding went beyond choice of name: URA<br>Friday Â• August 5, 2005<br>Lee U-Wen<br>u-wen@newstoday.com.sg<br><br>Under fire from the public for a $400,000 branding exercise, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is staunchly defending the planning process for the Marina Bay area.<br><br>The branding exercise Â— carried out by North American firm Interbrand Â— was an extensive one that went beyond name selection, the statutory board told Today. And the amount spent will be recouped many times over in investments and tourism spending in the coming years.<br><br>As URA's director of urban planning and design Michael Koh put it: "This branding project is not a name selection exercise. The scope of work is far wider and took nine months to complete."<br><br>In three phases, the team embarked on a process that involved, among other things, researching the strategies of competing cities such as London and Shanghai, interviewing stakeholders, and market-testing the brand locally and overseas.<br><br>Contrary to what some people have said, the views of the "man on the street" were sought through random street interviews conducted at places near Marina Bay Â— such as the Esplanade and One Fullerton.<br><br>But why not have a more extensive consultation process?<br><br>"We are, after all, identifying a strategy for Singapore to compete on a global stage and we don't want to give anything away to our competition," said URA's head of urban design Cheng Hsing Yao.<br><br>"We wanted to keep our plans under wraps until the final product was ready," he said.<br><br>One issue that concerned some of Today's readers was the decision to stick with the original name "Marina Bay" Â— which they said was not unique enough Â— at the end of the extensive process.<br><br>Addressing the criticism, Mr Cheng argued that the name, picked from over 400 suggestions, was "favoured by the stakeholders" and also the most "well-received".<br><br>While he declined to give examples of the shortlisted names, reiterating that the focus of the branding process was not on the name, he called for the public to "give (them) time" to realise the dreams of the Marina Bay brand.<br><br>This brand, he pointed out, would be used to promote the area internationally for the next 10 to 15 years.<br><br>He admitted that the $400,000 spent was "not a small sum" but he also called for the public to see the amount as an "investment that would bring long-term economic benefits".<br><br>"The real estate investments will be big, and this will create many jobs and increase tourism spending. A strong brand needs time to be built, we can't see the results overnight," he said.<br><br>But were the services of Interbrand truly necessary?<br><br>Insisting it was so, Mr Cheng said: "We cannot underestimate the knowledge and expertise needed to develop this core idea.<br><br>"Just urban planners and architects are not enough. It's clearer to engage a third party to come in to assess.<br><br>"If you look at many other private companies, they undergo branding exercises too."<br><br>Touted as Singapore's "future downtown", the Marina Bay area is being planned with the lifestyle of "work, live, play" in mind.<br><br>Modern office spaces will be juxtaposed among residential apartments in a place where recreational and entertainment activities will take place round-the-clock. It is also the site for one of the two integrated resorts that will be up by 2009.<br></div>
