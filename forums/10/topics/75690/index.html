            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, don't mean to start a verbal arguement here over the Chinese students studying in Singapore.  But after reading Sunday's TNP, I really found that particular chinese student revolting and it disgusted me.<br><br>But it also stirred something up. What is the Singapore Government giving foreign students so much study grants in the first place?  And they aren't even bonded to stay n work in Singapore?  What is the point when some of the foreign students, (like the above said Chinese student), wishes to just come here, have a free lunch then leave?<br><br>In anycase, what I found disgusting about that student was the way he said that he would leave Singapore the moment his studies were completed.  He would never stay in Singapore nor does he like Singapore.  IMHO, he has no honor or self respect.  Would you accept gifts from people who you do not like?  To accept such grants and in turn saying things like that is unacceptable and speaks much of that students intergrity.  Even a dog doesn't bite the hand that feeds him.  So it seems that he even below the level of a dog.<br><br>To the foreign students studying in Singapore with grants that the Singapore government has given you.  Though there are many things about various Singaporeans around you that u find uncomfortable, or dislike, don't slam all Singaporeans cos of one bad egg.  You guys are truly blessed that u recieve such benefits despite NOT CONTRIBUTING anything to this nation.  We as citizens of country, with obligations to this country, who live and die for this country, are getting about the SAME benefits as you are.  You need not serve our national service, and you are not under oath to defend this nation.  In fact, you can return to your "homeland" anytime you wish.  We are rooted here.  So at the very least, respect your hosts, and know your limitations as guest.  If you find Singapore revolting, and unacceptable, please leave.  Cancel your study grants, return the money that you owe and leave.  What you recieve as your allowances, are hard earned taxpayers money.<br><br>Some of these Chinese students claim that we descriminate against them.  What descrimination could you possible face when the Government of Singapore has already provided u with student grants similar to that of a Singapore-citizen?  These students claim that we forgotten our roots, that our ancestors too were from China.  No we have not.  But that is not as important as knowing our national identities as Singaporeans, and understanding that Singapore is where we were born, raised and where we will raise our children.   You are right if you that I do not consider myself "Chinese."  I consider myself Singaporean.<br><br>I understand that many of these foreign students are a hardworking, and polite lot.  I have nothing against them.  I just find people who come to Singapore as though we owe them a living revolting.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyah... don't take the comments of some minority seriously...<br><br>If one had read both the replies from singaporean and china, one will feel both sides r just mud slinging at each other. China says a lot of provoking things but singaporean replied back disgustingly... some even say bring back their sister and mother who r working as postitute in Geyland  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> As wat someone said before, an eye for an eye make the whole world blind  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>However I do find some of their points true. Singaporean generally r not friendly to PRC people... In fact if some singaporean r extra friendly to china people, they seems to be "despised" by singaporean themselves... I find this particularly true for the ladies here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  They seems to be particularly... not nasty... but unfriendly towards people from china. Why huh ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Is it because they feel china women r like wu ya ?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The article, obtained from the New Paper Website<br><br><blockquote>China students lash out S'pore's been good to you<br>By Dawn Chia<br><br>THIS China student wants to tell Singapore's youth to wake up, stop being so proud and stop feeding on pigswill.<br><br>And other China students studying in Singapore are apparently nodding in agreement, at least on a website forum.<br><br>'Singaporeans' brains are fed with pigswill, fat, have no intelligence, feel complacent even though they've only accomplished something small,' wrote this China student. Calling one of his Singaporean project mates 'stupid', he claimed that he could finish in a day what took that student four weeks to complete.<br><br>Is this merely teenage ranting?<br><br>Not really. The comment comes from an 18-year-old from China studying at a local polytechnic on a tuition fee grant for foreign students. He left these scathing remarks on a public forum on the sgchinese.com website.<br><br>He was one of 13 forum members who chided Singaporeans for forgetting their roots.<br><br>Others were less polite.<br><br>SLAMMING<br><br>SINGAPORE One said: '...The money for my school fees is given by their Government, and I'll be gone after I complete my studies.'<br><br>Another wrote: 'I really don't like Singapore and I really don't want to stay. No-one asked the Singapore Government to be so cheap, to pay our school fees for us to stay.<br><br>'...Rest assured that we will not stay after we complete our studies. I will not return to Singapore even if you ask me to.'<br><br>The New Paper on Sunday got in touch with the writer of the 'pigswill' posting and found him quick to stand by his views.<br><br>And he did not hesitate to lay out his demands.<br><br>No names, no pictures, and no face-to-face interviews, he specified.<br><br>He preferred to hide behind his user name on the forum - diablo3434 - and only consented to speak to us over the phone.<br><br>diablo3434 is a nickname he picked out of his love for the computer game, Diablo.<br><br>The second-year electronics student said that at first he did not have a bad impression of Singaporeans.<br><br>He has been in Singapore for two years, and recalled the first few months of his life as filled with many happy memories.<br><br>He said in Mandarin: 'When I had problems, Singaporeans were very helpful, and I liked them.<br><br>'But as I got to know them, I discovered a side of them that I didn't like.<br><br>'They look down on China and its people for no reason and I think that makes them very narrow-minded and misinformed.'<br><br>The outspoken teenager has no regrets at lashing out at his project-mate and Singaporeans on the Mar 7 Internet posting.<br><br>He said, with a hint of arrogance in his tone: 'I was frustrated when I wrote it - my project mate wasn't contributing, and was causing a delay in our group's progress.<br><br>'He was lazy and spent his time playing computer games.<br><br>'Sometimes I get angry and will say nasty things on the spur of the moment. I'm only human, like everyone else.'<br><br>He visits this particular website daily, or once a week, depending on his workload.<br><br>He doesn't think that it was wrong of him to have expressed his views - negative and blistering as they were.<br><br>The only son of two teachers, his monthly expenses are about $600 - $300 for his own expenditure and another $300 for rent.<br><br>He gets his pocket money from his parents, he said.<br><br>He lives in the East.<br><br>His criticism of Singapore and its youth have angered some Singaporean students and his classmates.<br><br>But the China student retorted: 'It's on the Internet, and people say all sorts of things on the Net.<br><br>'Even though I'm on a Singapore Government scholarship, I'm entitled to an opinion of my own.<br><br>'This is not defamatory.<br><br>'Moreover, Singaporeans hardly go to that website. It's mostly China students, and we share our views there.'<br><br>He claimed that it was the first time he had criticised Singaporeans so strongly.<br><br>The teenager, who is from the north-east region of China, heard about this forum from some friends in February.<br><br>The date accompanying this particular posting showed that he had registered his membership on Feb 20.<br><br>He was looking for a second-hand piano and went to the website to see if there was one for sale.<br><br>He found more than what he was looking for.<br><br>Besides being connected to some 40,000 members - mostly China students in Singapore - he could freely air his views on topics he is passionate about.<br><br>HELPING CHINA STUDENTS<br><br>He said he liked helping fellow China students who, like him, had faced problems such as finding their way around, or what to do if they lose their student pass.<br><br>IT programmer Patrick Li, a China national, set up the website in June 2001 to help China students cope with problems.<br><br>A few friends are helping him manage the website.<br><br>Mr Li, 26, estimates that at least 60 per cent of the 40,000 members are students from China studying in Singapore.<br><br>The rest are from Indonesia, Malaysia, Canada and even the US.<br><br>As much as the site allows members to voice their opinions freely, the webmaster stresses that strict rules apply.<br><br>He explained: 'We're very strict about monitoring content. There are about 80 moderators, including myself, who help monitor the forums. Messages which indulge in personal attacks, criticisms of any Government, or selling illegal stuff, will be taken down immediately.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Don't forget your roots<br><br>THE China teenager isn't the only one with strong views on Singaporeans.<br><br>His was the fifth response to a posting started by a forum member called Volts.<br><br>At least 95 responses were posted under the topic of Singaporeans.<br><br>Volts, who has been in Singapore for five years, criticised Singaporeans for thinking the world of themselves. He also wrote about what he felt as a scholarship student.<br><br>'When the teachers see me, they look as if I owe them something, like they are our providers and we should be grateful and slog for them willingly.'<br><br>Sean21 chided Singaporeans for forgetting that their ancestors came from the Fujian and Guangdong provinces, and also for being culturally barren.<br><br>'The TV programmes are boring and there are errors in the newspapers and magazines! Apart from 'good food', it's 'keeping a mistress', even a tree being struck by lightning can make the headlines in a newspaper...!'<br><br>The 35th posting said curtly: 'It doesn't matter to me. After all, the money for my school fees is given by their Government, and I'll be gone after I complete my studies.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>You are in my country, respect it please<br><br>UNGRATEFUL. Out of line. Uncalled for.<br><br>These are some of the responses to the China teenager's words from his Singaporean classmates.<br><br>The question they raised: Shouldn't he be more respectful of Singaporeans since he's on a tuition grant sponsored by the Singapore Government?<br><br>They spoke on the condition of anonymity as they did not want to strain their relationship with China students.<br><br>Ben, for instance, claims he couldn't sleep after he heard about the scathing Internet posting from his girlfriend on Apr 4.<br><br>He said: 'I don't really like the fast pace in Singapore but I'm still a Singaporean, and deep down, I love my country. It really bothered me and I decided to have a good talk with him about it.'<br><br>But it was in vain.<br><br>He recalled that even though the teenager agreed that he did not hate all Singaporeans, he stood by his opinion.<br><br>Ben said: 'He said it was only natural for him to have his own opinion, which I agree. But I told him he should think more before putting it into words as they could have serious repercussions.'<br><br>For Ben, the repercussions are already apparent.<br><br>The posting, and his confronting the teenager, have created a rift between him and his China-born girlfriend of more than a year.<br><br>She was unhappy that he had taken the matter so seriously.<br><br>But Ben is unwilling to back down.<br><br>He said: 'She felt that I should let it go, but I can't, and won't. I asked if she would be upset if I said such things about her country and people, and she got angry with me.<br><br>'We did not speak for four days after that.'<br><br>Another classmate also felt the remarks were unwarranted and unfounded.<br><br>The 18-year-old said: 'He's only lived here for a short while, and can't have seen much of Singapore or our way of living.<br><br>'What he's seen is only a small part, so how much does he really know?<br><br>'It doesn't seem very fair for him to be making these accusations.'<br><br>Some believe that this is an isolated case, saying that there are bound to be 'some bad apples in every basket'.<br><br>One student said that even if the teenager did not like Singapore, he should not make such an all-embracing statement, condemning its people.<br><br>He felt the posting began as a personal attack on one person, but got out of hand and became an attack on all Singaporeans.<br><br>He said: 'You don't have to like everything, but you must respect people and things you disagree with.<br><br>'Moreover, you have to respect the authorities and people who are making your tuition grant possible.'<br><br>Ben said that the more he read, the more incensed he got.<br><br>'I never expected these students to be so undiscerning, and unappreciative of what our Government has done for them,' he said grimly.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually about the project thingy... I can understand his frustrations. Different people have different standards. Some people want the project to be perfect and slog through it day and night. Some people just want to scrape through and work very little on it. In the end for group project, everyone just get the average of it, which will be seemed as unfair. This is particularly so if their project mates r not chosen by themselves but r being allocated by the teacher.<br><br>However this happens not just when China people r dealing with singaporean. In fact some singaporean r more hardworking then china people too. They should also realise tat China chinese has problem with doing project even among themselves. Project is always like tat one mah... As wat the newspaper had said, his frustration is only on a single person, but the way he wrote it makes it seems like he is dealing with the singaporean generally.<br><br>Say something bad about my country, I say something worse to yours.

I find this particularly true for the ladies here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  They seems to be particularly... not nasty... but unfriendly towards people from china. Why huh ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Is it because they feel china women r like wu ya ?<br></div></blockquote>hmm... i do not particularly shun or become exceptionally nasty to my PRC frens in uni. In fact if that really happens, it is not becos they are from China that i treat them differently. It is jus that some of them behave in an intolerable manner, as if they are the elites in school. In fact, I do have a few close PRC frens and they can be fun-loving and nice to hang out with too.<br><br>To be frank, towards these so-called "china ppl" that ppl term them as, I do admit they may be better than us in certain aspects, especially academically, becos they have put in much much more effort than we do in their studies. But, I wish to put forth my view, that many of them do not have a "life". In the sense that they enclose themselves in their own world and think that we are deliberately isolating them or wat.... Many of them do not know what leisure is, and some of them seek solace in computer games and call that their "lives".<br><br>Fortunately, my frens from China are not like that. Sadly, they also noe that their Chinese counterparts are often kiasu (can b even more kiasu than us Singaporeans at times), and often lack leisure time. Perhaps to these ppl, their "life" is probably to get first class hons and get an extremely good job or wat.<br><br>So wat if they develop IQ but not EQ right?<br><br>Anyway, straying away from this, I do notice something abt the Chinese in Singapore. Right now in the building where i am having my attachment in, a certain level is occupied by mainly Chinese nationals who are also having their attachments here and other China Chinese engineers. That level's ladies toilet is particularly dirty. haha. Sorry to say that, but that level's toilet is serviced/cleaned by the same cleaner auntie who services another level's toilet. And other levels, though occupied by many other SIngaporeans, Filipinos, Indians, etc etc, their toilets are much cleaner!<br><br>Ok. so my point is, the China Chinese in my office building, do not have basic toilet hygiene knowledge. They sh*t/urine without flushing, throw toilet paper all around, and there is definitely a stench in the toilet, god knows why. I have nothing against PRCs definitely, just that i hope those in my office building will be more "zidong" and practise good toilet manners.<br><br>haha. and those chinese nationals who cast such comments on us.. hmmm... I think they only made us not welcome them even more.. but nevertheless, i will treat my Chinese frens the same.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well to call Singaporean youths lazy and wallowing in pigswill is totally uncalled for.  Especially if he wants to take an uncooperative Singaporean project partner as an example.<br><br>First of all, not all Singaporean youth are like that.  To use the term "singaporean youth" is simply wrong.  One or two bad eggs do not represent the youth of Singapore.  In fact, I recall the Chinese have a saying for this.  I just suspect that interviewee is a media whore, simply seeking media attention with such use of words.  To put his situation more accurately with the use of words such as, ""my singaporean project partner." (who happens to represent all the youth in Singapore *ahem*), is lazy and wallows in swill."  He simply won't get as much media attention if he was to put his words more tactfully.<br><br>Secondly.  He almost sound as though his project partner is lazy because he is a Mainland chinese. Come on, get out of your own lil world.  Singaporean students in institutions EVERYWHERE have to handle uncooperative project partners like that too.  Not just Mainland CHinese students.  I've gotten my fair share of cocksters while studying, and still get them while serving NS.  He can only blame himself or ask himself why he has no ability to encourage his friend to contribute more, or refer the matter to higher school authorities.<br><br></div>

But think about this, have any of you actually "welcomed them" into your circles? I seriously doubt it for most of you anyway. Most people are what they are because of what they choose to be, and choice is also influenced by other choices. E.g. I choose to be friendly to people here, but if they do not choose to reciprocrate with me, what choice do i have?<br><br>The way people here talk to PRC people is also rude in a way, PRC scholars don't necessarily isolate themselves from you, YOU isolated them from yourselves with your preconceptions that they are too different from yourselves to bond.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Shotgun:</div><div class="quote_body">Some of these Chinese students claim that we descriminate against them.  What descrimination could you possible face when the Government of Singapore has already provided u with student grants similar to that of a Singapore-citizen?<br><br></div></blockquote>Haha! You have answered that question. The fact that these PRC scholars are brought in by the government on special packages because they have good grades is precisely what makes these PRC people different. And local people in Singapore shun things that are different from the norm, that's basis one for discrimination. I have seen it, whenever a PRC dude comes to join a local clique, they all look/regard him differently with an air of "wtf are you doing here? GO hang with your own PRC people", so how can we... no.. how can YOU PEOPLE deny that you don't discriminate against them.<br><br>I am no PRC scholar lover, I just hate discrimination, i sense it directed towards me even by locals. I get the same treatment for looking different and being of a different nationality. I have always been secular in upbringing, but the way local people do talk to me, actually makes me realise that I am different and will be segregated from YOU, not by my choice, but by YOURS.<br><br>e.g. History teacher talking about the bad stuff of the Brits, she will use words like Ang moh, which is perfectly fine with me, but she will keep provocatively looking at me saying "Are you ok with the choices of words i am using?"<br><br>Or "What are you doing here? SHouldn;t you be in a whiter country?"<br><br>Or "hey that's strange to hear a white person say that haha"<br><br>Ofcourse to be objective, not ALL of YOU are like that, just most of YOU in my experience here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> People here are narrow in outlook, even though officially it says you are multi-racial. I see segregation at Orchard, Little India, ChinaTown etc etc etc, even schools, people congregate by race.<br><br>Recently someone said to me... "you know why you don't mix around much, its because your too different... i mean its just weird".<br><br>THose were the exact words. How can a society like this possibly try to integrate into a salad bowl or a melting pot?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No. Actually they have neutral or good feelings towards Singapore <strong>BEFORE</strong> they came over. However sadly enough, quite a number of them met more black sheep than good ones in Singapore hence the misunderstandings. It's the same how some of us thought they are all bad just because of that one Chinese student whom insulted us. Plus all the stories we've been hearing about the Chinese women - they instill prejudice in us.<br><br>If some of our people finds fault with them with little reason, they don't see the reason why they can't.<br><br>If we could all treat them with proper respect, they would probably feel more welcome and not make such remarks about us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my encounter with some PRC scholars was not that friendly an encounter. however, when dealing with such issues, we have to be objective and not bring down the entire PRC community because of our few not-too-good encounters. ie. do not over-generalise.<br>comments on their dress sense or toilet manners do not do the PRC community justice, because some of them do actually have better dress sense than us S'poreans and practice good toliet manners... many of us S'poreans are guilty of not helping to maintain the toilets, often contributing to the stink and unsightlyness of the public toilets.<br>i have to say that the PRC's comments as reported in TNW was too far stretched... i does carry a certain amount of truth, but perhaps not eloquently expressed. SOME singaporeans do look down on those PRC scholars, often refering to them as inferior made in china products. in my opinion, we should take their comments with a pinch of salt...<br>those PRC scholars have done themselves a dis-service by portraying themselves as ungrateful ingrates, but we should not try to be on par with them in terms of their uncouth remarks... let them be... a rubbish dump can easily be identified by its smell, and they have revealed their true colours to us. so there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To men_@_arms:<br><br>I guess the main problem that led to the racial segregation in Singapore is the lack of proper linguistic skills. For example, in schools, the chinese learn Mandarin, the Malay learn their Malay language, and the Indians have their own variety as well. On the other hand, despite the government's emphasis on the importance of the English Language and for them having English as their first subject, not many of them are able to communicate in proper English still.<br><br>Besides that, colour obviously is another issue. I wouldn't exactly say that people are racist by nature, but it is just that we humans have a tendency to stay in "home ground", meaning, to congregate with people who are "like" us. For that, race and language similarities apply strongly. From there, the significant trend is that the chinese will start speaking in their mother tongue, and same goes for the rest of the ethnic groups. And that's when the standard of their spoken English begins its deteriorating descent.<br><br>And then we get things like the Speak Mandarin campaign, and things like Speak Good English campaign. What are they asking for, when many people are already having a hard time speaking English, proper standard English, let alone GOOD English which we would most likely hear the highly educated speak. Right, great move by the government. And ever noticed how "racist" TV Mobile is? Ever seen an Indian or Malay programme being shown often enough to be known or even at all? Nein...<br><br>I would say that the multi-racialism culture being promoted in Singapore has much potential for further success, but until the language barrier has been broken, its progress would be as good as them pushing against a brick wall.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>As for the Chinese problem, the atrocious behaviour of their government is no secret, and often enough, their peoples' as well. I doubt that our government has looked seriously into that matter of conflict between those students, but I feel that it is potentially detrimental to us, if not for them. If those students feel that they don't like being here, and while they are on a grant for that matter, then it is only appropriate for the government to send them back to whatever village they came from. Singapore is facing at least 4% unemployment rate. 4%, 4 million people, you do the math. And considering the fact that Singapore isn't a particularly country, and that it is also recognized as a developed nation, why should we sacrifice that 4% so that these ingrates can study here? Their country is not only corrupt, God knows what form of propaganda they were subjected to that they think their country is so great, despite all the evidence of their misdeeds on the contrary.<br><br>It's true that they may feel alienated by our people, but when they come here with their noses up on their foreheads, it's no surprise that our people are shunning away from them. I don't see the same thing happening to the Europeans, Australians, Burmese, Indians or Indonesians for instance. China may have been a superpower centuries ago, but somehow they have managed to keep that feeling inculcated in them, inappropriately may I add, even though they are now only a developing country (hardly though, when you think of them having only 2 or 3 big developed cities out of the rest of their land). Then they bring their pride along with them here and that's when the problem starts.<br><br>I wouldn't say that they're particularly intelligent; I would in fact look upon them as "factory-produced". The government calls for them, and up they come. They may be brilliant in Mathematics or Sciences, but ask them to explain concepts without the use of formulas and they're as confident as an elephant on a tightrope. And considering that their language evolved from pictures mind you, why would anyone, apart from them, think that their language is far superior? Especially when it comes to areas like engineering, where utmost precision of communication, not only calculation, is require, could one expect PICTURES to be able to convey precise details? No, I didn't think so.<br><br>So why, apart from economic trading, would the government want to pacify their country? And at the expense of our demographics and society's growth? I wouldn't think that it is worth it. Perhaps we should look at developing Australia further instead. It's time the Caucasians start working on being better again. I would hate to think of a Singapore with dirty toilets and a culture where people JUST HAVE TO spit everywhere they go, and converse as if they are propaganda speakers.</div>
