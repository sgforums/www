            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding the racial problems mentioned by the above poster,yes,they do exist.I should know.I'm a mixed blooder:  Portueguese,Indian and Chinese.So I have a right to say whatever I want about Chinese,Indians or ang moh's as they are my own damn people.<br><br>Simply put,to some Chinese that I met,I was an abomination of tainted blood.Imagine how that feels.Of course,that only happened once,in Singapore,by some old woman.In contrast,while you hear about racism in Sydney,and racism does exist,I have never experienced it here.<br><br>I agree the TV Mobile is highly racist.Its always Chinese programs or English programs,never a Malay or Indian program.As for the govt's Speak Mandarin program,they are promoting a language of the majority,as if we are some satellite state of China.Its all very well and good to promote a mother toungue,but to do it at the cost of others and without disregard for our multicultural heritage?<br><br>As for minorities,well,I see the bringing in of PRC scholars as an attempt by certain sections of the govt to regulate the population when obviously there is a drop in the Chinese section of the population,which will probably drop to about half in the next few generations in my opinion.Perhaps 50-60% Chinese would be a better mix.However,from what I see,the govt seems to be promoting PRC scholars who seem to be the predominant type of foreign student in our universities.thats the perception that some of us minority ppl have.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You don't get the point. The government doesn't let us learn Tamil and Malay because, for what??? Are the economies of India and Malaysia booming now like China does??? The government encourages us to learn Mandarin so strongly not because it's racist (the government is actually pro-white and anti-Chinese to a certain point, believe it or not) but because if we learn Mandarin, we could flock to China and rip off lots of money from their booming economy.<br><br>In short, the government is now promoting Mandarin like nuts for <strong>PERSONAL GAIN</strong>. If economy booms for Malaysia and India some years later, there's a good possibility that we would be encouraged to learn those two languages as well and Malay wouldn't have to stay as a 'puppet national language'!<br><br>You think the government is bowing to China's feet? Think again. It's bowing to America's feet and very possibly, just view China as a country we could rip off benefits from, otherwise just kick it off their arse, if you know any better.<br><br>As for the TV shows, I'm not quite sure. You can't say it's entirely racist. It's not totally devoid of Malay and Indian programmes, you know. Why the hell do you even think they have subtitles for?! If it's truly racist, they could always do away the subtitles in Channel 8. And yes, there are Malays and Indians whom actually watches Channel 8.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yout got a point.the economic future of Singapore lies on the Asia-Pacific,as in the whole of Asia,stretching from West Asia(including Israel and Turkey) and North Asia(yup,Russia)<br><br>Why do you think they have formed Network Indonesia,Network Indian and Network China?The 3 stated countries have potential once the current generations are past,when they eventually get their act together.<br><br>We really ought to teach at least basic Malay as a non-examinable subject to ALL students as it is a part of our heritage.We can also then tap into the economy of Malaysia and Indonesia,our two closest neighbours.In the long-term,through use of trade and economic power,perhaps after a few generations,we can assimilate them in our nation<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.<br><br>As for the above comments,Singapore is a pragmatic nation.We have a practical govt and they will do what is in Singapore's best interests.I may dislike and resent enormously some of their policies,but they do their job well,i have to admit.We will do what is in OUR best long-term interests,not that of other countries,though we will try to accomodate our neighbours no doubt.We do not bow to anyone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The future of Asia lies with China since China drives economic growth everywhere in Asia.  China is fast becoming the largest market for all kind of electronic products in the world. I have lived in China for a few years and I must say i am very impressed with the places I have been to like Shenzhen, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Dalian and Beijing. If u go there, u will be surprised by how open things already are. Luxury goods are easily available. Local people I met dare to criticise their government whenever they want to and openly. There are already lots and lots of westerners living in major chinese cities. Most of them I met say they like China very much. Myself included.  Sometimes i wonder why some of my fellow countrymen dislike china people so much. Without a doubt, China will become an economic powerhouse in the next 2 or 3 decades and not to mention the fact that China is eating our lunch, that's why we must engage them, do business with them or else we are doomed. No country on earth can afford to overlook the Chinese market. China is currently producing more engineers than America. Fortune magazine predicts that within this century, China will become the most technologically advance country in the world The mainland Chinese I have come across are smart and they will only get smarter. I fear them just as much as I respect them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The economic future of Singapore does not lie entirely in China.We must be cautious.I certainly don't want to be bowing to a hegemonic superpower.We will be partners with any nations,not tribute countries.<br><br>As for using their armed forces to prove a point,we are friends with China,but there have been suggestions by certain PRC ppl I have met with a "middle kingdom' mindset that see Singapore as a colony of China,and I will be DAMNED IFTHEY EVER SEEK TO INVADE THIS COUNTRY OF RULE IT,turning it into something like Hong Kong.Over my dead body will we ever surrender our sovereignity as Singaporeans to another nation.<br><br>Granted,these are few and far between.Most PRC ppl I have met are decent enough and I have many PRC friends,but if these ppl with the 'middle kingdom' mindset rise to power,I would definitely urge an immediate increase in defence spending,the acquisition of nuclear weaponry and an instatement of an acceptable casualty rate of 10% during NS training.<br><br>btw,how do u ppl feel about increasing training standards,so that we can match the physical and mental toughness of the israeli's or koreans,who have highly trained conscript armies?and perhaps the instatement of an acceptable casualty rate of say 6% during NS,to weed out weak elements that cannot make it.I say give more power to the PC's and OC's and if you keng,they crack down on you.it is best that you die in NS so that during war,you don't provide the weak link in the chain that protects your comrades.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree some PRC here is like 5hit. They really thot they are the expert as our local government view them as foreign talent. My big a55. Some act like a big fcuk and thier manner was like OMG...Barberian!!!! Forcing their way through a sardin packed MRT and knocking people without saying sorry. I saw a few times a youg PRC beating a elderly to a seat and sit on it like he deserve it....<br><br>My cousin actually whallop up 1 PRC man hahaha..... the PRC man told him, he (PRC) was a foreign talent whereas Singaporean is only a 2nd class citizen to him......<br><br>So hope SG government don waste taxpayer money on such monkeys...bringing them in and create trouble.</div>
