              our society is ruled by two different sets of laws – or laws applied
              selectively - for different people or political parties, it cannot but
              fracture and disintegrate. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Barely
              two weeks after he announced more space for political expression, Prime
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his colleagues from the People’s Action
              Party (PAP) could very well have just shown what this ‘openness’ mean –
              for the ruling party.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style='font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>On
              Sunday, the PAP Community Foundation organised a ‘PAP carnival’ at West
              Coast Park. This was reported by the Straits Times on its front page,
              with a big picture of PM Lee on a bicycle. The event would be nothing
              out of the ordinary if not for one small detail: outdoor events by
              political parties are banned – or at least that is what the PAP
              Government itself says. This was explained in no uncertain terms in
              Parliament last year (2007) by the Senior Minister of State for Law and
              Home Affairs, Professor Ho Peng Kee, and carried in news reports by our
              mainstream press. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style='font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The ban, said Minister Ho, is a ‘longstanding one’ because ‘</span><span style='font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>outdoor gatherings by parties have the potential to cause a public disturbance.’ (<a href="http://wpsn.wordpress.com/2007/08/28/st-28-08-2007/">Straits Times</a>).  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Ho
              explained this in his reply to questions from the Workers’ Party MPs in
              Parliament, who asked why the WP’s application to hold a cycling event
              at East Coast Park was rejected by the police. The Minister had said
              then:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><strong><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The
              East Coast Park is a recreational park for Singaporeans and their
              families. It is not meant to be used by a political party to promote
              its cause.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><strong><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Apart
              from displacing the usual recreational users…it is an open area where
              there is greater potential for breach of the peace, public disorder and
              unruly behaviour.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Minister Ho did not care even if the organisers themselves were ‘well-behaved’:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><strong><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>… even if the organisers were well behaved, others there might still cause problems.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>And to top it off, Minister Ho defended his position by saying:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><strong><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>You
              may be well-behaving, but there may be other people whom you come
              across when you cycle who may stop you, may want to debate with you and
              that may attract a crowd, and therefore will result in problems the
              police want to avoid.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>And the final nail in the coffin:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><strong><span style='font-size: 10pt; color: #1c282d; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>He
              said that police required political events to be held indoors or in
              stadiums where problems could be contained, adding that the WP could
              consider these venues. The policy applied to all political parties. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>‘The policy applied to all political parties.’</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Well, apparently not.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Having
              adopted such an unequivocal position on the issue, one wonders how
              Minister Ho would explain the police granting the People’s Action Party
              a permit to hold an outdoor event on Sunday – where <em>‘thousands thronged the park’</em> and <em>‘</em></span><em><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>a host of ministers and MPs [making] their entrance on bicycles’</span></em><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>, as reported by the Straits Times</span><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>. (One presumes that a police permit was applied for and, obviously, given.)</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>(Read also: <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2008/02/a-case-of-double-standards/">A CASE of double standards?</a>)  </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>While
              we may criticise the Government, the PAP, Minister Ho or even the
              police, for this seemingly biased application of the law, there is a
              wider and more important issue which such selective application of the
              law throws up - and this is; are we seeing a Government which would,
              apparently, disregard the law when it suits its purpose; what impact
              will this have on the wider society? On what moral authority would the
              Government be able to require everyone else to adhere to and obey the
              law if it does not do so itself?</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Sadly,
              such behaviour by the ruling party can only breed further resentment
              and cynicism not only among its dissenters but also increasingly among
              those who have supported it as well.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>As we said in an <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2008/04/toc-editorial-government%e2%80%99s-lack-of-accountability-bad-for-the-pap-worse-for-singapore/">earlier article </a>on
              the way the Government explained away the Mas Selamat escape fiasco,
              the Government’s lack of accountability is bad for the PAP but worse
              for Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>For
              if our society is ruled by two different sets of laws – or laws applied
              selectively - for different people or political parties, it cannot but
              fracture and disintegrate. The PAP would do well to remember that
              a leader whose moral authority is questionable is one whom no one
              respects. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN">Ironically,
              the slippery-slope argument which Minister Ho used to explain and
              justify his rejection of permits for other political parties, in the
              end, could result in his own PAP sliding down that slippery slope
              itself. </span></p>
