            <div class='col-md body'>boys and girls, be prepared to be multi-skilled and to take up jobs you might not be specifically trained to do. the world is changing:<br><br>Careers<br>An evolution takes root<br>Global changes pushing a large number of Singaporeans to work in jobs outside their degrees; further shifts ahead.<br>By Seah Chiang Nee, littlespeck.com<br>Jan 6, 2007<br><br>AFTER returning with a Master's in mass communications in Australia, Phyllis fretted as she shot off one job application letter after another.<br><br>She had heard horror stories about the tough market here and worried that she would be unemployed for some time. To her surprise, she landed her first job within two weeks and discovered a career trend.<br><br>Her job, however, had nothing to do with what she had expected when she first went to Melbourne six years earlier, which was journalism, advertising or public relations.<br><br>She made it as a junior executive at a beach hotel on the flourishing island of Sentosa.<br><br>What she and many Malaysians seeking jobs here have discovered in recent years is a growing disconnect between their university degrees and subsequent careers as a result of the changing global economy.<br><br>It merely follows the trend in the developed world as old businesses disappear, sometimes overnight, and new ones spring up, creating problems for graduates with an inflexible job expectation.<br><br>My friendÂ’s son who graduated in civil engineering from one of AmericaÂ’s top colleges, for example, is now teaching in a secondary school instead of working in construction.<br><br>Lawyers have become journalists or musicians and doctors are now managers. An IT graduate I befriended is a professional photographer and a few trained biologists have done well in sales.<br><br>Cases of people working in jobs unrelated to their training have become so common that interviewers have stopped asking candidates questions like: Â“Why should a trained scientist like you want to work as a junior executive with us?Â”<br><br>In the past, parents used to send their children to study accountancy, law or engineering, the so-called secure careers, and see them move single-mindedly into these professions.<br><br>A doctor was then a doctor, a biologist generally worked in the lab and a civil engineer, more often then not, would end up wearing a hard hat Â– square pegs in square holes, so to speak.<br><br>Scattered stories of graduates working outside their studies have been around for some time, but the numbers really took off around the mid or late-90s.<br><br>The reason was two-fold: the large loss of industrial jobs to countries like China and India, and new economic demands that cause some jobs to disappear and others to flourish.<br><br>People were also responding to SingaporeÂ’s own economic restructuring to move into higher technology and services that required retraining and reorganising of the labour market.<br><br>The economic downturns of Sept 11 (2001) and the SARS crisis (2003) caused large unemployment Â– and career dislocation.<br><br>In the first half of 2001, for instance, four in 10 of the 9,000 people retrenched were executives and 16,500 tertiary-educated Singaporeans were jobless by September. This resulted in professionals having to move into new unrelated work.<br><br>In the years ahead, multiple skills and career flexibility will be a fact of life as a result of further changes. Careers will blow hot and cold due to rising and falling demands.<br><br>In some years, skills like IT, construction or accountancy would be in demand; in others, especially now, it would be personal banking, healthcare or teaching.<br><br>Â“Any professional sticking to one career choice or skill stands the chance of being left behind,Â” said an executive head-hunter.<br><br>Whether working in Singapore or abroad, the ideal 21st Century graduate will be one who is anchored to one or two disciplines but who has also covered a spread of diverse elective courses.<br><br>To its credit, before the world economy changed, the government argued that economic restructuring had to begin in education.<br><br>Today, eight out of 10 Singaporean students get post-secondary education that is steadily moving into a multi-faceted approach.<br><br>Firstly, it abandoned the old exam-oriented model and adopted a large part of the American system.<br><br>The two biggest universities, National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University, now allow students to pursue courses outside their immediate fields of specialisation.<br><br>This is filtering downwards to schools. By end-2007, upper secondary students in 40 schools will be offered 40-hour courses in five polytechnics.<br><br>Â“We'll cover subjects like tourism services (accommodation, food and beverage, and tour planning), IT, Media and Design, Chemical and Life Sciences as well as Game Design,Â” an official explained.<br><br>This will move to the pre-teens with the opening of SingaporeÂ’s first Â“primary school of the futureÂ” in 2008 (with 14 more by 2015) to prepare children for a life dominated by technology and information.<br><br>Â“We want to teach children from young to be comfortable with the latest technology,Â” said a senior official.<br><br>Increasingly, students will be offered a wider range of courses and electives, allowing school dropouts to have a better crack at a meaningful job.<br><br>Some special schools are moving into non-academic studies. A case in point is North Light School where students can be seen playing games on Xbox 360 consoles during classes.<br><br>At Townsville Primary, a small supermarket has been set up, at which children take turns to work Â– giving them lessons in arithmetic and working skills.<br><br>When the two S$10bil (RM22.9bil) casino resorts open in 2010, further career shifts will likely follow. You may well find a medical practitioner working in a casino Â– and I donÂ’t mean in a clinic either.</div>
