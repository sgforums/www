              <p>CASE 1.</p>
              <p>"While a guy insist that since the man who brings home 
              more of the family income should be <strong>entitled to a bigger

              rights to children custody."</p>
              <p>what the heck....</p>
              <p>Let me make it really really simple for you.</p>
              <p>If a man earns more money. Should he take a bigger share of
              accumulated wealth. If a woman earns more money.. can she then also
              be entitled to take a bigger share of the accumlated wealth ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">While a guy insist that since the man who brings home and earn
                                      more of the family income should be entitled to a bigger share of
                                      the accumulated wealth because he contributes a bigger monetary
                                      share and since he is earning more.. he is more deserving of the
                                      rights to children custody.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">All else equal, this is correct for both sides.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #999999;">And another guy, insists that the woman does not deserve more,
                                      because she is the bigger earner..and since she is already a big
                                      earner..she does not need to help herself to more wealth from the
                                      family, and infact should contribute more to the welbeing of the
                                      child, leaving the care to the one earning less.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Earn more doesn't necessarily equate to contribution. In case 1 you specifically mentioned contribution, this is very important. Case 1 is something that have happened to quote you "</span><span style="color: #888888;">because he contributes a bigger monetary
                                      share". Case 2 is "</span><span style="color: #999999;">and infact should contribute more to the welbeing of the
                                      child, leaving the care to the one earning less</span><span style="color: #888888;">". The comparison is different.<br></span></p>
              <p>And why is maintenance redundant ? Affect men ? How does it
              affect them ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">It is not. Just make it fair. The payouts represents a liability and a decrease in disposable income which results in a reduced quality of life.</span></p>
              <p>Part of the legislature only what. You so scared for what ?</p>
              <p>You scared she take away your money ah. The most is she take
              half only what. You scared you cannot earn back ah. Please
              lorrrr......</p>

              <p>Yo, guy dun cheats a gal, he courts the gal, and
              usually, the primary objective is to get body while love is
              secondary. If he wants to court us, he has his rights, it is not
              the gal dun take his bait, to gal, it is usually looking for love
              one, and if he dun fit the bill, the gal will reject his courting,
              not to say that she dun take his bait. Unlike a gal courting an old
              man, by the look only, you and me should know what is the primary
              objective, maybe even the old man himself also acknowledge it, but
              to him is like what the hell, life is short, play hard, i take the
              body and she can take my money.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">If the girl takes the bait and gets betrayed? You cant blame the guy. Since in the previous case the old man took the bait and you blamed him for it. Guys also need support, also wants a stable home. By the look only is at best a guess. Maybe he indeed is in it for sex, there is also a possibility that he needs companionship. Anyway, you talk about love. Would you kindly define love for us? And kindly tell us what are the indicators of love.</span></p>
              <p>By nature, guy court gal, if a gal go court a guy, the motive is
              different other than Love.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Nature? More like culture. And culture is changing.</span></p>
              <p>As said earlier, men love to flirt around and as my aunty said,
              unlike women, men still look good in their middle age. As for
              female, once the body and looks is gone, god bless us, that is
              where the women's charter come into the picture. The women's
              charter is create more or less to tell our opposite gender to hold
              responsible for what they courted, promised and vowed, and not
              to simply discard female and his childrens like rubbish, use and
              throw.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Girls can be quite flirtatious too. And i believe that nobody contested the existence of the charter. Something is very wrong if your looks and body is the only thing holding the relationship. Are you saying that  a woman cant do the same? Things like abandoning the husband if his business fail? Shouldn't something also exists to tell the women to hold
              responsible for what they courted, promised and vowed, and not
              to simply discard female and his childrens like rubbish, use and
              throw?</span></p>
              <p>It is ok if you want a divorce so that you can go for your next
              young darling, but please hold your responsibility and pay
              your bills and stop victimising us. Men bad habit is they like to
              throw and beat wife once they cannot find the words to argue their
              wrongdoing.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Girls can also do whatever bad things a guy does. Please do not assume that only girls are being victimised. While beating up people is not desirable, but pls understand there there is a line that should not be crossed. Men or woman are the same. <br></span></p>
              <p>This is not only my views, I believes your house womenfolks
              would had agreed with me too. Go n hv a chat with your mom and
              sisters or even maids or yr gf or wife. In the meantime, let me
              look at females seeking personal protection from their male
              partners. Wha, so much.</p>

              take it for granted. Something created this world, be it science or

              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Assuming what you said is true, either females
              failed terribly in their job to guide them, or they are guiding them to
              the path of destruction. </span><span style="color: #3366ff;">Going by your argument, men fish and threatened the existence of sea creatures. But women are eating the fish too. History  cant be changed. It serves as a lesson.  <br></span></p>
              <p>If you do think we should compliment each others, tell me if
              this posting a compliment to us in the very first place. As i said,

              <p>Now, if the wife's source of income is her husbands income...then if the maintenance gets yanked.. or reduced.. then doesn't it also reduce the quality of life for the wife ?</p>
              <p>While the quality of life is important for a man.. is it not also as important for a woman?</p>

Its hard i know.. sometimes u just wanna rip thier face off. lol, We let other ppl rip thier faces off... but i admit, nothing is more satisfying.. then doing things urself.</p>
