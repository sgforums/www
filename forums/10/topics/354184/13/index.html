              <p>Don't say I bully small children.</p>
              <p>There are plenty of example cases online, click the following

              <p><span style="color: #888888;">May i know what do u make of the cases you mentioned in the above mentioned URL </span></p>
              <p>Don't hearsay some disgruntled man on the street or forum
              complaining with their one sided stories.</p>
              <p>Remember, you don't have to be a lawyer to read and understand
              some law issues.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Since when did i state that men are innocent? My
              stand have always been that both sides can be at fault and the charter
              tilts the odds to much in the girl's favour.Not only legally, but psychologically, and socially.<br></span></p>
              <p>The lawyers are not demi-gods.. they are merely legal
              consultants to help guide you through legal problems. Hiring one
              does not means you must be totally ignorant about the laws.</p>
              <p>Have a great day. Ok ? Good.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Lawyers are demi-gods. They are not merely
              consultants. Unless you believe that representing yourself in court is
              a good idea. Lawyers might go on to become judges. LKY is a trained
              lawyer. A good lawyer can make or break you. And the effects can be long-term.<br></span></p>

              <p><br> Funny how you compare me with my sista jojo, that is the problem
              with guys, like to compare and want to be on top of gals, this aint
              ancient india or some weird low caste countries, the women's
              charter as i stated, was passed thru male judges and policy makers,
              so if you guys are saying is not fair, go knock those male judges
              head ya.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">The link below suggest that around that time, the movement for women went into full swing. The current situation is very different.</span></p>

              <p>And the funniest part is that some of you want to hv a men's
              charter too, OMG, i laugh until my saliva dripping...please lah. U
              think the female judges is going to agree to that stupid bill.</p>
              <p>And you are right that most men dun think before they make
              decision, because sometime, instead of using the brain, they used
              their brother's 2 balls to think, that is where it goes wrong.
              Sotong man.</p>

              no lan, should be I also cannot do anything. So, dun give me the
              shit that he is threatened, i think because of his flirting habits
              the family members ignored him and let to his lost of family live
              and love, many sg Uncles have worked hard during their young times
              to bring up a family, unfortuntely, when they get old, they feel
              lost and search for some holes, and right infront is some foreign
              women who they think can bring them back to their youth life again,
              and in the end, they lost their own family love. Their
              grandchildrens and childrens cannot live to see a sex maniac
              grandfather.</span></p>
              <p>Similarly,
              if a guy cheats a girl, if she doesnt take the bait he also lan lan

              <p><br>Again, you are sidestepping our questions. Would you like to answer ahbeo's question which is "May i know what do u make of the cases you mentioned in the above mentioned URL"?</p>
              <p>In addition, how does the information in that URL add value to our discussion? If it is used to clarify certain positions, please specify the exact post. <strong>Seriously, I can't be bothered to read thru the URL, unless you explain the rationale why I should read it. You've wasted too much of our time by making broad statements and deliberately skipping specifics.</strong></p>
              <p>As for "a lawyer wannabe", may I know are you referring to yourself? I note that you dig out the Family Court Judgement URL in your post dated 14 Apr 09, 1.06pm. In your post dated 14 Apr 09, 5.04am, you said "The family court is NOT a criminal court. A family court cannot send a person to jail. Please educate yourself about the different types of court houses." You sound very much like you're trying to be a lawyer.</p>

              good.. the company benefits.. if they are bad.. they get fired. No
              arguments about that.</p>
              <p>They are paid big money because of the long working hours and
              efforts required of em. Go talk to a good lawyer.. and ye shall
              know.</p>
              <p>And sorry.. they are not demi-gods... only ignorant people
              believes that. A lucrative profession no doubt.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">I am not talking about the big bucks they make. Its the impact that they can make in people's lives. Lawyers belong to a very select class of people. I am not saying they they are able to throw lightning bolts at the people. Only politicans can do that (well i guess lawyers do help in making laws).</span></p>
              <p>Privileged yes, God like NO.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #888888;">This basically sums up the
              feminist movement that is going on around us. And from angel's
              posts, also seems to represents her views."</span></p>
              <p>And are ya sayin, that men has not been controlling women for
              thy past hundreds of generations ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Are you saying that we are living in one of the previous generations?</span></p>

              <p>jojobeach, you have also skipped a lot of ahbeo's questions in

              <p><span style="color: #888888;">I shall say again. I believe the charter should exist. But it favours the girls too much. Look around you. There is more and more chauvanism on the other side now. Men and women are both resistant to change. Thats why despite all the claims of equality and whatnots, males are still expected to bring home the bread etc. The roles have changed dramatically. Children are now sent to childcare centres. Traditional roles have changed. Some females might say that because men nowadays are useless (monetary terms). But now that women(many countries have more women than men) have entered the workforce, the supply of labour have increased which might have caused wages to fall (in real terms).<br></span></p>

              <p>No, when I say guys arguments are not in sync because of what they deem is fair.</p>
              <p>While a guy insist that since the man who brings home  more of the family income should be entitled to a bigger share of the accumulated wealth. And because he contributes a bigger monetary share .. he is more deserving of the rights to children custody.</p>
              <p>And another guy, insists that the woman does not deserve more, because she is the bigger earner..and since she is already a big earner..she does not need to help herself to more wealth from the family, and infact should contribute more to the welbeing of the child, leaving the care to the one earning less.</p>
              <p>So which is which ? Shouldn't the later also applies to the argument before ? Or vice versa ?</p>
              <p>Or apply according to which is more advantageous to men ?</p>
              <p>ADD: So what is the definition of a big earner ? Does it apply only to men ? If that is so.. isn;t that gender discrimination already ?</p>
              <p>If ye wants to argue fairness and equality.. the men needs to agree among themselves first.</p>
              <p>Protection comes at the expense of another ? I disagree. Just because you gave a woman a chopper, does not mean she will win the fight. But if you pit a bare handed woman against a man.. she is more likely to lose.</p>
              <p>I am not a legal expert,  but regards to the property as feme sole. It merely states that a woman has the same rights to her property she acquired prior to marriage, and a man cannot deprive her of that right to enjoy the property the way she did as a single woman. So , how is this unfair ?</p>
              <p>Add: if you are refering to a woman's assets becoming a shared/matrimonial assets.. I don't see any thing that prevents it from becoming so as long as he can prove that he had indeed contributed substantially to it.</p>
              <p>The judge takes into consideration the contributions.. give em some credit ya ?</p>
              <p>The links are merely to show you guys.. that you do get a fair trial. So it's really not a one sided affair. Ok ? Good</p>

                      <p> </p>
                      <p>No, when I say guys arguments are not in sync because of what
                          they deem is fair.</p>
                      <p>While a guy insist that since the man who brings home and earn
                          more of the family income should be entitled to a bigger share of
                          the accumulated wealth because he contributes a bigger monetary
                          share and since he is earning more.. he is more deserving of the
                          rights to children custody.</p>
                      <p><span style="color: #888888;">This case is fight for child. While i do not think it should be seen in a purely monetary term, money is stll an important aspect.</span></p>
                      <p>And another guy, insists that the woman does not deserve more,
                          because she is the bigger earner..and since she is already a big
                          earner..she does not need to help herself to more wealth from the
                          family, and infact should contribute more to the welbeing of the
                          child, leaving the care to the one earning less.</p>
                      <p><span style="color: #888888;">This case is about fighting for money. Who should contribute more is a private matter of the couple. But if you look at the need for the resources, the balance between need and contribution in a divorce case is pretty complex and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Earning more does not neccessarily equate to contributing more.</span></p>
                      <p>So which is which ? Shouldn't the later also applies to the
                          argument before ? Or vice versa ?</p>
                      <p>Or apply according to which is more advantageous to men ?</p>
                      <p>If ye wants to argue fairness and equality.. the men needs to
                          agree among themselves first.</p>
                      <p><span style="color: #888888;">Actually they are fighting for different things LOL. The first is more money = get child. 2nd is earn more take less from the divorce (assuming equal contribution).</span></p>
                      <p>Protection comes at the expense of another ? I disagree. Just
                          because you gave a woman a chopper, does not mean she will win the
                          fight. But if you pit a bare handed woman against a man.. she is
                          more likely to lose.</p>
                      <p><span style="color: #888888;">Eh. This argument doesnt apply here. How can u fight in a courtroom? Is the charter supposed to be a chopper? its supposed to be a shield. And if u charge at a bare-handed person with a shield....</span></p>
                      <p>I am not a legal expert,  but regards to the property as
                          feme sole. It merely states that a woman has the same rights to her
                          property she acquired prior to marriage, and a man cannot deprive
                          her of that right to enjoy the property the way she did as a single
                          woman. So , how is this unfair ?</p>
                      <p>Add: if you are refering to a woman's assets becoming a
                          shared/matrimonial assets.. I don't see any thing that prevents it
                          from becoming so as long as he can prove that he had indeed
                          contributed substantially to it.</p>
                      <p>The judge takes into consideration the contributions.. give em
                          some credit ya ?</p>
                      <p><span style="color: #888888;">Looking at this: </span></p>
                      <p><span style="color: #888888;">(c)
                          after 15th September 1961 is acquired
                          by or devolves upon a married woman,</span></p>
                       shall belong to her in all respects
                          as if she were a feme sole and may be disposed of accordingly
                      <br> 
                      Does this apply to the man? No wonder people say "what is mine is mine, what is yours is also mine"
              
                      <p>The links are merely to show you guys.. that you do get a fair
                          trail. So it's really not a one sided affair. OK ? Good.</p>
                      <p><span style="color: #888888;">I cant say the courts are unfair(later police treat me drink coffee). They must follow the written laws and regulations. I browsed through afew of the cases and i see alot of women claiming maintenance which is her right as per the charter. I have no idea in which piece of legistration is it written that men have this right.  </span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Indeed. Case 1: bigger earner = rights to kid/wealth; Case 2 : Bigger earner should contribute more. There is no discrimination here. Because you are comparing different things. Case 1 did not say the bigger earner should not contribute more, nor does case 2 say that she does not have the right to the kid/wealth. How can discrimination occur when you are comparing different things. <br></span></p>

Claim on assets is obvious everyone can claim. But maintenance? Redundant? No its not. Its not even redundant when you dont use it (in a court of law). It does not only affect us during a divorce.

              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"> </span><span style="color: #3366ff;">My understanding of it is that it means what the female owns before the marriage is hers. What she gains after the marriage is also hers. OB barrier? barrier to what? Divorce? How about what the man owns before. What he earns after? The law charts the paths that the judge can take.

              <p>Similarly, if a guy cheats a girl, if she doesnt take the bait he also lan lan right? It is not right to simply think the worst of him. Such lax prejudice.</p>

              <p>Yo, guy dun cheats a gal, he courts the gal, and usually, the primary objective is to get body while love is secondary. If he wants to court us, he has his rights, it is not the gal dun take his bait, to gal, it is usually looking for love one, and if he dun fit the bill, the gal will reject his courting, not to say that she dun take his bait. Unlike a gal courting an old man, by the look only, you and me should know what is the primary objective, maybe even the old man himself also acknowledge it, but to him is like what the hell, life is short, play hard, i take the body and she can take my money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By nature, guy court gal, if a gal go court a guy, the motive is different other than Love.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As said earlier, men love to flirt around and as my aunty said, unlike women, men still look good in their middle age. As for female, once the body and looks is gone, god bless us, that is where the women's charter come into the picture. The women's charter is create more or less to tell our opposite gender to hold responsible for what they courted, promised and vowed, and not to simply discard female and his childrens like rubbish, use and throw.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is ok if you want a divorce so that you can go for your next young darling, but please hold your responsibility and pay your bills and stop victimising us. Men bad habit is they like to throw and beat wife once they cannot find the words to argue their wrongdoing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is not only my views, I believes your house womenfolks would had agreed with me too. Go n hv a chat with your mom and sisters or even maids or yr gf or wife. In the meantime, let me look at females seeking personal protection from their male partners. Wha, so much.</p>
