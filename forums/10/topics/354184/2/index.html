              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>Divorce court is not there to look at the past and only penalise the wrong doers. They are there to facilitate your future.</p>
              <p>In the event you never get the divorces.  the Damages will have been the same as what you are experiencing later in life.</p>
              <p>In this event you are hoping to minimise the carnage to your future.  Please take note of my line one.</p>
              <p>Your original plan to retire and enjoy your wife  till you old age is now impossible.  So make a slight plan to pay her off, feed your children and live your life already.</p>
              <p>Engaging in this kind of accusation does nothing to show you being able to take on responsibilites and consequences of your actions. (You joined with this kinda woman, let her take over your business and such is your own leniency.)</p>

              <p><br> In the family, there is such a thing as trust, even if misplaced.
                  If a man thinks his wife can make better executive decisions, do
                  you think he wouldn't leave the decision-making to his wife?</p>
              <p>As I said before, he must prepare evidence of wrong-doing that
                  is culpable in a court of law. If none are present, then surely he
                  must be lying. If the husband produce sufficient evidence of wrong
                  doing, the law must be fair to the husband.</p>
              <p>If you ask me what's there to claim? If the above case is proven
                  to be true, the wife must not be able to claim alimony and can only
                  claim whatever she contributed to the family unit prior to the
                  marriage. If further evidence proves wrong-doing in a business
                  court, the wife may have to pay for damages.</p>

              <p>My dear boy, don't let these stupid and irresponsible adult male scare you into thinking the Women's charter is out to destroy men.</p>
              <p>The charter exists to reduce the number of  women who become victims of some men's irresponsible ways. Till today, there are still many women and children abandoned by men who managed to find ways to weasel out of their obligations.</p>
              <p>Protecting women and children is not discrimination.</p>
              <p>If men had not been so irresponsible, the Charter would have become redundant long time ago.</p>

              <p>The Women's Charter is to represent women who are housewives and not well educated or lose touch with present working society. Later changes were added for children of such marriages to be represented.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, responsibility cuts both ways. If the husband is deemed at fault, he must pay for the damages to the family unit and keep the remaining family unit sustainable. If the wife is at fault, she is not to request for alimony and that family finances be split equitably with what she brought in.</p>
              <p>And you, JoJoBeach is irresponsible because you just condemned people without evidence. As I said, review the evidence before prima facie judgement.</p>

              Get an experienced lawyer otherwise U may be "plucked" i know of a doctor who spent $113,000 after going thru divorce ,child custody,division of assets,protection order,etc.Todate he has taken up the case with Law Society and the latter has given this woman lawyer 3 months to substantiate her claims that her charges were.In fact I've attended the court case with this chinese physican doctor,and my goodness the lawyer has to be corrected by the judge which hand to raise when taking the oath,and this particular lawyer has to get another lawyer to assist her throughout every hearing thereby adding to more cost.On checking then I realise my doctor friend has paid $$$ for an inexperienced matrimonial lawyer.This lawyer specialises in other fields not matrimonial matter...so be careful

              <p><br> Unfortunately, Miss JoJo cannot read for nuts.</p>
              <p>I stipulated two conditions to be met for the penalty.
              First, the wife brings home less than the husband but is
              still working in her own right. Second, the wife spends less time
              than the husband with the family. Since, Miss JoJo wants to
              complain about foreign wives, then I would really like to bring up
              about the local idiotic women who could not care less about their
              families.</p>

              <p>Yes you are right, I don't read nuts.</p>
              <p>Idiotic women does exists, and how are you to decide which rules to apply for every case that comes into the court ah ?</p>
