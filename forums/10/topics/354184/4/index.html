              <p>Not actually, the wives sometimes managed to hook up with men who cannot abide with dissolution of the family unit. In such family cases, the children may still be won by the wife if the children are still quite young and cannnot choose between parents.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Actually no.</p>
              <p>Spoke to some such husbands and wifes.</p>
              <p>Usually the wives with such boyfriends or lovers got their children's custody because they actually has been caring for the children.</p>
              <p>And the men has some kinda of a mentality block about giving up children's custody.</p>
              <p>Excuses:</p>
              <p>1) Children is better with mother, because of the 'long standing tradition and idea that CHILDREN IS BETTER TO BE WITH MOTHER.'  KNS......this forum also has plenty of men who typed the above.</p>
              <p>2) Children with mother, means children can burden the wife a bit, so wife cannot do anything as rash as marrying another man, disappearing out of the country, disappear from her 'motherly duties'.</p>
              <p>And its a better representation that she is a vicious and devious woman, if she has a bf or is milking the ex husband dry by pitting the children against her.  (I quote: So the world can eventually see she is a beach.  Out to suck money by using the kids, has no morals to safeguard the children because she has another man blah blah blah.)</p>
              <p>3) Husband will work hard to maintain the kids and wife, because maintaining the wife happy then can maintain the children happy kinda logic.  (When actually its......because he dont want to have the burden of the children demanding his time.  And he can 'concentrate' on his work &amp; play.</p>
              <p>4) Knowing that the wife cannot sustain the children on her own.  making her too busy with the kids &amp; her work.  It also helps to decreases her attractiveness to other men because she is saddled with children, work and bills.</p>
              <p>5) Making the play to fight for custody of the children.  Even though he knows that the wife will eventually has the custody of the children and the assets.  To rant and let others know how 'horrible his wife is'.  </p>
              <p>Much the same as how 787180 neighbour did to the ex wife, mother in law and utlimately the child involved.  By creating hate and discrimination and attacks on his ex wife, children thru the use of others like 787180 who never experienced the pain of one such attack on 787180 family.</p>

              <p>Yes I agree. Sometimes romance is a waste of time. As there are far more better things to do, see and experience.</p>
              <p>The question will come onces you have done all you've wanted to do.. and then what next ?</p>
              <p>While a loner like yourself is one who enjoys isolation and the peace that comes with it. Most will rather seek one other so that one may feel complete.</p>
              <p>For many a times I ask.. the purpose of my existence... and everyone of us will eventually decide what one wants to leave behind when your body is but dust.</p>

              <p><br>Actually no.</p>
              <p>Spoke to some such husbands and wifes.</p>
              <p>Usually the wives with such boyfriends or lovers got their children's custody because they actually has been caring for the children.</p>
              <p>And the men has some kinda of a mentality block about giving up children's custody.</p>
              <p>Excuses:</p>
              <p>1) Children is better with mother, because of the 'long standing tradition and idea that CHILDREN IS BETTER TO BE WITH MOTHER.'  KNS......this forum also has plenty of men who typed the above.</p>
              <p>2) Children with mother, means children can burden the wife a bit, so wife cannot do anything as rash as marrying another man, disappearing out of the country, disappear from her 'motherly duties'.</p>
              <p>And its a better representation that she is a vicious and devious woman, if she has a bf or is milking the ex husband dry by pitting the children against her.  (I quote: So the world can eventually see she is a beach.  Out to suck money by using the kids, has no morals to safeguard the children because she has another man blah blah blah.)</p>
              <p>3) Husband will work hard to maintain the kids and wife, because maintaining the wife happy then can maintain the children happy kinda logic.  (When actually its......because he dont want to have the burden of the children demanding his time.  And he can 'concentrate' on his work &amp; play.</p>
              <p>4) Knowing that the wife cannot sustain the children on her own.  making her too busy with the kids &amp; her work.  It also helps to decreases her attractiveness to other men because she is saddled with children, work and bills.</p>
              <p>5) Making the play to fight for custody of the children.  Even though he knows that the wife will eventually has the custody of the children and the assets.  To rant and let others know how 'horrible his wife is'.  </p>
              <p>Much the same as how 787180 neighbour did to the ex wife, mother in law and utlimately the child involved.  By creating hate and discrimination and attacks on his ex wife, children thru the use of others like 787180 who never experienced the pain of one such attack on 787180 family.</p>

              <p>Yes I agree. Sometimes romance is a waste of time. As there are far more better things to do, see and experience.</p>

              <p>While a loner like yourself is one who enjoys isolation and the peace that comes with it. Most will rather seek one other so that one may feel complete.</p>

              <p>Do you mean to say that the lost of my ability to form meaningful relationships makes me less of a human?</p>
              <p>Being burdened with the responsibility of another inclines one to take less risk. Sometimes in life, family relationship isn't meant for certain people.</p>

              <p><br>Well, a father(a male) still has to try. If one partner in a marriage is lost, the other must provide a guiding light to the children. But for a male, there is always a tendency for things to get lost in translation.</p>
              <p>I mean all parents do wish all their children are normal and can have a meaningful relationship with someone they love and cherish.</p>
              <p>However, the lack of love does not equate to being less of a human nor does human life become any lesser. Any parent in his or her right mind will love his or her child/children regardless of their mental or physical disabilities.</p>

              <p><br>I won't say extending the charter will help but create a sustainable system of checks and balances may be a better idea. If a woman tries to gain favourbly in the divorce proceedings while acting in a duplicital manner, she has to pay back to her former husband all profits she has wrongfully gained and a penalty amount as well.</p>
