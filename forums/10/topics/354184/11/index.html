              <p><strong>Half-blind man nearly lost everything to China bride </strong><br>Sat, Apr 11, 2009<br> <br>First, she threatened to get the police to arrest him if he refused to marry her. When he finally relented, she made him sign a document willing his home and all his assets to her.</p>
              <p>Mr Liang, 62, who is blind in one eye, told a Shin Min Daily News reporter that he first met the China woman at a coffee shop near his home in 2004. His wife had passed away ten years earlier in 1994.</p>
              <p>He said that she came up to him and introduced herself as a beautician from China and said that she wanted to be his friend.<br> <br>The woman, who is 11 years younger than Mr Liang, told him that she was a divorcee, and that her ex-husband and daughter are in China.</p>
              <p>Mr Liang said that the woman was very nice to him when they first met. However, things took a drastic change three months later.</p>
              <p>"She told me that she wanted me to marry her. Should I refuse, she would report me to the police, accusing me of treating her badly and cheating her of her feelings."</p>
              <p>As he had no knowledge about the penal code, Mr Liang took the China woman's threats for real and agreed to the marriage. He also listened to her instructions, asking him to keep his children in the dark about the nuptials.</p>
              <p>"It was only at the Registry of Marriages did I realize that we needed two witnesses." Mr Liang told Shin Min, "I called my daughter, telling her I needed her as my witness, but she refused."</p>
              <p>In the end, Mr Liang managed to get a male relative and a friend of the China woman's to witness their marriage registration.</p>
              <p>It was only months later that Mr Liang's children learned of their father's marriage.</p>
              <p>Despite acceding to her request, Mr Liang found that married life was no better. His new wife refused to work, and constantly asked him for money.</p>
              <p>When his salary as a cleaner failed to satisfy his wife's needs, Mr Liang found himself asking his daughter for money.</p>
              <p>The former cleaner also blamed his new wife for his partial loss of sight. Mr Liang said that he was suffering from glaucoma and cataracts, but his condition was in check as his daughter would take him to the doctor regularly.</p>
              <p>When he remarried, his China wife assumed the responsibility, but failed to bring Mr Liang for treatment after the first time. By 2008, Mr Liang lost all sight in his right eye and was unable to work.</p>
              <p>According to a doctor's report, Mr Liang's loss of sight was attributed to the neglect of his condition.</p>
              <p>In early 2007, Mr Liang's new wife forced him to sign a document written in English. When Mr Liang indicated that he did not understand its contents, she refused to translate it for him.</p>
              <p>When he brought it to a neighbour, Mr Liang was horrified to learn that it was an agreement stating that he had willed his $300,000 three-room flat as well as his CPF and bank savings to her.</p>
              <p>However, as Mr Liang's children were aware of the agreement, the China woman did not benefit from it during the divorce proceedings.</p>

              <p>Oh my god... Kilfer... I'm starting to believe you are like in Secondary school ?</p>
              <p>That old man MARRIED the china woman.. in other words.. she is his LEGAL wife.</p>
              <p>Geesh.. you mean it's wrong for a wife to spend her husband's money ? Does your mother spends the money your dad brings home ?????  Or are you just discriminating that woman because she is from CHINA ?</p>
              <p>It would have been different if she was NOT married to that tiko old man.</p>
              <p>Angel is correct.. that man just thought he can marry a younger woman.. to get free fark and free aid during convalescence. He wouldn't be in such a bind if he had gone to Geylang.</p>
              <p>Medical damage ?? HAHAHAHAHAHH... you think the wife is a nurse or a doctor ? Please hor...you're so funny. Ignorance is such a blissful state for ya.</p>

              <p>So far.. the discussion goes all over the place.</p>
              <p>Ok . I hear ya, complaining how unfair the charter is to men.. and men do get abused.. blah blah blah.. but I have asked so many times... what kind of solid proposal do you have in mind ?</p>
              <p>OK so you want the women to pay for abuse on their men. But does that also means we make the men pay if it's their fault ? Like strip them of every thing they own and throw them in jail too ? Look. You guys can't have it one way and not the other.</p>

              <p>i dun think my discussion with you is all over the place. I answered every one of your questions point by point, didn't I?</p>
              <p>Singapore law currently has specific provisions for women in the form of the women's charter. we are only asking for the law be gender-neutral, and to treat every person equally... not "Look. You guys can't have it one way and not the other."</p>

              <p>btw, I like the way you twist the story to attempt to present yourself in a better way when I expose you for being unreasonable. just out of curiosity, do you play a lot of politics in the office?</p>

              husband and a wage-earning wife, then the husband
              should be able to get the ex-wife to compensate him for
              his contributions as a home-maker. Fair?</span></p>
              <p>2) Dude.. read the postings.. I'm not talking about just you.
              <span style="color: #0000ff;"><br> - Ok, let's go back to the post in question, which is your post
              dated 12 Apr 09, 11.45am quoted here as follows:</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So you quoted my comments in
              the beginning of that post. Paragraphs 1,2,4,5 are addressed to me.
              Paragraph 3 which is right in the middle of that post is "So far..
              the discussion goes all over the place.". And you're saying "Dude..
              read the postings.. I'm not talking about just
              you". So you are including me and other unspecified
              people in that "not talking about just you" statement, correct? If
              so, that will mean that you are accusing me of making the
              discussion go all over the place, which I am not.</span></p>
              <p>3) And twist the story ? <span style="color: #0000ff;"><br> -</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Let me tell you what I think about your
              actions... I took the effort to list down your points and
              answer each of them systematically... but you know you're being
              unreasonable... and you know you are losing the debate... so
              you're just trying to muddy the water, and distract everyone's
              attention by adding in unnecessary insults instead of answering the
              points that I have raised.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So I put it across to you again
              that yes, I think you are twisting the story to distract
               everyone. I joined this thread with the good
              intentions voicing my views that both parties in a marriage
              are equally mature adults and should therefore share equal
              responsibility for the success or failure of the marriage. However,
              you are twisting what I said for your own agenda.</span></p>
              <p>4) Pardon moi, if you havn't noticed.. the blame game wasn't
              started by me. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><br> - first, I state my view that I am not involved in any blame
              game. now the question is... are you involved in the blame
              game?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
