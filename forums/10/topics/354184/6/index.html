              <p>Thank you for your concern Mr.787180.</p>
              <p>Just making sure I don't marry a vile man like you. Don't want to have to rely on the Woman's charter to protect me and my babies rights.. would be an unfortunate failure on my part.</p>
              <p>Send my regards to your equally vile wife. May both of you live a long and lasting marriage together.</p>

              <p>Ahbeo, Have you read through the Woman's charter yet ? Tell me,
                  which part of the charter do you think needs to change, and change
                  to what ?</p>
              <p>If you have not even read through the charter yet, how can you
                  claim that is unfair ?</p>
              <p>Like I said, everyone who goes into the court will claim
                  innocent and the other party at a bigger fault. SO ALWAYS listen to
                  two side of the coin first.</p>
              <p>It is not just Singapore court that usually wards the child care
                  to the mother, even the western courts do the same. WHY ? </p>
              <p>Just because the father knows how to change a diaper and push a
                  stroller, does not means he is doing a better job than the
                  mother.</p>
              <p>Raising children are not as simple as you think.</p>
              <p>Fathers are not hard wired to multi task in a child care
                  situation..and are typically not as sensitive to the children's
                  emotional needs as the mother.</p>
              <p>Fathers do not have mother's instinct. That is a hard fact.</p>
              <p>As we human beings begins our defiant role against what nature
                  has decided for us, are we doing a better job ? I'm not convinced.

              <p>To ascertain the effects of that charter, you would probably need a lawyer, a psychiatrist and a sociologist. It does not only have legal implications. It affects the actions of people and wider sociological issues. I did not say change the charter, i said it might be a good idea to extend it so that both parties are protected.</p>

              <p>Nowadays, with the maid/childcare centres playing a much more prominent role in the upbringing of a child, the idea that the wife is doing all the work is debatable. And if you talk about a housewife, clearly the man, working to bring home the bread, provides a roof over the head, light for the child to read in, his role is unappreciated.</p>

              <p>So your main concern are all monetary related. And according to what is written, it does not say the judge MUST award maintenance. The words are clear in that it gives the judge flexibility to award based on many considerations.</p>
              <p>May I also remind you that maid and child care centers does not replace the role of a parent. They are merely there to support the role of busy working parents.</p>
              <p>Infact, any parent who leaves 100% child care to a outsider/third party , is guilty of neglect.</p>
              <p>Even the selection of the type of maids and child care institutions require much due diligence from the parent.</p>
              <p>To a man, a maid is a maid.. a child care is a child care center.</p>
              <p>To a woman, a maid is the extension of herself and needs to meet her standard of requirements, and a child care center needs to be clean, safe, teachers must be very involved..,etc.</p>
              <p>When it comes to providing services to a family, the WIFE is the harder customer to please. Because she usually have higher standards of requirements than the hushand. And that's already part of her nature.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #888888;">I give examples that i think applies to this thread. What else do you expect the parties in a divorce to fight for other than money and custody? the cockroach in the kitchen? Having many considerations is one thing but it is stated by law that it is something you can fight for. That in itself is a very big advantage that can be exploited.</span></p>
              <p>May I also remind you that maid and child care centers does not
              replace the role of a parent. They are merely there to support the

              <p>Even the selection of the type of maids and child care

              <p>To a man, a maid is a maid.. a child care is a child care
              center.</p>
              <p>To a woman, a maid is the extension of herself and needs to meet
              her standard of requirements, and a child care center needs to be
              clean, safe, teachers must be very involved..,etc.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Maybe i did not make myself clear, my point is that the modern child spends more time in a childcare center or with a maid, the parents plays less of a role. So to the view that mothers are spending as much time with the child might need some revision.</span></p>
              <p>When it comes to providing services to a family, the WIFE is the
              harder customer to please. Because she usually have higher
              standards of requirements than the hushand. And that's already part
              of her nature.</p>
              <p>Let me ask you, when you have a child, and you need one of your
              parent to care for your child,  which will you prefer ? Your
              mother or father ? When you make a preference, arn't you in effect
              exercising discrimination ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Providing services to the family? There are some very dedicated mothers and fathers around. There are also many fathers who simply bring home the bread, as well as mothers who cant/dont cook, maid does the housework, take the child to school etc.  When i have a child, i would prefer both to play a prominent role in my child's upbringing. No preference. Because I do not want my child to have no impression of his/her grandparents. I want him/her to have a solid family experience. (sadly my dad passed away so thats not really possible).</span></p>
              <p> On Part XI, what's there to change ? Is it not the purpose
              of the charter to protect women and girls ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Why must it change? It doesnt need to. Of cos i am not very supportive of the statutory rape regulations when both parties are in consent. Since it only punished one party when both parties knowingly did that act. </span></p>
              <p>And when you say extend.. can you be more specific ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Simply means the recognition than men are also vulnerable to abuse and level the playing field by extending the protection afforded to women to men. You know, women can beat up men too. There are such cases.  As in gender should not have an influence in the verdict. </span><span style="color: #888888;">The parties should be judged based on their actions and circumstances.</span></p>

              <p>So what do you suggest ? Remove that maintenance part altogether ?</p>
              <p>Why are you guys so afraid of the ability of your wife to "claim". Claiming doesn't do anything.. it's the JUDGE who AWARDS. You should be afraid of the JUDGE.. not your wife claiming your balls.</p>
              <p>Why do you equate the amount of time spent with the children as QUALITY parenting ? It's not how much time you take to do your job.. it's HOW you get the job done.</p>
              <p>So a woman who cannot cook and do house chores is a bad wife ???</p>
              <p>And a man who cannot bring home the bread is also a bad husband ?????</p>
              <p>Then like that TS is a bad husband lor ????? Then the TS wife is a bad wife lah.. then like that how you think the judge will award the dispute ??? Both of them are just as bad. (chuckle).</p>
              <p>Ofcors, in a desirable situation.. you would have both your parents take care of your child. But in a divorce situation.. the judge needs to make a CHOICE. The child cannot be SPLIT in HALF and awarded accordingly to EACH parent.</p>
              <p>There will ALWAYS be a preference.. or you guys like to call it discrimination.. because it's not about fairness when it comes to child custody.. it's about WHO IS BETTER at getting the job done.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Why must it change? It doesnt need
                                                  to. Of cos i am not very supportive of the statutory rape
                                                  regulations when both parties are in consent. Since it only
                                                  punished one party when both parties knowingly did that
                                                  act.</span></p>
              <p>My dear friend.. a man can always claim the girl gave him the consent even though he raped her. There are usually NO witness when such act are perpetuated.</p>
              <p>My suggestion to you.. is DON'T GO THERE.</p>
              <p>Who do you punish, example... a thief who goes into a store with very lax security serveilance... or the owner of the shop who does not take due diligence to protect his store ?</p>
              <p>Ofcors I can hear you screaming "not fair".. but as long as our culture emphasise on the virtue of virginity... it will remain so.</p>
              <p>And some laws like this statutory rape between two minors is part of a social conditioning framework. Ofcors I hear you screaming unfair again.. but like I said.. the purpose is to tell you " DON"T GO THERE".</p>

              <p>Yes, I agree, men can be vulnerable to spousal abuse. And if the husband can proof that the wife is violent in nature.. it will affect the judgement in favor of the husband.</p>
              <p>When it comes to child custody.. a judge will not award to the violent party. The behavioral considerations does affect the equity part of the divorce.</p>
              <p>But monetary and asset division has nothing to do with behaviors of each party. It has to do with the contribution of each party .</p>
              <p>Try not to roll everything into one big conclusion , Ok ? Good.</p>

              <p>To ascertain the effects of that charter, you would probably
                      need a lawyer, a psychiatrist and a sociologist. It does not only
                      have legal implications. It affects the actions of people and wider
                      sociological issues. I did not say change the charter, i said it
                      might be a good idea to extend it so that both parties are
                      protected.</p>
              <p>With references to the thread would be section 69), 113),
                      114).  Probably can read the Part XI too.</p>

              <p>Nowadays, with the maid/childcare centres playing a much more
                      prominent role in the upbringing of a child, the idea that the wife
                      is doing all the work is debatable. And if you talk about a
                      housewife, clearly the man, working to bring home the bread,
                      provides a roof over the head, light for the child to read in, his
                      role is unappreciated.</p>

              <p>I also believe that the charter is not doing enough.</p>
              <p>It should also include a chapter about abortion.</p>
              <p>That the father of the embryo should also be accountable for his aborted baby.</p>
              <p>Made to pay for the medical cost and go for mandatory counselling or face jail term.</p>
              <p>I've seen so many women go to the abortion clinics alone.. and have to pay for the extraction costs.. and I wonder.. where's the man who made her pregnant in the first place ??</p>
              <p>So many painful cases I see..young girls walking away from the clinic crying.. after getting dumped by her boyfriend who refuses to acknowledge the baby was his....</p>
              <p>With current DNA technology.. it is possible to determine the paternity of the father. We should put that to good use.</p>
              <p>While the woman has to endure the invasive extraction and emotional damage..the man should be put behind bars.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #888888;">erm i am getting abit sick of repeating the same thing. I do not question the existence of it. I am of the opinion that it is biased thats all.</span></p>
              <p>Why are you guys so afraid of the ability of your wife to
                                                  "claim". Claiming doesn't do anything.. it's the JUDGE who AWARDS.
                                                  You should be afraid of the JUDGE.. not your wife claiming your
                                                  balls.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Guns dont kill people, people<span style="color: #c0c0c0;"> kill people. Please take into consideration that whilst it is the judge awards the claim, the existence of the possibility of the claim is in itself a massive advantage. The case is against your ex-spouse. In essence it is a your interests vs his/her interests.</span></span><span style="color: #c0c0c0;"> Of cos everybody is afraid of having to give out payoffs. It directly affects your quality of life.</span></p>
              <p>Why do you equate the amount of time spent with the children as
                                                  QUALITY parenting ? It's not how much time you take to do your
                                                  job.. it's HOW you get the job done.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Time spent with the family is an important indicator of the quality of parenting. Quite frankly, IMO, spending 15 mins per day of top quality time with the kids is not what i would call a good parent.</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0;"> Of cos this is subjective.</span></p>
              <p>So a woman who cannot cook and do house chores is a bad wife
                                                  ???</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">No. It is to illustrate the role women plays in the family have changed. They play a less prominent role in taking care of the household. </span></p>
              <p>And a man who cannot bring home the bread is also a bad husband
                                                  ?????</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">I guess the conventional thinking is yes. But that is not my point. My point is that i am acknowledging that there are men who simply brings home the bread and does little else for the family.</span></p>
              <p>Then like that TS is a bad husband lor ????? Then the TS wife is
                                                  a bad wife lah.. then like that how you think the judge will award
                                                  the dispute ??? Both of them are just as bad. (chuckle).</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">I will not comment on this since 1) i am not a judge (This is actually a silly argument cos while ppl like to say "who are you to judge me", actually we are all judging people all our lives both consciously and subconciously), 2) i did not hear his wife's side of the story, 3) There is not enough details in his description.</span></p>
              <p>Ofcors, in a desirable situation.. you would have both your
                                                  parents take care of your child. But in a divorce situation.. the
                                                  judge needs to make a CHOICE. The child cannot be SPLIT in HALF and
                                                  awarded accordingly to EACH parent.</p>
              <p>There will ALWAYS be a preference.. or you guys like to call it
                                                  discrimination.. because it's not about fairness when it comes to
                                                  child custody.. it's about WHO IS BETTER at getting the job
                                                  done.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">And some divine power stated that women by default should be the prefered party PROBABLY due to age old social systems where </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">1)  In ancient times, men go hunting girls make the home</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">2) In medieval times, men go farm/work, takes care of the home</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">so by default women is prefered because they have a few millenium headstart?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">(note the probably because like i said in a previous post, such decisions shld not take gender into consideration but by virtue)</span></p>

                                                  screaming unfair again.. but like I said.. the purpose is to tell
                                                  you " DON"T GO THERE".</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;"> Similarly, the girl can cry rape even if she agreed to the act. I believe the question is on statutory rape. Not rape. Statutory rape means the act is agreed by both parties and yet only the guy is punished for it or at the very least, take a heaver punishment. Come on, both of them consented to it knowing the full consequences. Both are equally responsible.</span></p>
              <p>Yes, I agree, men can be vulnerable to spousal abuse. And if the
                                                  husband can proof that the wife is violent in nature.. it will
                                                  affect the judgement in favor of the husband.</p>
              <p>When it comes to child custody.. a judge will not award to the
                                                  violent party. The behavioral considerations does affect the equity
                                                  part of the divorce.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">This much i agree. But having to proof something might not be that easy. As compared to something that is a SOP consideration.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But monetary and asset division has nothing to do with behaviors
                                                  of each party. It has to do with the contribution of each party
                                                  .</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Yes, but the maintenance is another issue altogether. I dont exactly know how it works but looking at 114C, I wonder what would happen if a woman said i am accustomed to this, i am accustomed to that etc etc.</span></p>
              <p>Try not to roll everything into one big conclusion , Ok ?
                                                  Good.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">When i did give a conclusion? The only conclusion that i gave is that virtue should be the sole consideration in such cases.</span></p>

              <p>I also believe that the charter is not doing enough.</p>
              <p>It should also include a chapter about abortion.</p>
              <p>That the father of the embryo should also be accountable for his
                      aborted baby.</p>
              <p>Made to pay for the medical cost and go for mandatory
                      counselling or face jail term.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Medical cost part I agree, counselling probably wont be of much use, jail probably not. That would be like a permanent criminal record for not using contraceptives.<br>(eh i know contraceptives are not 100% but well its the best alternative to absistence, or ban pre-marital sex?) xD<br></span></p>
              <p>I've seen so many women go to the abortion clinics alone.. and
                      have to pay for the extraction costs.. and I wonder.. where's the
                      man who made her pregnant in the first place ??</p>
              <p>So many painful cases I see..young girls walking away from the
                      clinic crying.. after getting dumped by her boyfriend who refuses
                      to acknowledge the baby was his....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Just wondering, are you a nurse? a doctor? a clinical worker? or your circle of friends have really active hormones and are careless.</span></p>
              <p>With current DNA technology.. it is possible to determine the
                      paternity of the father. We should put that to good use.</p>
              <p>While the woman has to endure the invasive extraction and
                      emotional damage..the man should be put behind bars.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">There are also risks involved in the abortion process. I sympathise with the ladies. This is a tricky issue. because it is not a rape, it becomes an intercourse between 2 consenting adults, which assumes that the parties knows what they are doing and the consequences of it. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">From what i see in the charter, the protections in the charter assumed one thing, that the females do not want that event to happen to them. In this case, how do we explain? The woman do not want to have sex or do not want to get pregnant? Probably is want to have sex dont want to get pregnant and in the case where i get pregnant dont want to get dumped. In this case it is contradicting with the previous paragraph in that the woman rationally made the choice and accepted the risks associated with it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">hmmmz tricky indeed. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">*edit*</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">On second thought, a jail term for abandonment of a child probably exists. But a fetus? its not a legal entity yet.  (assuming that all other factors are normal like the parties dont sleep around etc etc.) complex complex</span></p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>So what do you suggest ? Remove that maintenance part altogether
                                          ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">erm i am getting abit sick of
                                          repeating the same thing. I do not question the existence of it. I
                                          am of the opinion that it is biased thats all.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Well, you're being vague about your expectations in the first place.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Infact.. I do agree that claiming part is rather redundant. I'd rather the court just AWARD base on whatever considerations the case presents.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">It doesn't matter if it's 10%, 50%, 100% or 200%</span>.<span style="color: #ff00ff;"> Just leave it to the judge to decide.</span></p>
              <p>Why are you guys so afraid of the ability of your wife to
                                          "claim". Claiming doesn't do anything.. it's the JUDGE who AWARDS.
                                          You should be afraid of the JUDGE.. not your wife claiming your
                                          balls.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Guns dont kill people, people
                                          <span style="color: #c0c0c0;">kill people. Please take into
                                          consideration that whilst it is the judge awards the claim, the
                                          existence of the possibility of the claim is in itself a massive
                                          advantage. The case is against your ex-spouse. In essence it is a
                                          your interests vs his/her interests.</span></span> <span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Of cos everybody is afraid of having to give out
                                          payoffs. It directly affects your quality of life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Ofcors it affects your quality of life, are you suggesting that only the man's quality of life post divorce is utmost important while the wife and children's should be cast to oblivion ? </span></p>
              <p>Why do you equate the amount of time spent with the children as
                                          QUALITY parenting ? It's not how much time you take to do your
                                          job.. it's HOW you get the job done.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Time spent with the family is an
                                          important indicator of the quality of parenting. Quite frankly,
                                          IMO, spending 15 mins per day of top quality time with the kids is
                                          not what i would call a good parent.</span> <span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Of cos this is subjective.</span></p>
              <p>So a woman who cannot cook and do house chores is a bad wife
                                          ???</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">No. It is to illustrate the role
                                          women plays in the family have changed. They play a less prominent
                                          role in taking care of the household.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Less prominent role ? So you're saying as long as she no longer gets her hands dirty with cleaning agents and washing poopy diapers.. her importance has effectively been diminished ? Not so my dear. If doing house chores is a means of establishing prominence, then why are we still paying meagre wages to our maids ? Shouldn't the maid too deserves a cut of the family wealth during a divorce ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">The determinant here is the amount of EFFORT each contributes in establishing the well being of the family and accumulation of family wealth , that is what truly matters.</span></p>
              <p>And a man who cannot bring home the bread is also a bad husband
                                          ?????</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">I guess the conventional thinking
                                          is yes. But that is not my point. My point is that i am
                                          acknowledging that there are men who simply brings home the bread
                                          and does little else for the family.</span></p>
              <p>Then like that TS is a bad husband lor ????? Then the TS wife is
                                          a bad wife lah.. then like that how you think the judge will award
                                          the dispute ??? Both of them are just as bad. (chuckle).</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">I will not comment on this since
                                          1) i am not a judge (This is actually a silly argument cos while
                                          ppl like to say "who are you to judge me", actually we are all
                                          judging people all our lives both consciously and subconciously),
                                          2) i did not hear his wife's side of the story, 3) There is not
                                          enough details in his description.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Agree.</span></p>
              <p>Ofcors, in a desirable situation.. you would have both your
                                          parents take care of your child. But in a divorce situation.. the
                                          judge needs to make a CHOICE. The child cannot be SPLIT in HALF and
                                          awarded accordingly to EACH parent.</p>
              <p>There will ALWAYS be a preference.. or you guys like to call it
                                          discrimination.. because it's not about fairness when it comes to
                                          child custody.. it's about WHO IS BETTER at getting the job
                                          done.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">And some divine power stated that
                                          women by default should be the prefered party PROBABLY due to age
                                          old social systems where</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">1)  In ancient times, men go
                                          hunting girls make the home</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">2) In medieval times, men go
                                          farm/work, takes care of the home</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">so by default women is prefered
                                          because they have a few millenium headstart?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">(note the probably because like i
                                          said in a previous post, such decisions shld not take gender into
                                          consideration but by virtue)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Well, lets put it this way.. GOD didn't make men and women equal. Not physically, not emotionally nor psychologically. </span></p>
              <p> y dear friend.. a man can always claim the girl gave him the
                                          consent even though he raped her. There are usually NO witness when
                                          such act are perpetuated.</p>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>My suggestion to you.. is DON'T GO THERE.</p>
              <p>Who do you punish, example... a thief who goes into a store with
                                          very lax security serveilance... or the owner of the shop who does
                                          not take due diligence to protect his store ?</p>
              <p>Ofcors I can hear you screaming "not fair".. but as long as our
                                          culture emphasise on the virtue of virginity... it will remain
                                          so.</p>
              <p>And some laws like this statutory rape between two minors is
                                          part of a social conditioning framework. Ofcors I hear you
                                          screaming unfair again.. but like I said.. the purpose is to tell
                                          you " DON"T GO THERE".</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;"> Similarly, the girl can cry
                                          rape even if she agreed to the act. I believe the question is on
                                          statutory rape. Not rape. Statutory rape means the act is agreed by
                                          both parties and yet only the guy is punished for it or at the very
                                          least, take a heaver punishment. Come on, both of them consented to
                                          it knowing the full consequences. Both are equally
                                          responsible.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Social conditioning.. heard of that ? The idea is to deter. As long as you don;t do it.. you don;t have to worry. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Like porn.. , many can argue it is an unfair act against freedom of choice. But the fundamental reason is not about fairness. it is about deterrence.</span></p>
              <p>Yes, I agree, men can be vulnerable to spousal abuse. And if the
                                          husband can proof that the wife is violent in nature.. it will
                                          affect the judgement in favor of the husband.</p>
              <p>When it comes to child custody.. a judge will not award to the
                                          violent party. The behavioral considerations does affect the equity
                                          part of the divorce.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">This much i agree. But having to
                                          proof something might not be that easy. As compared to something
                                          that is a SOP consideration.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">How is this difficult to proof? Abuses can be reported and documented. Ofcors if you are merely crying wolf.. then it is very difficult to prove lah.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But monetary and asset division
                                          has nothing to do with behaviors of each party. It has to do with
                                          the contribution of each party .</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Yes, but the maintenance is
                                          another issue altogether. I dont exactly know how it works but
                                          looking at 114C, I wonder what would happen if a woman said i am
                                          accustomed to this, i am accustomed to that etc etc.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">She is required to back up her claims.</span></p>
              <p>Try not to roll everything into one big conclusion , Ok ?
                                          Good.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">When i did give a conclusion? The
                                          only conclusion that i gave is that virtue should be the sole
                                          consideration in such cases.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Virtue ? If both party got virtue.. they wouldn't be in such a bind :P </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Lets just say.. try to stay married.. as long as you can. A divorce only means everyone gets to lose.</span></p>

              <p>I also believe that the charter is not doing enough.</p>
              <p>It should also include a chapter about abortion.</p>
              <p>That the father of the embryo should also be accountable for his
                                          aborted baby.</p>
              <p>Made to pay for the medical cost and go for mandatory
                                          counselling or face jail term.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Medical cost part I agree,
                                          counselling probably wont be of much use, jail probably not. That
                                          would be like a permanent criminal record for not using
                                          contraceptives.<br> (eh i know contraceptives are not 100% but well its the best
                                          alternative to absistence, or ban pre-marital sex?)
                                          xD</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">So you think by throwing money at the problem it should just go away ? Wow. Such non-chalant attitude.. tsk tsk. And who do you think would be paying for it ? Not likely the young man.. it's probably his parents who has to pay the fine. </span></p>
              <p>I've seen so many women go to the abortion clinics alone.. and
                                          have to pay for the extraction costs.. and I wonder.. where's the
                                          man who made her pregnant in the first place ??</p>
              <p>So many painful cases I see..young girls walking away from the
                                          clinic crying.. after getting dumped by her boyfriend who refuses
                                          to acknowledge the baby was his....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Just wondering, are you a nurse? a
                                          doctor? a clinical worker? or your circle of friends have really
                                          active hormones and are careless.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">I</span><span style="color: #ff00ff;">t doesn;t take a medical worker to see the heartaches playing out in family planning clinics across the nations. Lets say I do have personal friends whom are involved in such organizations</span>.</p>
              <p>With current DNA technology.. it is possible to determine the
                                          paternity of the father. We should put that to good use.</p>
              <p>While the woman has to endure the invasive extraction and
                                          emotional damage..the man should be put behind bars.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">There are also risks involved in
                                          the abortion process. I sympathise with the ladies. This is a
                                          tricky issue. because it is not a rape, it becomes an intercourse
                                          between 2 consenting adults, which assumes that the parties knows
                                          what they are doing and the consequences of it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">From what i see in the charter,
                                          the protections in the charter assumed one thing, that the females
                                          do not want that event to happen to them. In this case, how do we
                                          explain? The woman do not want to have sex or do not want to get
                                          pregnant? Probably is want to have sex dont want to get pregnant
                                          and in the case where i get pregnant dont want to get dumped. In
                                          this case it is contradicting with the previous paragraph in that
                                          the woman rationally made the choice and accepted the risks
                                          associated with it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">hmmmz tricky indeed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">*edit*</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">On second thought, a jail term for
                                          abandonment of a child probably exists. But a fetus? its not a
                                          legal entity yet.  (assuming that all other factors are normal
                                          like the parties dont sleep around etc etc.) complex
                                          complex</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">While I agree.. that women who puts themselves in such situations are partly to be blamed.. and so they pay the price with the shame, emotional and physical pain to kill an innocent life. Yet, the male party.. goes around like nothing has happened. While it is an easy option for a male to say " I don;t want this baby.. just abort it".. is that fair ?<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">A person is a person, no matter how small- Dr Suess.</span></p>

              <p>harlow... as long as there's still men like bcloud23 and 787180 around.. the women's charter is here to stay.</p>
              <p> With the vietnamese bride issue.. I'm glad the womans' charter is already in place. At least they get some form of protection from disgusting SG men.</p>
              <p>They're being treated like cattle , sold like pigs.. just to leave their poverty striken family in Vietnam.</p>
              <p>DO you really think they are here to look for LOVE ? Get real ok ? Right now.. the only way for them to stay out of Vietnam is to get married to a foreign man.</p>
              <p>If our government relaxed the immigration rules and give them girls a PR and a job now.. I can betcha , not many of them would want to marry our disgusting SG MEN.</p>
