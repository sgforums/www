              The chinese doctor was too naive to spent so much..just because this lady lawyer happens to come from same club and consistentlly assuring him of good professional service.
              
              She will open a new file and asked for $5000 deposit for each segment-child custody,maintenance,police protection,etc.The lawyer will then balantly forget to offset against previous deposits but continue to insist for &gt; $5000 deposits.She will not issue receipts despite constant reminder from this doctor.
              
              The doctor will drive his car to fetch the lawyer to Court and yet she charged him taxi fare all the time.
              
              She even used the doctor's condominium rent free 8 months for her so called client friend and refused to move out-mixing biz with pte affairs.
              
              On my advice after all the divorce he has made finally file complaint to Law Society to expose this unscrupulous lawyer

              <p>my mother was the opposite of your wife,she worked very hard....worked herself to cancer</p>
              <p>when i was a little boy i remebered her..going to work frm 9-11pm</p>
              <p>anyway i am 18 this yr and my mother passed away last yr leaving a property to her trustee,my aunties which had been caring for me a long time</p>
              <p>For a man to spend $113,000 to fight a divorce case, his intentions are clearly to want to destroy the other party.- jojobeach</p>
              <p>yup this i understand,after my mother death my father took my aunts to court as he wanted SOLE custody of us...its not us tat he wanted.its the new semi detached hse kept in tip toe conditions he wanted</p>
              <p>intially the case too very unfavourable to ourside</p>
              <p>but in the end we won,beat the crap out of him</p>
              <p>i even thanked his stupid old lawyer but his is so rude,not even a simple greeting frm him</p>
              <p>the court is fair to everything</p>
              <p>my father 80 yrs old still need to go some parenting course</p>
              <p>this is fairness at its best and finest</p>

              <p>anyway i am 18 this yr and my mother passed away last yr leaving
              a property to her trustee,my aunties which had been caring for me a
              long time</p>
              <p>For a man to spend $113,000 to fight a divorce case, his
              intentions are clearly to want to destroy the other party.-
              jojobeach</p>
              <p>yup this i understand,after my mother death my father took my
              aunts to court as he wanted SOLE custody of us...its not us tat he
              wanted.its the new semi detached hse kept in tip toe conditions he
              wanted</p>
              <p>intially the case too very unfavourable to ourside</p>
              <p>but in the end we won,beat the crap out of him</p>
              <p>i even thanked his stupid old lawyer but his is so rude,not
              even a simple greeting frm him</p>
              <p>the court is fair to everything</p>
              <p>my father 80 yrs old still need to go some parenting course</p>
              <p>this is fairness at its best and finest</p>

              <p>Yes, unfortunately.. the money goes where the children goes.</p>
              <p>That is the problem. Many men who fought for the custody are not concern with the children.. with the money.. they always believe a stepmom will solve the child care needs.</p>

              <p>Not actually, the wives sometimes managed to hook up with men who cannot abide with dissolution of the family unit. In such family cases, the children may still be won by the wife if the children are still quite young and cannnot choose between parents.</p>

              <p>LKY ? No thank you.</p>
              <p>I believe LKY is traumatised by the arrival of his first grandson. Bless that kid.</p>
              <p>Intelligence can be acquired after birth.. and not entirely inherited through genetics.</p>
              <p>If you give a baby from a stupid mom to be raised by a brilliant mom.. the child will acquire the knowledge of the brilliant mom through her teachings.</p>
              <p>However.. if you give the child of a brilliant parents to a stupid couple , then it is likely the child will face a lot of disadvantage in life.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately.. LKY equates having a degree with being smart... sadly.. it is not so.</p>
