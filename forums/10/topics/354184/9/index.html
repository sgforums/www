              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Well, you're being vague about
                          your expectations in the first place.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Infact.. I do agree that claiming
                          part is rather redundant. I'd rather the court just AWARD base on
                          whatever considerations the case presents.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">It doesn't matter if it's 10%,
                          50%, 100% or 200%</span>. <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Just leave
                          it to the judge to decide.<br><br><span style="color: #888888;">The point is it is written in black and white, as such becomes a default consideration in favour of the girls. </span><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Ofcors it affects your quality of
                          life, are you suggesting that only the man's quality of life post
                          divorce is utmost important while the wife and children's should be
                          cast to oblivion ?<span style="color: #888888;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">I have been saying that it should not be a default consideration in favour of the girls. It should be more level. I did not suggest the annulment of anything.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Less prominent role ? So you're
                          saying as long as she no longer gets her hands dirty with cleaning
                          agents and washing poopy diapers.. her importance has effectively
                          been diminished ? Not so my dear. If doing house chores is a means
                          of establishing prominence, then why are we still paying meagre
                          wages to our maids ? Shouldn't the maid too deserves a cut of the
                          family wealth during a divorce ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">The determinant here is the amount
                          of EFFORT each contributes in establishing the well being of the
                          family and accumulation of family wealth , that is what truly
                          matters.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">No. I am stating the fact that they in general do indeed play less of the role of a traditional wife. I did not say that she is NOT IMPORTANT. Being a full-time wife as per tradition would probably mean she spends more time in the house which probably suggests more personal bonding time with the kids. I am not saying it is right or wrong or anything, simply the effects of it. The maid does not get anything because she is not under the law nor socially perceived as a part of the family. She is in essence a paid employee.</span></p>
              <p>Then like that TS is a bad husband lor ????? Then the TS wife is
                          a bad wife lah.. then like that how you think the judge will award
                          the dispute ??? Both of them are just as bad. (chuckle).</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">No comment as per below.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">I will not comment on this since
                          1) i am not a judge (This is actually a silly argument cos while
                          ppl like to say "who are you to judge me", actually we are all
                          judging people all our lives both consciously and subconciously),
                          2) i did not hear his wife's side of the story, 3) There is not
                          enough details in his description.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Agree.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Well, lets put it this way.. GOD
                          didn't make men and women equal. Not physically, not emotionally
                          nor psychologically. <br><br><span style="color: #888888;">So in your opinion it is indeed a divine right of women? If that is so, probably this thread is redundant. </span><br></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Social conditioning.. heard of
                          that ? The idea is to deter. As long as you don;t do it.. you don;t
                          have to worry.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Like porn.. , many can argue it is
                          an unfair act against freedom of choice. But the fundamental reason
                          is not about fairness. it is about deterrence.<br><br><span style="color: #888888;">Indeed a deterence that makes one party pay the price for an act in which both party knowingly agreed. It suggests that men are evil and women are always the innocent party. So in your opinion, it is right for men to take the blame for it? even though the act is mutual?</span><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">How is this difficult to proof?
                          Abuses can be reported and documented. Ofcors if you are merely
                          crying wolf.. then it is very difficult to prove lah.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Something that you are automatically given preference and benefit of the doubt vs something you have to prove beyond doubt.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">She is required to back up her
                          claims.<br><br><span style="color: #888888;">Sure, so how about what the man is accustomed to? A woman can make a claim, what can a man claim? Women =&gt; alimony,  men =&gt; fend for yourself. Is this being the norm right? </span><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Virtue ? If both party got
                          virtue.. they wouldn't be in such a bind :P</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Lets just say.. try to stay
                          married.. as long as you can. A divorce only means everyone gets to
                          lose.<br><br><span style="color: #888888;">And in such cases women should be given preference?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">So you think by throwing money at
                                                  the problem it should just go away ? Wow. Such non-chalant
                                                  attitude.. tsk tsk. And who do you think would be paying for it ?
                                                  Not likely the young man.. it's probably his parents who has to pay
                                                  the fine. <br><br><span style="color: #888888;">I am saying a jail term is too much, not that the guy should get away with it. Look at the whole thread, I am actually trying to think logically how these situations should be handled. Thus i am not non-chalent.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">I</span><span style="color: #ff00ff;">t doesn;t take a medical worker to see the
                                                  heartaches playing out in family planning clinics across the
                                                  nations. Lets say I do have personal friends whom are involved in
                                                  such organizations</span>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">This indeed is a problem</span>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">While I agree.. that women who
                                                  puts themselves in such situations are partly to be blamed.. and so
                                                  they pay the price with the shame, emotional and physical pain to
                                                  kill an innocent life. Yet, the male party.. goes around like
                                                  nothing has happened. While it is an easy option for a male to say
                                                  " I don;t want this baby.. just abort it".. is that fair
                                                  ?<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">A person is a person, no matter

                          and as a father, me Daddy's gal sure look up to him for example, if
                          he teaches bad, I will be bad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, i met a lot of bad guys too, one thing i learn from them
                          is that they lack of self confidence and like to cheat others
                          including their parents, but they are weak EQ, so i chopped them
                          hard hard. I can be more bad when you are bad.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Similarly girls can be bad as well. I have a friend who had a gf for many years. He is already planning to marrying her. Then she left him for some rich guy, giving the reason that she likes that lifestyle. And now that guy does not take r/s seriously anymore. His attitude is "da jia kai xin jiu hao".  Both can be evil.</span></p>

              <p><br>It is a demand and supply chain here, if the men dun demand for it, there will be no supply, peoples are cursing that Geyland or joo chiat should be hv so much pro gals, but then you should ask the question back and said, "if u guys dun come, these gals will automatically go back or vanish to some other places".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Men courting women is the law of nature, if a women go and court men, i dun think you can call her a women, most of you call it slut or bitches. A women is like a flower, without the bees around, nothing moves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I bet you that every married man who are courting another woman would that they are not marry or simply that they are divorce or wife passed away. And when the woman fell in love with him, the true story will be poured out, cos married man are experienced man, they knows that women are emotional creature, once in love, he had them in his clutches. Damn men.</p>

              <p>Always remember : If there are children, they are the most affected. You *adults* never seem to understand this. THINK of the children. You had your fun, now live with the joys of the child(ren). The females had their fun (and almost doing nothing - the guys works mostly) - so do not even try to say giving birth is SUCH a noble thing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The family courts do not value the child as much as they value the maintenance and other matters. Live with it</p>

              <p><br>Yes, I agree. When the dream of romantic love is broken, only reality is left. And it can be downright heart breaking. After all the lies, betrayals, frustrations, anger and eventual disappointment, a divorcing couple still have to go thru the agony of taking opposing sides in a legal battle ground to protect their own interests.</p>
