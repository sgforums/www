              <p>erm, i have personally seen women who are pros at acting the victim and women who "have a change of heart" (breakup also have, divorce also have). My point is that while the society's mentality appears to favour the girls, there are male victims too. Extending the charter to males might be a good idea.</p>

              <p>Every relationship got it own unique problem, even if you see a women acting or whatever, do you really knows the problem behind it, of cos a male, you tends to defend the males, it could be she was humilated, beaten or mistreated by her husband that given no choice, she had to act inorder to gain more for her future and childrens, or that her man only knows how to Fxxk but dunno how to take care of family.</p>

              <p>No one's regretting the Women's charter, what Herzog (and frankly me as well) are trying to say that the charter needs to be looked to reflect the times and modified to prevent furthur abuse.</p>
              <p>I am brought up by a widowed mother, i have no reasons nor the motivation to look down on women. But even she has commented how easily the Women's Charter could be abused.</p>
              <p>To say all women are peace loving and socially non destructive is to say all men are blood thirsty and sex maniacs. There will always exceptions arising with changing times, which the law must make modifications for.</p>
              <p>Like you said, a group of men decided to break away from their traditional roles and the social norms of having women be servitude to men. Why is it so unthinkable that a group of women would arise to take advantage of the laws meant to give equality to them?</p>
              <p>I agree, the condition of women in those countries are appalling and we should help to improve their conditions. But that doesn't mean we should ignore that there are flaws in the Charter that needs to be looked at.</p>
              <p>That said however, given what i've read my opinion is that the TS probably married his wife because of her looks rather than her character and quite frankly fully deserved what he's getting now.</p>

              It seems man is on the losing side when it comes to divorce especially fiancially-ailmony,maintenance,division of assets,etc even if the divorced wife is the unfaithful,irresponsible,fault finding party..I can understand why TS is reluctant to pay or at least pay the mininum to his estranged party.
              
              The problem is sometimes and invariably the wife may be financially well off better than her spouse and yet trying to use Family Court to get even with her husband..this is also another aspect tha has often been abused...there are many arm-chair critics like old maid such as vicious kitty who always want to act like she is chief justice or public prosecutor...imagine faking cervical cancer to win sympathy...shock Vicious kitty still a"alive"..Don't act smart lah

              <p>Tsk tsk tsk.... Mr.787180,</p>
              <p>May I remind you that your filthy actions right now, may be retributed on your own children.. so think twice before you do cowardly deeds behind that computer of yours.</p>
              <p>Lets just pretend you do have a wife and 2 kids.</p>
              <p>I really pity your wife and children.</p>
              <p>So your young foreign mistress finally agreed to marry you eh ?</p>
              <p>So you are contemplating dumping your wife and take the 2 kids to avoid paying your wife anything eh ?</p>
              <p>So, your male ego is hurt because your wife earns more than your meagre retirement payments.. and you feel that since she earns more than you after the child are old enough to go to school.. you don't feel obliged to her at all after all these years.</p>
              <p>So, she don't deserve part of your retirement payouts.. because she earns more now anyway. But may I remind you that your retirement savings was accumulated throughout the marriage while you work and she took care of the household and children.</p>
              <p>May I remind you also that your foreign mistress is also not stupid. She will observe the way you treat your wife, and by you behaving like a stingy jerk, she will plan the relationship with you accordingly.</p>
              <p>If you think your young mistress will sacrifice as much as your wife did, think again.</p>
              <p>For those guys who claims that your wife is an evil bitch.</p>
              <p>May I ask,</p>
              <p>If she is really such a horrible person and such an evil bitch, what took you so long to find out ? Why do you have babies with her anyway ?</p>
              <p>True, some women change, but if you are in such a hurry to make her yours by marrying her and having babies with her... surely she cannot be as bad as you claim her to be.</p>
              <p>At the end of all relationship, spare a thought not just for yourself. Every human has their good and bad side. So, you are not perfect either.</p>
              <p>To the young innocent males out there who has yet to decide monkhood. Here's my golden advise.</p>
              <p>If you want to have babies with that woman you marry, WAIT and confirm that she is not an evil bitch before you stop using condoms.</p>
              <p>If she really is one, then dump her immediately, that way she can't get much from the family court either....in other words, you cut your losses, for when the baby comes... life do get more complicated ( during a divorce).</p>
              <p>After so many years of a marriage with you, you start claiming your wife is a real evil bitch and your children are her means of milking your money  and (when other young chick starts to notice your big fat wallet)... then it's too late to be such a cry baby.</p>

                  loves us dearly, loves and cares for the childrens we produce for

                  be she was humilated, beaten or mistreated by her husband that
                  given no choice, she had to act inorder to gain more for her future

              <p>Actually i do have a good idea of the situations i personally seen,
                  since i am quite inquisitive. In one extreme case, i have talked to and
                  seen the reactions of her family (immediate and maiden families).</p>
              <p>I
                  am not disputing the neccessity of the charter. I am questioning the
                  fairness of the charter protecting only one-side of the relationship. I
                  am sure there is a valid reason for the creation of the charter. The
                  charter came into existence in 1961, that is a long time ago. Many
                  things have changed since then. Women are now playing a much more
                  prominent role in society. </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">                                                                                 </span></p>
              <p>Let me illustrate my point,</p>
              <p>Let men be the value of 1</p>
              <p>Long ago, the womenfolk have little rights vale 0.6</p>
              <p>so the difference is 0.4</p>
              <p>Society
                  recognises that women are disadvantaged and thus devises mechanisms to
                  level the playing field. example: chivalry, notion of gentleman,
                  woman's charter value 0.2</p>
              <p>so now the situation of men: woman is 1: 0.6+0.2; 1:0.8</p>
              <p>But now, with women enjoying equal (or almost equal) rights to men, <br> the values become 1:0.8+0.4. Thus the value become 1:1.2 in favour of women.</p>
              <p>*the
                  values used are only as illustration and does not represent any point
                  system used to gauge the advantages and disadvantages or rights or the
                  lackof rights of the genders.</p>
              <p>**This illustration clearly has some assumptions, but
                  it is not to make an ass of u and me, it is like many scientific tests
                  and experiments, where certain factors are held constant.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">                                                                                 </span></p>
              <p>This
                  can be seen empirically, where women expects men to exhibit traits of
                  chivalry, gentlemanly conduct and take on traditional responsibilities
                  of men, while expecting them to share the burdens in the traditional
                  roles and responsibilities of a woman. Like the "Ladies first" in the
                  quote. It no longer becomes a struggle for equality but a fight for
                  supremacy. It is not about balancign the scale, but tilting it, to the
                  other side.</p>
              <p>Even our everyday language illustrates the power
                  shift, a male who believes that men are better is called MCP, a not
                  very desirable term whereas his female counterpart is known by a kinder
                  term, a feminist.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">My idea is that equality is what should be.</span> Men
                  and women are both susceptible to abuse. You have your rights because
                  you are an individual, not because of your gender, the colour of your
                  skin, your sexual orientation, income nor your education level.</p>
              <p>*edit*</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">My idea is that equality is what should be. &lt;= I mean to say that the equality is important and should be applied across the board in all issues and not selective ones.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Is the Husband being discriminated against, in the implementation of the Women’s charter at the Singapore family court?</strong></p>
              <p>Hi, this is something of a desperate attempt to get help for my situation. I had the privilege of first-hand experiences going through a divorce.</p>
              <p>May I be allowed to express my feelings and thoughts? It seems we have a system with good intentions, the system of mediations. I guess it is also practical as there are just too many divorce cases to deal with. The idea is to avoid going to trial but the trouble is nobody bothers to go through the details of the cases anymore. What’s the point of going through the details if the idea is to avoid going through the details to save time in the first place? But without going through the details of each case how could fair and effective mediation be rendered as a service rather than a disservice?</p>
              <p>It seems the whole system operates on a few key assumptions:<span> </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>First assumption</strong> is that the wife is the weaker party, the disadvantaged party and so where sympathy automatically is inclined towards. This is what the Woman’s Charter’s fundamental purpose, base on the said assumption to protect their rights and interests against the husband’s. What about the husband? Well may be we could also assume that the fool can fend for himself.<br></li>
              <li><strong>Second assumption</strong> is that the husband is always the dominant party and that the wife a housewife and even if a career woman has more likely than not played a subordinate and supporting role in the union. And so credit should be reserved for the wife.<br></li>
              <li><strong>Third</strong> that only the husband has benefited from the wife’s assumed contributions to the failed marriage. Sacrifices had only been one way, from the wife to the husband.<br></li>
              <li><strong>Fourth</strong> that the contributions from the wife are always positive, beneficial, always assets and never liabilities. So the length of marriage always goes in favour of her. No matter what she did – even if she steals money to give to her church that pays over half a million dollars to its pastor etc.<br></li>
              <li><strong>Fifth</strong> that the wife is always the party that suffers the most disadvantage in a failed marriage and so should be compensated with monetary rewards at his expense.<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>What if the assumptions are all wrong</strong> – so wrong? What if the husband had put everything on the line including his life’s savings and invited her into his life and she then took over his business, banished him from his work, ran the business to the ground, abandoned the family and left him to take care of their child on his own, siphoned money out secretly, bought a brand new car paid for in cash and donated tens of thousands to her church, and when nothing was left, abandoned him to fend for himself, then chased him out of the house ... and when he did not go under, she returned to get more out of him… Can the wife simply make use of the Women’s Charter to hound the husband?</p>
              <p>Will the mediators, councils and judges alike be willing to look at all these crucial facts before deciding summarily that the length of marriage is THE determining factor automatically favouring the wife?</p>
              <p>It looks like a full trial can’t be avoided for me. I am desperate to find a good trial lawyer who would look into the facts without prior misassumptions. Any helpful comments would be much appreciated.</p>

              <p>Actually i do have a good idea of the situations i personally seen, since i am quite inquisitive. In one extreme case, i have talked to and seen the reactions of her family (immediate and maiden families).</p>
              <p>I am not disputing the neccessity of the charter. I am questioning the fairness of the charter protecting only one-side of the relationship. I am sure there is a valid reason for the creation of the charter. The charter came into existence in 1961, that is a long time ago. Many things have changed since then. Women are now playing a much more prominent role in society. </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">                                                                                </span></p>
              <p>Let me illustrate my point,</p>
              <p>Let men be the value of 1</p>
              <p>Long ago, the womenfolk have little rights vale 0.6</p>
              <p>so the difference is 0.4</p>
              <p>Society recognises that women are disadvantaged and thus devises mechanisms to level the playing field. example: chivalry, notion of gentleman, woman's charter value 0.2</p>
              <p>so now the situation of men: woman is 1: 0.6+0.2; 1:0.8</p>
              <p>But now, with women enjoying equal (or almost equal) rights to men,<br>the values become 1:0.8+0.4. Thus the value become 1:1.2 in favour of women.</p>
              <p>*the values used are only as illustration and does not represent any point system used to gauge the advantages and disadvantages or rights or the lackof rights of the genders.</p>
              <p>**This illustration clearly has some assumptions, but it is not to make an ass of u and me, it is like many scientific tests and experiments, where certain factors are held constant.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">                                                                                </span></p>
              <p>This can be seen empirically, where women expects men to exhibit traits of chivalry, gentlemanly conduct and take on traditional responsibilities of men, while expecting them to share the burdens in the traditional roles and responsibilities of a woman. Like the "Ladies first" in the quote. It no longer becomes a struggle for equality but a fight for supremacy. It is not about balancign the scale, but tilting it, to the other side.</p>
              <p>Even our everyday language illustrates the power shift, a male who believes that men are better is called MCP, a not very desirable term whereas his female counterpart is known by a kinder term, a feminist.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">My idea is that equality is what should be.</span> Men and women are both susceptible to abuse. You have your rights because you are an individual, not because of your gender, the colour of your skin, your sexual orientation, income nor your education level.</p>
              <p>*edit*</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">My idea is that equality is what should be. &lt;= I mean to say that the equality is important and should be applied across the board in all issues and not selective ones.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Men are not neccessarily good, neither are women. It is neccessary to recognise that both parties can be the one in fault.  Bars and nightclubs? Indeed, so who are the people working there? Angels? or the idea that have been perpetuated across our society that all of the women working there are forced to do so by circumstances? Probably some are but definately not all. Women also watch porn. Many of my friends do.<br></span></p>
              <p>1. By physic, men are more stronger with their silly male
                      chauvinist and muscular than women</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Physically speaking yes, men are stronger than women.  But women are better in playing mind games no? Emotional blackmail? Having said that, i believe that nobody should hit another for no reason. But then again, nobody is above being punched up, both men and women. It really depends on whether you deserve it or not. (example: like a person insulting your entire family tree, yelling all sorts of "creative language" at you etc.)<br></span></p>

              <p>2. By Chemistry, men have less emotion and act

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">By "conventional wisdom", it is probably the case. Of cos we can talk about women plotting 30 year revenge plans as compared to men's rage and over style.</span></p>
              <p>3. By Biology, men no pause in sex and like to have sex, whereas
                      women got menopause.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Men can also experience menopause, you can check it up if u want.</span></p>
              <p>4. By neurology, men tend to want independency and are more
                      interested in new things.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you do a search on "extramaritial affair statistics" using google, you will find that the male:female ratio is actually not that far apart.</span></p>
              <p>All the above are realistic feature of men, that is why the

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As i said, times have changed, i would prefer to use the word fairer sex. I believe that a woman can outdo a man; a man can outdo a woman.

              i don't. Marriage is about a couple pooling their resources and
              expertise and work towards their common good. To grow together,
              struggle onward together and prosper together. A husband's success is
              as much his wife's success, and vice-versa. It should be beside every

              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Its
              like the movie rocky. Its the 10th round. Hes bloody, he falls.
              Everyone tells him "stay down, stay down". But he doesnt stay down and
              in the end he actually loses in the first movie. But hey he won in the
              sequels. &lt;&lt; lame joke</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">If i
              have a wife, sure i will take care of her, love her and look after her
              needs. I would want to laugh with her and cry with her. It is not
              because i vowed to do so. It is because she is the woman i chose and
              she is the woman who accepted me. When she is down, i will pull her up.
              Why? It is not because of duty. It is because it is the one thing i
              want her to do for me when i am down.</span></p>

              <p>I tend to agree more with ahbeo. At the end of the day, it's a matter of expectations.</p>
              <p>A guy will have certain expectations for his wife/gf.</p>
              <p>A girl will have certain expectations for her husband/bf.</p>
              <p>Find the right one, and you'll have a happy relations.</p>
              <p>Find the wrong one, then you can only blame yourself.</p>

                                      pulling the carpet and allowing more loopholes?</span></p>

              <p>Ahbeo, Have you read through the Woman's charter yet ? Tell me, which part of the charter do you think needs to change, and change to what ?</p>
              <p>If you have not even read through the charter yet, how can you claim that is unfair ?</p>
              <p>Like I said, everyone who goes into the court will claim innocent and the other party at a bigger fault. SO ALWAYS listen to two side of the coin first.</p>
              <p>It is not just Singapore court that usually wards the child care to the mother, even the western courts do the same. WHY ? </p>
              <p>Just because the father knows how to change a diaper and push a stroller, does not means he is doing a better job than the mother.</p>
              <p>Raising children are not as simple as you think.</p>
              <p>Fathers are not hard wired to multi task in a child care situation..and are typically not as sensitive to the children's emotional needs as the mother.</p>
              <p>Fathers do not have mother's instinct. That is a hard fact.</p>
              <p>As we human beings begins our defiant role against what nature has decided for us, are we doing a better job ? I'm not convinced. Are you  ?</p>

              <p>In that case, it just means that they have settled/agreed about the divisions amicably prior to filing divorce papers.</p>
              <p>That would be the best way to go about a divorce.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, people are vindictive, and couples going through divorce are usually at a very unstable emotional phase. And the law does allow for each party to use it against the other until each exhausted their own resources.</p>
              <p>Couples who are as reasonable and has the ability to be amicable during a divorce, are not likely to be divorced with each other.</p>
