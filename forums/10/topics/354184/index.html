              </p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Is the Husband being discriminated
              against, in the implementation of the Women’s charter at the Singapore family
              court?</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Hi, this is something of a desperate attempt to get help for
              my situation. I had the privilege of first-hand experiences going through a
              divorce.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">May I be allowed to express my feelings and thoughts? It
              seems we have a system with good intentions, the system of mediations. I guess
              it is also practical as there are just too many divorce cases to deal with. The
              idea is to avoid going to trial but the trouble is nobody bothers to go through
              the details of the cases anymore. What’s the point of going through the details
              if the idea is to avoid going through the details to save time in the first
              place? But without going through the details of each case how could fair and
              effective mediation be rendered as a service rather than a disservice?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It seems the whole system operates on a few key assumptions:<span>  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
              </p><ul>
              <li><strong>First assumption</strong> is that the wife is the weaker party, the disadvantaged party and so where
              sympathy automatically is inclined towards. This is what the Woman’s Charter’s
              fundamental purpose, base on the said assumption to protect their rights and
              interests against the husband’s. What about the husband? Well may be we could
              also assume that the fool can fend for himself.<br></li>
              <li><strong>Second assumption</strong> is that the husband is always the dominant party and that the wife a housewife
              and even if a career woman has more likely than not played a subordinate and
              supporting role in the union. And so credit should be reserved for the wife.<br></li>
              <li><strong>Third</strong> that only the husband has benefited from the wife’s assumed contributions
              to the failed marriage. Sacrifices had only been one way, from the wife to the
              husband.<br></li>
              <li><strong>Fourth</strong> that the
              contributions from the wife are always positive, beneficial, always assets and
              never liabilities. So the length of marriage always goes in favour of her. No
              matter what she did – even if she steals money to give to her church that pays
              over half a million dollars to its pastor etc.<br></li>
              <li><strong>Fifth</strong> that the
              wife is always the party that suffers the most disadvantage in a failed
              marriage and so should be compensated with monetary rewards at his expense.<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>What if the
              assumptions are all wrong</strong> – so wrong? What if the husband had put
              everything on the line including his life’s savings and invited her into his
              life and she then took over his business, banished him from his work, ran the
              business to the ground, abandoned the family and left him to take care of their
              child on his own, siphoned money out secretly, bought a brand new car paid for
              in cash and donated tens of thousands to her church, and when nothing was left,
              abandoned him to fend for himself, then chased him out of the house ... and
              when he did not go under, she returned to get more out of him… Can the wife simply
              make use of the Women’s Charter to hound the husband?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Will the mediators, councils and judges alike be willing to
              look at all these crucial facts before deciding summarily that the length of
              marriage is THE determining factor automatically favouring the wife?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It looks like a full trial can’t be avoided for me. I am
              desperate to find a good trial lawyer who would look into the facts without
              prior misassumptions. Any helpful comments would be much appreciated.</p>

              <p>I beg yr pardon, those are yr assumptions, and assumption dun prove anything in court..just ass u and me. Court dismissed</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First and foremost, nobody put a gun on your damn head to marry her, you wanted her, you loved her, you sex with her, she borne your childrens, so what if she took over your business and failed, so what if she takes yr money??? Isn't husband and wife make vows to go thru thick and thin of life. If you wanted to file for a divorce just go ahead. She did nothing wrong, too bad you get a bad wife, unlike others whose wifeys are caring and loving them, just blame it on yr poor life, and please paid your bills for divorcing, there is nothing wrong to our women's charter, it has served the court here for many years, Law by law.</p>

              <p>Let me add a few points.</p>
              <p>The women's Charter is meant to protect rights of women due to them being the weaker sex. It should not be used to work in favour of the woman</p>
              <p>A women;s charter comes into effect when the woman is not guilty or has no participation in anything in the cause of the event. Examples are rape, family maintenance ect and when the other party usually a man is not willing to provide the corrective action when it is entirely his fault.</p>
              <p>But if u have evidence that yr wife siphoned money out from you. Try to file a charge against her for theft.</p>

              the wife simply make use of the Women’s Charter to hound the
              husband?</p>
              <p>Will the mediators, councils and judges alike be
              willing to look at all these crucial facts before deciding
              summarily that the length of marriage is THE determining factor
              automatically favouring the wife?</p>
              <p>It looks like a full trial can’t be avoided for me. I
              am desperate to find a good trial lawyer who would look into the
              facts without prior misassumptions. Any helpful comments would be
              much appreciated.</p>

              <p>My dear boy, don't let these stupid and irresponsible adult male scare you into thinking the Women's charter is out to destroy men.</p>
              <p>The charter exists to reduce the number of  women who become victims of some men's irresponsible ways. Till today, there are still many women and children abandoned by men who managed to find ways to weasel out of their obligations.</p>
              <p>Protecting women and children is not discrimination.</p>
              <p>If men had not been so irresponsible, the Charter would have become redundant long time ago.</p>

              <p><br>In the family, there is such a thing as trust, even if misplaced. If a man thinks his wife can make better executive decisions, do you think he wouldn't leave the decision-making to his wife?</p>
              <p>As I said before, he must prepare evidence of wrong-doing that is culpable in a court of law. If none are present, then surely he must be lying. If the husband produce sufficient evidence of wrong doing, the law must be fair to the husband.</p>
              <p>If you ask me what's there to claim? If the above case is proven to be true, the wife must not be able to claim alimony and can only claim whatever she contributed to the family unit prior to the marriage. If further evidence proves wrong-doing in a business court, the wife may have to pay for damages.</p>
