              <p>well.. I posted a news article on page 10... jojobeach made some sarcastic remarks on that news article, so I made my response based on the points that jojobeach raised. Is there anything wrong with my approach? If jojobeach wanted to raise any additional points (from the previous pages), she could have done that. but jojobeach did not... so <strong>how is that my fault</strong>? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>how abt this? i'll also give you some air-time. u state what the area / points that we think we should be discussing on... and i'll try to answer them on tue nite, when I got more avail time. I'm giving you a first mover advantage... gentleman enuff?</p>

              <p>I think the whole idea of me using the term of alpha males is precisely referring to cads, the men the women in this threads hate so much.</p>
              <p>Alpha males is to my understanding are men whose primary goals to life is to complete for the attention of females, pursuing a higher social standing and power neccessary steps to gain attention. This makes them extremely aggressive and intolerant to any perceived loss to power or control (more likely for physical abuses)</p>
              <p>But that's just my personal theory, though wife beating tend to be done by men who failed to achieve a certain social standing and looked down upon by the immediate surrounding society. </p>
              <p>I don't use the term as an excuse that all men should be spared of the Women's charter. It was never my intention, it definitely is needed. Though i do think we need to look at it because the current generation of women(18-40) are not facing the same problems as the generation before them. </p>
              <p>But, i resent the way men as a whole are being blamed for the action of few in this thread. When we want to talk and discuss in a rational fashion we are instead accused of not "behaving like men" and "participating in whining".</p>
              <p>How in the world do women in this thread expect men to change when you want to take a holier than thou position and talk down to us?   Behaving exactly like the patriarchal societies in the Middle East?</p>
              <p>Women are the gate keepers to what behaviourial traits get passed down into the next generation. It's now men's fault when you favour men who do first and think later?</p>

              <p>Note the article mentioned... the China wife did NOT benefit

              <p><span style="color: #888888;">She benefitted during the marriage. According to my understanding of section 52 of the charter, It basically means what is the wife's is the wife's.  </span></p>
              <p>How many cases of domestic violence do you know whereby the MAN

                      want to continue and offer her more and more...if not for the
                      family rite, and also if I am not wrong, the old man's childrens is
                      fed up with their daddy action, if not why they dun wan to be his
                      witness at ROM.</p>
              <p>Now, let me ask you, is it the old man fault or the PRC woman
                      fault?  Singapore men is suppose to be smart and cleverer
                      rite, then why fall for PRC gals??? these men are all sex maniacs,
                      in desparate they give everything for it, why not spend his saving
                      go for spa, massage by Jap gals, short time at geyland with
                      different young gals, grooming by stevenson or 101, why can easily

              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Actually according the article, the man was threatened into the
                      marriage. While i cant say whether its because he needs companionship
                      or sex, it is not right to simply assume its just for sex.</span></p>

              <p>That old man MARRIED the china woman.. in other words.. she is
                      his LEGAL wife.</p>
              <p>Geesh.. you mean it's wrong for a wife to spend her husband's
                      money ? Does your mother spends the money your dad brings home
                      ?????  Or are you just discriminating that woman because she
                      is from CHINA ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">We have the benefit of hindsight in this case. So we cant say kilfer is discriminating against her. I believe the article mentioned her extravagant spendings and that the old man had to ask for money from his daughter. There was nothing against using the husband's money.  </span></p>
              <p>It would have been different if she was NOT married to that tiko
                      old man.</p>
              <p>Angel is correct.. that man just thought he can marry a younger
                      woman.. to get free fark and free aid during convalescence. He
                      wouldn't be in such a bind if he had gone to Geylang.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">As in reply to angel, doesnt seem right to assume.</span></p>
              <p>Medical damage ?? HAHAHAHAHAHH... you think the wife is a nurse

                      blissful state for ya.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">My understanding is that he meant the wife, by not bringing him to the doctor, caused his condition to deteriorate. Not asking for compensation.</span></p>

              <p>My dear Kilfer, I understand the agony some men goes through..
                      hoping to get a cheap fix and end up paying for more than they
                      signed up for.</p>
              <p>But you guys really need to get your acts together in order to
                      effect changes or improvements.</p>
              <p>So far.. the discussion goes all over the place.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Well, i do see alot of gender bashings in this thread. And many examples. But IMO, such discussions shld be wider than one or two cases. It should not be that specific since every case is unique.</span></p>
              <p>Ok . I hear ya, complaining how unfair the charter is to men..
                      and men do get abused.. blah blah blah.. but I have asked so many
                      times... what kind of solid proposal do you have in mind ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Interesting. Solid proposal is easy to say. We should first recognise the problem and then find a solution. Not many people who identifies a problem has the solution. Like i said, some protections should be extended to men.</span></p>
              <p>OK so you want the women to pay for abuse on their men. But does
                      that also means we make the men pay if it's their fault ? Like
                      strip them of every thing they own and throw them in jail too ?
                      Look. You guys can't have it one way and not the other.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Strip them of everything they own and throw them in jail is sounds like a very heavy punishment. The idea is to be fair to both genders. Both genders should not have it just one way.</span></p>

              <p><br><span style="color: #888888;">Actually according the article, the man was threatened into the marriage. While i cant say whether its because he needs companionship or sex, it is not right to simply assume its just for sex</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">..............................................................................................</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Threatened??? by a hole? OMG, Uncle, dun bluf XMM lah. As a man, if you dun make a move, no one can force you lah, even if i like a man or wanted to chop a guy hard hard, if he dun take the bait, I also lan lan...oops sorry me no lan, should be I also cannot do anything. So, dun give me the shit that he is threatened, i think because of his flirting habits the family members ignored him and let to his lost of family live and love, many sg Uncles have worked hard during their young times to bring up a family, unfortuntely, when they get old, they feel lost and search for some holes, and right infront is some foreign women who they think can bring them back to their youth life again, and in the end, they lost their own family love. Their grandchildrens and childrens cannot live to see a sex maniac grandfather.</span></p>
