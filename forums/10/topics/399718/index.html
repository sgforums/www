              Hi
              
              To All Residence, MOM and Govt MPs.
              
              Today newspaper as i was reading. I was stunt upon a topic that MOM, Govt
              allowed Blangadesh to stay in HDB Flats.
              
              I wld like to highlight some real incident happen in Fernvale Area. The blangdesh worker is staying at construction site. My shocking news was that i found them like to loiter near the Fernvale education centre and peep thru and see singapore women and maids.
              
              Some of the blangadesh was following the maids and single women quitely from behind and try to know where they stay. I immediately asked him are you stay around the area. He quickly saw me and run away.  
              
              When one of my spy team member having chat with the blangadesh and during the conversation they were telling my friend that single women, married women and students of singaporean very good chance to rape or rob them at night only one thing we cant stay around near to the HDB flats if not we can enjoy more singaporean maids every single night.  My friend was shocked to hear that. The friend of mine pretend drink beer with them and the more they say the more they are waiting for govt and MOM to approve them to stay in HDB flats so they can execute their plan.
              
              I hope in the forum that MOM, Govt MP and singaporean had a very deep consideration whether you want your love one, and kid every live in a horrifying nite especially when they return from school and work areas where they blangadesh is just neighbour and looking at them to see the right time to attack or rob even rape them.
              
              I would still prefer the blangadesh worker to house in the construction site more safer then allowed them to rent in the HDB 4rm or 5Rm FLATS.  Maids had been recently telling lie to their employer and funny behaviour some event commit suicide due to the blangadesh worker made her pregant and off the hp when they call. She feel embarras and jump down from our flats. Worst still a maid had been inserted a meat into her vagina when having sex with the blangadesh in a hotel. The maids immediate die in the hospital whereby the blanadesh say she betray him with another man.
              
              This is a very shocking news, i do hope MOM, Govt MP and all the Police NB station be more alert on this groups of blanadesh. They are not alone, many of them had been recently very action in toa payoh interchange show off our maids they are better in sex and many money they earns.
              
              See yourself if you dont believe what our team had mentioned.
              
              Last but not least stay vigilant and more alerts to these people.

              <p>If you are as maverick as your namesake, you would compile all the addresses of the MPs, ministers and tell the bangalas that these are excellent places to go fishing and get laid.</p>
