              <p>critized .I am not sure if this policy also apply to dentist programmes.</p>
              <p>Is the female intake cap at one third in SG?</p>
              <p>Look at the Australia reality.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Only 34% and 29% of doctors and dentists are female respectively.</span></p>
              <p>If Oz Uni take medical and dentists undergrad equally in sex</p>

              <p>It is not good enough that with a GP shortage stretching right

              <p>
              </p><p><br><span class="text">
              </span></p><p>   MY FATHER, Ang Teong Hui, was admitted recently to Changi General Hospital, where he was diagnosed with a mild stroke. However, his condition deteriorated and he fell into a coma on the same day.</p>
              <p>  The doctors did various tests on him and took scans of his brain where they eventually found the cause of his deteriorating condition.</p>
              <p>  However, the last scan - an MRI - was done a day after he was admitted, after the doctors felt that he might not pull through and needed the scan urgently.</p>
              <p>  When asked why the scan was not done earlier, the doctor replied that it was bad luck on my father's part as MRI scans were not done on weekends.</p>
              <p>  After my father was transferred out of the intensive-care unit to a normal ward, we asked one of the nurses why such a piece of state-of-the-art equipment was not used on weekends.</p>
              <p>  The nurse replied that it was unfair to recall the doctors just to do the scan because weekends were supposed to be their rest days.</p>
              <p>  Well, if it was unfair for the doctors to work on weekends, was it fair for my father to be denied treatment on a weekend, especially when the situation was so crucial?</p>
              <p>  My father died on Oct 8, aged 53, and there is nothing my family and I can do to bring him back. But I would like to make it known to Changi General Hospital and the relevant government departments that attitudes such as those mentioned above were incorrect.</p>

              <p>
              </p><p><br><span class="text">
              </span></p><p>  MY CHILD was sick, down with a bad cough, sore throat, runny nose and a slight fever on Feb 16. At 9pm, our family doctor had left so we went to another private clinic - 'Street 11 Clinic' at Block 139 Tampines Street 11.</p>
              <p>  After a brief consultation, she was given these medicines cough syrup (one bottle, 'Dhasedyl, 90ml'); a packet of 'Danzen' (20 tablets, 5mg) for the throat; 'Telfast D' (10 tablets) for runny nose and antibiotics 'Klacid MR' (five 500mg tablets for throat and nose).</p>
              <p>  I was astonished when I received the bill. These medicines cost me $80. I am puzzled at the high cost because I believe that my daughter's symptoms were fairly common and she was treated by a locum.</p>
              <p>  I feel the clinic had either overcharged and jacked up the price of common drugs, or did it give me unnecessarily expensive drugs for a common illness</p>
              <p>  I asked the receptionist for a breakdown of the cost of the various medicines. To my surprise, the staff informed me that the five antibiotic tablets alone cost $37.</p>
              <p>  I believe Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan had mentioned that affordable medicines be provided for patients at reasonable prices. Yet the clinic in our heartlands is charging drugs such as 'Klacid MR' at an exorbitant price. This is a worrying problem which I hope can be addressed to benefit the masses.</p>

              </p><p><br><span class="text">
              </span></p><p>  ON THE day the letter, 'Three-hour wait at KK's A&amp;E Department' (ST, March 7), was published, my son too came down with vomiting, diarrhoea and fever.</p>
              <p>  He experienced excessive thirst but would throw up shortly after drinking water. As he was showing signs of dehydration, my wife and I decided to take him to a hospital after midnight.</p>
              <p>  Unfortunately, having missed reading the papers that day, we took him to KK Hospital in the belief that we could get immediate help at the 24-hour children's emergency ward. How wrong we were.</p>
              <p>  Despite being put on the 'priority' list, it was only 1 1/2 hours later that we finally saw the doctor. The check-up was simple and was over in 15 minutes.</p>
              <p>  We decided to admit him for observation, and for him to get some rest. Then came more drama. The admission process took some 40 minutes. I was asked to sign in some 10 different places, and the staff (whose English was hardly comprehensible) was going back and forth photocopying forms.</p>
              <p>  Apparently, we could not send our son up to the room before all the forms were completed. It was close to 4am before he got to his bed. My wife fell sick the next morning.</p>
              <p>  It seems hospitals here take more care of paperwork and payments than of the sick. The fact is that there will always be many cases which, although not life-and-death situations, cannot exactly wait until the next day. What should we do in such cases?</p>
              <p>  I would also like to know if the Ministry of Health could publish statistics on waiting times in A&amp;E wards. Also, whether there are any guidelines governing this.</p>

Having spent several thousands of dollars, I was shocked to be told I had to pay an additional $77 for a copy of the test results. Why should I have to pay for a copy of my own test results when I have already paid for the tests? Isn't this double-payment? Or does a dozen sheets of paper cost $77 these days?</p>

              <p>Is Mt Elizabeth hospital’s health services deserve its perceived standard as a private hospital?<br> </p>
              <p>[</p>
              <p>some additions after I received a few feedback:</p>
              <p>1. i have made complaints to hospital the first thing but only received apology letter. the list of happenings continued becoz it is the way it is there.</p>
              <p>2. we couldnt move mum to another hospital coz of her condition.</p>
              <p>3. yes, someone in our family is familiar with medical/health practices and drugs.</p>
              <p>4. yes, I have kept the evidences.</p>
              <p>]</p>
              <p><br>My mum was hospitalized recently due to dengue and to our horror, we discover for ourselves the quality of the Mount Elizabeth hospitalization service which would have killed her if we had not been cautious.<br> <br>On the 3rd and 4th day of hospitalization from high fever, my mum's condition became worse. This was when we had the horrific experience from the hospital staff. Each time I returned to the hospital, I discover that my mum was not being monitored for her condition. The nurses were not aware whether my mum has taken her meal and medication or that she was having diarrhea. They were also unaware of her pains or complications arising from the dengue fever complications.<br> <br>My mum was weak and semi-conscious from high fever initially and her condition got very much worse. She was barely able to speak and was unconscious most of the time. We saw that the nurses were unaware of her conditions, did not chart her progress, and did not check on her. My mum would have died as she was a case of dengue fever with complications. Patients with her similar conditions had died. If not for our own efforts to monitor her, we would have lost her to the hospital service which we were willing to pay dearly for.<br> <br>When my mum was having diarrhea and I returned to the hospital to discover that myself, I asked my mum what happened and she mumbled in her weak condition that the nurses only took her to the toilet and left her there after she rang the bell. My mum had to clean herself every time in her weak condition. For information, my mum could hardly walk and was shaking badly.<br> <br> <br>My mum has existing high blood pressure and diabetics which she takes medication for. Upon the doctor's instruction, the nurses were to instruct us not to administer my mum any high blood pressure medication on 13 Nov 07 while no family were not around in hospital. The nurse did not check my mum's medication but asked my mum, who was semi-conscious to sort out the medication herself. I returned to the hospital a few hours later to find my mum taken the medication she was not supposed to take.

The then decided to draw blood from my mum's finger. During the 4 days which I were aware of her taking blood, she dropped the cap of the tube on the floor, always forgetting and reaching for things from the trolley, and I had to hold the cotton over my mum's wound every time.

My mum was in semi-conscious condition for some days and was not fully aware of the medication taken. Therefore, my mum did not understand what she said. So I asked the nurse what the drug was for, she said it is to aid digestion. I said my mum was not taking any drug to aid digestion. She then said it was for the bloated feeling on which I said again that the medication was in liquid form. She became frustrated and told me off saying she was asking my mum. My mum guessed and asked if it protected the stomach from the medication. GW then said yes. Since we said my mum has been eating some food and we did not know if she still needed the medication, GW said she would take the drug off. My sister later said that the drug was prescribed because my mum was having low platelet counts due to dengue and was prescribed the drug to protect the stomach from bleeding during food and medication.<br> <br>The next day, GW forgot to administer cough syrup at dinner time and I went to ask for it at 8pm. She came in with the cough syrup and asked my mum how long the effect of the syrup usually last.

              <p> </p>
              <p><span>  MY CHILD was sick, down with a bad cough, sore throat, runny nose and a slight fever on Feb 16. At 9pm, our family doctor had left so we went to another private clinic - 'Street 11 Clinic' at Block 139 Tampines Street 11.</span></p>
              <p>  After a brief consultation, she was given these medicines cough syrup (one bottle, 'Dhasedyl, 90ml'); a packet of 'Danzen' (20 tablets, 5mg) for the throat; 'Telfast D' (10 tablets) for runny nose and antibiotics 'Klacid MR' (five 500mg tablets for throat and nose).</p>
              <p>  I was astonished when I received the bill. These medicines cost me $80. I am puzzled at the high cost because I believe that my daughter's symptoms were fairly common and she was treated by a locum.</p>
              <p>  I feel the clinic had either overcharged and jacked up the price of common drugs, or did it give me unnecessarily expensive drugs for a common illness</p>
              <p>  I asked the receptionist for a breakdown of the cost of the various medicines. To my surprise, the staff informed me that the five antibiotic tablets alone cost $37.</p>
              <p>  I believe Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan had mentioned that affordable medicines be provided for patients at reasonable prices. Yet the clinic in our heartlands is charging drugs such as 'Klacid MR' at an exorbitant price. This is a worrying problem which I hope can be addressed to benefit the masses.</p>

              <p><span>  I HAVE done a series of medical tests at Singapore General Hospital over the past few months for a chronic pain condition. Having spent several thousands of dollars, I was shocked to be told I had to pay an additional $77 for a copy of the test results. Why should I have to pay for a copy of my own test results when I have already paid for the tests? Isn't this double-payment? Or does a dozen sheets of paper cost $77 these days?</span></p>

              <p>If you just want a dozen sheets of waste paper it will be far cheaper. But if you expect a nurse to search your case notes, retrieve the electronic records, make the copies and ask a doctor or technician to verify they are the correct results, then you must pay for the time taken by these highly trained professionals. And $77 is dirt cheap.....lawyers charge far more to make photocopies of legal papers. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span>  ON THE day the letter, 'Three-hour wait at KK's A&amp;E Department' (ST, March 7), was published, my son too came down with vomiting, diarrhoea and fever.</span></p>
              <p>  He experienced excessive thirst but would throw up shortly after drinking water. As he was showing signs of dehydration, my wife and I decided to take him to a hospital after midnight.</p>
              <p>  Unfortunately, having missed reading the papers that day, we took him to KK Hospital in the belief that we could get immediate help at the 24-hour children's emergency ward. How wrong we were.</p>
              <p>  Despite being put on the 'priority' list, it was only 1 1/2 hours later that we finally saw the doctor. The check-up was simple and was over in 15 minutes.</p>
              <p>  We decided to admit him for observation, and for him to get some rest. Then came more drama. The admission process took some 40 minutes. I was asked to sign in some 10 different places, and the staff (whose English was hardly comprehensible) was going back and forth photocopying forms.</p>
              <p>  Apparently, we could not send our son up to the room before all the forms were completed. It was close to 4am before he got to his bed. My wife fell sick the next morning.</p>
              <p>  It seems hospitals here take more care of paperwork and payments than of the sick. The fact is that there will always be many cases which, although not life-and-death situations, cannot exactly wait until the next day. What should we do in such cases?</p>
              <p>  I would also like to know if the Ministry of Health could publish statistics on waiting times in A&amp;E wards. Also, whether there are any guidelines governing this.</p>

              <p>The child did not die, did he? 90 minute wait for a non-emergency is far too short. For the charges you pay, what do you expect? If you want a doctor to drop everything and abandon more seriously ill patients just to see your child, you should just employ your own in-house physician. Go to the UK....with those symptoms, your son will have to make an appointment the next morning to see your GP. The waiting time for a GP appointment is another 2 days.  </p>

              <div>What's wrong with the people in Singapore?<br><br>So what if you are a doctor, a teacher, a retail associate or professionals of any kind? So what if you have the degree, bachelor or master? Even if you are highly educated, regardless if you are bbm or pbm, you are just bushits.<br><br>Feeling kinda insulted?<br><br><br>Well, if you don't have the good attidutes towards others, you deserve it!<br><br><br>This latest experience by my mum and aunts were definitely showing that doctors can be really pathetic, shameless and most likely haughty or proud just because they are a doctor. And words coming out from their mouth can really be insulting and stinks lots.<br><br>Doctors are doctors. They should be professional in their behaviour and actions. Be it a dentist or a doctor doing all sorts of checkups, and be it doctors from a clinic or doctors from a hospital.<br>It's really very ugly to see doctors being sarcastic and disrespectful to their patients.<br><br>And you know what? Wow, ministers or other people praising the good service standards in Singapore when they are getting worse. Open up their eyes and see how ugly people can be when they aren't able to suck any money from your pocket. See how hungry and nasty these "professionals" can be?! They just want our money! If you don't give them the money, you might as well vanish far away and never be there again. So what in short do we call this--A daylight robbery, and mind you this is a legal daylight robbery!<br><br>Customers should be served in a respectable manner provided they are also behaving in a courteous manner. However, sales person in shopping centres, departmental stores, even food courts just look at you at the corner of their eyes when you don't tend to buy anything but look. Who says it is wrong to look? By the way, the basic step to buying something from a shop is through glancing and looking. And if they never buy this time, they may just come back the next time and buy it straight away! So service standard hits new low in Singapore. Shame!<br><br>Going back to the experience in a dental clinic. This doctor (a female one) is damn overboard to have actually say real nasty things to my uneducated and not-so-smart aunt. The setting: a new set of dentures for my aunt was not comfortable, and is painful to the gums. hence my mum and her went back to ask her and do something to the dentures like bending the metal wire.<br><br><br><strong><span style="font-size: 180%;">"</span></strong><br><blockquote>
              <p>Doctor: Face was very "smelly", then ask them...<br><br>Mum: (Speaks for aunt) .....<br><br>Doctor (She): Oh, maybe because she is low-IQ, she needs more time to adapt than a normal person. Dr also added she needs 3 months but others only need less than a month.<br><br>Mum &amp; Aunt: (Don't want to fight back...partially coz they're surprised to hear...)<br><br>Doctor: Since she is low-IQ, she doesn't know how to bite...she only uses her toungue to break down the chunks of food. That's why she finds it pain when she wears the dentures.<br><br>Doctor: You see, a normal person can learn how to write ABC in a very short period of time, and that she needs to use 1 year's time but yet still unable to pick up ABC.<br><br><strong><span style="font-size: 180%;">"</span></strong></p>
              </blockquote><br><br><br>This is far too overboard. The doctor is insulting her patients! She kept emphasising that my aunt is too low IQ and she doesn't know what to do?!! How can? At least we all know she can talk, she can eat, she can even do house chores and cook herself!<br><br>And who says that low IQ has got to do with pain? Oh my god, even the stupidest person will never say such things!! <strong>STUPID DOCTOR-YOU ARE WORST: YOU=ZERO IQ!!! </strong><br>And mind her, everyone will feel pain since they are alive. It's whether they know how to express themselves and say it out or they don't say.<strong><span style="font-size: 180%;"> All humans do feel pain.</span></strong><br>So the doctor said that she needs 3 month to adapt while others need one month to adapt? Isn't she trying to make ppl ROFL? Make my aunt suffer another 2 months? And by then the dentist cum doctor can excuse herself that she never see this patient before?!<br><br>The truth is even "normal" people also go back to her and complain to her. So her answer to my aunt and mum is really sarcastic. She abuse the word "low-IQ" and think that she is very clever when she=zero IQ.<br><br>AND VERY IMPORTANT AS WHAT MY DAD SAID SHE IS JUST A DENTIST, SHE HAS NO RIGHTS TO CARE THAT WHETHER HER PATIENTS ARE OF LOW-IQ, ARE NORMAL, ETC, HER JOB IS PRIMARILY ON DENTAL ONLY. SHE CANNOT INTERFERE OTHERS' EQ OR IQ EVEN IF SHE IS ANY LOUSY PSYCHOLOGIST OR SO.<br><br>And I shall say she should observe the good service protocols and be professional when she is supposed to be. She should respect the customers or patients irregardless whether she is happy or not. She should not abuse others with their weaknesses. She should have been courterous although she can't earn any cents from the patients; this is her FAULT for not making good dentures, she should correct them at her full responsibilities. She shouldn't excuse herself or say tonnes of nasty things to cover her <strong>faults and put the mistakes on her patients instead.</strong><br><br>And most importantly, <span style="font-size: 180%;">if she can't provide good service and even good medical support for her patients, she might as well resign and get her bums out of the clinic. She should go for upgrading of her medical techniques and attend courses to improve her service standards. She is claimed to be a poor dentist who has no rights to stay at her current position. </span><br><br><br>This dental clinic is located at Yishun. Somewhere.....</div>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">- Lee Kuan Yew, <a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw03/031103to.htm"><span style="color: #990000;">TODAY</span></a>, November, 2003</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Recently a friend of mine (we’ll call her ‘Esther’) was admitted to the Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) department of the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">General</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hospital</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (SGH). </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Esther had earlier seen her GP who recommended that she consulted doctors at SGH to determine the cause of her illness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Day One</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Registration – </span></em></strong><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">8.40pm</span></em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The registration at the triage section of the A&amp;E’s Isolation Ward (IW) was smooth and swift and went without a hitch. The triage nurse was courteous, friendly and apparently highly efficient. We thanked her and took our seats at the waiting area for Esther’s number to be called by the doctor on duty that night.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">It was about </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">8.40pm</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The consultation with the doctor eventually took place at around </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">10pm</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> – after some 1 hour 20 mins later. Esther was told that she had to be admitted for overnight observation so that more tests could be done to ascertain the cause of her illness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">So, we returned to the waiting area and waited for Esther to be assigned a ward and a bed. In the meantime, a nurse told us that they would find a bed in the IW for Esther to rest temporarily, instead of sitting on the chairs in the waiting area, which was an exercise in endurance for someone who is ill.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">It turned out to be a frustrating, excruciating and a very long wait indeed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">At </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">12.20am</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, some 3 hours and 40 mins after Esther had registered at the A&amp;E, I approached the triage nurse and asked if they were aware that Esther was waiting for a bed in the IW. (In all those 3 hours 40 mins, we were not informed or updated about when a bed might be available.) </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The nurse was very understanding and explained that there were no beds available and that there was nothing they could do. And so the wait continued.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">12.50am</span></em></strong><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> – 4 hours 10 mins</span></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">At </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">12.50am</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> – 4 hours and 10mins after registration – we were finally informed that a bed was available in the IW’s Fever Zone. The relief – and exhaustion - on Esther’s face was evident. She would be able to rest her tired self finally.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The “Fever Zone”, where the temporary beds were, is a small section within the Isolation Ward. It has two rooms – one for male patients and one for female patients. Each room could hold about 6 to 7 beds. The Fever Zone is the place where patients who have to be warded are temporarily placed while waiting to be admitted to the wards of their choice. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Esther had opted for a B2-plus ward (5 patients in an air-conditioned room).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">We were hopeful that we wouldn’t have to wait just as long for Esther to be assigned a bed in the B2-plus ward. The IW ward has its television and lights on 24-hours and patients are wheeled out to the wards and new ones wheeled in, a situation which doesn’t really allow one to rest properly amidst the noise and the comings and goings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Our hope was misplaced.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The long wait was to last till the next day. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Day Two</span></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">9pm</span></em></strong><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> – 24 hours 20 mins</span></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">At about </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">9pm</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> on Day Two – 24 hours 20 minutes after registration - Esther was informed that a B2 bed was available and the nurse asked if she wanted it. As a B2 ward is non-air conditioned, as opposed to a B2-plus ward, Esther declined. (See <a href="http://www.sgh.com.sg/ForPatientsnVisitors/HospitalCharges/InpatientCharges/"><span style="color: #990000;">here</span></a>)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The reason why she declined is because we suspected that Esther might have to stay quite a while in the hospital (as she already had 2 previous unsuccessful blood tests, one at a private hospital and the other with her GP) and because of her constitutional sensitivity to warm temperatures we decided to wait for a B2-plus bed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Thus, we waited a further 3 hours.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">12.50am</span></em></strong><strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> – 28 hours 10 mins</span></em></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">At about </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">12 midnight</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, a nurse informed us that a B2-plus bed was available. Preparation was then made to transfer us to the ward. Esther was put on a wheelchair and wheeled to the corridor of the IW. We were so tired from all the hours of waiting. It was only 15 minutes later that we heard the nurse informing the ward, through a phone call, that Esther was ready to be transferred. A further 12 minutes later, a male nurse arrived to wheel Esther to the B2-plus area of the hospital. Esther had waited for about 30 minutes in the corridor. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">It was </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">12.50am</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> on Day Two before Esther finally managed to put her head down on a bed in a B2-plus ward.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">All in all, from registration to being admitted to a B2-plus ward, it took <strong><em>28 hours and 10 minutes. </em></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Nurses were patient, courteous and professional</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Now, before you think that my frustration is directed at the nurses on duty that night, let me say that they were very patient, courteous and professional in their duties. Although they could have done better in some areas – such as keeping us informed of the situation with the availability of the bed – it is understandable as the A&amp;E is a very busy place to work in. The nurses also had to tend to many patients.<br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I would like to mention, particularly, the nurses at the IW’s Fever Zone. They were compassionate and understanding. This is especially commendable when one considers that most of the patients in the IW that night were elderly and weak. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">One of the nurses explained to Esther that the situation has been such since the Chinese New Year. She also said that the wards in </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Tan</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Tock</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Seng</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hospital</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> were fully occupied and patients were being directed to SGH. Hence the shortfall of beds there.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">A serious problem</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Esther was not the only one who had to wait so many hours for a bed. But perhaps she is luckier than others who had had to wait in wheelchairs in the waiting area for hours and hours on end that night we were there – for even the number of beds in the IW is limited.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">While MM Lee may be right that “within one-and-a-half to two hours flat, you’d know what went wrong” (even though in Esher’s case the cause of her illness is still unknown 5 days after admission to SGH), the other important thing is the availability, or the squeeze, on the number of hospital beds.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">According to the nurses there, this is not a sudden or a temporary hiccup. It has been like this since the Chinese New Year, as earlier mentioned.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">While we trumpet the excellence of our clinical healthcare service (and I don’t disagree with this), it is what happens on the ground to each patient that needs to be looked at.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Waiting for more than 28 hours for a bed is simply unacceptable.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I hope that the Minister for Health, Mr Khaw Boon Wan, will put some effort into solving this problem – especially now that he has been called “the best Health Minister Singapore has ever had” by none other than SM Goh himself. (<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_222196.html"><span style="color: #990000;">Straits Times</span></a>)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">When you are sick and weak, you shouldn’t be made to endure a frustrating and excruciating 28 hours just for a bed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">And I am sure that Esther is not the only one who has had this experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Perhaps the new <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/276541/1/.html"><span style="color: #990000;">Khoo Teck Puat</span></a> hospital in Yishun, scheduled to open in 2010, will help to alleviate the situation. But that is left to be seen.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">One can only hope that </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">’s healthcare system will not become what MM Lee said of the system in the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">UK</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, where he experienced “restlessness and unhappiness” when waiting for 45 minutes for an ambulance:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“There’s no connection between those in the system and the patients..” </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span>-<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">MM Lee,<strong> </strong>(<a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw03/031103to.htm"><span style="color: #990000;">TODAY</span></a>)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">From Esther’s experience, one could say the same for </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">’s system as well.</span></p>

              <p>I know of three cases where children with fever are hospitalized for days and weeks and the doctors never found out the cause.</p>
              <p>This particular case seems to be an indicator that hospital capacity is stretched to its limit. Few possible causes:</p>
              <p>1. increasing population size raise the demand.<br>2. more people getting sick and taking longer time to recover due to multiple environmental factors, new diseases and more drug resisting virus etc.<br>3. more hospital space is designated to serve medical tourists.</p>
              <p>It also show a problem hospitals face: what is the right mix of different types of wards. There might be a Class A or Class C bed immediately available, but both would not be an option for Esther. If that is the case, a capacity-demand mismatch play a part in this waiting game.</p>

              <div class="story_text">I COULD not have been more disappointed with the service I experienced at Raffles Hospital when I went for a medical check-up last Saturday.
              <p>After waiting for about 20 minutes to get a queue number, I was told that the wait would be approximately three hours. I waited for another 20 minutes, went to have my breakfast, came back and read the newspaper - and found that my registration had still not been completed. Then the queue numbers of people who had arrived after me were called. I asked the staff why this was happening, as registration merely required keying in my details, and therefore the queue numbers should be called sequentially. At this point, the staff located my documents and told me to go for the X-ray. Another wait at the X-ray room, but a shorter one this time. After that, I went back to where I had made my initial registration to see the doctor.</p>
              <p>With more than 50 people waiting to see the doctor, I asked a staff member and was told that there are either one or two doctors on duty, and it would be another long wait. When I asked why there were only so few doctors, considering the number of people waiting, I was told that this is how the system works there. I was further informed that my wait that day was in fact considered a shorter wait compared to other days. I asked how that could be possible as I had to wait for at least three hours for services that would take less than 10 minutes.</p>
              <p>For the welfare of everyone going for medical check-ups in Raffles Hospital, may I ask the hospital management to please enlighten us on the reason for the three-hour wait for a simple check-up? Why aren't more doctors deployed to deal with the situation?</p>
              <p>To improve matters, perhaps the hospital's processes could be streamlined, like combining the steps involving obtaining the queue number and registration, since there is seemingly no benefit in separating the process.</p>

              <p><span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Sick child
              waited 1 1/2 hours to see A&amp;E doc</strong></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>  ON THE day the letter, 'Three-hour
              wait at KK's A&amp;E Department' (ST, March 7), was published, my
              son too came down with vomiting, diarrhoea and fever.</span></p>
              <p>  He experienced excessive thirst but would throw up
              shortly after drinking water. As he was showing signs of
              dehydration, my wife and I decided to take him to a hospital after
              midnight.</p>
              <p>  Unfortunately, having missed reading the papers that
              day, we took him to KK Hospital in the belief that we could get
              immediate help at the 24-hour children's emergency ward. How wrong
              we were.</p>
              <p>  Despite being put on the 'priority' list, it was
              only 1 1/2 hours later that we finally saw the doctor. The check-up
              was simple and was over in 15 minutes.</p>
              <p>  We decided to admit him for observation, and for him
              to get some rest. Then came more drama. The admission process took
              some 40 minutes. I was asked to sign in some 10 different places,
              and the staff (whose English was hardly comprehensible) was going
              back and forth photocopying forms.</p>
              <p>  Apparently, we could not send our son up to the room
              before all the forms were completed. It was close to 4am before he
              got to his bed. My wife fell sick the next morning.</p>
              <p>  It seems hospitals here take more care of paperwork
              and payments than of the sick. The fact is that there will always
              be many cases which, although not life-and-death situations, cannot
              exactly wait until the next day. What should we do in such
              cases?</p>
              <p>  I would also like to know if the Ministry of Health
              could publish statistics on waiting times in A&amp;E wards. Also,
              whether there are any guidelines governing this.</p>

              <h3>NSW health minister to fix 'systemic failure'</h3>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">NSW Health Minister John Della Bosca has promised
                          to fix a "systemic failure" that forced doctors at a hospital in the
                          state's west to buy their own medical supplies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mr Della Bosca on Thursday said he had
                          launched an investigation into cash-flow problems at the Greater
                          Western Area Health Service which led to shortages of medical gear at
                          Dubbo Base Hospital.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">"The direct answer is cash flow, and it is
                          totally unacceptable for doctors and nurses to be paying for supplies
                          out of their own pocket," he told Fairfax Radio Network.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">"It is totally unacceptable, if it is true,
                          that doctors and nurses are having to borrow bandaging from local
                          veterinary scientists.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">"I'm immediately having that investigated as of today."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mr Della Bosca said before medical staff went
                          public with their concerns, he had held a meeting with the GWAHS's
                          chief financial officer a week ago.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The meeting had led to the payment of about 5,000 outstanding accounts.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">"Those creditors are now satisfied and supplies have been restarted," Mr Della Bosca said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">"(But) we need to fix the system, there's a systemic failure here and I'm getting to the bottom of it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">"I expect to have it fixed and fixed very quickly."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">A Dubbo-based doctor has said he personally
                          bought equipment so a diagnostic blood test could be processed at the
                          hospital, while nurses also say they often source medical supplies from
                          the local vet.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The hospital's Medical Staff Council
                          chairman, Dr Dean Fisher, said there had been ongoing problems at the
                          facility, but patient care was now threatened.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">"It ... stems mostly from bills unpaid by GWAHS, which stopped supplies being sent up to us to use," Dr Fisher said Wednesday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">"In the past it's been unpaid food bills,
                          unpaid transport bills, now it's affecting patient safety and that's of
                          extraordinary concern."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The GWAHS has brought forward to Monday a meeting with the staff council originally scheduled for next month.</span></p>

              <h3 class="post-title">Healthcare Pricing Singapore Style.....</h3>
              <div class="post-body">
              <p> </p>
              I think our system has gotten better at creative pricing of healthcare services. Even for a person who is concerned about healthcare and keeps a close watch on escalating healthcare costs and how subsidy is being reduced....... I'm really surprised by this one from today's Straits Times forum:
              <div>
              <div><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/RpqyNRK_AXI/AAAAAAAAAQs/hXlM00kbFN4/s1600-h/medsub.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5087574670085914994" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; cursor: hand; text-align: center;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/RpqyNRK_AXI/AAAAAAAAAQs/hXlM00kbFN4/s200/medsub.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>
              <div>If you get 50 pills from the doctor and you're suppose to take 1 per day, it will cost 3 times more than if you're to take 2 per day. Yes, the same 50 pills cost 3 times more if you consume it slower. I know the govt is perpetually worried about people abusing govt aid by consuming more than they really need (e.g. 3 meals instead of 2 meals per day) that is why they give people on PA (public assistance) enough for only 2 meals a day......I don't know they are so cautious to extend these wonderful ideas to healthcare. I guess they are worried that the woman might consume more medicine than she really needs even though it is perscribed by a doctor.</div>
              </div>
              <img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5087573768142782802" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 286px; cursor: hand; height: 116px; text-align: center;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/RpqxYxK_AVI/AAAAAAAAAQc/OzFSDq2ib78/s200/medsub2.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="228" height="107"> A few months ago, I woke up with an <em>extreme </em>pain in my elbow. I went to the GP and he told me I needed to get it checked by a specialist as my joint might be infected. I took some pain killers to keep the pain away andI called up the govt hospital to ask for an appointment. They told me 2 weeks time unless I came in as a "private patient". I didn't know what "private patient" meant to my pocket -$500?, $1000? so I just took more blue painkiller pills and the '2 weeks later' appointment. It was strange that a clerk (not doctor) was at the other endtelling me what my medical options were.</div>
              <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
              <div>Two weeks later I turned up at the hospital and was seen by a specialist:</div>
              <div><strong>Specialist: </strong><em>Lucky Tan right, sit down. What's wrong with you?</em></div>
              <div><em></em></div>
              <div><strong>Me:</strong> <em>I woke up 2 weeks ago and my elbow hurt like hell, the GP asked me to come here and check if it's infected</em>.</div>
              <div><strong>Specialist:</strong><em>2 weeks ago? Does it hurt now?</em></div>
              <div><em></em></div>
              <div><strong>Me:</strong><em>No.</em></div>
              <div><em></em></div>
              <div><strong>Specialist</strong>:<em>In that case, there is nothing I can do for you. Come back again if it hurts and I can run some test on fluids in you elbow joint.</em><br><br>$70 for a 1 minute conversation with a specialist....and that was subsidised!</div>
              <div>The Singapore healthcare system is going to be great! As our Minister Khaw focusses on reducing subsidy at the same time Singapore turns into a medical hub for rich millionaires in the region and beyond, our healthcare industry will enter a Golden Period of high profits. You may think the priority of care depends severity of your sickness - ah that is so old fashion in modern Singapore Inc. You want treatment fast, just pay for it - be it dental care, elbow pain, etc. The poor can afford to wait and the rich can afford to pay.</div>

              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is part one of a three-parts chronological treatise on healthcare issues over the last 2 years or so, like means-testing, non-priority for subsidised rates healthcare, wards down-grading, medical fees competition, costs of medicines and alternatives, healthcare spending, MediShield, ElderShield, implications for foreigners, PRs and Singaporeans, etc.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">What will the future of healthcare be like for Singaporeans? What are some issues that we may need to be concerned with? What are your fears? What sort of healthcare system do you want? How do we compare with other countries?</span><span> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Here are the first 3 issues with our healthcare system.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">F1. May 2007 - <strong>REVERSE MEANS-TESTING:</strong> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Singapore%20Healthcare%20System/Tantockseng.jpg" border="5" alt="" width="180" height="150" align="left">I went to the Travellers’ Health and Vaccination Clinic at </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Tan</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Tock</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Seng</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hospital</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> for a Yellow Fever vaccination recently. The charge was $130.20, compared to just $15 for the same vaccination I had at the same clinic 10 years ago. This is an increase of 768 per cent or a 24 per cent compounded increase per annum. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The clinic was furnished lavishly with leather sofas, leather chairs, paintings on the walls, flowers in vases, etc, like a five-star hotel. The same vaccination costs about HK$200 (S$39), A$50 (S$63) and 35 euros (S$72) in </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hong Kong</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Australia</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Ireland</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, respectively. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Why has the cost of vaccination increased by so much over the last 10 years, when inflation in Singapore was less than 2 per cent per annum? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">When I paid the $130.20 fee, the staff gave me a brochure and said that if I had a platinum credit card, I would receive a 12 per cent discount for health screening.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Why do the more affluent who qualify for a platinum card get a discount of 12 per cent, whereas the lower income have to pay 13.6 per cent more, in a government restructured hospital? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Is this not, in a way, like reverse means testing - the rich pay less, the poor pay more? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">F2. April 2007 - <strong>ELDERSHIELD</strong>: </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Singapore%20Healthcare%20System/old1.jpg" border="5" alt="" width="140" height="180" align="right">The MOH has announced that the two insurers of ElderShield will give a one-time rebate to policyholders because of low claims relative to the premiums collected, since the scheme started.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Why pay a rebate, and increase premiums at the same time? Why not just use the excess funding accumulated to reduce future premiums or increase benefits? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">At the end of last year, there were about 750,000 policyholders, with a total of 2,366 successful claims. About 16 per cent of claims declined. The claims payout last year was about $8.5 million (2,366 claims x $300 monthly x 12 months). </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Even if we assume all 750,000 policyholders paid the lowest premiums at age 40 of $169.74 (male $148.84 + female $190.63 divided by 2), premiums per year were $127.3 million ($169.74 x 750,000 policyholders). </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">This means the claims ratio was only about 6.7 per cent ($8.5 million in claims but $127.3 million in premiums). </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">As the 2,366 claims were the cumulative total for the four years since the scheme started, the claims payout over premiums per year is actually much lower. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">What was the claims ratio for each of the four years of the scheme? I believe this may be the most profitable insurance scheme in the history of insurance in any country. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">How much profit has been made since the scheme started? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Notwithstanding the proposal to increase the monthly payout by $100 and the payout period from five to six years, in view of the above, how is it possible that the proposal now is to have existing policyholders pay a one-off adjustment to make up for lower premiums paid in earlier years under the current ElderShield scheme, increase premiums of about $10 a month for the older age group, and have policyholders registered automatically for the new scheme after September pay premiums of $1 to $2 more a month? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">As to the opt-out rate having gone down steadily from 38 per cent when the scheme was launched to 14 per cent last year, there are 1.26 million residents (Singaporeans and PRs) aged 40 to 64, according to the Department of Statistics’ ‘key statistics demography Singapore residents by age group end June 2006′. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">So, isn’t the opt-out rate about 40 per cent (with about 750,000 policyholders among 1.26 million residents)? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Does the Ministry of Health’s study on the opt-out rate refer to the current opt-out rate of new entrants who reach age 40, or the overall opt-out rate of those eligible?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">F3. April 2007 - <strong>HOSPITAL WARDS DOWNGRADING</strong>: </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Singapore%20Healthcare%20System/Cclassward2.jpg" border="5" alt="" width="190" height="150" align="left">The Health Minister clarified in Parliament on April 10 that downgrading to subsidised wards is a two-day process and his plans to introduce means testing in hospitals within a year. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Some Singaporeans who can afford higher class wards might be reluctant to opt for them, fearing that their hospital stay might be prolonged due to unexpected complications and the charges incurred might exceed their Medisave account balance, medical insurance and cash reserves. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Thus, higher-income Singaporeans might opt for Class C or B2 subsidised wards if, for example, they believe that they could be required to stay in hospital for longer than, say, five days. The logic is that if it’s five days or less, they might think that they can afford the luxury of higher class ward facilities. But, since there is always the possibility of them staying for an indefinite period, they might think it is better not to risk opting for a higher class ward. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Now that this worry is being exacerbated by means testing, the problem of overcrowding in Class C wards may get worse. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In any case, when the Class C or B2 ward is full, one can go to a higher class ward and still pay the lower rates. So, why risk opting for a higher class ward in the first place? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this regard, I would like to suggest that patients and their families be assured that if they opt for a higher class ward, and end up staying for much longer than expected, such as over three weeks, they will automatically be allowed to downgrade to C class or B2. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">This may result in fewer people opting for C class or B2 on admission to the hospital.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Singapore%20Healthcare%20System/B2classwards.jpg" border="5" alt="" width="190" height="150" align="right">Currently, those who opt for a higher class ward, and subsequently request for downgrading, are subject to means testing — this I believe is what Singaporeans fear most. Thus, this may be the root cause for many patients opting for subsidised wards. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">It was clarified in Parliament that it takes two days or longer to process a ward-downgrading request, if patients are unable to produce the relevant documents to support their applications when means-testing is involved.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Only those with a per capita family income of $1,000 a month or lower can downgrade to Class B2, and $500 or lower to Class C. For outpatients applying to downgrade, it takes an average of two weeks to secure an appointment with a medical social worker to assess whether the patient qualifies. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">So, for say a three-person family with a household income of just $1,501 a month, downgrading to Class C is not allowed. Only 1 per cent of patients in Class A or B1 wards who sought to downgrade were successful. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Judging from this, no wonder Singaporeans are opting for lower-class wards — due to the fear of not being able to downgrade.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 24pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Public toilets at NUH in shocking state</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: small;">BETWEEN Feb 3 and 11, I had to go to National University Hospital (NUH) daily because a family member was hospitalised. The medical care was excellent and the nurses professional and kind. However, the standard of hygiene in the public toilets left much to be desired. <span style="color: #ff0000;">To put it bluntly, they were disgusting and, given our reputation for cleanliness and efficiency, quite disgraceful.</span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: small;">I had to use the men's toilets on the ground floor and the shared individual cubicles on the sixth floor regularly. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The floors were inevitably sopping with used paper towels strewn about. The toilet seats were broken, unhinged, wet, stained or all of the above. Needless to say, the stench was unbearable.</span></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: small;">What I found most distressing was <span style="color: #ff0000;">the sorry state of the shared cubicle outside the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)</span> on the second floor. Metres from what is supposed to be a sterile environment, the tap above the sink in the cubicle was not even working. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There was no sterilised mat at the entrance of the ICU, which meant anyone who had just stepped out of the toilet would carry whatever creepy crawlies their shoes picked up from the wet floor into the ICU.</span></span></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: small;">Excuses of constant human traffic and insufficient cleaning staff cut no ice with me. The standard of hygiene in a hospital is supposed to be - pardon the pun - whiter than white. If NUH cannot rely on toilet users to be civilised, it should increase the number of times the toilets are cleaned every day. "</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">  Of nearly 1000 buildings inspected by the Public Utilities Board over the past month, 49 were found to have sanitary pipes above water tanks. The PUB said the <strong>management corporations of the 49 affected buildings have been asked to redirect the sanitary pipes or relocate the water tanks.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">  <strong>Bukit Timah Plaza's management corporation is facing legal action for gross negligence in allowing sewage to contaminate the building's water supply system.</strong> <strong>The filthy water has made at least 65 people fall ill since last week.</strong> The Public Utilities Board (PUB) and the Ministry of Environment (ENV) said on Thursday 23 Aug 2000 that their investigations showed that the management corporation had "grossly neglected its duty" to maintain the complex's water supply and internal sewage-piping systems. </span></p>
