              <p>Some MPs and residents keep asking stupid questions.</p>
              <p><strong>Q1)  What have the opposition done in their constituencies in the past?</strong></p>
              <p>They have voted the PAP to serve them, and then they asked why the oppositions never do anything for them. WTF are they talking about???</p>
              <p>It’s like a Sohai bought a HP PC with 5 years service. 5 years later, HP and Dell trying to sell him a new PC. He asked Dell that why Dell never service his PC in the past. Then he said HP is  good because HP has been serving his PC for past 5 years.</p>
              <p>In the past, the residents didn't given the opposition a chance to serve them. They should not expect the opposition to do same as the elected MP. The elected MP has 5 figure pay leh.</p>
              <p><strong>Q2)  Can the opposition deliver?</strong></p>
              <p>Some people think that is like order a pizza, they will get the pizza in 40 mins.</p>
              <p>The oppositions are sharing their views and direction for their election campaign. So that those people that have the same view will support them. I believe that they will do their best to make their agenda happen. But they are not the ruling party. They have no control over the Ministries and Statutory Boards.</p>
              <p>When they have 2/3 of the seats, they can surely deliver. By that time, you see whether the PAP can deliver.</p>

              <p>Wait , i think as stupid as i am , i can answer the first question.  The opposition parties have gotten the apologies for us Singaporeans who have been suffering and not listened to for the past 5 years from the PAP MPs.</p>
              <p>That is a small step forward.</p>
              <p>Now the big step, send in the opposition parties to the Parliament House.</p>

              <p><strong>i would like to address the following question as follows:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Q1)  What have the opposition done in their constituencies in the past?</strong></p>
              <p>opposition cant really done much in PAP held area is as follows:</p>
              <p>1. PAP thru its funded organisation like PA( people association) denied opposition candidates the use of RC and CC and void decks( town council deny).</p>
              <p>just imagine even until now, mr low thia kiang and Mr Cham still conduct Meet the ppl session at the void deck!!, yes void deck. because PA which control the RC deny them to use their facilities. But dont forget that PA is funded using taxpayers money, Singaporean money!</p>
              <p>2. jerrymandering the electoral boundaries. PAP know the opposition has limited resources as they do not have PA as their extended arm which received govt funds. you might be trying your best to get connected with XX GRC, but come next election the boundaries is shifted.</p>
              <p><strong>Q2)  Can the opposition deliver?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Have HG and PS turn into real slum?  </strong>are we goign to close an eye on resident of HG and PS which pay same amount of taxes, ERP, COE be deny the chances for lift upgrading( LUP)? dont forget this upgrading by the PAP is also govt funded that is singaporeans money. the PAP use our money to do upgrading for you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>é£Žé›¨å�ŒèˆŸ how to justify where HG and PS resident are swimming besides the boat!!</p>
              <p>i dont stay in above 2 areas but i believe in justice and equality. I was move when i hear nicole seah citing the singapore pledge. time to have a believe!!</p>
