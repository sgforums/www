BUt my theory is simple, they didnt label the typhoon only being second to the F-22 for nothing.</div></blockquote>When the French will tell you that the European consortium that builds the Typhoons/EFA are wrong in the sums... the Rafale is better in the area of Avionics, stealth and costs.<br><br>You are right, both frames are equally matched. I reckon RSAF should consider Typhoons if they want a fighter whose primary role is air-defence, secondary role is deep-strike/CAS. If they wish to have a fighter that excels in deep penetration strike and can hold its own in air to air combat, then choose the Rafale... Depending on how RSAF sees the role of the Vipers, I think the decision is then fall on the role of the new type of fighters. Then again, perhaps RSAF should just get the Super bugs.  It is just as equally good. Maybe wait for the Super bugs to get the new electronic steered phase array radar with Terrain following and Synatic Aperture capabilities rather than the present radar which is essentially the same as the C/D versions.<br></div>

As for the Wild Weasel version of the F-18, its the EF-18G Growler, now still a concept. The JSF would be a long term replacement for the F-16, I strongly believe.....<br><br></div>

He ordered the Tomcat production line shut down and the equipment destroyed.<br>When he was Sec of Defense back then, He was also the Senator of (Dunno where) where Boeing production plant was located.

USN hasn't got a operational sqn of Superbugs till last month... I don't think they are yet to be deployed on any aircraft carriers. Bombcats are still the main workhorse for any deep strike penetration stuffs... C/Ds for the tactical strike and CAS roles.... Anyway, the real reasons for the bombcats roles are actually more for the fact that the lost of A6s means that the carriers need something to fill the void.  Will have to see how good the Bombcats are in the near future... anyway, the Phoneix capability will definitely be missed when the Tomcats say bye bye to the serivce.</div>

The first unit, VF-41 Black Aces is on their way back to CONUS on Enterprise, and once the arrive will trade in their F-14s for the F-SuperBug. The CAG bird pic is already up on VF-41 website.<br><br>Its a pity really, I've seen Tomcats on the 3 carriers I've visited before, and I just feel in terms of looks and capability the SuperBug is nowhere close. One interesting thing was that mechs from all 3 carriers did say that even though its good, the Tomcats (even the Bs and Ds) are bithes to maintain due to their age, so I guess its replacement was inevitable<br><br>AIM-54 is actually more for defeating heavy bombers, not a really relevant weapon today.

The Backfires Bears and Badgers it was designed to kill can't either, but any fighter pilot who spots the -54 early has a big chance of getting away, particularly in a tailchase. I'm not too sure about the '99 engagement, but I seem to recall that the Iraqi jets were MiG-25, not exactly spring chickens when it comes to dodging missiles, but they still got away relatively easily...<br><br>Flankers for the navy might make military sense, but any active US service member who even makes such a suggestion can kiss his military(and any political) career goodbye. Its just not good form to suggest that the US gets weapons from the Russians. I do agree that it makes military sense though, I have seen analysis that the Flanker was aerodynamically the best fighter there is, but let down by generally substandard engines and avionics. Can you imagine what kind of performance a Flanker using Western engines of a similar size to the Russian ones can churn out??</div>

Given that the the US always think that they produce the best stuffs, I cannot see this option will even be remotely considered.  Anyway, Boeing and Lockheed will make sure that this will not happen too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> hee hee<br></div>
