This sum of money is not worth spending and i hope the government won't overdo it by purchasing Aircraft Carrier, where the hell are we gonna find pilots to fly the jets there when we already have so many planes on land bases. The latest i know is the development of the Terrex AIFV and the LWSPH 155mm Howitzer. This is shown in the latest pioneer. However, plans of building a new light tank or MBT have never been talked about. Maybe they are planning it secretly?!? Who Knoes? Who can be trusted, the ans is NO ONE! not even your friends and everyone around you. Lets take TOM CLANCY'S books for example, the book" EVERY MAN IS A TIGER" reveals many thigs, maybe some are not top classified secrets, but GEN Chuck Horner (ret) did talked about it.Many other books also the same. anybody reading the book i mentioned? I've not finish reading.<br><br></div>

Carriers can... disappear (hide from enemy view) in times of crisis by moving into the international seas and oceans, while still able to launch strike mission at our enemy.<br><br>7. a carrier can extend (power project) singapore protection of its SLOC all the way to .. whereever u want.<br><br>8. a carrier can be use as backup runway for RSAF planes which cannot land because the ground runway is in bad shape.<br><br>9. a carrier can be used as a command ship for amphibious operation and providing air cover for the amphibious forces without the need to have RSAF fly long distance to cover the amphibious units all the way from singapore.<br><br>and there are many more benefits of a carrier.<br><br>the sad part is that... a carrier cannot stand alone and u need a huge fleet to protect it.<br><br>secondly... a carrier if sunk... remain sunk. a ground runway damaged, can still be repaired.<br><br>thirdly.... a carrier would no doubt invites huge big giant alien looking barbaric mouth frothing, red eyed jeolousy and outrage from the 'superior race' up north.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore does not exactly have a sy1 system to protect naval forces from long range missiles.

The AMX-13SM1s we have now, are nothing but cannon fodder.  What I submit for a possible replacement would be a the latest Sheridan light tank.

Leo 1 A5 is only a 40 Tons platform whereas M60 A3/Sabra is at leas 55 Tons. M1A2 is even  much bigger in the size of Leo2A5/6.<br><br>Perhaps you were thinking I was talking about Leopard 2 instead of Leopard 1<br><br><strong> </strong><blockquote><strong><br>I'd still prefer 60+ Typhoons over the Rafales.<br></strong></blockquote>But if you look at the avionics suite, Rafale is acutally more advanced than the Typhoons. One might one to go with the Typhoons only for the fact that they employ US/NATO weapons (eg. AMRAAM) rather than the French made missiles.  Then again, Rafale can be easily adopt AMRAAM/Sidewinders combination too.<br></div>
