            <div class='col-md body'>Do you know the root cause why people are suffering dropping wages and diminishing CPF ?<br><br>Is it because of globalization or people squandering their monies with unwise use of their cpf as often presented by the government?<br><br>Just common sense. The root cause is not difficult to find. The government has promised to restructure the economy for years to value-adding technology driven model but what has happened? Obviously there is a lack of practical implementation master minds or talents.<br><br>All that the government has done is talk only with very little talents who could implement their talks.<br><br>At the same time it has continuously jacked up costs of living by all kinds of direct and indirect taxes with overcharging of citizens on land costs by themselves and all their GLCs and loading of their own hyper-salaries and that of the whole of public service which today is much too high as compared with private sector equivalents.<br><br>Now the whole system so created by MM Lee himself due to years of relentlessly wrong policies cannot be sustained by the economy, that is why.<br><br>It is a double whammy with wrong policies and failure in economic restructuring on the one hand worsened by over-charging the people with direct and indirect taxing on the other.<br><br>Such two sided squeeze has caused stagnation of the domestic economy for years now without admission of problems.<br><br>Under such circumstance salaries cannot grow and property stagnated for years wiping out large chunks of their cpf and savings.<br><br>Do you know now why people have not enough saving or cpf because of wrong policies for years without change.<br><br>Read again today's radio 95.8 listeners' call-in feedbacks on why many ordinary people are not doing well. Most listeners are giving the feedback that the relentless cost push-up by government for years has been the principal cause for many people being unable to maintain their household expenditure not to mention inability to look after their ageing parents.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The root cause can also be derived from a consistent inability by the government to realise that they have to shoulder an equitable portion of the burden faced by the elderly and the retired.<br><br>It is an ideological problem, which they have not yet realised. They talk of pragmatism all the time, failing to see that they have adopted certain views on certain issues that are often too inflexible.<br><br>Some realities are fixed, and non-negotiable. <strong>The role of the government to care for the elderly is one of them.</strong>.<br><br>The earlier they recognise this truth, the better for us all.</div>
