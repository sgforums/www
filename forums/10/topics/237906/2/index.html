            <div class='col-md body'>Sonthi wants many things. And it is quite ironic that he should ask for state intervention in purchasing something that is seen as vital to Thai national interests, while at the same time, he and his bunch of weed-whackers lambasted us for using state funds to purchase their assets hiding behind a cloak of a "independant" agency.<br><br>If he wants it back, he'll have to buy it back.At the prevailing market rate.Regardless of the ethics of our initial purchase, Shin Corp is a privatised firm, and if the Thais want to retain their international credit and investment rating, they better stop making inflammatory statements. Don't blame us for your inability to foresee that your own PM might privatise your telecommunications and sell it off in a jiffy, blame yourselves for not paying heed to what has been going on in Asia for the past decade.<br><br>And the Democrat Party, what a joke. One minute they are campaigning for a return to democracy and the removal of Thaksin, the next minute they are cosy bedfellows with Sonthi. I'd like to see them wriggle around the sheets when the Council for National Security starts appearing either inept or begins to clampdown on a steadily rising tide of unhappiness and popular feeling amongst the people that they are not doing much in terms of their coup promises and the Pattani problem down south.<br><br>Technocrats generally do not know much about running a nation with such diverse demographics and political affiliation. A regime that came to power in a coup promising democracy and accountability will not stay in power by playing a zero-sum domestic political agenda and freezing pro-Thaksin supporters from the political discourse of the day.</div>
