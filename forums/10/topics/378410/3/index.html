              <p><br>i am suprised that you this taiwanese "hum" know how to see you own foes fight but yet know little or nuts about monopoly. monopoly to you it seems may be an old game, but somehow you tend to overlook that monopoly also means power and control,seriously..computers may do a better job that your assumed thinking of this board game but it can't till now totally replace the real point of it: monopoly is a test of ones skill in control and power, a very grave oversight that seriously overlooked.it also tells us now in this country one fraction is losing the monopoly thru it's unpopular reforms and trying to seal it up with FT/FW,not knowing that it would also backifre on them. the fundementals they set up abt 40 years ago was the safeguards to protect the locals and that is being slowly tweaked against what it was design to do.Perhaps you this "hum" also cannot comprehend the oldest rule in goverance-"the people ARE the foundation of the goverment." not the other way round.</p>

              <p>As was expected, the "zwei-siao-HOG" had to return to accurately expose its hot gas intelligence as it attempts to fight its way out of a corner that it paint itself into.</p>
              <p>Only a "zwei-siao-HOG" will buy the PAP reasons for its own grass-root leader to be more important than a Member of Parliament elected by the citizens to represent them in all their interests with the Government.</p>
              <p>Was MP Low from WP not the elected MP that was the subject of the discussion ?</p>
              <p>How did the "zwei-siao-HOG" arrived at its conclusion that MP Low was not free and that PAP Eric should officiate at the ceremony ?</p>
              <p>It had to take a dumb ass in a "zwei-siao-HOG" to suggest that elected MP "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Low should stand beside Eric and stare hard at him</span></em>" - as Eric proceed to perform the ceremony instead of MP Low.</p>
              <p>How did the "zwei-siao-HOG" arranged for MP Low to suddenly be free and have him to stand next to PAP Eric to stare hard at Eric ?</p>
              <p>Only the "zwei-siao-HOG" will have the stupendous abilities to tie both of its feet with its teeth, even as it has a whole mouthful of CSJ's dickie that it will hold with such tenacity with its front paws.</p>
              <p>One need not wonder why a "zwei-siao-HOG" will be so fascinated with CSJ's dickie to torment itself into perpetuity.</p>
              <p>Only an impotent "zwei-siao-HOG" will continue with its fascination in CSJ's dickie and his balls - as it envy the guts and willingness in CSJ to bring the fight to the PAP.</p>

              <p><br>i am suprised that you this taiwanese "hum" know how to see you own foes fight but yet know little or nuts about monopoly. monopoly to you it seems may be an old game, but somehow you tend to overlook that monopoly also means power and control,seriously..computers may do a better job that your assumed thinking of this board game but it can't till now totally replace the real point of it: monopoly is a test of ones skill in control and power, a very grave oversight that seriously overlooked.it also tells us now in this country one fraction is losing the monopoly thru it's unpopular reforms and trying to seal it up with FT/FW,not knowing that it would also backifre on them. the fundementals they set up abt 40 years ago was the safeguards to protect the locals and that is being slowly tweaked against what it was design to do.Perhaps you this "hum" also cannot comprehend the oldest rule in goverance-"the people ARE the foundation of the goverment." not the other way round.</p>

              <p><br>And how deep inside your levis jean will hide the purse in the Taiwanese 'hum' ?</p>
              <p>If "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">knowledge is in eye of the beholden</span></em>" - it certainly does not seem to be in you, as you do not seem to be beholden to any knowledge that is evident in the ignorance that is spread by your dependence on your 'clitoris' that replaced your tongue.</p>
              <p>Do you have any "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">views and knowledge</span></em>" that is "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">gain to share</span></em>" - which anyone will be interested to absorb ?</p>
              <p>With your expertise in ignorance and verbiage, is the "1 dollar cent" the value of a Taiwanese 'hum' - or is this another useless exercise as an "Attention Seeking Whore" ?</p>
