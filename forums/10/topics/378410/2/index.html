              <p>I was there during one of my long business trips</p>
              <p>It was pretty interesting. German restaurants costs about 10+ Euro per person. If you choose something like pork ribs, it could even be less than 10. Beer is dirt cheap. Supermarkets affordable.</p>
              <p>People are generally nice, they treat people pretty well, regardless of nationality.</p>
              <p>Working is comfortable, people tend to be helpful when meeting face to face, and they will do their utmost to make you feel at home.</p>
              <p>Factory Outlet experience is AMAZING. Each of the building is like a Paragon building. Branded wear over there is very affordable. There's a Hugo Boss Outlet there that is really cheap. You can get a Hugo Boss shirt at about 30 Euros. You see Germans buying bags and bags of outlet sale items.</p>
              <p>What do we have in Singapore? Everything, but they all cost much more than other countries.</p>
              <p>Face it, Singapore is too expensive, and our salaries are artificially suppressed. It can only get worse as years go by (Inflation continues, but salaries continue to lag behind)</p>

              <p><br>The "Fascist Hog" is in its glorious best with its "zwei-siao" responses.</p>
              <p>Not satisfied with its "zwei-siao" idea of having Low playing second fiddle to a non-elected PAP representative - by having Low standing next to the PAP representative and simply stare at him when he make the announcement - and having its "zwei-siao" idea demolished, all the "Fascist Hog" can do is get into a kiddie tantrum..</p>
              <p>This confirms again that "fascism" is bankrupt, which has been revealed in the many bankrupt positions taken by a "zwei-siao-hog" that were so easily demolished.</p>
              <p>What more creative ideas can be expected from the bankrupt mind of a "Fascist" - but a pathetic display of its impotence to make any dent with its "Fascist" remark ?</p>
              <p>It is not a surprise that the "Fascist" will be more creative with its familiarity with the faeces that only a "zwei-siao-hog" has the expertise to play with.</p>

              <p>Actually, he won't. It's been some time since  I went to PAP/YPAP's web site, but the last time I visited there, there was similarly a lot of unhappiness with the PAP being posted as well. So unless the mods there have gotten less lazy and been doing a lot of "preening" to keep up the illusion of being popular; I wouldn't count on him being happy there. Haha...</p>

              <p>firstly, I support what Mr Low TK has done, for if we are talking about proper channels, he should have done it, not the advisor or anyone else.</p>
              <p>secondly, given how Mr Low TK has voiced out, I feel that he has a strong support/base in hougang.</p>
              <p>I think slowly, people are starting to "lose" the fear of having their benefits "curtails" like in opposition wards,such as PP or Hougang.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the  citizens who have benefited most from the LKY's era are slowly declining. So a lot of people now, will be questioning the ruling party what they can bring instead of past glories.</p>
              <p>So the next GE will be rather interesting..</p>

              <h1>Sylvia Lim rebuts Ministry of National Development on behalf of Hougang MP Low Thia Kiang</h1>
              <p>The Chairman of the Workers’ Party, NCMP Ms Sylvia Lim has written a
              reply to rebut the letter by Minister for National Development’s Press
              Secretary entitled: “Ministry: MP Low wrong on lift upgrading” which
              was published on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Ms Lim took issue with MND’s reply which seems to imply that the
              grassroots advisor was more appropriate than the MP to announce the LUP
              plans because he was able to gather residents’ input and marshal
              support for the plans.</p>
              <p>The PAP grassroots representative for Hougang Mr Eric Low sparked a
              public backlash when he unshamedly claimed credit for bringing LUP to
              Hougang two weeks ago which led many Singaporeans to question why the
              announcement was not made by the MP for Hougang, Mr Low Thia Kiang
              instead.</p>
              <p>Writing on behalf of Hougang MP Mr Low Thia Kiang who is currently
              out of town, Ms Lim wrote that Mr Low’s letter was not about claiming
              credit for LUP:</p>
              <p>“He (Low) has stated that he is prepared to work with the
              government’s appointees for the benefit of his constituents, and indeed
              has met the grassroots advisor several times over many months to give
              input on the LUP plans for Hougang.”</p>
              <p>She added sarcastically that the LUP was introduced “to rectify a
              design flaw in public housing which does not cater for an ageing
              society. Given this imperative, the public interest should trump
              politics.”</p>
              <p>According to Ms Lim, Mr Low was “compelled” to write the letter to
              Straits Times Forum because HDB’s initial reply to Mr Yusuf who had
              written in lampooning HDB and PA for not following protocol seems to
              insinuate that Mr Low was unwilling to work with the government.</p>
              <p>Mr Eric Low had earlier revealed that he enjoyed a cordial working
              relationship with Mr Low Thia Kiang and the two even had coffee
              together after the last meeting on the LUP.</p>
              <p>Ms Lim also rebuked MND’s claims that LUP Is funded from budget
              surpluses which Opposition MPs are not responsible for generating.</p>
              <p>She wrote that the budget surpluses are hardly the effort of the
              government alone, as they include significant contributions from the
              public through taxes, levies and stamp fees, which the government
              simply reaps.</p>
              <p>Ms Lim ended the letter by berating MND for not respecting the people’s choice of their MP:</p>
              <p>“Finally, MND also appears to interpret the General Elections as an
              event where the only outcome which matters is who forms the government.
              This shows the respect the government has for the people’s choice of
              Member of Parliament, who is vested with the Constitutional mandate to
              represent the constituency.”</p>
              <p>The PAP won 82 out of 84 seats contested during the last general
              elections. The two opposition wards are Hougang and Potong Pasir which
              were denied critical estate upgrading by the PAP government because
              they did not express “support” for the government’s plan.</p>
              <p>Upgrading was constantly used as a carrot to entice residents to
              vote for the PAP though being taxpayers, they are entitled to it.
              Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong had promised a $100 million upgrading
              plan for Hougang and Potong Pasir if the PAP candidates won.</p>
              <p>Though Mr Eric Low lost to Mr Low Thia Kiang, he still lingered
              around in Hougang as the “grassroots adviser”, an euphemism for PAP
              losers.</p>
              <p>The PAP government has drawn online flak for choosing to work
              through their unelected representatives instead of the opposition MPs
              who are voted in by the residents.</p>
              <p>Unless more opposition MPs are voted into parliament the next
              election, this age-old “practice” promulgated by the PAP is likely to
              continue.</p>

              <p>It is about time for the "zwei-siao-Fascist-Hog" to hang-up its infatuation with CSJ's dick in its closet, and hope that its "zwei-siao" scrawny dick of a typical "Fascist Hog" will grow into a size worthy of the more human form - that it can only fantasize to have - <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"even it it's a few years wait"</span></em></p>

              <p>Did I state that the LUP be delayed until a PAP MP gets elected or that Aturdie can wait a century till Chee Soon Juan gets elected to be his MP? Stop sucking on Chee Soon Juan's little dickie and wake up to reality.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Another good example of blatant disrespect for oppositions PAP showed was back in 2006 election.    The unpopular SENG HAN TONG blatantly humiliated Mr Low Thia Kiang on national TV.    He crowed like a rooster to insult Mr Low.   This ugly scenerio spoke ill of PAP and Seng Han Tong.   This is a good example of how arrogant the ruling party is.</p></div>
