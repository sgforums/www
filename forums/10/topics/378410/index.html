              <p>Every time I come across an article like this, I get even more convinced that Singapore is (and possibly has never been) truly democratic. Even if we don't support the opposition, should we not respect them? Should we not give them their rights and respect (the correct) authority?!</p>

              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><strong>From our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">After keeping a dignified silence for a week, Hougang’s Member of Parliament Mr Low Thia Kiang has finally struck back at the PAP and HDB for unceremoniously sidelining him in the announcement of the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP). (read Mr Low’s letter <a style="color: #a91b33; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/10/10/low-thia-kiang-no-basis-for-mp-not-to-announce-lift-upgrading/">here</a>)</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">PAP’s grassroots adviser and loser in the last general elections in Hougang, Mr Eric Low, claimed credit for bringing LUP to Hougang in a press conference last week.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">Mr Eric Low was reported in the media to have said:</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em>“Though I was not elected, I have been trying hard to lobby the authorities including National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan to upgrade the lifts in Hougang. Now that the lifts will finally be ugraded, I am extremely satisfied about it.”</em></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">Hardly hiding his displeasure at the attention-seeking antics of his rival, Mr Low Thia Kiang shot back in his letter:</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em>“The HDB deems the grassroots adviser as the appropriate person to announce the lift upgrading programme because he gathers input from residents, ensures that the plans meet residents’ needs, can propose changes based on residents’ feedback, and seek residents’ support.</em></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em>On what basis does the HDB assume that the Member of Parliament, who has the support of the constituency’s electorate, is unable to do the same and is therefore inappropriate to play the same role as the adviser?”</em></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">HDB and PA had earlier replied in the Straits Times Forum that “<em>it is the Government’s practice to implement its national programmes for residents through advisers to grassroots organisations who are appointed by the Government to gather feedback from residents.”</em></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan, who entered Parliament via the “back door” after losing to Mr Chiam See Tong in the 1984 elections in Potong Pasir, went as far as to say that he does not expect non-PAP MPs to explain LUP:</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em>“I don’t expect the MP who’s not … a PAP MP to explain why LUP is like that, why we need co-payment, what the co-payment is all about. The adviser is always the one doing it, and it’s no different this time round.”</em></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">Mr Low Thia Kiang went on to castigate HDB for “not respecting” the well of the people in elections by liaising directly with the PAP losers instead of the legitimate and rightful MP in charge of the ward.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em>“This says much of the respect of the ruling party for the will of the people expressed at general elections and how mature we are as a democracy,”</em> he ended.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">The use of supposedly non-partisan government agencies by the PAP  to undermine the authority of the opposition MPs has sparked a public backlash against its perpetuators.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">In a poll conducted here, 96 per cent of over 500 respondents agree that it should be the opposition MP who made the announcement of LUP instead of the PAP losing candidate or in PAP jargon – its “grassroots adviser”.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">An irate Singaporean, Mr Muhammad Yusuf wrote a scathing piece to the Straits Times Forum a few days ago lampooning Mr Eric Low and Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, the PAP’s grassroots leader in Potong Pasir for announcing the news of LUP. (read letter <span id="sample-permalink"><a style="color: #a91b33; text-decoration: none;" href="http://singaporeenquirer.sg/?p=4741">here</a>)</span></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">He wrote:</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em>“Mr Low justified his announcement of the programme by saying it was the usual practice, even in PAP wards, for the grassroots adviser to lead the programme.</em></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em>My question: Under what authority did both Mr Low and Mr Sitoh act as advisers to the grassroots organisations, given that the People’s Association is a government statutory board and should work with the elected MPs of the constituencies?”</em></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">Many netizens also question the political affiliations of HDB and PA which are supposed to be apolitical and neutral government agency and statutory board respectively.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><strong>rointan1 </strong>casts aspersions on the neutrality of PA:</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em>“Sanjai Devmurari (of People’s Association), you didn’t address the pertinent question of why People’s Association appointed PAP members as “advisors” in opposition party wards!!</em></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em>Why are all the grassroots advisors for the 82 PAP wards the elected PAP MPs, but not for Hougang and Potong Pasir???</em></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em>Just admit that People’s Association is NOT non-partisan! It is just an instrument of PAP.”</em></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><strong>Commentator </strong>questioned why the PA was involved in the running of town councils:</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em>“What has the PA got to do with the running of Town Council?</em></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em>The PA is a government organ not a PAP organization such as the PAP Foundation which runs kindergartens.</em></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em>Therefore, for the PA to work only with PAP advisers and not the elected Member of Parliament of Hougang and Potong Pasir is tantamount to a govt body (the people’s public servants) taking part in partisan politics which i believe is illegal and prohibited.</em></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em>Only in Singapore can such blatant behaviour be allowed without consequence.”</em></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><strong>Legoass</strong> puts in bluntly:</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em>“These 2 clowns are trying to defend the indefensible!! PA and HDB are all working for PAP.”</em></p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">After 44 years of uninterrupted one-party rule under the complete dominance of the PAP, the boundary between the party and state have become increasingly blurred.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">The incumbent has cleverly made use of its access to state resources to buttress its position in the government and curb the growth of the opposition in Singapore.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">For example, the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee which is lambasted for the rampant gerrymandering to dilute and dismantle blocs of opposition support in various constituencies is appointed by the Prime Minister who is from the PAP.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">As a result, no opposition has managed to win a GRC since its introduction in 1988. In that year and in 1991, Eunos GRC was won narrowly by a margin of 50.1 per cent by the PAP. It “disappeared” from the electoral map in the 1997 elections.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">Similarly, the hotly contested Cheng San GRC was won by less than 55 per cent of the votes by the PAP during the 1997 elections. Cheng San GRC was never seen again in subsequent elections.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">Singapore’s Election Commission amazingly comes under the auspices of the Prime Minister’s Office instead of being an independent non-partisan organization.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">Due to its control of treasury, the PAP often threatens residents that their estates will be deprived of upgrading and “turned into slums” if they do not vote for them.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">The two opposition wards of Hougang and Potong Pasir were denied much needed upgrading by HDB though residents living there pay taxes and serve National Service like the rest of Singapore.</p>
              <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;">Though many Singaporeans are displeased with the way the ruling party has manipulated the system to perpetuate its hegemony, there is little they can do sa the police, media and grassroots organizations are all under its tight-fisted control.</p>

If we do, then, we must say categorically, without qualification, that no restraint from the any democratic processes, other than by the ordinary law of the land, should be allowed... If you believe in democracy, you must believe in it unconditionally. If you believe that men should be free, then, they should have the right of free association, of free speech, of free publication. Then, no law should permit those democratic processes to be set at nought, and no excuse, whether of security, should allow a government to be deterred from doing what it knows to right, and what it must know to be right... "- <em>Lee Kuan Yew, Legislative Assembly Debates April 27, 1955</em> <br><br>"Let us get down to fundamentals. Is this an open, or is this a closed society? Is it a society where men can preach ideas - novel, unorthodox, heresies, to established churches and established governments - where there is a constant contest for men's hearts and minds on the basis of what is right, of what is just, of what is in the national interests, or is it a closed society where the mass media - the newspapaers, the journals, publications, TV, radio - either bound by sound or by sight, or both sound and sight, men's minds are fed with a constant drone of sycophantic support for a particular orthodox political philosophy? That is the first question we asked ourselves. I would like to see minds stimulated and debate provoked, and truth refined and crystallized out of the conflict of different evidence and views. I, therefore, welcome every and any opportunity of a chance to agree, or to dissent, in order that out of thesis comes synthesis - thesis, anti-major premise, anti-premise, synthesis, so we progress... I welcome every opportunity to meet members of the opposition, and so do members of my party, over the radio, over the television, university forums, public rallies. We never run away from the open encounter. If your ideas, your views cannot stand the challenge of criticism then they are too fragile and not sturdy enough to last. I am talking of the principle of the open society, the open debate, ideas, not intimidation, persuasion not coercion... Sir, the basic fundamentals we asked ourselves...is whether the duties of the Minister of Information and Broadcasting are to produce closed minds or open minds, because these instruments - the mass media, the TV, the radio - can produce either the open minds receptive to ideas and ideals, a democratic system of life, or closed and limited. But I know that the open debate is a painful process for closed minds...But let me make this point: that 5 million adult minds in Malaysia cannot be closed - definitely not in the lifetime of the people in authority. It is not possible because whatever the faults of the colonial system, and there are many...they generated the open mind, the inquiring mind." <em>- Lee Kuan Yew Dec 18, 1964 Malaysian Parliamentary Debates </em></span></p>

              <p>After the shock of being thrown out of Malaysia on 9 August 1965, when LKY publicly cried his crocodile tears - (no one knows if those were tears of regret or bitterness) - there seems to be a change in his political attitude, which seemed to have hardened.</p>
              <p>His methods in dealing with political opponents became desperate, impatient, aloof, arrogant, ruthless, and equal to the methods employed by Stalin.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>The lessons in fixxing the Political Opponents became the Handbook of political survival, and after each election is followed by internal reviews and plans to tie up the loopholes to prevent any success for the opponents in the next election.</p>
              <p>At the same time, moves were made to fix the opponents in the judiciary system, to bankrupt the political opponents or to tie them down with legal procedures that will cost them dearly - especially when the Judiciary began to charge for the time of the courtrooms, and all the judiciary personnel involved.</p>
              <p>Democracy exist only in the word appearing in the political jargon used by the Ruling Party as a Public Relations propaganda, when in fact the Democratic Practice of Politics in Singapore is no better then in Zimbabwe.</p>

              <p><br>Why does anyone need to stay in the Istana ?</p>
              <p>The Istana was the residence of the Colonial Governor-General of Singapore.</p>
              <p>The Prime Minister's Office was originally at City Hall since self-government in 1953.</p>
              <p>When the Governor-General left Singapore after Singapore merged into Malaysia, the first Head of State of Singapore - Yang di-pertuan Negara Ishak Yussof - took over the Istana, and the PM's office continued to be at the Istana.</p>
              <p>The Istana continued to be the exclusive use of the President through Benjamin Sheares, and it was during C.V Devan Nair's term as President that the PM GCT had decided to move his office from City Hall into the Istana Annexe, and followed soon after by the office of then SM LKY.</p>
              <p>Was the move out of sheer vanity to share the shine of the President's vast estate, when both GCT and LKY moved their offices to the Istana annexe that is next to the main Presidential building.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If anyone has read the Animal Farm, the hogs were condemning the Farmer who exploited the animals for the profits that helped the Farmer lived in luxury in the Farmer's House within the Animal Farm.</p>
              <p>After the animal took over the Farm, and the Farmer had to leave his own Farm, the Hogs took over the Farmer's house, and the Hogs will soon be seen to begin walking on their two hind legs.</p>
              <p>The Hogs then took to the tasks of giving orders and ensure that the Animal Farm continue to tick like a clock, so that the profit continue to roll in - and to improve the Farmer's House - but not the Farm.</p>

              <p>Here again, the X-rated kiddie has confirmed its stupendous X-rated reading ability, as shown repeatedly in its X-rated scores in comprehension to the issues posted.</p>
              <p>Was the issues about HDB making the announcement for LUP through grassroot leaders, or was it about the correct channel for the announcements to be made by the People's ELECTED Representatives to Parliament ?</p>
              <p>When was the grassroot "leaders" elected by the citizens in the Community ?</p>
              <p>Was the LUP program not a program from tax payer's money, or is the program funded by the PAP ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, the X-rated kiddie's thought process is that of a X-rat acting on behalf of his beloved PAPa.</p>
              <p>Do we need to know the motivation for a X-rat to blind side the real issues and help PAPa to cover its obvious mistake in using public funds to boost PAPa's image ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>As far as I am concerned, even though only a nobody and insignificant, I rejoice with my fellow citizens, some whom are my family, relatives and friends,  who are getting the LUP, regardless in any political controlled ward. Their lives will be improved and properties be increased in value.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The shameless persistence of a X-rat to claim association with the larger community of citizens can only be seen as a desperated attempt to get into the midst and form a typical saboteur's scheme at attacking the community from within.</p>
              <p>If there is any honesty in a X-rat to speak on behalf of its family members - who are more human in form then the resident X-rat -  one will hear the cursing of its family members to being forced to contribute to the LUP works, when the HDB had been short-sighted to design building plans without the fast ageing population in mind.</p>
              <p>We now have the ridiculous situation where at a single block of HDB flat, there will be at least four to six new vertical lift shafts added to the existing one or two - as these blocks have been designed in vertical column of two units per floor facing each other, vertically linked by stairwells to common passage ways that horizontally connect at the intermediate Levels 4, 8 and 12 - (and all depends on the overall number of floors at each block) - where the old lift shaft will terminate at these floors only.</p>
              <p>How much more will the property value increase, as the property edge towards the 99-year lease expiry date ?</p>
              <p>Obviously again, the X-rat kid knows little about property values becoming lower as its age gets closer to the expiry date of the lease.</p>
              <p>Obviously the X-rat will indulge again in the mindless polishing of a painful subject to make it shine bright enough to numb the pain, and all done for the sake of PAPa.</p>
              <p>Is there any honest thought that is original for the interests of the humans, whom a shameless X-rat claim to be fellow-citizens ?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The political hacks seem to be at the X-spot that marks the position of the X-rat, which has shown consistent ability to justify the senseless policies that impoverish Singaporeans, while attempting its level X-rated best to gloss over the mistakes and ignore the injustice committed against loyal Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The X-rat is at its best when it wields its dumb intelligence to hack at the honest thoughts of Singaporeans as it blindly defends its beloved PAPa's position.</p>
              <p>This is the honest picture that matters when the X-rated background clutter is removed, and the X-rat is seen in all its naked glory of deceit and plagiarizing quality.</p>

              <p>Is the X-rated kiddie attempting to prove what has been said more then a few times in its dubious X-rated standard attempting to do everything but never achieving any ?</p>
              <p>Since when was anything said that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">moving into 'official govt residences' an offence</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Is the idiocy not in the X-rated supreme ability to interpret more then it can read ?</p>
              <p>How did the X-rat conclude that "<em>vanity</em>" is equivalen to an "<em>offense</em>" ?</p>
              <p>The X-rat thought process seems to be drifting into the realm of the Talibans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The White House has always been the residence of the US Presidents - is there any quarrel that you have with that ?</p>
              <p>The idiocy again reveals in the poor reading and thinking abilities of a X-rated kiddie anxious to show its true quality as a X-rat - attempting to put words into a storyline that it has shown X-rated ability to comprehend.</p>
              <p>The X-rat's idiocy in relating a storyline to the real world situation has again been confirmed in its total inability to exercise any quality to be discerning and circumspect.</p>
              <p>It is unable to judge for itself the facts of the real world as it stands but to plagiarize any ideas that will suit its own political argument.</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that it can get skewed so badly with facts to relate to a storyline in defense of the Hogs in the Animal Farm, as it will so blindly defend his PAPa in real life ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another amazing statement made by the X-rated reading ability of a village idiot that will blindly plagiarize any statement made by others into its own statements even as there are no relevant context in the entire reading.</p>
              <p>Did the chimpanzee exist in the Animal Farm ?</p>
              <p>Was there anything written about the Gorillas being overthrown and the chimpanzee to be installed in its place ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps the X-rat intend to takeover the Farm for its own use ?</p>
              <p>Are you qualified to speak on behalf of all Singaporeans - as if anyone will even care to listen to a X-rat's opinion ?</p>
              <p>The stupidity has been shown in the X-rat continuous failure in its over anxious efforts to sink my position, as it continue to be trashed more then a few times across all the threads when the X-rat's failed arguments have been consistently exposed for the dumbness in facts and in the quality of thinking.</p>
              <p>The X-rat should stand in silence and listen to the sound of the ocean roaring through its brain, so as to understand how much more space need to be filled before the X-rat should attempt to speak on behalf of Singaporeans.</p>

              <p><br> Perhaps this Speakers' Corner is not suitable for you since you are
              so negative about the crowd and so on here.  
              You may wanna go surf PAP website and the forum (if there is any) I
              believe you will be happy reading those.   Happiness

              <p>And I don't see any rule in the disclaimer when I signed up an
              account here that I must adhere to the topic. Don't understand why
              xtreyier is taking upon himself the responsibility of telling
              people to stay on topic when he's neither the moderator nor the
              forum owner. Perhaps he secretly wants to be a moderator? <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>If you notice, these days those who come here with opposing views on disagreeing with the crowd here claim they are well travelled or stay overseas for long.  All those I meet who claim they stay overseas or are well travelled, about 90% of them prefer overseas and have more good things to say about other countries than Singapore.</p>
