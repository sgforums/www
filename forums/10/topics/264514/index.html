He was here, as were other members of PAP central executive. So was I and numerous other newspapermen who refused to work for the Japanese.<br><br>The threat of death or imprisonment does not scare away anyone who believes in freedom -- the freedom of the individual to think, to read or to write as he pleases, within the confines of the laws of the state.<br><br>And there are laws in Singapore which ensure that sedition can be punished by the courts and that those found guilty of the offence can be sent to jail.<br><br><strong><span class="small">BUT MR LEE PREFERS TO USE THE PRESERVATION OF PUBLIC SECURITY ORDINANCE INSTEAD OF THE SEDITION ORDINANCE</span></strong>.<br><br>A strange choice for a man who once opposed this same Preservation of Public Security Ordinance in these words:<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">"What he (the Chief Minister) is seeking to do in the name of democracy is to curtail a fundamental liberty and the most fundamental of them all -- freedom from arrest and punishment without having violated a specific provision of the law and being convicted for it</span></strong>.<br><br>And again: <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"If it is not totalitarian to arrest a man and detain him when you cannot charge him with any offence against any written law -- if that is not what we have always cried out against in Fascist states -- then what is it ?"</strong></span> </span><br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: brown;"><span class="large">What Indeed ?</span></span></span></strong><br><br><span style="color: darkgreen;">Mr Lee cannot have his cake and eat it. He must choose between democracy and totalitarianism. And so must his supporters.<br><br>His supporters, like Mr S Rajaratnam, a former president of the Singapore Union of Journalists and a former member of the staff of The Straits Times.<br><br>Mr Rajaratnam, writing in October 1955, in the Singapore Journalist, organ of the SUJ, on "The Press and Mr Speaker" had this to say:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"The press is fair game for touchy politicians. In recent months the local press has been accused of wilful distortions of weighty and lengthy pronouncements by gentlemen who are struck by the facts that they do not read as well in print as they sound.<br><br>"Believing as we do in free speech, we think that politicians are perfectly entitled to air their views on whether a newspaper or a journalist has done justice to their speeches. "But it is a different matter when differences of opinion as to sub-editing could result in a newspaper or a journalist being denied facilities which are normally obtained in a free country</span>... </span><br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: brown;"><span class="large">City of Merdeka</span></span></span></strong><br><br><span style="color: darkgreen;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"It is to be hoped that when they (the Assemblymen) cry 'merdeka' (with or without a clenched fist), they mean also 'merdeka' for the press and pressmen who have no objection to having their ears boxed.<br><br>"All they ask is that they be allowed to carry on their pleasant and unpleasant duties of reporting and commenting with the greatest possible freedom.<br><br>"There will not be that feeling of freedom if a newspaperman feels that he can be kept out of the Assembly by the Speaker, whose decision cannot be questioned."</span><br><br><strong><span class="small">AND MR RAJARATNAM SHOULD AGREE THAT NEWSPAPERMEN WILL NOT HAVE "THAT FEELING OF FREEDOM" IF THEY ARE DETAINED IN PRISON BY A GOVERNMENT WHOSE DECISION CANNOT BE QUESTIONED</span>.</strong><br><br>However that may be, Mr Lee and Mr Rajaratnam should know their newspapermen better.<br><br>Threats will not prevent a good newspaperman from publishing a story which he considers should be published, or from commenting on an issue which is vital to the common good.<br><br>The Straits Times will continue to publish the news and honest opinion, whatever the consequences -- even if the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance is invoked against individual newspapermen.<br><br>Mr Lee and his comrades should think again<br></span></blockquote></span><br></div>
