              <p>I agree my friend, that is why I said in the other thread, I dont think it is really relevant or on-target for SDP to protest to government or parliament about rising prices.</p>
              <p>From my understanding, Singapore practice free market economy. From what we read, there is a worldwide rising price of commodities, like oil price, food price, and this has affected many countries, including Singapore.</p>
              <p>So, Im not sure Singapore government has the power to affect this global phenomenon, and it doesnt seem to result from some failed SG government policy which caused it, nor does it seem that the government can issue a policy which can fix it. Maybe SDP need to ask some opinion from some economists for their analysis and what is the remedy. From the part of the SG government, Im sure they have asked their economists and taken whatever steps it can take.</p>
              <p>So....Im not sure SDP really has much of a reason to protest to anyone....maybe protest to the world markets....go stand at SGX, or a wholesale market, instead of parliament, but that doesnt make sense, does it ..?</p>
              <p>But another issue here......police arresting people who waive placards...yes this is quite sad....to me the sad part is that Singapore could have been the best place in the world in terms of order and safety, but when we look at how this is achieved, we see that some things are also inserted inside by the maintainer or manager of this order and security, which really remove any expression by the rest of the people, who are without any intent for any disruption or violence whatsoever.</p>
              <p>This makes people wonder whether this is really the right arrangement, and whether the manager is actually looking after his own interests by using the excuse of order and security, which is indeed well maintained.</p>
              <p>Quite sad.</p>
              <p>To me there is only 1 solution...</p>
              <p>If really the majority of people dont mind, well then, just  ammend the constitution. Put it there,  people cannot hold demonstrations.</p>
              <p>Hold a referendum if neccessary. Then put it there.</p>
              <p>Then moral legitimacy is there.</p>
              <p>So every time police need to arrest 10 people or 18 people with children, at least there is no problem.</p>
              <p>Not like now, people with children waiving placards, expressing their opinions, in accordance with their right in the constitution, are arrested by the police, on the reason of maintaining order.</p>
              <p>I just find it a little sad.</p>
              <p>What u want..? One way or the other? Make a choice and stick with it. Do the people have the right or not..? Yes or no? Dont say yes, but practice it with a no. Yes or no?</p>
              <p>If it is written as 'yes', then....there is a problem here because people then think they can do it, and then u have to come up with all sorts of roundabout excuses to prevent them from doing it, and that tarnish ur own reputation when people see that u cheat.</p>
              <p>So I say, the only real solution, permanent solution with moral authority is...to hold a referendum, and ammend the constitution to ban demonstrations. This will carry a strong moral legitimacy and once and for all settle this uncomfortable situation.</p>

              <div class="itembody"><a href="http://newsintercom.org/index.php?catid=2"><img src="http://newsintercom.org/skins/base/Columns.gif" alt="Columns" align="right"> </a> March 11, 2008<br> <br> Singapore is a parliamentary republic in which the People's Action
              Party (PAP), in power since 1959, overwhelmingly dominates politics.
              The population was approximately 4.6 million, with foreign workers
              accounting for nearly one-fifth of the total. Opposition parties exist,
              parliamentary elections take place at regular, constitutionally
              mandated intervals (most recently in May 2006), and the voting and
              vote-counting systems are fair and free from tampering; however, <strong>the PAP placed formidable obstacles in the path of political opponents. </strong>The
              PAP held 82 of 84 elected parliamentary seats and all ministerial
              positions. The civilian authorities generally maintained effective
              control of the security forces.<br> <br> <strong>The government has broad powers to limit citizens' rights and to handicap political opposition, which it used. </strong>Caning is an allowable punishment for numerous offenses. The following human rights problems were reported: <strong>preventive
              detention, executive influence over the judiciary, infringement of
              citizens' privacy rights, restriction of speech and press freedom and
              the practice of self-censorship by journalists, restriction of freedom
              of assembly and association, limited restriction of freedom of
              religion, and some trafficking in persons.</strong> <br><br> <img title="US Secretary of State Rice" src="http://www.newsintercom.org/media/226/20080311-condi-rice.jpg" alt="US Secretary of State Rice" width="240" height="180"><br> <br> Living in Singapore one can attest to the accuracy of the US State Department's assessment.<br> <br> This begs the question whether we have honorable leaders in power when
              they stand accused of such low-down tactics to stay in power.<br> <br> It begs questions whether the government uses power to further party
              interests instead of the majority of the citizen's long term and short
              term interests. It begs questions on accountability, transparency and
              nepotism.<br> <br> It begs questions on whether the preferences of certain groups are placed over and above the preferences of the other groups.<br> <br> When thinking people look at how dishonorable people are in power, it leaves a bad taste in the mouth.</div>

              <h5>Compare and contrast, Singapore vs Penang:<br></h5>
              <h5><br></h5>
              <h5>Protest against new government</h5>
              <p> </p>
              <p>GEORGE TOWN: A group of people gathered around the
              Komtar building here yesterday to protest against the DAP-PKR
              coalition government.</p>
              <p>The crowd demanded that the state government leave the New
              Economic Policy (NEP) alone and also called on Chief Minister Lim
              Guan Eng to ensure that the Malays would not be marginalised under
              the new state administration.<br> <br> They said he should not turn Penang into another Singapore.<br> <br> Police, including light strike force personnel, were on standby as
              the crowd started to gather in Jalan Magazine after Friday prayers
              about 2.15pm.<br> <br> They carried banners decrying attempts to abolish the NEP and
              calling for support for Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's
              leadership.</p>
              <p>North East district police chief assistant commissioner Azam
              Abdul Hamid later ordered the crowd to disperse after informing
              them that police had not issued any permit for the gathering.<br> <br> Also present were state Umno leaders including former deputy chief
              minister Datuk Seri Abdul Rashid Abdullah, Umno secretary Datuk
              Azhar Ibrahim and Bukit Mertajam division chief Datuk Musa Sheikh
              Fadzir.<br> <strong><br> The crowd dispersed peacefully after shouting slogans for about 45
              minutes. Police did not arrest anyone.</strong><br> <br> Azhar said that the gathering was organised as the Malays wanted to
              vent their anger against the state government's stand on the
              NEP.<strong><br> <br> Lim said the state government did not have any problems with the
              gathering.<br> <br> "It is all part of freedom of speech. However, I am surprised that
              they did not give me any memorandum.</strong><br> <br> "This is the first time a demonstration has been held but those who
              organised it did not have any memorandum to be submitted," he
              said.<strong><br> <br> Lim said the newly-formed state government was willing to listen to
              what the people had to say, including those from Umno.</strong></p>

              <p>i think it is rather silly of you to compare sdp's rally with the penang protest. the penang protest was organised by umno, the main party of the ruling coalition, of course there will be no arrest!</p>
