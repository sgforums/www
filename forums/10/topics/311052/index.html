              <p><strong> 10 arrested for protesting against rising prices</strong></p>
                  <p>SINGAPORE police on Saturday arrested 10 people for holding a rally
                  without a permit to protest against rising living costs, witnesses
                  said.</p>
                  <p>Leading pro-democracy activist Chee Soon Juan was among the group
                  who were bundled into police vans after plainclothes officers stopped
                  them in front of a shopping mall in the business district, an AFP
                  reporter and photographer said.</p>
                  <p>Chee is the leader of the Singapore Democratic Party, one of
                  a handful of opposition parties in the city-state, which has been ruled
                  by the People's Action Party since 1959.</p>
                  <p>About 18 protesters, including children, had earlier gathered
                  outside parliament where they symbolically laid groceries on a
                  sidewalk.</p>
                  <p>The police then stopped them just minutes after setting off
                  for the Orchard Road shopping area, where they had planned another
                  protest.</p>
                  <p>They wore red t-shirts with the words 'we cannot take it anymore' while others carried placards denouncing rising prices.</p>
                  <p>The 10 were arrested after ignoring police calls to disperse and lay
                  down their placards, the witnesses said. Chee's activist sister was
                  also apprehended.</p>
                  <p>Singapore, scarred by racial riots in the 1960s, has strict
                  laws against public assembly, which require a police permit for a
                  gathering of five or more people. -- AFP</p>

              <p class="abstract">GEORGE TOWN: A group of people gathered around the Komtar building here
                  yesterday to protest against the DAP-PKR coalition government.</p>

              </table>
              The crowd demanded that the state government
                  leave the New Economic Policy (NEP) alone and also called on Chief
                  Minister Lim Guan Eng to ensure that the Malays would not be
                  marginalised under the new state administration.<br><br> They said he should not turn Penang into another Singapore.<br><br> Police, including light strike force personnel, were on standby as the
                  crowd started to gather in Jalan Magazine after Friday prayers about
                  2.15pm.<br><br> They carried banners decrying attempts to abolish the
                  NEP and calling for support for Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's
                  leadership.<p></p>
              
              <p>North East district police chief assistant commissioner Azam
                  Abdul Hamid later ordered the crowd to disperse after informing them
                  that police had not issued any permit for the gathering.<br><br> Also present were state Umno leaders including former deputy chief
                  minister Datuk Seri Abdul Rashid Abdullah, Umno secretary Datuk Azhar
                  Ibrahim and Bukit Mertajam division chief Datuk Musa Sheikh Fadzir.<br><strong><br> The crowd dispersed peacefully after shouting slogans for about 45 minutes. Police did not arrest anyone.</strong><br><br> Azhar said that the gathering was organised as the Malays wanted to
                  vent their anger against the state government's stand on the NEP.<strong><br><br> Lim said the state government did not have any problems with the gathering.<br><br> "It is all part of freedom of speech. However, I am surprised that they did not give me any memorandum.</strong><br><br> "This is the first time a demonstration has been held but those who
                  organised it did not have any memorandum to be submitted," he said.<strong><br><br> Lim said the newly-formed state government was willing to listen to what the people had to say, including those from Umno.</strong></p>

              <p>yea..1964....er huh..1964....yes yes..1964.....its all about 1964.....is singapore police still wearing shorts? nope? y not? 1964 they wearing them wasn;t they?, they should still be wearing it since they just love mentioning 1964 at any oppertunity when arrest is made at a protest.. now u know y your pm says "everyones happy, because no one is protesting outside city hall..".. lol..</p>
              <p>Wake up lar please... you know how many civil and internal war america had?  would a protest be deemed illegal for them becuz every sizable protest (4 people and above in s'pore case) would led to a probable chance of a reoccurence of this riots in the past? no of course not.. but then i guess pap disagrees, they just think majority of singaporeans are imature and might resort to violence if they dun keep things keep under control... thats the picture ... whether you like it or not.. xD</p>

              <p>It is only in this 'democracy" that the foundations of free speech is viewed as a threat to security. what freedoms have we scarificed at the altar of sercurity of a nation's mere assests? that of speech. that of worship. that of fear. and now with prices soaring, we are in danger of never gaining freedom from want. If these 4 freedoms seem familiar, they were the roots of all democracy, they were what the orginal American constitution were formed on, they were written by citizens for citizens, they were as just as justice could get in this shithole we live in.</p>
              <p>The men on top uses fear to keep the population in control and fear as a uniting force. fear to take away your civil rights. "racial riots in the 1960s?" in comes the ISA, internet monitoring, political censorship and ultimately, conscription. "9/11". and the American constitution is ripped apart, the bill of rights burnt down.</p>
              <p>hang the drug dealers, beat the thieves and robbers but when you arrest people for reasons as such mentioned above, you believe your own lies. It's all downhill from here folks.</p>
              <p>It is highly, highly paradoxical to assume a moral society can be built out of fear, fear of punishment. We're going straight to hell.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree that democracy under Abdullah Badawi has been given some space to grow. They let Anwar speak in the election rallies although the state media did not report on them. I hope he stays on because Najib or Mr M's son are as autocratic as Mr M himself. In this mind, Abdullah think about the next generation of young Malaysian, many of whom went to western countries to study and brough home the "god given gift of democracy" and how he can win them over in the next election. I have more confident of Malaysia becoming a freer and more democratic country. But for Singapore, I don't know what its future, can't read the minds of our leaders...a bit depressed.</div>
