If chee has a debate with LHL, you know who will lose. Anyway chee is not a threat anymore because he has been backcrupted, he wont stand for elections any more. The real threat is still mas selamat.

              <p>Got me thinking.</p>
              <p>LKY is just a lawyer, he had people around him that set up the policies, he was just their mouthpiece.   Over the years most of these people have stepped down and let younger people take their place.   LKY is still there claiming credit for everything.   Did he really do as much as he says he did?</p>
              <p>Which got me further thinking.</p>
              <p>Cause of our strategic location on the map, Singapore was already a triving port before LKY was born.   Is our growth really just because of him?</p>

               Correct, i think he should just take a token pay as he has more than enough money for 3 generations to live luxuriously without working.
              
              And to quote the man himself: can he sleep "with a clear conscience" at night? i can't.

              <p>older generation of singaporeans are more naive. so long they have 3 sq meals a day and a roof over their head, they are contented.</p>
              <p>these people were brought up in hostile environment where abject poverty and social instability were rampant in the 40-50s. one of the school teachers punishment back in the 40-50s were kneeling on bottle caps and smacked across the back with huge rotans. they have little concept of what is human and civil rights.</p>
