            <div class='col-md body'>If minister Ng Eng Hen become the education minister, it is doubtful he will impart good values to our future generation/<br><br>Education is concerned not just with learning of knowledge it is about bringing up good citizens to serve the country.<br><br>Education should be governed by someone who has the broad-minded vision about how to motivate citizens to study and work hard and cultivate good moral values like willing to serve the country with honor, honesty and integrity and how to utilize all talents including the practical non-academic talents needed to build the country in every field.<br><br>From his speeches so far we can see him as not so interested in upholding moral values of citizens and loyalty to serve their interests.<br><br>He is the ministers who openly resorted to importing of foreigners to make up for losses due to brain drains caused by anti-people policies.<br><br>He is also the minister who openly supported the policy to increase ministers' salaries without considering the ethical or moral values of being a minister in service of the country.<br><br>So we do not expect him to have good moral or ethical values to impart to the future generations.</div>

He is another minister who does not listen to his people but only his own voice.<br><br>His value system represented by all his utterances so far can be summed up in one phrase:<br><br>"The government is always right" even although he is only governing on the assumption that we need foreign talents which citizens do not have.<br><br>For everyone of the foreign talent issued with skill permit, we can easily find that the skill he thought the citizens do not have are actually available among our citizens.<br><br>Due to imperfection in the employment market place, the employers tend to miss such potential skill employees that is all. He had not tried hard enough to convince employers to look harder so the poly or ITE graduates with the skills are often bypassed in favor of foreigners who of course need to be retrained or trained to fit the jobs the employers are looking to fill.<br><br>In the same way the government is only looking for talents among only their own connection so many potential talents are not given the opportunity to serve the country. Therefore the government can claim difficulty in engaging talents and have to increase their own salaries to do so - just nice they can reward themselves at the same time by taking monies of the people under their nose.</div>

The surgeons and many medical professionals who enjoyed good earnings at Mount Elizabeth or Lucky Plaza had to scale down their operations.<br><br>After the financial crisis of 1997 there was another drop in Indonesians seeking medical treatments at our private hospitals so many doctors have seen their earning dropping.<br><br>So without doubt it was not quite correct for MM Lee to claim those surgeons were making millions and even if they did before the crunch they could see their incomes dropping.<br><br>So it is more likely to be a relief to be offered a minister's million dollar post at that time when better ones like the Lim Kim San or Goh Keng Swee equivalents were not given the same opportunity or bypassed.</div>
