            <div class='col-md body'>You are damn right about Singtel's monopoly, and it is restricting the growth that should be for Singapore, but then again, companies are mostly after profits, who cares about your growth when their company is growing faster with more profits rolling in month after month.

However, 3 new operators and 1 existing operator (Starhub) will be starting their operations. If I didn't remember wrongly, it would be around March this year. They have already received the go-ahead by the government to start business.<br><br>But this doesn't mean you will have cheaper broadband plans. As Singapore is a small country with that limited number of people, they may decide to charge higher.</div>

One of the operators that is starting is a foreign company. A China company to be specific. Have heard some rumours about what this company is going to offer. The rates they are offering are very attractive, comparable with those in HK and China (although higher). Not quite sure if the government will try to slot any government officers inside. As this is a foreign company, I think the government will be doing some planning before they consider slotting one in.</div>
