              <p>@@@@@@@@</p>
              <p>I will talk abt the costs ,benefits and risks of this project.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1.Costs</span></strong></p>
              <p>---US 7 billions to build</p>
              <p>---I dunt know if this include so many bridges crossing the 700 km pipe line.</p>
              <p>---damages and dividing to properties and land</p>
              <p>---damages to environment</p>
              <p>----You need an extra fleet of VLCC to transport oil (refined or raw)to</p>
              <p>Japan,China,Korea etc.Currently,u just need one fleet.</p>
              <p>----costs and time of unloading from VLCC to Yan in Kedah</p>
              <p>and then pumping to Bachok in Kelantan.U need energy to pump</p>
              <p>the oil through the 700 km pipe line.Right?Then u need to load into</p>
              <p>VLCC and ship to customers in Asia!!</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.Benefits---</span></strong></p>
              <p>----reduce risks to pirates</p>
              <p>---save time.But how much time can be saved?</p>

              <p>is happy that their land is divided.i dunt know the details of the project.</p>
              <p>Local resistances ,plus the local politicians can give the project</p>
              <p>a lot of troubles.</p>
              <p>----The long pipe line is subject to local and foreign attacks.</p>
              <p>U cant turn the pipe line into Berlin Wall.Right?</p>
              <p>--Very hard to get finance.</p>
              <p>----From the points of view of oil owners and ship operators,will they</p>

              <p>can they save in time and cost?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.NEVER TURN THIS PROJECT INTO IRON FISTS</span></strong></p>
              <p>This is  stupid ,if not dangerous,to turn this project into a spring board</p>
              <p>for any country to jumo into a bigger political stage in the world.</p>
              <p>Or,if u turn this pipe lines.if successfully completed,</p>
              <p>as a iron bar to threat the throat of any countries,u are as good</p>
              <p>as declaring wars.</p>
              <p>No country,big or small,nearby or far away,can tolerate that</p>
              <p>the sea lane of oil import is choked!!</p>
              <p>If u force oil owners and ship operators to use this pipe</p>

              <p>Deals signed on pipeline that seeks to divert Malacca Strait oil<br>Posted: 28 May 2007 1505 hrs<br> <br>KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian, Indonesian and <strong>Saudi Arabian firms</strong> on Monday signed agreements for construction of a pipeline that aims to divert 20 percent of oil flowing through the strategic Malacca Strait, the project owner said.</p>
              <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>My suggestion to Singapore is to import more fake degree holders from China, sponsor their education, give their mothers allowance money, allocate quotas in universities to them and give them civil servant positions.</p>
              <p>Also, to build more casinos and raise rental and housing prices.</p>
              <p>Sure can win over these kind of silly Malaysian nonsense.</p>

              <p><br>This is another one of the ignorant posts from the resident "hum" that simply have to display its idiocy irregardless if there is any basis for the reckless remarks made.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The "vege and durians" are mostly in the sides of hills and mountains located around Ipoh, Tapah, Cameron Highlands, and up to Penang.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The pipeline is located almost next to the Thai-Malaysia Border that is clearly more then 200km near any vegetable or durian farm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can oil flow uphill ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps the froth that flows from the useless "hum" will defy gravity and flow upwards to the "twat" located at its head ?</p>

              <p><br>Perharps you mistook the reality of not building. Last year oil price reach over a hundred a barrel. The cost of no building might reach $300 a barrel.</p>
              <p>It is both political and economical...the region look at this to reduce the reliance on the strait and also the West. Most of these projects are invested by both the chinese and Iranian.</p>
              <p>MY interest is to reduce the economics power house by Singapore so that it shelve the little armed race that is going on.</p>
              <p>But all in all Singapore refinery center proof to be a bottleneck especially with our limited land and resources. The question is how can we benefit from the line.</p>
              <p>Finally the stabilities of Price.....if you understand the coorelation between intended demand the stabilities of resources...The pipeline and  the speed of deliveries would help to stablizes some of the premium that we tag onto Oil future market.   </p>
              <p>Like i said it would reduce some of the high paying jobs in Singapore......more jobs loss.  </p>

              <p>Singapore only has an 85% <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>share of the design and construction market</em></span> for the off-shore rigs - which makes Singapore the No 1 specialist in this field.</p>
              <p>Singapore is ranked globally as the No 3 in Export Refinery Center, and still has no influence on the price of Crude Oil - which is determined by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).</p>
              <p>The price of refined oil products such as the different grades of petrol, diesel, kerosene, lubricating oils, and other by-products such as aromatics for perfume, plastic resins, and synthetics - are all determined by the Oil Companies, which vary their selling prices based on the input costs from OPEC.</p>
              <p>The retail prices sold to Singapore Consumers are determined by the Oil Companies with the Singapore Government collecting 44 cents per litre irregardless of the price.</p>
              <p>This provides the Government a rich source of continuous revenue, while the Oil Companies are said to be having only a thin margin from the retail price.</p>
