Anyway, looking at the rate Taiwan is going, I think they have better give Mr Ma a chance to lead the nation.  So far the opposition, xie chang ting, keeps attacking Mr Ma with words and have not spoken on what he will do to help Taiwan when he is elected.  Just find the whole DPP crap!   Xie chang ting and the DPP has no credibility.</div>
