              <p>To me, the "causeway versus bridge" debate is a relatively straightforward issue. I am not sure what kind of "conspiracy theory" you have. But I hope it is backed by some kind of logical assessment and not just based on your usual unsubstantiated allegations.</p>
              <p>Why do you think the Malaysian wants a bridge? It is to facilitate access and departure by ships to and from their port in Pasir Gudang.  With the causeway, ships currently have to sail around Singapore, thereby making it less attractive for shippers to use Pasir Gudang port. Therefore, Singapore must be an idiot to spend millions of dollars to replace the causeway and end up increasing competition for our own ports in Pasir Panjang.</p>
              <p>Bottomline is that the bridge benefits Malaysia at the expense of Singapore.  It is therefore not in our national interest to agree to the bridge proposal.</p>
              <p>You agree with my assessment? </p>

(yeah right). Singapore used to be as clear as the Maldives... it's the stinking PSA which corrupted our waters, they should be bankrupted for doing that to our environment.</p></div>

              <p><br>The Second Link at Tuas was an entirely Malaysian idea - like the Third Link that they are proposing to connect Singapore's Changi area to the South-eastern area of Johor that will provide direct access to the very undeveloped areas of Desaru to Mersing, and the entire East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia.</p>
              <p>If you noticed, almost 90% of the Second Link falls on the Malaysian side, and only 10% of the Second Link bridge is on the Singapore side, and paid for and built by Singapore Contractors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you know the length of the entire Straits of Johor that will need to be dredged ?</p>
              <p>Do you know how slow a process a "bucket dredge" operate and the cost of continuously dredging the sea bed that keeps getting silted by the many large rivers that flow into the Straits of Johor ?</p>
              <p>How many "bucket dredge" do you think will be needed to keep the newly cleared depths of the sea channels from being filled up again - especially when after moving to a new area, then the old area needs to be attended to again ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Suez Canal or the Panama Canal is a concrete water way that are operated by compartmentalised flood gates, operated in tiers to bring the vessel across a narrow isthmus.</p>
              <p>The Thais had wanted to build such a canal across the Isthmus of Kra in Southern Thailand, and which they believe will be a very attractive proposition to the VLCC that travels from the Bay of Bengal to the South China Sea, and avoid the narrow Straits of Malacca.</p>
              <p>This plan has been mooted since the mid-1980s, and this time they have been able to mobilised the financial support, but the engineering works have yet to be started, while the security situation in Southern Thailand remains hot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The bridge that the Malaysian are proposing to replace the Causeway is supposed to be a suspended bridge, and to allow for ships to sail below - this suspension bridge will necessarily be sufficient high for safety and to be of practical use.</p>
              <p>You are right that to mention that the approach roads leading to a bridge of such height will need to have some space to avoid a steep incline.</p>
              <p>The approach for vehicular traffic has been catered via the newly opened Johor ICQ facilities that had the motorways all built and truncated due to the aborted bridge.</p>
              <p>However, the paradox in the Malaysian position is that even as much as they wanted the Singapore Government to co-operate with their idea in replacing the Causeway with a suspended bridge - the Malaysian Government will also insist on having the little used Malayan Railway to continue its run deep into the heart of Singapore City and terminate at Tanjong Pagar Station.</p>
              <p>The Malaysian Government will even accomodate this uneconomic insistence to continue with the unprofitable operation of the Malayan Railway into Singapore - even to the extent of relocating the entire Railway Station to a new location further inland, so as to allow the train to have a manageable incline up the suspended bridge.</p>
              <p>The new location of the new Railway Station will be a few kilometers into the rural area - from its present location that is located within Johor Bahru city and immediately next to the Causeway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All these uneconomic decisions show clearly that the Malaysian Government had insisted on their position based on purely political reaons - more then economics or even for financial reasons.</p>
              <p>This is due to the Malaysian Government being faced with a "Catch-22 situation" in that if the Malaysian Government should terminate the rail service into Singapore, it will allow the Singapore Government to exercise a clause in the Colonial Agreement - which clearly state that when the railway service to Singapore is terminated, all the land - on which the rail run and where the train station is sited - will fall into dis-use, all the dis-use land will have to be returned to the Singapore Authorities.</p>
              <p>To sweeten the deal, the Singapore Government had offered to the Malaysian Government a new site for Train Station to be located at the Woodlands ICQ, and which will serve as the natural and logical terminating and starting point of service.</p>
              <p>The proposal was further enhanced when an offer was also given to the Malaysian Government for a plot of land be given in exchange for the total value of the land which is occupied by the Train Station and the land space on which the railway line is built on. This plot of land is to be located in the heart of the new Marina Financial Centre on the reclaimed land next to Clifford Pier and Shenton Way.</p>
              <p>The package was given an added boost with the Singapore Government offering to develop this piece of land jointly with the Malaysian Government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the end of it all - this entire sordid affair is all about politics and the bad blood between ex-PM MM and the original MM in Singapore.</p>

              <h5>Singapore keen on third bridge as 'crooked' one dropped</h5>
              <p> </p>
              <p> PUTRAJAYA, Thurs:</p>
              <div id="adwrapper">
              <p class="abstract">Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s idea of a new bridge to link eastern Johor to Singapore has been embraced by Singapore. The republic’s nod for the project was conveyed by its minister mentor Lee Kuan Yew during his meeting with Najib on today.</p>
              Najib said although no deadline would be given for the commencement of the project for now, once built the bridge would be the catalyst for rapid growth in eastern Johor and meet Singapore’s desire to increase its investments in Malaysia.<br><br>“Singapore is keen on having the third bridge and it is something which we (Malaysia and Singapore) will pursue,” he said.<br><br>Najib, who is also finance minister, said Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Tan Sri Nor Mohamed Yakcop had been asked to conduct a feasibility study on the project with his Singaporean counterpart.<br><br>They are expected to appoint a consultant and determine the projected cost.<br>Najib said the cost of constructing the bridge would be shared equally by both countries.<br><br>The third bridge, after the Causeway and the Second Link, would not only facilitate Johor’s development but also that of Rompin and Kuantan in Pahang as well as Terengganu.<br><br>Iskandar Malaysia, Najib added, would also benefit from the third bridge project.<br><br>The prime minister raised the new bridge idea during his visit to Singapore recently, on the grounds that eastern Johor was less developed and had huge potential.<br><br>He said the new bridge meant that <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">the Causeway would remain as it is</span></strong>, and that <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">there would be no “crooked” or straight bridge to replace it</span></strong>.<br><br><strong>Singapore’s cooperation was needed to replace the Causeway, whose replacement it felt was hard to justify.</strong><br><br>Najib, during a press conference after the 2010 Budget consultation meeting, was also asked on Lee’s meetings with leaders of political parties during his eight-day visit to Malaysia.<br><br>“There is nothing to it if he wants to meet anyone for a clear picture of the situation in the country. To him (Lee), the stability of Malaysia is closely related to Singapore, just as Malaysia’s success has an effect on the country,” he said.</div>
