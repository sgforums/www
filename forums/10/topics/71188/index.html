            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">It was a surprise to see SM LKY being shocked when shown the reality of the situation faced by SIA Pilots.<br><br>It was even more revealing that the shocking reality of the attitude that SIA Management has adopted in ignoring the cost implications to the viability of some 'pet' schemes, compared to the views from ALPA-S. </span><br><br><strong>SM MEETS PILOTS: THE MEETING<br><span class="large">Overseas-based pilots are 'a thorn in our flesh' </span></strong><br><br>On Thursday, after a meeting with Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore Airlines pilots told the media they wanted to cooperate with management and move on. REBECCA LEE gives more details on the various issues raised at the two-hour meeting attended by 14 pilots.<br><br>SINGAPORE Airlines' overseas-based pilots are a 'thorn in the flesh' to union members, bemoaned the pilots' association during its meeting with Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew on Thursday.<br><br>Singapore-based pilots were unhappy with them not because of their bigger pay packets, but because <strong>they were costing the company too much money, which could be easily saved by finding other ways of hiring pilots.</strong><br><br>Members of the Air Line Pilots Association-Singapore (Alpa-S) who met SM Lee at the Istana on Thursday also lamented the unfair way routes were distributed.<br><br><strong>The overseas-based pilots could 'cherry-pick' the routes they flew and took the lucrative long-haul routes, leaving their Singapore-based counterparts with 'scraps'. </strong><br><br>Pilots get bigger allowances on longer routes, which are also considered more prestigious.<br><br>The unhappiness over overseas-based pilots was raised when SM Lee asked the 14 pilots of Alpa-S to tell him their grievances.<br><br><strong>Alpa-S president Mok Hin Choon said they could not see the logic in SIA continuing to employ overseas-based pilots, <span style="color: red;">who now cost the airline 15 to 20 per cent more than locally-based ones</span>.</strong><br><br>This was due to currency conversion and the various allowances they get, he said, based on the calculations the union had made.<br>SIA started a wholly-owned subsidiary in Mauritius in 1997 when it expanded rapidly and needed to fill its cockpits faster than it could train its pilots.<br><br>It recruited about 120 pilots overseas through this company and based them in London, Los Angeles, Brisbane, Sydney and Perth, instead of here.<br><br>These pilots are not represented by Alpa-S, which counts 1,600 of SIA's 1,800 pilots - who hail from 40 countries - as its members.<br>Captain Mok said the strengthening of certain foreign currencies, such as the pound, over the past few years meant that the overseas-based pilots cost the airline more now.<br><br>The pilots produced a chart to show that hiring a foreign pilot and basing him in Singapore is cheaper than relying on the scheme.<br>Capt Mok also highlighted the practical difficulties of having such overseas-based pilots.<br><br>For example, sometimes a Singapore-based pilot has to take a flight up to London to 'position' himself there so that he can pilot an aircraft back to Singapore, as the overseas-based pilot will have returned home to London where he is based.<br><br>'At one point in time, it really frustrated us more because they were cherry-picking the flights,' Capt Mok added.<br><br>For instance, these pilots would pick the flights from Singapore to London or Singapore to Frankfurt, which were popular routes.<br>'And they would leave us with all the scraps,' he said.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">While SM Lee listened to their complaints, he also expressed surprise that the management could have acted in a way that did not benefit the company in terms of cost-savings</span>.</strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">'Surely they can't be that daft,' he said</span>.</strong><br><br>The discussion also turned to the rostering of pilots which appeared to cause much grief among those present.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Who was in charge, SM Lee demanded to know, his voicing rising a little.<br><br>Flight operations division, came the reply.<br><br>'If all this is true, then the flight operations must be blind or stupid!' said SM Lee. </span>.</strong><br><br><strong>Asked if the airline could easily sack these pilots, the Alpa-S members said there could be issues with European Union regulations.<br><br>SM Lee then asked the pilots for a list of their cost comparisons so he could study them.</strong><br><br>He pointed out to them that if the overseas-based pilots now cost more than when the scheme started because of currency fluctuations, the company might not have foreseen the foreign exchange risks.<br><br>This was something every business had to deal with, he said.<br>The pilots went on to tell him that the overseas-based pilots made up just one instance in which they had tried to talk with the management and offer better ideas on how to save money.<br><br>But often management would not be interested in listening to them, complained one.<br><br>Unhappiness regarding the overseas-based pilots first surfaced publicly last May when the airline announced wage cuts and unpaid leave to stem the financial bleeding from the Sars outbreak.<br><br><strong>SIA defended the scheme. It said the overseas-based pilots saved the company about $100,000 a year per pilot, as it did not have to pay housing and other allowances to base them here.<br><br>Disagreeing with its decision to apply the wage cuts across the board then, the Singapore-based pilots wanted the overseas-based pilots to be laid off first, given the excess supply of pilots at that time. </strong><br><br>They had said that the overseas-based pilots were not employees of SIA, but merely seconded to the company.<br><br>However, SIA maintained at that time that it had to be even-handed or it would not be able to recruit foreign pilots when times were good again.<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/singapore/story/0,4386,237418,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/singapore/story/0,4386,237418,00.html?</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">What a difference 48 hours make in news reporting, when looking at the following news report extracted below from this Sunday Times, the slant of language and tone is completely different from the preceding article that led this thread.<br><br>In this Sunday's edition, the report seems to put the ALPA-S SIA Pilot Association in a bad spot, and meekly accepted their mistaken position of confronting SIA Management.<br><br>The tough, bullying language of SM LKY was kept in awe, and glorified as his playing the role of 'good cop and bad cop' - when it basically boils down to nothing by gangsterism across the negotiating table, with him thinking that he has all the Ace Cards; until the rude surprise of the silly mistakes of SIA Management.<br><br>Compared with the report of the clear defense put up by Capt Goh, who was individually targetted by SM LKY, nothing was mentioned in the same breadth as was reported and posted in the other thread - 'SIA Girl Letter' by Void Deck, dated 29 February 2004.</span><br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=71129" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=71129</a><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">SM's meeting with pilots: What happened at the Istana </span></span></strong><br><span class="small">By Zuraidah Ibrahim </span><br><br>'You play straight with me, I play straight with you. You play ducks and drakes with me, I play ducks and drakes with you.' -- SM Lee Kuan Yew<br><br>AS THE guests stepped into the pristine hallways of the Istana last Thursday afternoon, it was clear from their expectant faces that they were not there on one of those routine diplomatic goodwill visits.<br><br>This was no courtesy call.<br><br>The 14 Singapore Airlines pilots - a carefully selected mix of unionists ousted from leadership last November and their successors - were first ushered into a drawing room.<br><br>Some sat armed with files. Others waited with folded arms. Eventually, they were shepherded up to the chandelier-draped Sheares Room. Several paused at the bottom of the stairs, staring curiously through glass doors into a roomful of journalists.<br><br>Upstairs, they were about to face the man who had served them a series of public rebukes over the past few months.<br><br>He was after 'the principals and the ringleaders' behind the ouster of the union leadership, he had said.<br><br>'If they play this game, there will be broken heads,' he said on another occasion.<br><br>'Think carefully,' he cautioned them later, suspecting that the pilots were on a collision course with management.<br><br>That Thursday afternoon, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew began with an explanation.<br><br>'I decided to take up this issue since I've been involved with Singapore Airlines from the start,' he said.<br><br>In case the pilots needed reminding, he pointed out that it was he who had secured the pact for SIA's first and most lucrative route then to London. It was he who had asked for Changi to be built, despite expert studies favouring Paya Lebar. It was he who had seen the airline through its turbulent early years.<br><br>'So,' he said, 'I have no intention for it to go down'.<br><br>If the pilots had anticipated facing an uncompromising force, they were right.<br><br>But if they had feared that this determination would extend to siding completely with SIA's management, they were wrong.<br><br>Instead, he gave his word, several times, that SIA management would be put right.<br><br>'There will be no sacred cows,' he said, meaning this clearing of the way of past agreements and positions would probably apply equally to the union as it would to management.<br><br>In the two-hour exchange that followed, he also gave them a tutorial on industrial relations, what it meant to be an effective union, and the importance of non-confrontational, cooperative labour-management relations within Singapore's formula for success.<br><br>He came to power on the back of union support, he recounted to those in need of a history lesson. As a lawyer new to politics, he had done work for unions for free. His pro-union credentials were as unimpeachable as his pro-business record, he appeared to be saying.<br><br>But what he could not countenance was an adversarial relationship that could bring Singapore down.<br><br>Thus, he reasoned with the delegation, to win their minds rather than break their heads.<br><br>First, however, there was a reading of the riot act to one Captain Ryan Goh.<br><br>The master politician was at work.<br><br>You were the prime mover, were you not, behind the machinations to vote against the union leadership, he asked.<br><br>This, even though you were on the very council of the Air Line Pilots Association-Singapore (Alpa-S)?<br><br>That fateful ouster was what had brought the pilots that afternoon to the Istana.<br><br>Alpa-S - which guards jealously its status as an independent union that stays out of the tripartite loop - booted out its leaders after rueing the wage cuts that they had accepted and members had earlier endorsed.<br><br>The pilots agreed to the lower pay during the Sars outbreak when the airline was bleeding. But after it made a stunning turnaround a quarter later, a whispering campaign began about the union being weak. The larger battle ahead - negotiating a new collective agreement then in its last days - needed stronger stomachs, the sentiment went.<br><br>Reading from a file, Mr Lee pulled out the following facts about Captain Goh.<br><br>A Malaysian with permanent residence status here, he had accepted Australian PR in 2002, moved his wife and children to Perth, shipped his car and sold his flat.<br><br>You told someone from IE Singapore that the grass had stopped growing in Singapore, did you not, he asked.<br><br>He turned to one of the pilots and asked if he knew the Malaysian had bought a house in Australia and had this option to bail out.<br><br>No, the person answered.<br><br>'No?' repeated Mr Lee.<br><br>'That's deception, isn't it?' he asked Capt Goh.<br><br>The pilot in the hot seat tried to defend himself but it was too late. The line in the sand between him and the Singaporeans had been drawn for him.<br><br>'My daughter is still in school here,' he tried saying, adding this showed he still had roots in Singapore.<br><br>But wasn't that because she did not like school in Australia and came back, Mr Lee shot back calmly.<br><br>Silence.<br><br>The castigation, no doubt a tactic of divide-and-rule, also established a more significant point: It is not up to PRs or other foreigners to get into union matters and play around with decisions that affect the rest of Singaporeans.<br><br>Capt Goh had tried to undermine the interests of SIA and Singapore, he said. 'If Singapore goes down, you go down,' he told the Singaporeans across the table. 'He doesn't go down.'<br><br>With that out of the way, he laid out what he wanted to achieve out of the meeting: a fresh start.<br><br>'You play straight with me, I play straight with you. You play ducks and drakes with me, I play ducks and drakes with you,' he told them.<br><br>'Tell me whether we can cooperate.'<br><br>Yes, they could tell him one thing and act another way, but he was not interested in that.<br><br>'I don't hold you to blame for everything. Nor is the management responsible for all the things that have gone wrong. 'I want to create a new partnership of trust and cooperation, not confrontation,' he said.<br><br>The pilots needed to understand what was at stake. When members ousted their leaders, their actions jarred and suggested they were clueless about the environment they operated in: An economy on the remake trying to ease its cost pressures and an aviation industry that will be forever changed by the wringer it went through these last few years.<br><br>SIA did not need hostile industrial relations that would weigh it down at a time when the connectivity that the airline and Changi provided was facing intense competition. Without that connectivity that other parts of the economy were premised upon, Singapore would suffer.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>'So it puzzles me. Pilots are intelligent people. How is it you are out of touch?' he asked rhetorically.<br><br>It was partly because, someone had told him, he said, pilots were out of the country half the time. Partly also, they were out of the know because they were not under the National Trades Union Congress, which would have kept members apprised of the slightest twitch of its trouble-on-the-horizon barometer.<br><br>Whatever the case, he set the parameters for future moves.<br><br>All National Wages Council recommendations must be accepted if the airline was to achieve flexibility and nimbleness to outlast the competition.<br><br>Wages would have to be as variable as possible. Profit-sharing must factor in return on capital. Retrenchment benefits must be capped at 25 years. Medical benefits would no longer be fully paid for, a bitter pill almost all Singaporean workers have already swallowed, some as far back as a decade ago.<br><br>But all these changes did not mean the pilots were being sold down the river. They will be paid market rates and when there are extras, they will get more, he explained.<br><br>'Now, I want to hear what you have to say,' he said after an hour.<br><br>Over the next, the pilots vented their grievances, imploring for understanding.<br><br>Captain Mok Hin Choon, the new president of Alpa-S, said the company had to reflect and see if it could bring along its people, pointing out that even its NTUC-related unions were unhappy.<br><br>'Trust has been missing for the last few years,' he said, adding that 'it takes two hands to clap'.<br><br>Out of the bag leapt their biggest bugbear - the overseas-based pilots. The company kept rebuffing their proposals to relook the scheme which they said was inefficient, wasteful and resulted in rostering that left them with scraps while their overseas counterparts cherry-picked the juicier routes.<br><br>Flight operations was in charge, came the reply, when Mr Lee asked who was behind it all if they were right about the matter.<br><br>'If all this is true, then the flight operations must be blind or stupid! ... I want an explanation from them because I cannot believe this,' he said.<br><br>'You give me a paper, I will look at it.'<br><br>He promised the human resources of the airline would be revamped and urged the pilots to give new chief executive officer Chew Choon Seng a chance.<br><br>As trust was rebuilt, there should be more information sharing so both sides could work together.<br><br>They told him 38 pilots had left in recent months. Where were they going, he wanted to know.<br><br>There will be changes, he said.<br><br>'I am assuring you that the Government will make sure that SIA acts in good faith,' he said.<br><br>Mr Lee went on to answer one of the main questions on the minds of Singaporeans: Why did the Government need to intervene in an internal company matter? 'We are the majority owners and we will ensure that they act in the interest of the country, and the interest of the country requires cooperation, trust and confidence from the unions.'<br><br>Why did it have to be the Senior Minister?<br><br>As he explained it, he had dealt with the airline from the beginning, it was fair he saw to it that the restive relationship between the pilots in the early years still continuing today, end.<br><br>But he was also realistic enough to concede this much: The residual feelings of suspicion would still be there.<br><br>Capt Mok too made this plain enough when he told the media later Alpa-S was not ready to embrace NTUC.<br><br>But yes, he and the others pledged to work on a clean slate, work in partnership with management and give things a go. They would use the negotiations for the new collective agreement as a time for trust-building.<br><br>By the end of it, it felt as if the fog of suspicion that had settled between Government and Alpa-S these past months had a good chance of lifting.<br><br>As the press walked in at the tail end of the meeting and posed questions, Captain Mok insisted on looking forward, vowing to make a clean start.<br><br>Details of difficulties with management? No, he wasn't keen on hitting the headlines with that.<br><br>Details of demands? No, not keen either.<br><br>Management should thank him for closing the books thus.<br><br>The meeting ended with handshakes all around, even with the solemn-looking Capt Goh.<br><br>If there was any sense of deja vu in the room, Captain Freddie Koh must have felt it most.<br><br>He was among a posse of union pilots Mr Lee summoned to the Istana in 1980 for daring to fan a go-slow action to vent their disgruntlement over pay and work conditions.<br><br>He told them then in unvarnished language: 'I do not want to do you in but I will not let anyone do Singapore in.'<br><br>When trouble with Alpa-S began, Mr Lee said he wanted to clean up on the restiveness that was resurfacing. 'This is a job that has to be finished and I'll finish it.'<br><br>Thursday afternoon moved towards that conclusion.<br><br>Looking back, throughout it all, the Senior Minister in effect employed the familiar strategy of good cop, bad cop. Except that he played both roles.<br><br>Now that he and the Government have said their piece and the pilots have made peace, SIA needs to break its deafening silence. Soon.<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4386,237674,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4386,237674,00.html?</a><br></div>
