            <div class='col-md body'>glad to know opposition has learnt much from previous election. i think the next election will see opposition do better. personally i wish to see a opposition win a GRC. on the average oposition should have the vote of around 40% or thereabout from the past few election with the exception of last election due to $%$^% of CSJ. that means 4 out of 10 singaporean.<br>i do agree we need more oppositions voices rather than puppet voices appointed by PAP. it been quite a while since the last PAP MPs voices their disagreement with the minister inside on parliament. im sure those disagreement which we hear last year was just a show and MP lili are given big backlash by PM goh.<br><br>im been true opposition supporter since my eligible to vote.<br>cheers for the next election!</div>

I hole the view that no one would be able to win any SMC other than those previously won 10 or 20 years ago.<br><br>In strategic terms, these SMCs are considered as "killing field". PAP is too eager to put up strangle hold on their monopoly power and they are not here to make sure that there are enough SMCs for opposition parties to contest, but rather, to divert opposition parties' efforts into a battlefield that they could never win. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>How do it? It is pretty simple. PAP made a mistake back in 1991 to have SMCs up for snatch without much considerations. Later, they are smarter, introducing elected Presidency. The elected Presidency scheme was an effort for data collection, on the voting patterns of Singaporeans based on "proxy opposition". That is why they set "high" standards to deter any credible threat from any opposition members in this contest. They fielded both trusted candidates of their own, though one is viewed as "PAP man" as the other long serving civil servant.<br><br>Why the need for such data collection? This is basically to make it easier for boundaries to be redrawn, to exact precision, carving out areas stipulated as "killing field"; ie. where support for the PAP man is so great that it is not possible for any opposition contestor to win. Of course, the common practice of dissolving "danger zones" still exist; eg. like Cheng San, Eunos, Anson, Bukit Gombak... etc etc.<br><br>Many opposition parties are too "practical" and think they could possibly win a SMC. These are misguided views. These are the exact places whereby PAP wants you to be there, so they could concentrate their firepower with a proxy known advantage of support on the ground!<br><br>On the contrary, I think it is much easier for opposition parties to win GRC, provided they could come up with elements that could sway the middle ground. This is especially so when the past "stronghold" of PAP has been averaged out by various absorption of "danger zones". To make it "safer them, they actually split ChengSan into three pieces so to be absorbed by three different GRCs, namely, Aljunied, Pungol Pasir Ris and Ang Mo Kio GRC. This is to say that they are not confident about the ability of any of these three GRCs to absord Chengsan as a whole. It reveals the vulnerability of their GRC system.<br><br>Thus, I think for the next general election, if there isn't any big changes, opposition could possibly win one GRC. As for SMC, I am not that optimistic that any opposition party could break through the two seats we have at present.<br><br>However, there is a catch here. PAP may choose to have a Presidential election first, before holding the GE. The reason, as given, is for sharpening up the precision of data collection. After one decade, due to movements on the ground, the spread could be very different right now. I think they will play safe and call a Presidential election first.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Opposition has limited resources. Its better to concentrate on SMC before they get stronger to move on. Winning an election is not just about having the chance to speak in parliament. More importantly they must be able to take care of the residents. There's no point in winning a GRC and getting boot out in the next election. Public confidence in the opposition will be seriously eroded in the long run.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Re: limited resources and SMC.<br><br>However, WP already has one SMC. So it make sense to move to a GRC<br><br>Other than the 2 other opposition SMCs, there is no guarantee the PAP SMCs will stay. Heck no one knows whether the opposition SMCs will stay! PAP may finally change their mind to get rid of Hougang and PP in the next GE.<br><br>I am helping WP at the grassroots. And if WP win a GRC, I for one will bleed to ensure it keeps the GRC for at least 2 GE.<br><br>EmptyCage</div>
