              <p><br>As usual the Taiwanese 'hum' return to this Speaker's Corner to get its daily orgasmic fix of seeking the attention needed as an 'Attention Seeking Whore'.</p>
              <p>If the Genting Resorts World at Sentosa need 30,000 workers - it will make the entire operation an uneconomic proposition to start with.</p>
              <p>The First World Hotel in the Genting Highlands, Malaysia is recorded by Guiness as the World Largest Hotel with 6,118 rooms - surely the Resort World will not be bigger then that in the Genting Highlands.</p>
              <p>Using the method employed by hoteliers to determine staff to room ratio - the most economic ratio is set at 1.5 worker to 1 room, the First World Hotel will already employ 9,177 workers.</p>
              <p>The Genting Resorts World at Sentosa has a total of only 1840 rooms spread through the Crockfords Tower, Hotel Michael, Festive Hotel and Hard Rock Hotel - at the same industry accepted staff-to-room ratio, these hotels will employ only 2760 workers that include the Top guy and his Administrators, the Service and F&amp;B Staff.</p>
              <p>The Casino operating 24 hours can at best employ double that number employed by the hotel - making it a total of 5520 workers.</p>
              <p>The total number employed at the Resort World will be no more then 8280 workers.</p>
              <p>Universal Studios cannot possibly employ more then the numbers employed at the Casino - and even if we take the full 5520 workers, the total employed can hardly total the 30,000 that the Taiwanese 'hum' will ignorantly blast from her brains located at Level 0.</p>

              <p>But the real fact is PAP will win this election with at least a 70% votes, it is real because they got the joker in their hand, and if you know how to play cards, joker can be any subsitute, and it is also real that they have do their homework and start the construction long before now to their advantage, there is nothing much opposition can do except playing an illusion role, hoping for the best.</p>
              <p>Just be illusion abit, if PAP are reading the posts here, it will be laughing ground for them, a place for them to relax and listen to joker like you and many others singing songs and talking cock all day...as margaret rightly put it...In politcs, if you got something to said, ask the man, they can tell you tales all day long, but if you need somehting to be done, ask the woman.</p>
