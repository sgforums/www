              <h1>Even CNA is questioning the percentage of Singaporeans employed by Resorts World Sentosa</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">February 18, 2010</span></p>
              <p>When even the usually meek Channel News Asia (CNA) is questioning the accuracy of information given to it, something must be really wrong.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>In an article yesterday, CNA cast doubts if the majority of Resorts World Sentosa’s staff are indeed Singaporeans.</p>
              <p><em>“Resorts World Sentosa said 70 per cent of its staff strength of over 8,000 are Singaporeans or Permanent Residents. But some who’ve visited the gaming tables are questioning where exactly are they working?”</em> it asked.</p>
              <p>When Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) was awarded the integrated resort in 2006, it said it would remain “committed to hiring Singaporeans as a first priority.”</p>
              <p>However, according to those who have visited the casino over the weekend, most of the staff working there appeared to be foreigners.</p>
              <p>As early as 2008, Philipines President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo claimed that RWS will open about 5,000 new jobs for Filipinos. She had sent a delegation to Singapore to explore possible <span id="IL_AD4">job opportunities</span> for migrant <span id="IL_AD5">Filipino</span> and they went to discuss available slots for Filipino workers such as workers for hotels, casinos and performers with Tan Hee Teck, CEO of RWS. (read report <a href="http://pinoybusiness.org/2009/04/09/singapore-to-open-5000-jobs-for-filipinos/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">here</span></span></a><span id="IL_AD3">)</span></p>
              <p><span>The Straits Times reported on 8 February 2010 that Resort World Sentosa (RWS) will be hiring 150 card dealers in Taiwan who are expected to be paid around $1,800 monthly. Besides Taiwanese, RWS has also been actively recruiting Malaysians and Filipinos to man its casino in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p>The 70 per cent figure quoted is misleading because PRs are included. Foreigners can be fast-tracked to become PRs, thereby decreasing the percentage for foreign workers.</p>
              <p>For some strange reason, both RWS and the authorities appear to be reluctant to release the exact percentage of Singapore citizens working at the IR which is likely to be in the range of 50 – 60 per cent or even less.</p>
              <p>Based on some feedback we receive from readers, the majority of the service staff at RWS are foreigners. In fact, the lessons have to be conducted in Mandarin due to the large number of non-English speaking workers from China and Taiwan.</p>
              <p>Robin Goh, assistant director, Communications, Resorts World Sentosa, said to CNA:</p>
              <p><em>“There might be skill sets that are lacking in Singapore perhaps. For example jobs in casino and jobs within Universal Studios Singapore. And again, sad to say, it is also a challenge to find Singaporeans to pick up some jobs that they sometimes shun, for example jobs that have shifts.”</em></p>
              <p>As expected, the all too convenient excuse that the jobs are ”shunned” by locals is brought up again to explain why Singaporeans are not employed.</p>
              <p>RWS is operating and making money in Singapore. The onus is on it to adjust its wages and working hours to fit the expectations of Singaporeans and not the other way round.</p>
              <p>Of course RWS cannot be blamed entirely since the ruling party doesn’t really care much if they employ locals or foreigners since according to their warped logic – “foreigners help to create, (not snatch away) jobs for Singaporeans”.</p>

              <h1>Resort World Sentosa casino run by significant number of foreigners</h1>
              <div class="date">

              <p><span class="time">February 17, 2010</span></p>
              <p>Despite all the media hype about the two Integrated Resorts (IRs) providing employment opportunities for Singaporeans, it appears that foreigners are the ultimate beneficiaries at least in the case of the recently opened casino of Resort World Sentosa (RWS).</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>According to a CNA report today, there were complaints from gamblers about the competency of the card dealers on the floor.</p>
              <p>Said one visitor to the casino:</p>
              <p><em>“It’s very slow, I don’t see a lot of Singaporeans also. They are still at a learning stage and they made a number of mistakes.”</em></p>
              <p>A RWS spokesman said:</p>
              <p><em>“Mainly our croupiers are new to the industry. They started training as early as August last year so they have been training for quite a while. But nothing beats the real thing. So, when the casino opens, many are learning on the job.”</em></p>
              <p>A reader who claimed to be working in RWS said many of the dealers are from China and Taiwan such that lessons have to be conducted in Mandarin for them.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times reported on 8 February 2010 that Resort World Sentosa (RWS) will be hiring 150 card dealers in Taiwan who are expected to be paid around $1,800 monthly. Besides Taiwanese, RWS has also been actively recruiting Malaysians and Filipinos to man its casino in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Philipines President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo said in April last year that RWS will open about 5,000 new jobs for Filipinos. She had sent a delegation to Singapore to explore possible <span id="IL_AD4">job opportunities</span> for migrant <span id="IL_AD5">Filipino</span> and they went to discuss available slots for Filipino workers such as workers for hotels, casinos and performers with Tan Hee Teck, CEO of RWS. (read report <a href="http://pinoybusiness.org/2009/04/09/singapore-to-open-5000-jobs-for-filipinos/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a><span id="IL_AD3">)</span></p>
              <p><span>In fact, the number of foreign workers at RWS is so high that HDB has to allocate two blocks of flats in Toa Payoh to house them. </span></p>
              <p><span>Unless RWS gives us an exact breakdown of the number of Singapore citizens and foreigners (including PRs) on its payroll, we can never come to a reasonable conclusion if it is providing more jobs to Singaporeans or foreigners.</span></p>
              <p><span>With the fesstive season drawing to close, </span>Resorts World Sentosa expects visitor numbers to its casino to dip significantly today onwards after an overwhelming response to its opening, during the first three days of the Lunar New Year.</p>
              <p>Even then, a significant number of the visitors appear to be foreigners with PRs using their native passports to get into the casinos without paying the mandatory $100  levy.</p>
              <p>It remains to be seen if the two IRs will be a roaring success in the year of the Tiger or turn out to be “white elephants” like the now defunct Tang Dynasty village in Jurong which was launched amidst much fanfare too a few years ago.</p>

              <p>During a F&amp;B meeting organised by them, they plead with us for peoples and ideas, the final suggestion was to give IR employment rights to Philippinos, because they are more service orientated peoples, and since most of you have enuf of indians, PRC and bangala or mynmar moving around your living space, Philippinos will add more spice to it.

              <p>From e2i, both Casinos need 30,000 peoples to work on it, from
              top CEOs to cleaners, now where to get so many singaporeans, since
              it construction, e2i had been trying very hard to get singaporeans
              in, more so with the recent crisis when unemployment rate goes up
              to 5%, they managed to get 6,000 to train up, some sent to genting
              some to las vegas for training. Do you think it is easy to get
              workers and staffs in singapore ar??? especially so with an aging
              population and high education level society with peoples like you
              all, all want to shake legs and talk cock only but dun want to
              contribute anything or work, so what can the casino do, even my pub
              staffs they also wanted to pull away, do you know that hotels paid
              levels had went up as much as 50% because of IR, they are hunting
              peoples from hotel, restaurant and pubs line to work for them, so
              we, as boss have to pay our staff higher inorder to keep them, even
              so, Casinos still cannot get enuf, and at the end they managed to
              beef it up to 16,000, some still training.</p>
              <p>During a F&amp;B meeting organised by them, they plead with us
              for peoples and ideas, the final suggestion was to give IR
              employment rights to Philippinos, because they are more service
              orientated peoples, and since most of you have enuf of indians, PRC
              and bangala or mynmar moving around your living space, Philippinos
              will add more spice to it. But rest assure, Pinoys are more
              friendly and nice peoples.</p>

              <p>If every boss think like that, Singaporeans will be forced to be criminals cos of no money to eat, and riot in casino. Then military forces would collapse.

              <p>I agreed, but things can happen, so IR takes the caution way out, it is running on a 24 hrs basis ya, not simple to maintain, in itself is already got 78 HR senior managements handling, some from HK, and some from Macao and some from malaysia. In end of 2008, hotels face alots of pressure from their staffs resignation in group that they decided to draw a line with IR manangement, because if IR head hunt the staffs in hotel and our pubs line, we may have to employ bangalas girls to serve you.</p>

              <p>From e2i, both Casinos need 30,000 peoples to work on it, from top CEOs to cleaners, now where to get so many singaporeans, since it construction, e2i had been trying very hard to get singaporeans in, more so with the recent crisis when unemployment rate goes up to 5%, they managed to get 6,000 to train up, some sent to genting some to las vegas for training. Do you think it is easy to get workers and staffs in singapore ar??? especially so with an aging population and high education level society with peoples like you all, all want to shake legs and talk cock only but dun want to contribute anything or work, so what can the casino do, even my pub staffs they also wanted to pull away, do you know that hotels paid levels had went up as much as 50% because of IR, they are hunting peoples from hotel, restaurant and pubs line to work for them, so we, as boss have to pay our staff higher inorder to keep them, even so, Casinos still cannot get enuf, and at the end they managed to beef it up to 16,000, some still training.</p>
              <p>During a F&amp;B meeting organised by them, they plead with us for peoples and ideas, the final suggestion was to give IR employment rights to Philippinos, because they are more service orientated peoples, and since most of you have enuf of indians, PRC and bangala or mynmar moving around your living space, Philippinos will add more spice to it. But rest assure, Pinoys are more friendly and nice peoples.</p>

              <p><br>As usual the Taiwanese 'hum' return to this Speaker's Corner to get its daily orgasmic fix of seeking the attention needed as an 'Attention Seeking Whore'.</p>
              <p>If the Las Vegas Sands and the Resorts World at Sentosa need 30,000 workers to work on it - this will make the entire venture an uneconomic proposition to start with.</p>
              <p>The First World Hotel in the Genting Highlands, Malaysia is recorded by Guiness as the World Largest Hotel with 6,118 rooms - surely the Resort World will not be bigger then that in the Genting Highlands.</p>
              <p>Using the method employed by hoteliers to determine staff to room ratio - the most economic ratio is set at 1.5 worker to 1 room, the First World Hotel will already employ 9,177 workers.</p>
              <p>The Genting Resorts World at Sentosa has a total of only 1840 rooms spread through the Crockfords Tower, Hotel Michael, Festive Hotel and Hard Rock Hotel - at the same industry accepted staff-to-room ratio, these hotels will employ only 2760 workers that include the Top guy and his Administrators, the Service and F&amp;B Staff.</p>
              <p>The Casino operating 24 hours can at best employ the same number employed by the hotel - making it a total of 2760 workers.</p>
              <p>The total number employed at the Resort World will be no more then 5520 workers.</p>
              <p>Universal Studios cannot possibly employ more then the numbers employed at the Casino - and even if we include the full 2760 workers, the total number of 8280 employed for the entire Sentosa Integrated Resort cannot contribute to the 30,000 employed by both Integrated Resorts - as the Las Vegas Sands cannot employ more then the numbers at Sentosa.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the Taiwanese 'hum' will ignorantly blast from her brains located at Level 0 just to attract attention to herself as an "Attention Seeking Whore".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The government did say that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jobmarket.com.sg/forums/showthread.php?t=5064">’35,000 jobs to be created – 10,000 by the two integrated resorts, and the other 25,000 in supporting industries’ </a>- which the Taiwanese 'hum' could not even absorb sufficient info when the brain is clouded with the eagerness to simply seek its daily orgasmic fix in this Speaker's Corner. </p>
