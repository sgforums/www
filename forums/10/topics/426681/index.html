              <p>In the matter of dispute between <strong>Potong Pasir Town Council vs MHA 
              (SLA) over the erection of usual 3' X 2' signboards demarcating state 
              land. [SG parliament, 3/2011]</strong><br> <br> Re: <strong>'Chiam calls attention to upkeep of state land'</strong>: [<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Singapore/Story/STIStory_643350.html">ST, 10Mar2011</a>][<a href="http://thenewsynewsblog.blogspot.com/2011/03/chiam-calls-attention-to-upkeep-of.html">alt link1(picts)</a>][<a href="http://en-gb.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=203029136390339">alt link2</a>]<br> <br> It is a shame on Singapore politics and syndromic of systemic 
              inefficiency that an issue over the placement of a 3' X 2' signboard 
              should snowball into a parliamentary debate over its provision.<br> <br> The former lamenting about the added responsibilities put on his Town 
              Council cleaners, the latter defending blatant systemic double 
              standards, ostensibly created to disadvantage opposition politicians.<br> <br> My suggestion would be for the SLA to stop such low brow practices and 
              prejudice against opposition constituents. The usual practice as I 
              understand would be the erection of the 3' X 2' signboard, an example of
               which is annexed below.<br> <br> The wise way forward would probably be for Mr Chiam to take 'ownership'/
               custody for the piece of state land (by way of a prolonged rent free 
              lease), and innovate useful purposes for it. The triangular "piece of 
              land behind the Hindu temple along Potong Pasir Avenue 3" [<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HaoGW4lk0Uw/TZTqHtc2vXI/AAAAAAAAAUI/g-g1TjKIfi8/s1600/Gmaps%252C+PPasir+Ave3BhdTemple.JPG">pict</a>]
               measures only 100 X 50m (an odd shaped quarter hector); and lying 100m 
              SW of Potong Pasir Police Post and 400m south of the P.Pasir Town 
              Council (PPTC); directly across the road from St Andrews village.<br> <br> My recommendation would be for the field to be taken over by PPTC and 
              turned into a fruit garden/ partitioned into a vegetable garden. These 
              uses would serve the residents well as the town council could ban casual
               picking of fruit and instead devise a system whereby all harvest could 
              be channeled in cash or kind to the constituency's needy residents. 
              Surrounding residents, paroling police and even the friendly SAJC 
              security guards could be engaged to enforce such  PPTC policies by 
              calling the police should 'poachers' be sighted/ present.<br> <br> SLA on receiving this high noble request from the MP concerned ought to,
               but for any better purpose, grant free lease of the land for this/ 
              proximate purpose to PPTC. (I really cannot accept the inefficiency of 
              SLA workers going down to PP to clean up/ cut grass on the 1/4 hectare 
              area at every beck and call).<br> <br> Only by such charity and innovation can the citizens of Singapore live happily and harmoniously together.<br> Potong Pasir community would be happier, more robust and the SLA eased.<br> Election or no election, may the best man win.<br> <br> Majulah Singapura.<br> <br> End-notes:<br> An alternative use for the land (triangular shaped, boarded by roads and
               HDB) would be for TaiChi/ other light sports/ fun fairs/ performances; 
              the use of which might generate monies that PPTC could re-channel 
              towards maintenance of the land. A less robust but likewise possible use
               for the vacant piece of land then I originally suggested. If PPTC could
               afford it, a flower/ herb garden would be a nice addition too.<br> <br> Example of a signboard such as the one in contention [<a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BsIGPkVWbBM/TYHjqBR_moI/AAAAAAAAATM/Sh_CUzrpekQ/s1600/SLA+state+land+sign+%2528Evans+Rd%2529.JPG">pict</a>]:<br> <a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BsIGPkVWbBM/TYHjqBR_moI/AAAAAAAAATM/Sh_CUzrpekQ/s1600/SLA+state+land+sign+%2528Evans+Rd%2529.JPG"><img class="tcattdimgresizer" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BsIGPkVWbBM/TYHjqBR_moI/AAAAAAAAATM/Sh_CUzrpekQ/s200/SLA+state+land+sign+%2528Evans+Rd%2529.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br> <br> ~ <strong>"The King will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one  of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.'"</strong>-- <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:40&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 25:40</a> (NIV)<br> <br> Rgds, Love and may God bless,<br> B.C.</p>
