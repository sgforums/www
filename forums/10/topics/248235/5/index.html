Sylvia would make a good minister judging from her passionate speech and great ideas with all the correct sense.

The precise reason why I have become so vocal is becoz I reached the top 10% not becoz of their help, but it is thru my own realization of my value, and to break out of that vicious cycle that the govt put on many Singaporeans (that is, to accept low pay).

By drawing enormous salary, it is difficult to draw a line between "I work for the money" and "I truly work for the people".  So I dont dispute any of that.<br><br>What I wrote is simple.  Complains and criticism out of emotions dont make things better.

Keeping the transport cheap is ALREADY 1 effective way of helping the poorer people.<br>And why not profits recycled back to them?

I do not have that right.<br><br>All I am asking for, is that<br>(1) you keep an open mind, and look ard you. Do not become one with an elitist attitude (ie one that does not care of the unhappiness of the common citizen, coz this breeds arrogance and ignorance, and is usually the 1st step to a downfall)<br><br>(2) keep away from extremism. LKY always use comments like 'We cannot have a dud minister', 'We cannot lose our capable cabinet'. His comments are all ABSOLUTE. The common Singaporean acknowledges what the PAP has done, but also has the rightful mind to know that the PAP is now so arrogant, that they must be taught a lesson.<br><br>No one advocates the knocking down of the entire PAP cabinet, but just a lesson so that they wake up and start to understand what the word UNDERSTAND means.<br><br>(3) you acknowledge that some points here are in their most likelihood, true about the PAP, (eg ministers aren't really worth their pay, coz till now, what achievements do they have. Opposition members aren't necessarily lousy as what the PAP suggests. Look at Sylvia and Low Thia Kiang)<br><br>If you walk away from this embracing the above, then its enough. You would finally start to see things with your heart, and not only with your eyes. Your eyes read only their propaganda that they show you, but your heart will tell you things the PAP will not want to tell you.</div>

I think this problem, of PM being a potentially dangerous power if it falls into the wrong hands, is a problem caused by our govt themselves. Give someone absolute power, and it corrupts them absolutely. USA is truly governed by 3 powers, the President, the Parliament, and the Judicial system, unlike ours, where everything is officially governed by 3, but absolute power is concentrated into 1.<br><br>b) I personally wish LKY steps down, coz he is now too power-hungry, and is restricting the progress of our nation. If he could step down, and allow the young guns (new blood) to breathe new life into Singapore, I believe it can be better for Singapore.<br>There are many powerful men, whom step down from their powerful positions (Bill Gates for eg), becoz they realized one thing. They are no longer the young person they once was, and they need new blood to lead the company.<br>There is such thing as staying too long and stagnating progression.<br>Unfortunately, I think in Asian societies, this mindset is still not here yet.<br><br>And, glad to know you are providing well for your family. At least, your father can enjoy during old age.<br><br>Many others can't. You see them still working to this day, as road sweepers, food court cleaning staff, old cardbox collectors etc. I once was really saddened seeing this old lady being scolded by her food court manager (he was in actual fact, screaming at her so loudly that everyone was staring), and he was shouting he was going to sack her.<br><br></div></blockquote>Hi old bird,<br><br>You have a compassionate heart.<br><br>You have raised an interesting and additional issue.  Is there help available to these helpless old people who have to be cleaners ?<br><br>It is true that Singapore is not and has chosen not to be a welfare state.  This decision will inevitably cause retirement insecurity for those without sufficient savings (most will have to downgrade their standard of living, including myself).<br><br>I think there must be some genuine charities who are looking after these desperate old people.<br><br></div>

All of them agreed on one point,  it is easier to form capital here in Singapore than if they were in other countries.   Of cos, some of them with loads of money, then emigrate to Canada, Australia etc.<br><br>Next, i think becos the Lee family is wealthy, LHL / LKY do not care about a few millions a year.<br><br>Still, I am not agreeing totally with the pay hike because it is difficult to win the argument.  below are some of my thoughts.<br><br>pros :  a) reduce corruption, b) easier to convince leaders in the private sector to join civil service, c) retain good people in the cabinet.<br><br>a) 1 million per year plus pension payout at retirement is more than sufficient to remove poverty from the minister.  Whether he is corrupt or not from there depends only on his moral values.  If he is corruptable, paying him 3 million wont make a difference.<br><br>b) back to (a).  Also, public sector serves the public.  leader of public sector should exhibit moral authority.  taking a pay cut is an opportunity for him to show his moral authority and that he is willing to serve and that he is ready to go for higher aims in life other than money.<br><br>c) good people drawing 1mio per year dont go for private sector if he has a heart for the nation.<br><br></div>

LKY like wise, should just shut up and retire in glory.<br></div>
