            <div class='col-md body'>Here are some ministerial pay related posts I made in another forum. So here I am to see what kind of feedback I can get...<br><br>Just saw the front page of today's English papers. There's an article about how Singaporeans are affected by rising prices and cost of living. The most prominent part of this article is the picture of a family stating how they helped to cut costs by buying cheaper groceries and making less phone calls. That ties in with our ministers' advice to 'switch to cheaper products'.<br><br>Now to show willing, I am going to take this 'sound' piece of advice further. To cut costs and reduce the burden on taxpayers, we should 'switch to cheaper ministers'.<br><br>With the kind of money we are paying our PM, we can afford an American President, a British PM, an Australian PM and a German Chancellor. And the salary of one Singapore minister can pay for several British Cabinet Ministers (who probably will not tell us to 'switch to cheaper products'.<br><br>So what do you think fellows? Shall we send out Offer of Employment letters to Foreign Talents around the world? After all, according to our PAP masters, Foreign Talents can do the job where locals can't. Tony Blair lost his job as PM, so send him one. I think he will be more than happy if we pay him just one fifth of what we are paying our PM now. And send letters to the Clintons and Obama Barrack too. Only one can become the next American president. Tell both of them that if either one loses the American Presidential race, they can come work for us in Singapore. Again I am sure they will be more than happy to work for one fifth of LHL's pay. And Bill Clinton can have all the interns he wants (haha just my little joke).<br><br>I checked the Constitution and Penal Code. There's nothing in there that says private citizens can't send Offer of Employment letters to foreign politicians. Go on. Start typing and emailing!<br><br>That's our answer to your 'switch to cheaper products' advice, Mr Minister.<br><br>Crew</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok. Please help to draft this letter. Here my creativity seems to fizzle out. And oh, my friend just pointed out we missed a 'super funny politician' in her own words. Anyone know who the hell is Stephen Colbert? Appearently he does a comedy show and is running for USA president as an independent?<br><br>Here's what I got so far... a rough sketch. Ideas welcomed. Please brainstorm.<br><br>Dear [fill in name of politician here],<br><br>You might have heard about the high flying CPI and soaring costs of services and products in Singapore. Our elite team of ministers (who's incidentally also the highest paid bunch of politicians in the world) offered this advice to help counter inflation: switch to cheaper products.<br><br>We, the citizens of Singapore, were so impressed by the wisdom of our leaders that we have taken the advice to heart. Not only that, as responsible citizens, we have decided to carry this advice further and came up with our own strategy. That is to 'switch to cheaper ministers'.<br><br>We did some calculations [need some help with the current figures of ministers' salary here as the figures at SDP website is outdated] and came to the conclusion that if we were to replace the current PM and his cabinet with cheaper but more talented foreign imports, we could save millions for the Treasury in the short term and billions in the long run.<br><br>We are therefore pleased to offer you the post of Prime Minister and an annual salary of US400,000 dollars. It may be much lesser than the millions paid to our current Prime Minister, but why do you think we are seeking a replacement in the first place? US400,000 dollars is twice the amount the American president is earning and is not to be sneezed at. The job comes with various perks such as a guaranteed win at every election.<br><br>Your Faithful Servant,<br><br>Crew<br><br>Ok... that's the rough gist of it. Some suggestions sought. Do you think it would look better with more signatures? As it is not a legally binding letter, it need not be your real name. Your online moniker will do. And how to I send out an email with all the signatures? Do I put it down with your permission or forward it to everyone to sign? Also would it look better on those online petitions website?<br><br>Crew</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And here's more ideas for the letter. To make it look more 'official' like the ones they send to executives, here's my idea for the Benefits section...<br><br>Standard benefits for the Prime Minister of Singapore include the following:<br><br>-Guaranteed win at every General Election for Prime Minister and his party.<br><br>-Stock options and a seat on the board of directors in the GIC. The GIC is a global investment company established to manage Singapore's foreign reserves which amounts to more than US$100 billion. Rememer, the GIC motto is: Our money is your money!<br><br>-The spouse of the Prime Minister will be offered the post of CEO of Temasek Holdings, the executive arm of the GIC. It currently manages a portfolio of more than US$100 billion.<br><br>-Health, dental, life and disability insurance.<br><br>Duties and Responsibilites:<br><br>-Upon assuming office, the Prime Minister will form the new government. We at Singapore Inc. advise a complete overhaul of the Cabinet. Currently, a Singapore minister earn an annual salary of US$1.32 million. We advise appointing ministers who will be happy with US $314, 000. That is much lower than the current pay scale for a Singapore minister but twice the amount a US Cabinet Secretary is earning. With 15 Cabinet ministers (excluding the Senior Minister and Minister Mentor), this exercise to curb the excesses of the cabinet will save the Treasury US$ 15 million a year.<br><br>-We at Singapore Inc. advise that the posts of Senior Minister and Minister Mentor are redundant and a drain on the taxpayers. No other Prime Minister in the world needs to be advised by a Senior Minister and mentored by a Minister Mentor at the same time. Doing away with these redundacies will save the Treasury another US $4 million a year.<br><br>-Traditionally, Singapore has a President who is the ceremonial head of State. However, after Ong Teng Chong's term of office, what little executive power the post of President conferred has been further curtailed. We at Singapore Inc. therefore consider the current salary for the President at US $2.6 million to be an excess and an unnecessary drain on taxpayers. We advise keeping the ceremonial post of President but reducing his salary to US $ 315, 000 which is what on par with what the German President is getting.<br><br>-If our advice is taken and implemented, that will save the Treasury approximately US$ 21 million a year.<br><br>We look forward to you joining us.<br><br>Singapore Inc.<br>(For the people. By the people)</div>

              <p>Seriously, cut Ministers' pay, how much extra resources do you have?  As I have wrote in another post, we have 18 Cabinet Ministers.  If they average $2mil salary per year, that's just $36mil per year. </p>
              <p>Take the extreme and they are paid nothing, that's just $36mil a year.  What can you do with $36mil?  Not very much if you are thinking about broad policies like giving every low income household food vouchers etc.</p>

              <p>that in a Democracy, its the majority of votes that count.</p>
              <p>who is casting the votes? sinaporeens of course.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and that is the bottom line. Singaporeans. Remember, its singaporeans we are talking about. They have maintained their position for 50 years or so. no change. negligible change has happened.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the key thing to note is 'singaporeans'.</p>
              <p>we are not talking about Americans , Europeans or South Koreans nor japanese. All these are true 1st world democracies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are talking about another kind of democracy in this world. another true 1st world democracy, i have to reallly have to must say.</p>

              <p>second key thing to note is the GRC systematica.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and by the way, why people call it the INC ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I tot INC is a company operating in the private sector where its income is earned by winning its competition in the market and impressing and satisfying its customers who then willing to pay and pay ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>INC ? who owns the INC? who has that right to use the income of the INC to spend on its employees?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if this is another country, what you said could happen.</p>
              <p>This is the little dot.</p>

              <p>Singa Crew makes some sharp points, and their satire is right on the mark - an online petition, however satirical, is certainly one way of drawing attention to your position.</p>
              <p>However, as with most such things, the real issue is how to gain publicity for your stance. Singa Crew's petition will make few people aware of the issues if they don't actually read it.</p>
              <p>Words can spread information and change minds, but the real challenge here is making them heard in the world beyond this forum post on this message board.</p>
