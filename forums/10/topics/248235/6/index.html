This uniform similarity includes US, Europe and of cos   Singapore etc.  So the anti govt among Singaporeans is the norm, not extra-ordinary.<br>b) personally i wish LKY to live forever.  He is the pillar of Singapore.  His PAP built for Singapore a remarkable infrastructure out from nothing.<br>c) likewise, the enormous power of the PM is the highest risk for Singapore when LKY is not around.  Put a wrong PM up there, Singapore is in big troubles.  LKY might be worried about this that he decided to pay up the ministers to reduce this risk.<br>d) I grew out of the your so called "slave" class.  Now I provide for my family and my elders with reasonably comfortable life.  Tell you this : my father was from your so called "lowest income" group. Honestly, PAP built an infrastructure for all of us so well that sometimes we need some reminder lest we take things for granted.<br>e)  GLC:  look around, these are Singaporean companies hiring Singaporeans.<br><br>Politics is an area I am nuts about.  I can only base my opinions on what i experienced and those around me.  My conclusion is different from you.  PAP might be tough.

            <div class='col-md body'>An interesting paragraph from a book.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract from Economics of the Public Sector by Joseph E. Stiglitz:</span> </strong><br><br>Government's ability to compel individuals' support of public goods, however, may also enable it to compel individuals' support of special interest groups: it can force one group to give up its resources to another group. Such forced transfers have been likened to theft, with one major difference: Transfers through the government wear the mantle of legality and respectability conferred upon them by the political process. <span style="color: blue;">When political process in a country becomes detached from the citizenry and is used to transfer resources to the groups in power, the distinction between taxation and theft becomes blurred at best.</span><br><br>These issues were of critical concern to the founders of the United States. The rebellion that became the Revolutionary War is often dated to the Boston Tea Party, which was motivated by the conviction that unjust taxes were being levied on the colonies. The slogan <span style="color: blue;">"Taxation without representation is tyranny"</span> provided one of the central motifs of the revolution. Distinguishing between the legitimate and illegitimate uses of the power of taxation is a matter of continual contention.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Taken from Low Thia Khiang:</strong><br><br>According to a 2005 report by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations, the Singapore civil service has some of the highest paid civil servants in the world. Our government holds the view that this will ensure a clean, competent and effective civil service. However, the facts show that other countries with lower paid civil servants are also able to enjoy such qualities.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Based on the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) and Global Competitiveness Index (GPI), Singapore ranks below Finland and Denmark for 2005 and 2006. </span>However, the governing of a country should not only take into account these 2 factors. A more important factor that directly affects the lives of every Singaporean living here is the quality of life. <span style="color: blue;">A survey that evaluates 39 quality of living criteria, including political, social, economic and environmental factors, personal safety and health, education, transport and other public services, found in 2006 that Swiss cities have topped the annual survey again, while Singapore, with its highly paid and thus highly competent and clean government, ranked best only among Asian cities but was 34th in the world (ST 2 April 2007).</span><br><br>Based on the above facts, it would be interesting to know how much the civil servants are paid in countries such as Denmark, Finland and Switzerland, just to name a few. According to a United Nations report, the Switzerland Federal Office of Personnel revealed that the basic remuneration of civil servants range from 55,000 Swiss Franc to 321,000 Swiss Franc in 2006, which based on an exchange rate of 1.25, is about S$69,000 to S$402,000. Good performers receive merit increments of up to 6%, while worst-performing staff may get a decrease in salary. Although bonuses can reach 12% of salary for outstanding performance, and residence and overtime allowances are paid,<span style="color: orange;"> it still seems that the highest paid Swiss civil servants receive a lower salary than what Singapore civil servants and Ministers receive. (Note: they have neither a prime minister nor a president) </span><br><br><a href="http://www.wp.sg/wp/articles/2007/0409_ltk_ministerial_civil_service_pay.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.wp.sg/wp/articles/2007/0409_ltk_ministerial_civil_service_pay.php</a></div>

Shucks - seems that their pay increment/adjustment does not base on their performance - rather it is based on the economy.  Correct me if I am wrong.    As politicians their main duty/responsibility is to serve the nation, so how they perform it is really up to the nation to judge.  If economy is not doing well, will their pay be deducted.  [b]Now that lee hsien loong claims that economy is doing well, is he going to give the green light to restore the CPF contribution to employees?</strong>  Seems he only care for himself.  He and his $$$$$$ !   In our hearts, we know if he is genuine to care for the people of singapore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Let's see what percentage of vote he will get in the next election.  [/b]</blockquote>Would like to expound on rane's point... PAP cannot take credit for this round of economic growth, definitely not to justify their astronomical salaries.<br><br>1. The entire GLOBAL economy is doing well, not just SG. In fact, SG is NOT the best performing Asian economy, not even close. For the PAP to take credit is hogwash. In fact, if they want to tie their pay to GDP, we should benchmark our GDP to the best-performing Asian economy, like China or India. By this measure, the ministers should be taking a paycut, not a pay increase.<br><br>2. Our economy is doing well because <strong>4 million Singaporeans made SACRIFICES and took a CPF cut in 2002</strong>, and for many, pay freezes and pay cuts as well. Until now, this cut has yet to be fully repealed. For the PAP to take credit for the sacrifices of 4 million citizens is a sick joke. It is like your lawyer advising you to spend less to pay off your credit card debt, then charges you $5000 for his 'advice'. Who made the sacrifice? YOU!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think the problem here is what are the qualities u look for in an MP? Do u need an expert surgeon to be an MP. His specialty is in operation n not diplomacy and more paper work. Will he be a good administrator? More importantly will he be a good MP who noes what the ppl need?</div>
