Although the thread topics surround one issues, they are mainly discussing different aspects of it. And to combine a polling thread to discussion thread will only create even more confusion. Perhaps the moderators can open up one or two at least for us to continue our discussion?Thanks in advance.</div>

(1 thread limit causes disorganization in a big issue discussion)<br><br>I have great respect for moderator bc to consolidate to 4-5 sub topics, mod must be familiar wif the topic discussed, choose the appropriate topics to leave open; and which to close (best to close the topic with an message redirecting reader to the approp thread)</div>
