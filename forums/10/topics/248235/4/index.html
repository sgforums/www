            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by CannotTahan:<br><strong>The world has changed since our independence.  Money flows at lightning speed today.  The ability to attract and "hold" the money is an achievement.  These monies do not belong to Singaporeans.  So you dont see them going to our pockets.  What it does bring is employment and higher salaries, of course first in the banking sector.  By doing this, we are de-coupling from China and India's competition.  The immediate impact is the private residential properties, first in the prime districts, because foreign monies already bought.  The longer term impact is continuing climbing residential property prices including HDB , year after year.  What do you prefer?  Certainly a HDB flat worth about the same as a private apartment in London in the future.[b]</strong>[/b]</blockquote>What the heck are you talking about? What do you mean by "decoupling"? How is a rise in residential property prices a good thing? As it is, many people are in debt as it is just to live in a flat. With so much debt, it isn't a surprise that population growth is low, and people even consider migrating.<br><br>ANd just how does the money come to our pockets? What jobs? Most jobs end up in foreigners. Are the jobs good? The financial sector is a different ball game from the rest of the industries, and by no means are the jobs we are getting of the high end variety. Glorified technicians do not get good pay in the long run.</div>

LHL has set a highly sensitive political decision because the population's support especially during general elections depend a lot on trust.

Shucks - seems that their pay increment/adjustment does not base on their performance - rather it is based on the economy.  Correct me if I am wrong.    As politicians their main duty/responsibility is to serve the nation, so how they perform it is really up to the nation to judge.  If economy is not doing well, will their pay be deducted.  Now that lee hsien loong claims that economy is doing well, is he going to give the green light to restore the CPF contribution to employees?  Seems he only care for himself.  He and his $$$$$$ !   In our hearts, we know if he is genuine to care for the people of singapore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Let's see what percentage of vote he will get in the next election.</div>

So wonder does serving the nation comes first or getting fat salary comes first.    IN singapore, theirs is the only job that is secure and pay so super well.  So far no retrenchment - so secure!! Generally speaking, if the politicians of the country put earning fat salary as their top priority then how far - how sincere for them to care and serve the nation.  So don't blame the nation for doubting their sincerity to become ministers, PM and so on.  Are they genuine to serve the people?</div>
