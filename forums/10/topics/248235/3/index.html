But what you said is right, the people of Singapore are slaves. Slaves to the tyranny of the Lee Family, I doubt that this powerful family will ever be overthrown due to the cowardice of these slaves. Without the proper support, as well as the suppression by the current government, there is no hope at all for an opposition system in Singapore, a so called democratic society.<br><br>Time and time again the government has modified the election arena to their advantage. Time and time again the government has abused the trust of the people. The time of MM Lee is nearly over... I hope there will be no more votes of what the Man did in HIS TIME. I hope the people will see for themselves what the current batch of Ministers are doing in OUR TIME.</div>

I wouldn't say that HDB resale prices are very low... yeah I also agree that money flows at lighting speed ... into the pockets of the government.<br><br>Did the government not attract talents in the past? How much did they use to pay those talents? Look at the 'talents' now... I prefer to called them elites detached from the harsh realities facing most Singaporeans.<br><br>If not, please explain the public outcry over the pay rise.<br><br></div>

The private sector works hard to bring in money and further investment. Do not discredit the average Singaporean's contributions. Without the commoners, where will there be a govt that can sit there and earn so much money, without the risks?<br><br>Also, it does not necessarily bring employment, much less higher salaries. Most singaporeans salaries have been stagnated even though the economy is getting better, and many jobs are taken away by foreigners coz the govt does not trust their own people.<br><br>So what if the HDB is worth the same as a private apartment? HDB is meant to be affordable, so that the average Singaporean can afford it.<br><br><strong>End of the day, pls remember, this is a govt, NOT a private corporation. The govt's duty is to ensure all Singaporeans are having a good living, and not only giving elites opportunities to become rich.</strong><br></div>

Let me give you a simple analogy<br><br>If you are in a 2-star or 3-star hotel, and you are paying that sort of price, your expectations of the service are low, basically, you will be more willing to do many things yourself.<br><br>However, it is different in a 5-star or 6-star hotel, when you are paying astronomical prices. You expect them to do everything for you as far as possible.<br><br>Similarly, for the govt, its the same. If they pay themselves so much, then they have no moral right to ask singaporeans to take care of themselves, coz we are paying astronomical prices for the service, and we expect good or excellent service.<br><br>If they want Singaporeans to be more independent, then do not take that much money.<br><br>Just one cheap education and you are telling me they should be paid so much? That is the only good thing, medical costs are escalating, transport costs escalating.<br><br>Heck, our govt is outsourcing so many things, why then are we required to pay them, sincethey have outsourced so many stuff and have less things to worry about?<br><br>Pls remember statistics. Singapore's STANDARD OF LIVING is only ranked 34th in the world. That is a TRUE statistics, and reflects truly that the govt isn't doing well in improving the lives of the people</div>
