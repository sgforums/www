              <p> </p>
              <p>...When the business interests, led by William C. Whitney, pushed
              through the first installment of civil service reform in 1883, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they
              expected that they would be able to control both political parties
              equally.</span></p>
              <p>Indeed, some of them intended to contribute to both and to
              allow an alternation of the two parties in public office in order to
              conceal their own influence, inhibit any exhibition of independence by
              politicians, and allow the electorate to believe that they were
              exercising their own free choice.</p>
              <p>Such an alternation of the parties on
              the Federal scene occurred in the period 1880-1896, with business
              influence (or at least Morgan's influence) as great in Democratic as in
              Republican administrations. But in 1896 came a shocking experience. The
              business interests discovered that they could control the Republican
              Party to a large degree but could not be nearly so confident of
              controlling the Democratic Party...</p>
              <p>...  The inability of plutocracy to control the Democratic Party as
              it had demonstrated it could control the Republican Party, made it
              advisable for them to adopt a one-party outlook on political affairs,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> although they continued to contribute to some extent to both parties
              and did not cease their efforts to control both.</span> In fact on two
              occasions, in 1904 and in 1924, J. P. Morgan was able to sit back with
              a feeling of satisfaction to watch a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">presidential election in which the
              candidates of both parties were in his sphere of influence.</span></p>
              <p>In 1924 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the
              Democratic candidate was one of his chief lawyers, while the Republican
              candidate was the classmate and handpicked choice of his partner,
              Dwight Morrow.</span> Usually, Morgan had to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> share this political influence
              with other sectors of the business oligarchy</span>, especially with the
              Rockefeller interest (as was done, for example, by dividing the ticket
              between them in 1900 and in 1920)...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>... In these terms the political struggle in the United States has
              shifted in two ways, or even three. This struggle,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> in the minds of the
              ill informed, had always been viewed as a struggle between Republicans
              and Democrats at the ballot box in November.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wall Street</span>, long ago,
              however, had seen that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the real struggle was in the nominating
              conventions the preceding summer.</span> This realization was forced upon the
              petty-bourgeois supporters of Republican candidates by their antipathy
              for Willkie, Dewey, Eisenhower, and other Wall Street interventionists
              and<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> their inability to nominate their congressional favorites</span>, like
              Senators Knowland, Bricker, and Taft, at national party conventions...</p>

              <p><strong>US Seizes Control of AIG with $85 Billion Bailout</strong></p>
              <p><em>The US government has seized control of insurance giant American
              International Group in an unprecedented $85 billion bailout. The
              Federal Reserve made the deal on Tuesday to save AIG from collapse in
              what the </em><em>New York Times describes as “the most radical
              intervention in private business in the central bank’s history.” The
              move comes as a series of financial crises has altered the landscape of
              Wall Street. </em></p>

              <p>Billionaire George Soros' $20 billion hedge fund, Soros Fund Management, may have lost at least $120 million with its stake in Lehman Brothers as the bank suffered its worst quarterly result.</p>
              <p>According to reports, losses could increase to $380 million depending on the time he bought the shares and if the fund still owns the shares. The 9.5 million shares, or 1.4 percent of Lehman, held by Soros were purchased some time between March 31 and June 30.</p>
              <p>Reports said if Soros acquired the shares at its highest price, he invested $450 million; if the deal was struck at its lowest value, the cost was estimated at $188 million.</p>

              <p><br>Key Republicans on Capitol Hill blasted the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve on Wednesday for orchestrating an $85 billion bailout of insurance giant American International Group, and the White House for not informing them of the plan.</p>
              <p>"Once again the Fed has put the taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars to bail out an institution that put greed ahead of responsibility and used their good name to take risky bets that did not pay off," said Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Kentucky, a member of the Senate Banking Committee.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, the top Republican on the committee, said the senator "profoundly disagrees with the decision to use taxpayer dollars to bail out a private company" and is upset the government has sent an inconsistent message to the markets by bailing out AIG after it just refused to save investment bank Lehman Brothers from bankruptcy.</p>
              <p>"The American taxpayer should not be asked to unwillingly assume the inordinate risks that financial experts knowingly undertook, particularly when taxpayer exposure is increased by the ad hoc manner in which these bailouts have been engineered," said Shelby's aide, Jonathan Graffeo.</p>
