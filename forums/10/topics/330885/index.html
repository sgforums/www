              <p>SINGAPORE (CNN) -- Hundreds of customers flocked to the Singapore office of troubled insurer American International Group Inc. (AIG) on Wednesday, many hoping to pull their investments and policies from the company.</p>
              <p>People in Singapore queue outside the office of AIA, a subsidiary of AIG.</p>
              <p>The crowd formed just hours after the U.S. Federal Reserve Board authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend $85 billion to a crumbling AIG. In return, the federal government will receive a nearly 80 percent stake in the company.<br><br>One person who lined up in Singapore, retired teacher Wong Yoke Inn, said she was going to pull her investments from AIA even though it would cost her about $3,000 -- the equivalent of about $2,000 in the United States.</p>
              <p>She joined an orderly crowd whose members were each given a number and a time to return to meet with a representative of AIA Singapore -- AIG's division in the island nation.<br><br>AIA tried to allay investors concerns in a statement distributed outside the Singapore office and posted on the company's Web site.</p>
              <p>"AIA Singapore has more than sufficient capital and reserves ... to meet our obligations to policyholders," the statement said.</p>
              <p>"The funds maintained in Singapore are segregated from American International Group, Inc. (AIG) and are held specifically for the purpose of meeting our obligations to policyholders."<br><br>The U.S. government announced Tuesday night that it would act to save America's largest insurer from filing for bankruptcy. Such a move almost certainly would have further roiled world markets already reeling from the bankruptcy filling of Lehman Brothers and the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America.</p>

              <p><strong>John McCain &amp; Barack Obama both have advisers tied to Wall Street mess</strong></p>
              <p><em>John McCain and Barack Obama both pledged to rein in Wall Street abuses Tuesday, but their campaign rosters include top advisers and moneymen with key roles in making the mess possible....</em></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>...To me, the most ominous flaw in our constitutional set-up <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is the fact
              that the federal government does not have control over of money and
              credit and does not have control of corporations.</span> It is therefore not
              really sovereign. And it is not really responsible, because<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> it is now
              controlled by these two groups, corporations, and those who control the
              flows of money.</span> The new public financing of the Presidential elections
              is arranged so that they can spend as much as they want: voluntary
              contributions, not authorized by the candidate, are legal...</p>
              <p>...To get back to sovereignty and the structure of the state, another
              cause of today's instability is that we now have a society in America,
              Europe and much of the world which is<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> totally dominated by the two
              elements of sovereignty that are not included in the state structure:
              control of credit and banking and the corporation.</span></p>
              <p>These are<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> free of
              political controls and social responsibility</span>, and they have largely
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">monopolized power </span>in Western Civilization and in American society. They
              are ruthlessly going forward to eliminate land, labour,
              entrepreneurial-managerial skills, and everything else the economists
              once told us were the chief elements of production. The only element of
              production they are concerned with is the one they can control: capital...</p>
              <p>...The administrative system and elections are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dominated today by the
              private power of money flows and corporation activities.</span> I want to read
              you a summary from James Willard Hurst, "The Legitimacy of the Business
              Corporation in the Law of the United States from 1780 to 1970". He
              points out that there was powerful anti-corporation feeling in the
              United States in the 1820's. Therefore, it was established by the
              states that corporations could not exist by prescription: they had to
              have charters. They had to have a limited term of life and not be
              immortal. Corporations today are immortal: if they get charters, they
              can live forever and bury us all. They had to have a limited purpose.
              Who is giving us this bread made of sawdust? ITT: International
              Telephone and Telegraph, the same corporation that drove Ivar Kreuger
              to suicide in Paris in April 1931, when it actually was an
              international telegraph corporation, controlled by J P. Morgan...</p>

              <p>...For almost fifty years, from 1880 to 1930, financial
              capitalism approximated a feudal structure in which<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> two great powers,
              centered in New York</span>, dominated a number of lesser powers, both in New
              York and in provincial cities. No description of this structure as it
              existed in the 1920's can be given in a brief compass, since it
              infiltrated all aspects of American life and especially all branches of
              economic life.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At the center were a group of less than a dozen
              investment banks, which were, at the height of their powers, still
              unincorporated private partnerships. These included J. P. Morgan; the
              Rockefeller family; Kuhn, Loeb and Company; Dillon, Read and Company;
              Brown Brothers and Harriman; and others.</span></p>
              <p>Each of these was linked in
              organizational or personal relationships with various banks, insurance
              companies, railroads, utilities, and industrial firms. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The result was
              to form a number of webs of economic power of which the more important
              centered in New York</span>, while other provincial groups allied with these
              were to be found in Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Chicago, and Boston.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">J. P. Morgan worked in close relationship to a
              group of banks and insurance companies</span>, including the First National
              Bank of New York, the Guaranty Trust Company, the Bankers Trust, the
              New York Trust Company, and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The whole nexus dominated a network of business firms which included at

              <p>...To me, the most ominous flaw in our constitutional set-up <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is the fact that the federal government does not have control over of money and credit and does not have control of corporations.</span> It is therefore not really sovereign. And it is not really responsible, because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it is now controlled by these two groups, corporations, and those who control the flows of money.</span> The new public financing of the Presidential elections is arranged so that they can spend as much as they want: voluntary contributions, not authorized by the candidate, are legal...</p>
              <p>...To get back to sovereignty and the structure of the state, another cause of today's instability is that we now have a society in America, Europe and much of the world which is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">totally dominated by the two elements of sovereignty that are not included in the state structure: control of credit and banking and the corporation.</span></p>
              <p>These are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">free of political controls and social responsibility</span>, and they have largely <span style="text-decoration: underline;">monopolized power</span> in Western Civilization and in American society. They are ruthlessly going forward to eliminate land, labour, entrepreneurial-managerial skills, and everything else the economists once told us were the chief elements of production. The only element of production they are concerned with is the one they can control: capital...</p>
              <p>...The administrative system and elections are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dominated today by the private power of money flows and corporation activities.</span> I want to read you a summary from James Willard Hurst, "The Legitimacy of the Business Corporation in the Law of the United States from 1780 to 1970". He points out that there was powerful anti-corporation feeling in the United States in the 1820's. Therefore, it was established by the states that corporations could not exist by prescription: they had to have charters. They had to have a limited term of life and not be immortal. Corporations today are immortal: if they get charters, they can live forever and bury us all. They had to have a limited purpose. Who is giving us this bread made of sawdust? ITT: International Telephone and Telegraph, the same corporation that drove Ivar Kreuger to suicide in Paris in April 1931, when it actually was an international telegraph corporation, controlled by J P. Morgan...</p>

              <p>Quite interesting sir, however, i will like to take it as a cooking pots, first the rich capitalists put all the ingredients into the pots, cook it slightly to produce the splendour aroma for all to come and add on their own ingredients, once many had took over the cooking, the rich capitalists will scoop up their share of soup with the most expensive ingredients and leave it to boil and start another pot and so on. And the rest of them who are with the first pot will either get burnt from overboiling or scramber with losses of not getting the soup, limping away in search of another pot.</p>
