              <div class="quote"><span class="byline">Quote:</span> <blockquote> <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_control_in_Singapore">Population control in Singapore [Wikipedia]</a></strong> spans two distinct phases: first to slow and reverse the boom in births that started after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II</a>; and then, from the 1980s onwards, to encourage parents to have more children because birth numbers had fallen below <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replacement_level">replacement levels</a>. Government <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics">eugenics</a> policies flavoured both phases. In 1960s and 1970s, the anti-natalist policies flourished. The <strong>Family Planning and Population Board</strong> (FPPB) was established, initially advocating small families but eventually running the <strong>Stop at Two</strong> programme, which pushed for small two-children families and promoted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilisation_%28medicine%29">sterilisation</a>. From 1969 it was also used by government leaders to target lowly-educated and low-income women in an experiment with<strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics">eugenics</a></strong> policies to solve social concerns. </blockquote></div>
              <p>My views about the issue are as follows:<br> - If SG govt had indeed expected the baby boomers to be a burden upon 
              society during their aged years as opposed to a shrinking schooling 
              generation as their progeny numbers shrunk, then the <strong>SG govt should then have saved up enough from taxes upon the baby boomer generation</strong> and saved this value in gold (/other equity value) so as to be a ready 
              source of capital to finance in some way the retirement years of these 
              seniors since the baby boomer workforce would have been a strong supply 
              of labour and thus tax collections (and healthcare and education for the
               young a relatively less expensive concern then)- <strong>so where has the profitable taxes collected from the baby boomer generation gone</strong>?.<br> <br> - If SG govt had anticipated baby boomers to have fewer offspring to care for them in their older years, then <strong>govt should have encouraged these baby boomers to save on their part</strong>,
               and on the govt's part, promise to control the rate of inflation so 
              that the savings in cash of these baby boomers would  not be eroded and 
              thus affect the morale and determination of baby boomers to save and 
              care for themselves in their retirement years.<br> <br> - If the SG govt had earlier come clean about the problematic 
              consequences of its population control measures and eugenics programmes,
               perhaps Singaporeans would have become either more understanding of 
              'foreign talent', or at least <strong>more competent (physically and financially etc) to cope independently during old age</strong> (inflation is an unnecessary burden to the aged).<br> <br> This are just 3 of my 2c worth suggestions for now, however, the 
              selective memory loss by DPM Teo doesn't seem to augur well for the 
              progress of the current Singapore conversation. If honesty and sincerity
               cannot be ensured at least by the leading party, then I fear that the 
              current conversation can only remain tainted by distrust and suspicion 
              and rightly so.<br> <br> For a start, lets give the DPM the benefit of the doubt that being a DPM
               in Singapore is a stressful affair since apparently, Singaporeans are 
              champion <strong>grumblers</strong>. <em>"Mr Lee: 'There must be. Singaporeans are champion grumblers.'"</em> [<a href="http://www.news.gov.sg/public/sgpc/en/media_releases/agencies/pmo/transcript/T-20091228-1.html">TRANSCRIPT OF MINISTER MENTOR LEE KUAN YEWâ€™S INTERVIEW WITH MARK JACOBSON FROM NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC ON 6 JULY 2009</a>]<br> <br> Nevertheless, let us all be correctly reminded about Singapore's past population policies under the PAP government. May <strong>half truths</strong> never be told.<br> <br> Unless Singapore politicians can come clean and not sprout half truths 
              at the drop of the hat, I really cannot see how Singapore can progress 
              as one united (and loving nation), rather than a corrupted and probably,

              to care for them in their older years, then <strong>govt should
              have encouraged these baby boomers to save on their part</strong>,
              and on the govt's part, promise to control the rate of inflation so
              that the savings in cash of these baby boomers would not be eroded
              and thus affect the morale and determination of baby boomers to
              save and care for themselves in their retirement years.<br> <br> - If the SG govt had earlier come clean about the problematic
              consequences of its population control measures and eugenics
              programmes, perhaps Singaporeans would have become either more
              understanding of 'foreign talent', or at least <strong>more
              competent (physically and financially etc) to cope independently
              during old age</strong> (inflation is an unnecessary burden to the
              aged).<br> <br> This are just 3 of my 2c worth suggestions for now, however, the
              selective memory loss by DPM Teo doesn't seem to augur well for the
              progress of the current Singapore conversation. If honesty and
              sincerity cannot be ensured at least by the leading party, then I
              fear that the current conversation can only remain tainted by
              distrust and suspicion and rightly so.<br> <br> For a start, lets give the DPM the benefit of the doubt that being
              a DPM in Singapore is a stressful affair since apparently,
              Singaporeans are champion <strong>grumblers</strong>. <em>"Mr Lee:
              'There must be. Singaporeans are champion grumblers.'"</em> [<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.news.gov.sg/public/sgpc/en/media_releases/agencies/pmo/transcript/T-20091228-1.html">TRANSCRIPT
