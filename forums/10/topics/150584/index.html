We surely can do much much more than that, have people much much more Zoe and Fann. But instead, we have to push those people to Hong Kong and China... and from China, the response is not really alot of people bothered with Singapore production nowadays, and not stars except the Sun and the Ah Du.<br><br>Instead great Chinese shows are starting to flood Singapore as FTs do.<br><br>This is only making us weaker and weaker.

            <div class='col-md body'>Meritocracy is a flawed concept. It adheres to a certain narrow minded concept of judgment. S'pore is a well known meritocratic society.<br>The wrost and worrying part of the system is that it allows crooked individuals to be in power and wreck havock. Much like the NKF saga.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like for eg. somene can be good in maths but not good in memorising facts like History subject. Is it fair to say if the that person failed his history or any other subject for that matter, he failed to fulfill the system criteria? I do not think so.<br>In the first place there isnt a system in  place to identify the other talents the person may have.<br>S'pore education system had ruined many people's lives.They streamline u to VITB, ITE, Poly and JC. If u flunked your O levels to a certain extent  u go to VITB. According to them, u should have  go to VITB n waste yr life in a propaganda and well established power control scheme system meant to seregate society. Imagine the stigma attached to the person as "less capable" because he or she went to the VITB<br><br>The education system is a failure as it does more harm than good. And history had shown  that a education system in a country is influenced by political motives. For example, Japan censors its texbooks about its WW2 history.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As u can see her ein these forums, People who air radical views and suggestions may be lower educated than the elites sitting at the top. But yet they the elites dont come up with such ideas. So to ask u this question, Did the meritocracy system yield any beneficial results ?</div>
