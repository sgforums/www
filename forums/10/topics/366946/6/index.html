              <p>LONDON
                  (AP) — Investors will be keeping a close eye on how far world leaders
                  will go in expressing support for a strong dollar at the Group of Eight
                  summit in Italy, amid talk that the dollar's status as the world's
                  reserve currency will be on the agenda.<br><br> China, Russia and India
                  have indicated that they want to see long-term changes in the
                  international monetary system in the wake of the financial crisis that
                  has pushed the world economy into its first synchronized downturn since
                  the Second World War...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/nationworld/wire/sns-ap-g8-summit-dollar,0,1821705.story">http://www.latimes.com/business/nationworld/wire/sns-ap-g8-summit</a></p>
              <p>What defines the situation today is a growing realization across all
                  Eurasia from Beijing to Moscow, from Alma Ata to Ankara that the pillar
                  of the postwar order, the United States has become an increasingly
                  incalculable partner and force in world economic and political affairs.
                  Some even within the US speak of a terminal decline in American
                  influence over the coming decades, with terms such as ‘imperial
                  overstretch.’ It’s essential to understand the extent and nature of the
                  current economic and financial crisis of the Dollar System if we are to
                  make any serious calculation of the future.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">The crisis which broke in
                  August 2007 as a crisis in the sub-prime or high-risk segment of US
                  real estate credit was in fact a first manifestation of a process of
                  debt destruction <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>which is bringing the United States into a new Great
                  Depression, one that will last at least a decade, perhaps several. In
                  its severity it will be far worse than that of the 1930’s. Today the
                  USA is the world’s greatest debtor economy. In 1929 it was the largest
                  creditor. </strong></span></span>Today the USA public debt is over $11 trillion, growing at
                  the fastest rate in history. The Federal deficit this year is estimated
                  to exceed $1.8 trillion as the Treasury pours money into a bankrupt
                  banking system to try to rescue a collapsing Dollar System.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> In 1929 US
                  Public Debt was insignificant. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">Since
                  Washington abandoned the Bretton Woods Gold Exchange Standard
                  convertibility in August 1971 it has been accepted wisdom in Washington
                  that, as Dick Cheney put it, ‘deficits don’t matter.’ So long as the
                  dollar was world reserve currency and the US was the greatest military
                  power, the world would support the dollar. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>That era appears to have
                  ended.</strong></span></span> The trade surplus economies of Asia, above all China are
                  becoming increasingly concerned that the value of their dollar
                  investments in US debt will depreciate as the volume of debt needed
                  continues to soar.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In
                  recent months China has begun exploring alternative investment avenues
                  to replace their dollar investments. Russia and Brazil, seeking to
                  reduce their dependence on the dollar, plan to buy $20billion of SDR
                  bonds from the IMF and diversify foreign-currency reserves. Russia’s
                  central bank said it may cut investments in US Treasuries, currently
                  estimated at $240billion , and China says it may reduce reliance on the
                  dollar and US bonds. China today is America’s largest foreign creditor.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">This
                  is no short-term impulse to dump dollars or a pressure tactic by the
                  countries of Eurasia. It’s the beginning of a global tectonic shift
                  away from a sole financial center to many regional or ‘multipolar’
                  centers over the next decade. As the trillions of dollars of US
                  taxpayer bailouts have demonstrated, try as they might, Humpty Dumpty,
                  the Dollar System can’t be put together again, as it was even three
                  years ago. Wrong economic policies, decisions taken more than four
                  decades ago in Washington and Wall Street, have reached their relative
                  limits. The world is in what Joseph Schumpeter once called ‘creative
                  destruction.’ The consequences for the future of Eurasia are enormous.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>With
                  the pillar of the US-centered Dollar System slowly  collapsing, the
                  choices for Eurasia begin to define themselves.</strong></span></span> At this point they can
                  go one of two ways: Continue the status quo and subordinate national
                  economic decisions to support the Dollar System. That means abiding by
                  the rules of IMF and World Bank austerity. It means abiding by the
                  trade rules of the G7-dominated WTO, even on issues such as GMO seeds
                  which go against national health security. It means to subordinate
                  national security interests to NATO, an institution created in the Cold
                  War atmosphere of the Truman Doctrine in 1948. That, despite we are at
                  a time the original purpose for NATO, defense against a Soviet military
                  threat or Warsaw Pact aggression has long since become a relic of past
                  history. Those four institutions are at the heart of the 1944 Bretton
                  Woods Dollar System, as I have described in detail in a recent book.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext" style="text-align: left;">The
                  main problem for fast-emerging Eurasian nations with continuing this
                  Atlantic status quo, sometimes referred to by Washington as
                  ‘Globalization,’ is that it now means going down with the Dollar
                  Titanic over the longer term...</p>

              <p>BUT to you and me, the comman man on the street, a recession would mean we would have to hold on to our jobs, or look for jobs, and work harder, to provide for our love ones, and contribute through our taxes and CPF, to the even worse off, down and outs, disheartened, old, aged, orphans, sick, etc, and together, as a society, help one another to get out of this crisis.</p>
              <p>Will we survive, or will we die? Only you and me alone can answer this question, and it will lie in our attitudes towards life. Will we cower in fear, whine for handouts while we are still capable to provide, or work harder, smarter, not risking it all as we once did in 'guaranteed derivatives'and other forms of 'easy money', to survive, not only for our own sake, but for those around us, living simply and realistically?</p>
              <p>Regardless of whatever political outcome, or another economist's theoratical play on words of up, down, flat, mid term, long term, the awful reality is that we all still need to work to meet ours and our loved ones' needs.</p>
              <p>Life is never a bed of roses for anyone, not for the roadsweeper or the PM. Daily we face challenges, and it is how we overcome them that make us special, worthy of the human race that had survive for millions of years.</p>
              <p>And it is most certain we will all pull through this crisis, as our forefathers who had survived even worse calamities, as long as we don't lose heart, and do what is necessary - get a job - and remember to have rest as well.</p>
              <p>You and I are all that's left to save our society - our loved ones and thru our contributions,  save others who are worse off than us. Whomever and wherever you are, you are not alone in this crisis. Good luck.</p>

              <p>Will we survive, or will we die? Only you and me alone can
                              answer this question, and it will lie in our attitudes towards
                              life. Will we cower in fear, whine for handouts while we are still
                              capable to provide, or work harder, smarter, not risking it all as
                              we once did in 'guaranteed derivatives'and other forms of 'easy
                              money', to survive, not only for our own sake, but for those around
                              us, living simply and realistically?</p>
              <p>Regardless of whatever political outcome, or another economist's
                              theoratical play on words of up, down, flat, mid term, long term,
                              the awful reality is that we all still need to work to meet ours
                              and our loved ones' needs.</p>
              <p>Life is never a bed of roses for anyone, not for the roadsweeper
                              or the PM. Daily we face challenges, and it is how we overcome them
                              that make us special, worthy of the human race that had survive for
                              millions of years.</p>
              <p>And it is most certain we will all pull through this crisis, as
                              our forefathers who had survived even worse calamities, as long as
                              we don't lose heart, and do what is necessary - get a job - and
                              remember to have rest as well.</p>
              <p>You and I are all that's left to save our society - our loved
                              ones and thru our contributions,  save others who are worse
                              off than us. Whomever and wherever you are, you are not alone in
                              this crisis. Good luck.</p>

              <p>As for me, this recession affect me little. But that's not to say I cannot start preparing for the next recession (or the next wave). In fact, I work 2 full-time jobs from 8am to 5.30pm, then from 7.30pm to 10pm, 1 of which is extremely defensive (education, in tuitioning).... 7 days a week...

              <p>Furthermore, as stated earlier in this thread before it was disrupted by Atobe, I mentioned that I put my money into defensive dividend yielding stocks... My main aim is to increase my net monthly cashflow so that I can survive on lower margins in my bank savings account... Money flows to these equities, money market funds, but little on things like clothes, etc... but I do spend a lot on food :D</p>

              <p>Thing is, right after uni, an 8 to 5 job is too relaxing for me... at night nothing much to do... I'm too used to waking at 6 and sleeping past midnight, doing work in uni... for 4 yrs...</p>
              <p>Tuition is fun though... :D</p>

              <p>I'm just an ordinary 9 to 5 joe, single and with not much committment, totally insignificant, someone whom no one would ever give so much as a second glance if ever we pass by streets.</p>
              <p>But I am not blind to what is happening now in our society. Everyday I had watch families struggling to make ends meet, disheartened job seekers sweating under the sun, disgruntled uncles at coffee stalls complaining of their jobs being taken over by foreign workers, the old and aged worse off, orphanages getting low on funds, etc.</p>
              <p>Too late to blame anyone, if there is even anyone to be blamed, for no one pointed a gun to our heads to make the financial crisis happened. My salary aint much and cannot possibly do much, but I do know that collectively, you and I and everyone can do more with our contributions and encouragements. No one else can help us other than ourselves, and we must never give in to frustrations or surrender to circumstances. The time to prove our worth has come.</p>
              <p>This is as much as i can do to help here. Cheers to all, we aint dead yet.</p>

              <p>A single day away, and the attempts to hijack the thread for some self-indulgent exercise continues - amazing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is certainly a big deal to a small investor when the stock move 10 cents in an entire day , when such movements are small change for the big investors looking for "ikan bilis to complement their desire to go for cheap beer".</p>
              <p>For all your self-indulgent advertising of your TA skills  - did you manage to make any real gains yesterday by cashing in some of your previous purchases ?</p>
              <p>With all the technical expertise trumpeted, you should have scored several rounds making the daily or weekly margin gains that would have sufficiently cushioned your life - instead of sweating out with two jobs a day.</p>
              <p>How contradictory can you be in your statements to Ah Chia that you will put your  "<em>money into defensive dividend yielding stocks</em>" which you claimed will help with - <em>"My main aim is to increase my net monthly cashflow" </em>?</p>
              <p>Is the juvenile mind attempting to con the Speaker's Corner ?</p>
              <p>Dividends are paid once a year, and unless you hold a substantial size in each counter, and holding several different counters - can the dividend actually help you to "<em>survive on lower <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">marings</span></span> in my bank savings account</em>" ? - (marings ???)</p>
              <p>With your admitted limitation in investment capital, you could not possibly be holding any sizeable volumes or even spread your risks with multiple counters.</p>
              <p>Obviously you have not made any impact with your boasted investment skills, which require you to sweat out in two jobs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Without all the TA humbug - if you are what you claimed to be, you would have taken a position with one of the leading Blue Chip counter alone yesterday, and with one single lot taken in the morning, and released in the afternoon, you would have a net gain of $600.</p>

              <p>Your take. I don't need to point out how wrong your sentences are (again) or spoonfeed you where you are wrong (again) this time. All I can say is my average monthly dividends is sufficient for most students' pocket money, and my next target is to increase it to match my expenditure.</p>

              <p>Wow, <strong>talking big when on hindsight.</strong></p>
              <p>That's doing a dumb thing when general sentiments are bad. Did that in May when the sentiments were super bullish, but not now. In fact, I posted my live trades in Money forum at that time, not talking big on hindsight like you did. Do go and take a look at my posts there for proof. Or do you need me to spoonfeed you with the particular thread as well?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway thanks for pointing out my typo error. Happens often when you are typing fast enough.</p>
              <p>And anyway, none of the sharing posts were meant for thick skulled people like you with limited brain capacity to add on as well.</p>
