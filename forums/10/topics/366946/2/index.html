              <p>Stock market has little relation to how economy is.</p>
              <p>What I just said was in relation to what I learned from EW (Elliot Wave) principle as stated above. Primary A wave took about 15~18 mths from sti 3906 to sti 1455 in march 09... So we can expect Pri B to be about 0.618 or 1.618 the time taken by Pri A... And I make a first guess of 0.618, which means about next year. Primary C also about 0.618 or 1.618 the time taken by Pri A.... So... ;)</p>

              <p>You remember our school days recess time or not, a time to eat, rest and talk ccok. I remember i used to save $2 grandma gave me for my expenses, then after school go shopping centres with my mates to laze around looking for chio chio boys. Sometime, we also went tp changi airport to study...lucky no H1N1 then. This is the meaning of recession.</p>

              these <span style="color: #800000;">2) group of rich individuals then held their money back,
              refusing to invest in crazy priced properties</span>... they were waiting
              for the fall and when it arrived in November 2008, they kept tabs
              on the valuation.</p>
              <p>the screening period was from January to March, this is so
              called the stability period. prices will not fall too low from that
              benchmark after March and then the craze sets in. those who have
              "saved" enough money for property investment came in strongly,
              pushing the market. the 100% sale of <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:8@Woodleigh">8@Woodleigh</a> only proves this theory that <span style="color: #333399;">3)</span> <span style="color: #800000;">people
              just needed to buy something for the sake of buying as their money
              was kept too long in the bank.</span> the project was situated at a
              questionable plot of land where its tenure: 99 years old leasehold.
              the project just behind, in less than 50 metres away, The
              Blossoms, is Freehold.</p>
              <p>yet <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:8@Woodleigh">8@Woodleigh</a> is selling at a freehold price. <span style="color: #800000;">3) why?</span> only those buyers can
              answer. nearer to MRT, yes...  but at what price? is Woodleigh
              MRT station even opened yet? nope but i'll applaud the sales team
              for such a magnificent feat. 100% sales to idiots.... sigh...
              recession? there are still a handful of people not even slightly
              affected like those in medical, petroleum and even F&amp;B...</p>
              <p>but my personal opinion; if you wish to invest in properties,
              hold that money... <span style="color: #333333;">the bubble will burst soon</span>, it will not last as
              the economy has not shown significant improvement and shares has
              dropped in the recent days... if you wish to buy for own stay...
              find a value for money project and preferably, Freehold...</p>

              <p>I agree with what you had said, but there's a few points to note:<br><br>1) In fact, analsysts had already "predicted" that a recession was looming when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ( when it wasn't in the reds) were instructed by Bill Clinton, under his rule, to ease morgage requirements and pre-requisites.

              <p>2) There were many intelligent but poor economists in England, and i suspect many around the world, that fore-warned the people of the imminen reccession.

              <p>3) That is true to a certain extent. However, it is more towards of jumping the bandwagon. Typical Singaporeans are very "kiasu", when their neighbours or friends buy a new house, and brag that the property market is on the upswing, etc etc, <strong>they do not want to lose out</strong>. Furthermore, there were a slew of positive market sentiments, which many believed that " the worst is behind us ". However, it is merely an increase of consumer confidence.

              <p>In my opinion, the global economy would only see a recovery in 2013. However, due to the positive upbeat, this can be brought back to 2011, depending on how long this wave lasts.</p>

              <p>sigh...have we all learnt nothing from this crisis?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If stats, facts and number crunching can be relied upon, this crisis would never have happened, or even averted. It failed everyone, including the  influential numero uno of monetary policy - US Fed Reserve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's all about CONFIDENCE. How confident are you of the US dollar and the value of your own national dollar for trade and exchange of goods, today and tomorrow?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Human confidence does not follow pre-set alogorithms that can be determined or adhered to. There is no known formula to chart it' s progress or the lack. It can move and defy all laws of gravity, or it can simply sink overnight at the latest dismal natural calamities affecting Earth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, whether we are out of recession or not, market confidence will be the sole determinant and indicatr - and it will be spending. When we all spend, we will be out of recession. Properties, goods and services on the uprise will be healthy indicators of recovery, even if job stats are still low.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those holding jobs are the ones with the power to spend and full recovery will depend on them to create opportunities to open up the labour pool requirement for more growth and expansion- more jobs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Confidence and spending. They are the true indicators. Human ultimately have needs. </p>
