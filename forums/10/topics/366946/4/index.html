              <p>Unclear details, probably, especially to people looking to be spoonfed.</p>
              <p>But all I can tell you is when I posted the same thing in CNA Market Talk forum, i.e. "downwave to 2050", the forumers there understand perfectly. You can go look through the whole 260+ pages of a particular thread there to confirm for yourself.</p>
              <p>For those unfamiliar like you, too bad. I'm not touching their money. They have the cognitive ability to discern whether they should believe; they have the control over their money.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, if unclear, you can just take out your keyboard and ask. Duh. You will fail in life if everytime you are unclear, you just complain that it is unclear and do nothing about it. Am I as untouchable as the minister?</p>
              <p>Lastly, basic common sense will clear up the unclear details with a little more thoughts, especially to those who are followers of STI. Obviously you haven't given it much thought or you aren't even interested in following, in which case, there's nothing more for me to say to you.</p>
              <p>Nvm, it's ok if you aren't interested. I have no obligations to explain further to you if you are only seeking to complain. There's totally no necessity for me to share anything learned; I don't need to explain whatever actions I took to earn and profit (or loss) on my own money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By comparing a sharing post from me on what I would do to my own money, to an explanation given by a minister on what was done on Singaporeans money, and hence committing a logical fallacy, you have clearly lost whatever little respect I had for you.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Your eyes have also clearly failed you that <strong>stocks were mentioned on the very first post.</strong> There's nothing wrong in giving my thoughts and opinions on it. Yet you can link it to what the ministers are saying???? What other need is there to qualify the response at the start when it is part of the point in the first post made by TS?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>It looks more likely the case that you need to be shown the ropes how to turn on basic common sense in your head.</p>
              <p>You can call it obfuscating, confusing, anything you like. I don't need or want you to understand anyway. You don't understand anyway too; there are just so many things in this world that can easily obfuscate you.</p>
              <p>This isn't even a thread on political reality. And I don't need to be complaining like you on political reality here when I can easily succeed in this system and live on comfortably.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, by persisting like that even though I have explicitly stated that I do not need you to understand my post, you are putting yourself on the same league as PAP for their tactic of questioning James Gomez in the last elections. Maybe you want to tell me you do not condemn their methods at all, but instead, support it so well that you have to replicate it? Hypocrite.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just sharing opinions so as to protect forumers here, in case they really think the worst is over and throw too much into stocks. Really... What has Singapore degenerated into? Such that my aim/target of compassion to share my thoughts so that people will be less likely to lose money is also to be questioned and probed?</p>

              <p>My follow up reply is to clear any confusion you had. I have admitted for not being clear, because I am indeed talking to people who are not followers of STI. And it is indeed spoonfeeding because even you did not dare to challenge and check out CNA Market Talk forum on whether they will understand what was posted, which I can tell you, they will.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, haven't I take steps to attempt to clear up your confusion on my phrasing? Realised only you didn't understand? Do I need to explain to you each and every single word, and how logical it is to avid followers of STI?</p>
              <p>You were logical enough to deduce that 2050 isn't the year I was referring to because 2011 was already stated as longer term, yet how come you weren't logical enough to deduce too that it refers to the value of STI when it is on the downtrend at 2280? Isn't that waiting to be spoonfed? Thinking and deducing logics halfway?</p>
              <p>Must everything be so clear in black and white like a contract you are going to sign for you to fully comprehend? Is this seriously something that you cannot deduce and comprehend by yourself?</p>
              <p>I have never believed in stating things too clearly and fully when educating/sharing, because I strongly believe in an inquiry approach. I still refuse to believe that your brain capacity was insufficient to process what was said properly.</p>

              <p>The most essential point from your reply on Pg 2 - 07 Jul '09 - 8.30AM:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue; font-size: 12pt;    "><em>yes, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it's my mistake for not stating properly and clearly</span>  </em></span>...........</p>

              <p>Try again, incoherent person.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>You seem desparate to score with your misleading position. </p>
              <p>My reply on Pg 3 - 07 Jul '09 12.23PM - which you insist on taking out of context was:-</p>
              <p><em>Do you think that anyone who is an avid follower of the Stock Indices would have grasp the nuances in the statement made - let alone those who are unfamiliar ?</em></p>
              <p>Firstly, it was not a statement but a question to you.</p>
              <p>Secondly, it referred to your statement made in this Speaker's Corner and to "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">anyone</span> who is an avid follower of the Stock Indices" whom you are addressing in this Speaker's Corner.</p>
              <p>Is it not obvious that you should not expect the same level of understanding as those whom you are discussing Stock Indices in a specific CNA Market Talk Forum - which you had boasted ?</p>
              <p>Incoherent ?</p>
              <p>It looks like you have floated incoherent ideas in the wrong and disconnected forum, when my first response to the TS was consistently about "politics" from Pg 1.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Yes, glad that you realised fially that it included stocks.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, the item "stock" was mentioned in passing by TS in the context of a larger political statement about the state of the economy.</p>
              <p>Was he discussing in depth about the economy <em>per se</em> - or even about the stocks  performance ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>My follow up reply is to clear any confusion you had. I have admitted for not being clear, because I am indeed talking to people who are not followers of STI. And it is indeed spoonfeeding because even you did not dare to challenge and check out CNA Market Talk forum on whether they will understand what was posted, which I can tell you, they will.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The TS had started this thread as a general idea floated to get reaction from any party interested to follow on.</p>
              <p>While your approach is with tracking stock indices that was posted in some vague and misleading manner which opened itself to a different interpretation - and clearly you realised it was your own mistake <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">as seen from your own admission</span></strong> - mine was from a political angle.</p>
              <p>Even the reply from the seemingly avid stock follower <em>angel7030</em> in her post on Pg 3 - 07 Jul '09 - 11.56AM had also taken your number 2011 on its face value in her comment :-</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">by 2011, gosh! the IR is booming and credit will be free like hell, interest rate would had raise, my gosh, you need to shift it now. What SPH! for god sake, printing is not going to be the bull on the run anymore. ST engg,..wow, i better go for Keppel lor</span></em></p>
              <p>From my further questions to seek her clarification and without any leads given - she developed this further in her response on Pg 4 - 07 Jul '09 1:12PM which confirmed that even an avid stock follower had also not connected with your incoherent words of a subject that you placed in the wrong forum.</p>
              <p>You could have been more successful if you had fished for some reaction to your incoherent ideas at the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTxZXKsJdGU&amp;feature=channel">marketplace </a>in this SgForums.</p>
              <p>You will probably get more appropriate reactions from the multitude of experts in the different markets found there.</p>
              <p>  </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Furthermore, haven't I take steps to attempt to clear up your confusion on my phrasing? Realised only you didn't understand? Do I need to explain to you each and every single word, and how logical it is to avid followers of STI?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No one else seems to be connected with your idea - even <em>noahnoah</em> exchange with you on Pg 2 and Pg 3 clearly showed the confusion caused further in your clarification floated:-</p>

              <p><em>STI stocks come down in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">late 2010 to 2011</span></strong>?</em></p>

              <p>Did you correct him in his mistaken use of the 2011 stock indices as a period in time ?</p>
              <p>No, you even responded on the same Pg 3 - 07 Jul '09 12.18PM</p>
              <p> </p>

Isn't that waiting to be spoonfed? Thinking and deducing logics halfway?</p>
              <p>Must everything be so clear in black and white like a contract you are going to sign for you to fully comprehend? Is this seriously something that you cannot deduce and comprehend by yourself?</p>

              <p>Are you being consistent here, or trying to best someone to become more hypocritically incoherent than one whom you have accused to be so ?</p>
              <p>Did I deduce that 2050 isn't the year that you were referring to ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How did you read my question in my reply on Pg 2 - 07 Jul '09 - 4:58AM - which was printed as follows:-</p>
              <p><em>Stock market bottom out in March 2011...yet the current upwave will last till next year March ?</em></p>
              <p><em>Does the slide begin from March 2010 ?</em></p>
              <p><em>'Short term wise' - when the prediction is that 'there might be a down wave till 2050' ?</em></p>
              <p><em>The period - from 2009 till 2050 - is surely quite a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">short term</span></span> by any brilliant measure.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you now moving away from using the numbers 2011 and 2050  as Stock Indices as insisted in your replies ?</p>
              <p>Have you now moved to the common positions taken by <em>noahnoah, angel7030</em> and myself in seeing your numbers 2011 and 2050 as a reference to the calendar year, and not as stock indices that you wished ?</p>

              <p>It was the contents that you have presented that clearly showed the art of obfuscating - similar to what the PAP Ministers had shown themselves to be more capabable artists than you possibly can imitate.</p>
              <p>Can you measure anywhere near them, when you clearly admit your own error about the confusion that your statement had caused ?</p>

              <p>Did you find no where to post your Stock Indices even at the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTxZXKsJdGU&amp;amp;feature=channel">marketplace </a>in this SgForums and decide to continue logging into this thread ?</p>
              <p>Or did the juvenile charlaton investor - lost the eagle eyed sight - got skinned by others with better acumen then your theoretically juvenile understanding of the market place ?</p>
              <p>Another juvenile attempt at deflecting your own errors at posting off-tangent topic onto others ?</p>

              <p>I still believe that the full impact is not here yet, which is the main reason why I'm working hard to saving more, and investing mostly in defensive dividend-yielding equities, e.g. EGW, telco, ST Engg, SPH. Recession a not, people still need to use gas, water, electricity... many still use newspapers, telephone, and SAF still need ST Engg to provide equipments... No need to complain about rise in prices, because any rise to increase profits will result in higher DPU for the equities; I get the 'rebates' back.</p>
              <p>A lot of spending now comes probably from the huge corrective Primary Wave B that many has profitted from after entering in Mar lows.</p>

              <p>Singapore Tyrannosaur has labelled the "noisy pussy" as a "sock puppet" for replying to his own posts.</p>
              <p>Is it not odd that the <em>eagle</em> should practise the typical style of "noisy pussy" way of quoting from himself and maing a reply to his own post ?</p>
              <p>Yet the <em>eagle</em> will make a juvenile claim about others being the "noisy pussy" when he indulges in the despicable art of "sock puppet" postings.</p>
