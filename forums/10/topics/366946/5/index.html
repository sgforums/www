              <p>You really nailed yourself right here. Let me spoonfeed you with one more advice: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The price of a stock does not determine whether it is a high-value investment.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>6) </strong>You are still hugging to your Oei Hong Leong high-value, non-penny-stocks example even though I have given you example of his AIG (&lt;$3) trade <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><br>Then he also lost nearly a billion in forex, and suing Citibank for it. Never consider also? Or are you simply lost touch with the news? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>7)</strong> So if I'm investing, and my portfolio is left running alone, why can't I have more time to play with you here? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> I don't even need to need to salvage any pride from people like you, because all that I can see of you in this forum is complaining like a complain queen. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>My pride comes from my profits which speak for themselves, not from people like you hor <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>8) </strong>Deluded by big percentage movements? Oh come on, do you even know the power of percentages? Maybe you should retake your O level E maths :D</p>
              <p>You are just like someone I knew, who told me a 10 cent gain for a $0.60 stock is not as good as a 50 cents gain for a $5 stock <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong> 9)</strong> This 9th point is in response to your previous reply to my explanation of using the inquiry approach which I missed.  You said:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Is that anyone's fault for your preferred juvenile position
                                                  taken ?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Oh please... Before you take it as juvenile, please do your google research ok? Don't wait to be spoonfed.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Indeed, go announce to the world that an inquiry approach is juvenile.</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Aiyah, since you want to call me juvenile investor or of juvenile mind, by all means go ahead la. You sound like you are an extremely insecure person such that you need to do such things on a virtual platform. My main aim was sharing, your main aim was 'insulting' and attacking. Go ahead, I shall be kind to you poor thing. I don't need any name or position or even recognition to be earning from stocks. All I know is I can earn money can liao. Being called juvenile a not doesn't matter. I don't need to be in the league of Oei Hong Leong to earn comfortably through stocks. And what  for do I need to spoonfeed someone who has no ideas of what is a penny stock further?</p>
              <p>Anyway, much of what I said in this post has pretty much 'spoonfed' you. Hope you learned a bit at least. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"> And thanks for entertaining me so much.</p>

              <br> Companies:JPMorgan Chase and Co
              <br> <br> The economy is on its way to recovery said JPMorgan Vice Chairman James
              B. Lee, Jr., though some work still remains before a complete rebound
              is underway.
              <br> <br> The government and the private sector must work together to ensure that a complete recovery will occur, he said.
              <br> <br>“I do think we’re on the right track, but what has to happen now is
              Republicans, Democrats, private sector, people on the Hill, people in
              the White House, as Americans we all have to work together,” said
              Miller.
              <br> <br> Despite the economic turmoil the markets have suffered in the last year, Miller said he has strong faith markets will rebound.
              <br> <br> “I’m a long term optimist on our country, on our economy, and on our company,” said Miller.</span></p>
