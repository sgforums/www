If you don't even know what it is for, or don't believe it, you have just nailed yourself yet again by saying contradictory things, i.e. that I would have bought at ytd's low and sold at ytd's high ===&gt; That is not how I would use TA. Duh again. You are taking a gambler's mindset, not a trader nor an investor. It's the "aiyah, should have done this should have done that" mindset.</p>

              <p>Anyway, this is really for sharing. TA is all about reading into psychology and turning probabilities to your side. And why I believe is because I have seen first hand how it can actually work quite well.</p>
              <p>Why I think it works well most times is because financial institutions are using computer programs to help them do speed trades, so much so that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Big fund managers fight among each other, we small fish just join the ride. That's my opinions :D</p>
              <p>And especially in times of recession... It can be quite amazing because human emotions are running at adrenaline... Believe it a not, when TH dumbly went to buy in Citibank, Eillott Wave Princple has actually foresaw much more downside to come... For me, this is on hindsight, but to pple in CNA forum, as well as to pple here, we all knew that it was dumb by gut feeling...</p>

              <p><br>Seriously, eagle - this is nothing personal but I do take issue with TA especially in its attempts to bring market psychology into any quantifiable means into its analysis.</p>
              <p>On its technical side, there are merits in its method to track the daily ups and downs - so that one can have a historical trend to study.</p>
              <p>By overlaying or placing the physical or astrological events that affected the recorded performance at any particular point in time, it will help one's own judgment in the decisions to be taken either at that same co-incidental cyclical point in time - or for the longer term.</p>
              <p>TA helps up to a point.</p>
              <p>At the end of it all, it is still gut feeling that makes one call the shot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is not an attempt to best your efforts - the following will help clarify what you have stated about TA - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.buzzle.com/articles/technical-analysis-stock-market-trading.html">Technical Analysis in Stock Market Trading </a>- and let others take some measure for their own benefit.</p>

              <p>I strongly agree with you that TA helps to a point... My main aim is just to reach expand the effects of how much help TA can give... TA can fail, because ultimately, it is merely increasing your probability...</p>
              <p>However, I do not think that gut feelings call the shots mostly. This is mainly because of computer programs and algorithms that Goldman Sachs used to make millions.... and computers don't use gut feelings...</p>
              <p>What I do is to identify already undervalued stocks by FA, then use TA to determine when to enter. In a way, my probability of going wrong is lower.</p>
              <p>In short, TA helps, but in the long long run, FA wins...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, gut feelings still do help... Like what Warren Buffett said, "I rather be lucky than smart". I have indeed been lucky so far.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, my main aim is in passive dividend investing in defensive sectors because I want to survive more on dividends than salary eventually... And the first thing that comes in is SPH, Starhub, ST Engg, CitySpring as well as certain REITs... For Starhub and CitySpring, the dividends come in quarterly, so it's quite good... These are my long term investments which I'm not going to touch much... And only when I reach a certain level (abt 12k dividends monthly, average 1k monthly) will I change strategy :D</p>
              <p>This, I feel, is one good way of helping to survive recessions... I'm lucky this time to emerge relatively unscathe, but I'm already planning for the next recession, which I forsee will happen in 10 years time due to the cyclial nature of economies.</p>
              <p>I'm more or less of the same idea as this person who's writing in sgbluechip.blogspot.com</p>
