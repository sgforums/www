              <p>Do you seriously think that all the monies that Singaporean contribute into the CPF is sitting there "un-USED" to back the Singapore Dollar ?</p>
              <p>In the first place, do you understand the mechanics in how the money of a country is being backed ?</p>
              <p>In the early days when the PAP Government stepped into the Government, there was ZERO amount in the Ministry of Finance and in the Treasury - as claimed by LKY.</p>
              <p>Money had to be raised to get the gears of Government running or the machinery to govern Singapore will collapse.</p>
              <p>The CPF was initially started by the British Colonial Government as an addition to the Pension Scheme, and was intended to be a Retirement Saving Fund - much like that offered by Banks today.</p>
              <p>The CPF scheme started by the Colonial Government was VOLUNTARY based.</p>
              <p>This provided the PAP Government with the easiest source of money that is available immediately.</p>
              <p>Legislations was passed to make CPF contribution a monthly affair, and made COMPULSORY for all new workers - while those who have been employed under the pension scheme, were offered a choice of keeping the pension or switch over.</p>
              <p>The money in the CPF was borrowed by the PAP Government for all the infrastructure development in Singapore at a cheap rate of 2.5 per cent per annum.</p>
              <p>The CPF was the Banker to the Government, and the loan taken was returned to the CPF Board from the annual surplus that the Government managed from all the various revenue generating programs.</p>
              <p>The CPF will in all probability keep the money collected in a continuous state of investment in various areas - keeping a balanced ratio of cash to investments.</p>
              <p>There has never been any clear indication as to what kind of investments the CPF monies had gone into, but one can be certain that a substantial amount would have gone to the various types of bonds offered by the Singapore Government and the various GLCs that provide essential services to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>If the Singapore Dollar should go down in value, it will not be a lack of CPF backing but more due to the Singapore economic viability to support the SingDollar.</p>
              <p>The revenue that this Singapore Government report is not from the huge industrial output of manufactured goods exported, but from the revenues that this Government collect through various direct and indirect taxes imposed on Singaporeans, as well as from the revenues collected by the various GLCs charging Singaporeans for the essential services provided.</p>
              <p>Singapore export less than Hongkong, yet the Governmet can report huge annual surplus that outstrip Hongkong's.</p>
              <p>No wonder this Government insist on being paid similar wages as the Corporate Executives in the Private Sector, as the Ministers are the executives managing Singapore Incorporated.</p>

              <p>Whether it is used for investment or saving in our treasury, it uphold the sing dollars, do you want your sing dollars to depreciate overnight and find your saving lowered by half??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Without natural resources and near corruption free govt, do you expect the politician here to rule like the junta or even our neighbouring countries?? Just imagine, without any natural resources and not even a single rice, we are on top in many way against them, sure you got to do some managment stuff to get things right. Other countries govt may be getting lower paid, but the undertable money can be anytime, more than our ministers paid, you bet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You must understand that CPF is not entirely your money, as a boss (under my daddy) i need to contribute 14.5% of my staffs CPF UNDER THE LAW OF THE GOVT, not by the staff. The staffs contribute 20%. All these are mend to secure a good old age life, the govt can alway move the 14.5% as these are by laws a contribution from the employers, therefore u have to understand that this amount is not a employee money, it is a fund under that laws to enforce the employers to help their staffs. People have the wrong concept that CPF is totally theirs, that is why the govt can manipulate the funds and give back your share of 20% only. Anyway, the govt is only planning to help the old agers to handle their CPF with care, many spent lavishly and in the end no money.</p>
