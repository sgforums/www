              <p>No news. Is just my expectations from observing charts coupled with what I think of the economy...</p>
              <p>To me, this is Pri Wave B only... Pri Wave A was from heights of 2007 to Mar 09 (~15 mths)... From wiki</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Wave B:</strong> Prices reverse higher, which many see as a resumption of
              the now long-gone bull market. Those familiar with classical technical
              analysis may see the peak as the right shoulder of a head and shoulders
              reversal pattern. The volume during wave B should be lower than in wave
              A. By this point, fundamentals are probably no longer improving, but
              they most likely have not yet turned negative.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I forsee a Wave C coming... Which likely mean a repeat of the pattern from 98-03... Although we can explain it away because of SARS, I still believe it as part of this EW principle, which was developed from observing human psychology.</p>
              <p>Whatever the world governments are doing, they are still humans, and they will still fit into this big picture of the big waves.</p>
              <p>My view is very pessimistic, and I have to agree that 2011 is still too far to say... But at least with my counting, I can roughly determine the trend and how strong it could most likely be.</p>

              <p>Unclear details, probably, especially to people looking to be spoonfed.</p>
              <p>But all I can tell you is when I posted the same thing in CNA Market Talk forum, i.e. "downwave to 2050", the forumers there understand perfectly. You can go look through the whole 260+ pages of a particular thread there to confirm for yourself.</p>
              <p>For those unfamiliar like you, too bad. I'm not touching their money. They have the cognitive ability to discern whether they should believe; they have the control over their money.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, if unclear, you can just take out your keyboard and ask. Duh. You will fail in life if everytime you are unclear, you just complain that it is unclear and do nothing about it. Am I as untouchable as the minister?</p>
              <p>Lastly, basic common sense will clear up the unclear details with a little more thoughts, especially to those who are followers of STI. Obviously you haven't given it much thought or you aren't even interested in following, in which case, there's nothing more for me to say to you.</p>
              <p>Nvm, it's ok if you aren't interested. I have no obligations to explain further to you if you are only seeking to complain. There's totally no necessity for me to share anything learned; I don't need to explain whatever actions I took to earn and profit (or loss) on my own money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By comparing a sharing post from me on what I would do to my own money, to an explanation given by a minister on what was done on Singaporeans money, and hence committing a logical fallacy, you have clearly lost whatever little respect I had for you.</p>

              <p>Lost is part of a gain, it is inevitable in the first place, nobody want a lost, who would?? But if you look at the purpose of investment, it serve no harm but a win win for the govt and it citizen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is there to explain when you dun even need to foot a cent, get your rebates, get trained/educated and get a job, still peace and harmony, travel as you like and eat as usual.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With no doubt, Share and Stock are secondary in comparing to your primary job security, the connection and the know how is critical, unless given excess money or money gained in previous selling or accumulated, you can go into share market with some fun. But never use the money that is for your basic neccessities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And as a person, Singapore govt understand the basic neccessities fund that need to be preserve our needs, the lost are part of the earlier gain, that is why, even if we are the hardest hit economy downturn around this region, we still stand tall and able to give rebates, discount and spur programme to help the lower income.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Neighbouring countries are alway an envy of us, and that come with jealousy too, despite our losses, we still stand out from the rest shown that we can afford such losses.</p>

              <br> <br> SINGAPORE: United Overseas Bank (UOB) chairman Wee Cho Yaw said the
              banking sector is not out of the woods yet and he remains pessimistic
              about the medium term.
              <br> <br>But at the bank's annual general meeting on Wednesday, he assured
              shareholders that UOB has already fully provided for all its toxic
              assets and has no plans for a rights issue.
              <br> <br>Admittedly, there were concerns among some shareholders. One of
              them, who only wanted to be known as Mr Tee, said rising non-performing
              loan (NPL) ratio poses a big risk and is an issue, while others are
              more optimistic about it.
              <br> <br>"That is only to be expected, I think the question is how much
              higher it goes up. I believe Mr Wee Ee Cheong said that during the last
              Asian financial crisis, it was at a much higher level than today,"
              another shareholder, Vincent Chen, said.
              <br> <br>Among Singapore's major banks, UOB has the highest NPL ratio at 2
              per cent. Its competitors, DBS and OCBC, have raised theirs to 1.5 per
              cent in the fourth quarter of last year.
              <br> <br>UOB justified its decision to cut its 2008 final dividend from 45
              cents to 40 cents. The bank said it is looking at the long term and
              wants to preserve some cash to prepare for any future shocks.
              <br> <br>Mr Wee also spoke about the departure of Mr Michael Lien from the
              bank's board. Mr Lien is the grandson of the late Dr Lien Ying Chow who
              founded Overseas Union Bank, which was bought over by UOB in 2001.
              <br> <br>Mr Wee said he personally called both Mr Lien and his grandmother,
              Margaret Lien, to ask them to keep a representative of their family on
              the board. However, both of them declined the offer, citing the desire
              to concentrate on their new commitments.
