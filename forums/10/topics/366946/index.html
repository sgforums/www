              <p>Been hearing conflicting status some said the worse is over , there other people said we are just a the beginning have not seen the worse</p>
              <p>one thing I can tell is the ST recruitment section is very slim , that shows employers are not hiring , some of the project i was in charge was put on hold and bank has not been disbursing loan, economy is in a state of malaise , on the other hand stock has risen so has COE , pple are thronging show house of pty launch and showroom of cars</p>
              <p>In 6 months later i will come back to this topic and post ....</p>

              <p>Did they say this?</p>
              <p>Stock market has little relation to how economy is.</p>
              <p>What I just said was in relation to what I learned from EW (Elliot Wave) principle as stated above. Primary A wave took about 15~18 mths from sti 3906 to sti 1455 in march 09... So we can expect Pri B to be about 0.618 or 1.618 the time taken by Pri A... And I make a first guess of 0.618, which means about next year. Primary C also about 0.618 or 1.618 the time taken by Pri A.... So... ;)</p>

              <p>there are people who actually "knew" the recession was coming in
              mid 2008 when property prices was pushed up beyond comprehension.
              these group of rich individuals then held their money back,
              refusing to invest in crazy priced properties... they were waiting
              for the fall and when it arrived in November 2008, they kept tabs
              on the valuation.</p>
              <p>the screening period was from January to March, this is so
              called the stability period. prices will not fall too low from that
              benchmark after March and then the craze sets in. those who have
              "saved" enough money for property investment came in strongly,
              pushing the market. the 100% sale of <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:8@Woodleigh">8@Woodleigh</a> only proves this theory that people
              just needed to buy something for the sake of buying as their money
              was kept too long in the bank. the project was situated at a
              questionable plot of land where its tenure: 99 years old leasehold.
              the project just behind, in less than 50 metres away, The
              Blossoms, is Freehold.</p>
              <p>yet <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:8@Woodleigh">8@Woodleigh</a> is selling at a freehold price. why? only those buyers can
              answer. nearer to MRT, yes...  but at what price? is Woodleigh
              MRT station even opened yet? nope but i'll applaud the sales team
              for such a magnificent feat. 100% sales to idiots.... sigh...
              recession? there are still a handful of people not even slightly
              affected like those in medical, petroleum and even F&amp;B...</p>
              <p>but my personal opinion; if you wish to invest in properties,
              hold that money... the bubble will burst soon, it will not last as
              the economy has not shown significant improvement and shares has
              dropped in the recent days... if you wish to buy for own stay...
              find a value for money project and preferably, Freehold...</p>

              <p>Economic forecast from the economic, investment and financial guru Lee Kuan Yew:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>MM Lee says Singapore at centre of world’s highest growth region</strong></p>
              <p>February 12, 2008</p>
              <p>Minister Mentor<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Lee Kuan Yew believed Asia will not go into
                  recession, citing not only strong growth in China and India, but also
                  the strength of commodity prices boosting growth in Malaysia, Brunei
                  and Indonesia.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Speaking
                  to some 1,200 people at the Tanjong Pagar Lunar New Year dinner on
                  Monday night, Mr Lee said Singapore is at the centre of the world’s
                  highest growth region, and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>is in a period of steady growth.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Mr Lee is also positive that Singapore <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>can maximise its chances to
                  reach a higher quality of development in the coming five to ten years.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>“This is quite remarkable, for it will be the<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> first time that when
                  the American economy slows down and reduce imports from Asia, Asia will
                  not go into recession. </strong></span></span>The reason is the dynamics of the domestic
                  growth momentum in China and in India – two very huge countries.
                  Furthermore, our neighbours are doing well. Singapore is in the centre
                  of the world’s highest growth region,” he said.</p>
              <p>While some may be lamenting the financial crisis, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mr Lee said he
                  sees a blessing</strong></span></span> as property prices have cooled down for the time being.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">
              </span></strong></p><h1><strong>He added that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore’s Government of Singapore Investment
                  Corporation (GIC) and Temasek have also been able to increase the value
                  of their assets, especially during such downturns.</span></strong></h1><strong>
              </strong><p></p>
              <p>The two companies recently invested some S$22 billion into UBS, Citigroup and Merrill-Lynch.</p>
              <p>“When the share prices of these banks recover (the) S$22 billion
                  investments, it will be worth S$50 to S$70 billion. But never believe
                  that assets will always go up. There will be downturns. And so we must
                  have these reserves to see us through these troughs. Singapore has got
                  to this level through hard work and thrift. We must continue in this
                  mode,” Mr Lee pointed out.</p>
              <p>On the home front, Mr Lee said higher food and energy prices, and a
                  widening income gap are cause for concern and must be addressed.</p>
              <p>He also said that while there are massive investments, such as the
                  Marina Barrage, to develop Singapore into a global city, those living
                  in the heartland housing estates will not be left behind.</p>
              <p>All estates will be upgraded and beautified to ensure all Singaporeans can benefit from the growth, Mr Lee added. – CNA/ac</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>We must all listen to and follow the guru.</p>
              <p>He is very wise.</p>
              <p>As long as we follow Lee Kuan Yew, we will be wealthy.</p>

              <p><br>This part that LKY say not true la. Anyone should noe tat. One country's economy is always tied to another, and another's economy tied yet to another and so on. Meaning, like domino effect.</p>
              <p>One get, all get. The only difference is, how hard. Singapore not too bad, as compared to other big nations. The biggest problem Singapore faced was winning investors' trusts again.</p>
