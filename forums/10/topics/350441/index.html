              <p>By Mark Pittman</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aG0_2ZIA96TI&amp;refer=home">http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aG0_2ZIA96TI&amp;refer=home</a></p>
              <p>March 5 (Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve Board of
              Governors receives daily reports on loans to banks and
              securities firms, the institution said in response to a Freedom
              of Information Act lawsuit filed by Bloomberg News.</p>
              <p>The Fed refused yesterday to disclose the names of the
              borrowers and the loans, alleging that it would cast “a
              stigma” on recipients of more than $1.9 trillion of emergency
              credit from U.S. taxpayers and the assets the central bank is
              accepting as collateral.</p>
              <p>The bank provides “select members and staff of the Board
              of Governors with daily and weekly reports” on Primary Dealer
              Credit Facility borrowing, said <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Susan+E.+McLaughlin&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Susan E. McLaughlin</a>, a senior
              vice president in the markets group of the Federal Reserve Bank
              of New York in a deposition for the Fed. The documents “include
              the names of the primary dealers that have borrowed from the
              PDCF, individual loan amounts, composition of securities pledged
              and rates for specific loans.”</p>
              <p>The Board of Governors contends that it’s separate from its
              member banks, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
              which runs the lending programs. Most documents relevant to the
              Bloomberg suit are at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
              which the Fed contends isn’t subject to FOIA law. The Board of
              Governors has 231 pages of documents, which it is denying access
              to under an exemption under trade secrets.</p>
              <p>“I would assume that information would be shared by the
              Fed and the New York Fed,” said U.S. Representative <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Scott%0AGarrett&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Scott
              Garrett</a>, a New Jersey Republican. “At some point, the demand
              for transparency is paramount to any demand that they have for
              secrecy.”</p>
              <p>Bloomberg sued Nov. 7 under the U.S. <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/">Freedom of
              Information</a> Act requesting details about the terms of 11 Fed
              lending programs.</p>
              <p>‘Financial Crisis’</p>
              <p>The Bloomberg lawsuit said the collateral lists “are
              central to understanding and assessing the government’s response
              to the most cataclysmic financial crisis in America since the
              Great Depression.”</p>
              <p>The Fed stepped into a rescue role that was the original
              purpose of the Treasury’s $700 billion <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/hp1207.htm">Troubled Asset Relief
              Program</a>. The central bank loans don’t have the oversight
              safeguards that Congress imposed upon the TARP.</p>
              <p>Total Fed lending exceeded $2 trillion for the first time
              Nov. 6 after rising by 138 percent, or $1.23 trillion, in the 12
              weeks since Sept. 14, when central bank governors relaxed
              collateral standards to accept securities that weren’t rated
              AAA. Fed lending as of Feb. 25 was $1.92 billion.</p>
              <p>Posted Collateral</p>
              <p>Bloomberg News, a unit of New York-based Bloomberg LP, on
              May 21 asked the Fed to provide data on collateral posted from
              April 4 to May 20. The central bank said June 19 that it needed
              until July 3 to search documents and determine whether it would
              make them public. Bloomberg didn’t receive a formal response
              that would let it file an appeal within the legal time limit.</p>
              <p>On Oct. 25, Bloomberg filed another request, expanding the
              range of when the collateral was posted. It sued Nov. 7.</p>
              <p>In response to Bloomberg’s request, the Fed said the U.S.
              is facing “an unprecedented crisis” in which “loss in
              confidence in and between financial institutions can occur with
              lightning speed and devastating effects.”</p>
              <p>Fed Chairman <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Ben+S.+Bernanke&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Ben S. Bernanke</a> and then Treasury Secretary
              <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Henry+Paulson&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Henry Paulson</a> said in September they would meet congressional
              demands for transparency in a $700 billion bailout of the
              banking system.</p>
              <p>The Freedom of Information Act obliges federal agencies to
              make government documents available to the press and public. The
              Bloomberg lawsuit, filed in New York, doesn’t seek money
              damages.</p>
              <p>Bank Opposition</p>
              <p>Banks oppose any release of information because that might
              signal weakness and spur short-selling or a run by depositors,
              the Fed argued in its response.</p>
              <p>“You could make everything a trade secret,” said <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Lucy%0ADalglish&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Lucy
              Dalglish</a>, executive director of the Arlington, Virginia-based
              Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.</p>
              <p>The case is Bloomberg LP v. Board of Governors of the
              Federal Reserve System, 08-CV-9595, U.S. District Court,
              Southern District of New York (Manhattan).</p>
