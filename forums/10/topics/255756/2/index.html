So better go elsewhere for good if I have a chance than to stay here and be a burden.  Remember that jerk said he will not make Singapore a welfare state.

This was mentioned in a programme or article last year or beginning of this year that every year there are how many ??? thousands of Singaporeans giving up their citizenship.
