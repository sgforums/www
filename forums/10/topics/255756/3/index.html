If not u think in ur honest opinion, these PR like<br><br>to become citizens n this is merely one of the benefit. U mentioned these local migrated still keeping their citizenship n what u meaned they not sure of themselves?<br>Is there another possibility they might have other commitment back at home? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
