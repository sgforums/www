            <div class='col-md body'>Unemployment rates are calculated based on those who seek work but cannot find it. So this means that some people who give up seeking work are not considered unemployed anymore and are generally dropped from statistics.<br><br>For example lets say our forum member Mr Dragg was seeking work in the 1st year but by 2nd year he gave up. Then in first year he will be part of the uemplpyment statistics. By 2nd year, he will not be included in that statistics. So the statistics seems to indicate a reducing number of unemployed people.<br><br>Statistics don't tell the whole picture.  Facts cannot be massaged but statistics can.</div>

Singaporeans tend to shun these jobs not because they are unwilling to do them, but rather because they do not pay enough to cover a family's expenses.<br><br>Many of my friends have not been able to get a job for months, some even years, though they have lowered their expectations drastically. One, an engineer, left his job late last year but until now has not been able to get a job.<br><br>Although he has breadth of experience and has even headed a department, so far no employer has been keen to tap his skills and experience.<br><br>He is willing to take a pay cut of up to 50 per cent to make ends meet. Despite this, he is still desperately searching for a job in a very vibrant job market.<br><br>Many friends say employers prefer younger workers as they are less demanding and more eager to learn.<br><br>Some bosses also prefer foreigners as they are cheaper to hire. Hiring from abroad both dampens wages and forces locals to compete with a mass influx of foreigners. Apparently, there are firms that will only replace outgoing local staff with foreigners.<br><br>Unless some priority is given to unemployed locals, I fear that the feeling of discontentment may grow with time.<br></div>
