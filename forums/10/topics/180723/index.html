            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">Budget not a GE sweetener, says PM<br><br>It is part of long-term policy to pave the way for Singapore's future growth, he says<br><br>By Laurel Teo<br>March 2, 2006<br>The Straits Times<br><br>TALK may be raging on this year's Budget being an election ploy to win votes, but Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday brushed off such notions, saying the Government was not so short-sighted.<br><br>'This is not a Budget merely for the purpose of distributing hongbaos to get votes,' he told Parliament, delivering his response as Finance Minister at the end of 2 1/2 days of debate on the Budget.<br><br>On the contrary, the package aims to position Singapore for the long term. Hence, it makes long-term commitments 'so that the Government wins not just the next election, but also the mandate to govern over successive terms'.<br><br>A total of 47 MPs spoke in the debate. Nearly all applauded the generous giveaways and supported its targeted approach at helping the old and poor. But many - from both the opposition as well as his own People's Action Party (PAP) - had also wondered if the goodies handed out on Feb 17 were election sweeteners.<br><br>Responding yesterday, Mr Lee put Budget 2006 in context. It comes after six years of economic upheaval, when workers lost jobs in the downturn. Many could not cope as the economy restructured.<br><br>Now, the economy was in better shape and the Government could afford to share some of the Budget surpluses with all Singaporeans, he said.<br><br>While generous, the $2.6 billion 'Progress Package' was not large compared to the $2.5 billion New Singapore Shares given out in 2001 and the $2.7 billion Economic Restructuring Shares given out in 2003, he said.<br><br>This year's package has been designed with 'growth dividends' for everyone, but it is weighted in favour of the old and poor.<br><br>These two vulnerable groups needed the most help, he told MPs who lamented that some groups were neglected, such as the asset-rich but cash-poor, housewives and younger low-wage workers.<br><br>Budget 2006 also marks a shift in Government thinking.<br><br>Said Mr Lee: 'While sharing the fruits of growth is something the Government has periodically done, this Budget is different because it recognises that the world has changed and growth will no longer deliver the same opportunities to every individual. Going forward, we will work systematically to ensure that no Singaporean is left behind as we forge ahead.'<br><br>MPs had also made many suggestions on streamlining the proposed Workfare Bonus for low-wage workers. Mr Lee said he heard their views. Indeed, he announced a small change: those who have worked for least six months in the last year will now qualify for the bonus. They need not have worked for a continuous six months, as previously announced.<br><br>While dealing with MPs' many queries, Mr Lee in his 90-minute speech also outlined in broad strokes the Budget's key priorities.<br><br>One of these is to grow the economy through investments in various sectors such as service, research and development, and to encourage enterprise. Another is to maintain fiscal prudence and make sure help schemes are financially sustainable.<br><br>As for the fear that Singaporeans might come to expect generous handouts as an entitlement, and even fritter them away on 4-D, Mr Lee was more optimistic.<br><br>He pointed to press reports of prudent Singaporeans saying they would save the bonuses to pay bills or for their children's education.<br><br>'These are the stories which give you heart and hope and convince me that we are doing the right thing by Singaporeans,' he said.<br><br>To MPs alarmed that this year's generous handouts and Budget deficit of $2.86 billion might mean that the Government was abandoning its fiscal prudence, PM Lee said this was hardly the case. Even after the giveaways this year, there would still be some $730 million left over at the end of this term of Government, he noted.<br><br>The PAP government, he pledged, would stick to its fiscally prudent philosophy of ensuring that 'every term of Government must live within its means and the Budget must be in overall balance over the economic cycle'.<br><br>Summing up, Mr Lee was confident that Budget 2006 would pave the way for future growth.<br><br>'We are on one mountain, we're climbing up. We see a whole range opening up in front of us. There is a whole range of possibilities ahead.<br><br>'With the skills and the strengths we have acquired climbing the first mountain, we are now stronger and better placed to conquer the next higher peak, and then the next.'</span><br><br><a href="http://www.asiaone.com/st/st_20060302_374745.html" rel="nofollow">Asia1.com</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>March 7, 2006<br>Budget goodies not an election 'sweetener'<br><br>I FIND the claim by the opposition that the recent Budget was aimed at winning votes for the Government ludicrous.<br><br>Firstly, what votes are the opposition parties talking about? For several decades now, voters have supported the People's Action Party (PAP) Government, both in good and bad times.<br><br>The PAP Government, clearly an icon, is viewed with admiration and envy by leaders and citizens of many nations.<br><br>Opposition parties had plenty of time, over the years, to prove their worth. They went on campaigns to try and win voters over to their plans for a better Singapore, and each time the voters shut them out, except for two constituencies.<br><br>The PAP team has shown that it delivers on its promises. It is always ready with a new pool of leaders to ensure continuity in the governing process.<br><br>It understands its responsibility: It is not about winning one election; it is about securing continual growth and benefits for the nation and its people.<br><br>The opposition parties would like the people to believe that whenever they bite the dust in an election, it is not a case of voters rejecting their candidates or plans but rather one of voters being bought over with 'sweeteners' from the incumbent government.<br><br>This insults the intelligence of voters.

For several decades now, voters have supported the People's Action Party (PAP) Government, both in good and bad times......<br><br>.....Opposition parties had plenty of time, over the years, to prove their worth. They went on campaigns to try and win voters over to their plans for a better Singapore, and each time the voters shut them out, except for two constituencies.<br></blockquote>Have the people actually voted? Or have the number of walkovers increased? For several decades, the politically slanted re-drawing of electorial boundaries by a supposedly 'neutral' committee have effectively killed off any attempts at long term planning by opposition parties to bridge the heartlands.<br><br>What long term implications did NSS or ERS shares have in helping the average singaporean ride the 'storm' of economic downturn back in 2003? Is it any coincidence that there will be another round of pay-outs for budget 2006 coming so close to a potential GE?<br><br>Have our citizens become so absent-minded the moment money is thrown at them?<br><br><blockquote>The opposition parties would like the people to believe that whenever they bite the dust in an election, it is not a case of voters rejecting their candidates or plans but rather one of voters being bought over with 'sweeteners' from the incumbent government.<br><br>This insults the intelligence of voters. Voters have matured over the years and still they go with the winning team. They are definitely not puppets on a string. </blockquote>Indeed, with a nanny mentality created by the govt for the sole purpose of generating a dependent society craving for HELP, can we truly mature beyond the supposed level needed to offer measured opinions?<br><br>Those who emigrated to other countries were callously labelled as 'quitters', yet they are the ones who found their niche. And ironically, they had to 'quit' their NANNY to find it.<br><br>Now the govt suddenly has a change of heart, allowing overseas voting and advertising plenty of sweeteners to attract back the 'lost sheep' from the herd.<br><br>What do these actions speak about the hypocrisy of our leaders?<br><br>And with various fee hikes, exponential costs of living, stagnant salary packages, glossed over employment statistics, WHAT PROMISES have the ruling party lived up to?<br><br>Where is the purported pipe dream of SWISS STANDARD OF LIVING mouthed off by our SM GCT? Or the fantasy of GOAL 2010 by the arrogance of Mah Bow Tan? Would Buangkok MRT have opened without the famous (now infamous) WHITE ELEPHANTS saga? Wasn't that one of the promises by our transport minister, only to be marginalised citing lack of population and high costs?<br><br>So many unanswered promises, and no admissions of MISTAKES and BAD DECISIONS.<br><br>That is the daily story of our self-styled INFALLIABLE Ruling Party.</div>
