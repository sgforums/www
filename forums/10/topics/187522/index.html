            <div class='col-md body'>Strange is our system of laws and enforcement nowadays.<br><br>Under Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act 2004, any resident has a right to lodge a complaint to the Strata Title Board if any decision or improvement of the Condomium Management Corporation only benefits certain residents and not all the residents in the same estate equally.<br><br>For example, if a certain car park lot is reserved for certain residents the rest can file a complaint to the Strata Title Board to demand justice.<br><br>As another example, a resident paying the same maintenance fee for maintenance of the common areas in the estate has the right to equal treatment. So if his condominium management council say builds a better tiled lobby for certain block or part of the estate using the common fund to do so, the residents who fail to get similar benefits can lodge a complaint to the Strata Title Board to ask for fair treatment.<br><br>I wonder why residents of Toa Payoh at certain blocks of the same age cannot get similar upgrading of lifts with stopping at every floor if this kind of upgradig is done to certain other block or area.<br><br>Surely HDB will be as fair to residents as those in private condos based on payment of same maintenance fees and equality of rights of citizenship as stated in the National Pledge and the Constitution. Such rights surely are non-politicised to divide the country in privileged and less-privileged citizens as they are based on payment of maintenance fees and have nothing to do with who is elected the MP and where are the GRC lines drawn in different years.<br><br>It will be the most strange kind of law in this world if the estate residents cannot be entitled to same treatment based on their payments of same rate of maintenance fees from the beginning to the HDB even if the estates were subsequently handed over the Town Council. If not then why hand over the estate to Town Council or MP as surely the residents like the reason given for GRC i.e. racial harmony should not suffer any discrimination. Why the same amount of contributions to common fund cannot entitle the residents to equal treatments in upgrading. Why must estate upgrading be made into any issue or even be determined by the MP who do not pay such funds for the residents. What differences can the MP make in maintaining and managing estate's common property using common fund contributed by the residents.<br><br>Will the Strata Title Board be able to give some valuable advice to our Mayors and the professional MA of the Town Council having jurisdiction over the equitable use of common fund for estate maintenance and upgrading.</div>
