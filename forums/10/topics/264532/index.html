He is the worst we can have for a PM in Singapore.  Say or criticise whatever about the past PMs, think they in their ways contribute much more than the junior lee.<br><br>It is so questionable why he enters politician to serve people.  Wants to earn more $$$, be a business man.  he is giving himself bad publicity as a politician who concentrates so much on money making than care enough to servce the people with sincerity.<br><br>Well, ultimately the people have a choice on voting day.  Some people are to blame themselves for the choice  they have been making.  So it is two sides to a coin.  Make them the choice, so please don't complain and blame them for the continuous rise of the cost of living within short time.  You have yourself to blame!!!
