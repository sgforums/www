            <div class='col-md body'>While S Korea govt turned crisis into tech revolution PAP might turn crisis into social erosion, if they opt for the casino!<br><br>The future is South Korea<br>Tech firms try out latest in world's most wired society<br>Birgitta Forsberg, Chronicle Staff Writer<br><br>Sunday, March 13, 2005<br><br>If you live in South Korea, it is an everyday reality to have always-<br>on superfast Internet -- broadband -- both in your cell phone and in<br>your home.<br><br>South Korea is the most wired country on the planet. Some South<br>Koreans can get up to 20 megabits of data per second -- breakneck<br>speed by today's standards. Americans are lucky if they get 4 Mbps.<br><br>While South Korea leads in the rollout of broadband, the United<br>States --<br><br>supposedly the world's technology leader -- comes in no better than<br>No. 13, according to experts. About 76 percent of households have<br>broadband in South Korea. The figure is 30 percent in the United<br>States.<br><br>Broadband widens the digital data pipeline to allow complicated<br>files, including pictures, graphics and video, to be downloaded at<br>near-instant speed. Experts consider the development of broadband<br>networks to be the single most important step for expanding digital<br>technology and bringing cutting-edge computer applications directly<br>into people's lives.<br><br>While broadband is usually associated with computers, wireless phones<br>are also an important part of the picture. Here the situation is<br>similar to computers. Some 75 percent of South Koreans have a mobile<br>phone, compared with 60 percent of Americans. And South Koreans<br>generally do more and cooler things with their phones.<br><br>"There is no point in Korea where you can stand without receiving a<br>signal," said Joy King, director of industry marketing at Hewlett-<br>Packard. "In the U.S., we are still at the 'can-you-hear-me-now'<br>level. When Europe and Asia are moving to multimedia text messaging,<br>the U.S. has just started text messages. The U.S. is a Third World<br>country in this aspect."<br><br>Silicon Valley used to be hailed as the world's high-tech capital.<br>Now many consider South Korea the king.<br><br>"From my perspective, Silicon Valley does not have that role. The<br>lead is in Asia, in Korea and Japan, no question," King said.<br><br>South Korea has managed to leapfrog the United States in both<br>broadband and mobile phone usage thanks to a population density that<br>makes connectivity easier and government policies that promote<br>development. South Korea also has a culture where people are crazy<br>about playing online games and don't go home after work. Instead,<br>they go to dinner, to karaoke or to a bar -- all the while using<br>their mobile phones.<br><br>U.S. technology leaders are sounding the alarm that the nation is<br>falling dangerously behind in broad areas of digital innovation,<br>including broadband.<br><br>Last week, technology executives affiliated with the lobbying group<br>TechNet traveled to Washington to press for government policies that<br>would promote broadband development.<br><br>The U.S. information superhighway has turned into a "bumpy, two-lane<br>country road" compared with broadband development in other countries,<br>the group said.<br><br>Future is now in South Korea<br><br>As Silicon Valley's biggest corporations complain about the relative<br>backward state of broadband in this country, they are rushing to<br>South Korea to see if their products pass muster with some of the<br>world's most demanding technology customers.<br><br>Silicon Valley companies view South Korea as a sort of time machine<br>when testing broadband applications, a place where they can get a<br>glimpse of what Americans will use in the future.<br><br>Samsung, the giant South Korean electronics company, tests its new<br>products in Korea first for six to eight months. "It collects<br>feedback from customers (to) remodel and fix things before<br>introducing the products worldwide," said Jong Kap Kim, executive<br>director of South Korea's iPark Silicon Valley. "And several U.S.<br>companies are doing the same."<br><br>Microsoft brought MSN Mobile, which enables instant messaging on<br>mobile phones, to South Korea two years ago. It introduced the<br>service in the United States six months later.<br><br>"It's still much more popular in Korea," said Brooke Richardson, MSN<br>lead product manager. "It's not only that the U.S. is not so advanced<br>in broadband. Mobile phone usage is not so high here either. MSN is<br>bridging the two worlds of PCs and mobile phones, and Korea has that<br>connectivity. We have incubated some of our stuff in Korea, like<br>mobile instant messaging and mobile e-mail. We have also launched<br>services there that the rest of the world was not ready for."<br><br>For example, with MSN Messenger, Koreans use avatars, a cartoon that<br>represents them online. When your friends see your avatar, they know<br>you're online and instant messaging.<br><br>"Basically, customers in Korea buy a virtual person. For a small fee,<br>they can buy clothes, shoes and purses for it," Richardson said.<br><br>Crisis turned tech revolution<br><br>South Korea's success story began when the country was hit by a<br>financial crisis in 1997 and 1998.<br><br>"At that time, the Korean government turned to the high-tech industry<br>as a solution to overcome the crisis. Broadband was a new market with<br>new demand for modems, routers, servers, computers, a new<br>infrastructure. It caused a lot of activity and created many jobs,"<br>iPark Silicon Valley's Kim said.<br><br>The South Korean government ensured competition by ending state-owned<br>Korea Telecom's monopoly. The government spent billions of dollars<br>building a fiber grid, reaching schools and government buildings, and<br>offered another billion in financial incentives to phone companies<br>that strung broadband links to homes. Tough competition drove prices<br>down, demand surged and the country was on a roll.<br><br>South Korea is also a small country where 30 percent of its 48.6<br>million inhabitants live in the three main cities -- and most of them<br>in dense apartment blocks.<br><br>"It's unbelievable dense," said Ward Hanson, a research fellow at the<br>Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research who recently returned<br>from a visit to South Korea.<br><br>"When you drive in to Seoul along the Han River you see thousands of<br>high- rise buildings, 20 to 30 stories high. It's much like Manhattan<br>in New York, but even denser than that."<br><br>And it is much cheaper and much easier to wire an apartment building<br>than a typically spread-out U.S. city and its suburbs, not to mention<br>the nation's vast rural areas.<br><br>Experts also point to computer games as a crucial catalyst for<br>Korea's explosive broadband growth.<br><br>"Until very recently, Korea strictly limited impact of Japanese<br>culture, remembering the colonial Japan, and prohibited videos,<br>movies, video games and PlayStations from Japan," Hanson<br>said. "Koreans therefore played PC games and a whole industry with<br>game parlors grew. Now there are more than 100,000. And if you<br>competed with somebody who had broadband, you were killed."<br><br>Why U.S. lags in broadband<br><br>President Bush has said all Americans should have access to broadband<br>by 2007. To reach that goal, he has promised to remove bureaucratic<br>obstacles. But, unlike the Korean government, his administration is<br>not pumping money into the market.<br><br>HP's King cites several reasons for slow broadband<br>development. "North America is lagging because first of all it didn't<br>have one underlying standard, " she said. "Secondly (it's lagging)<br>because the government has not really invested directly in<br>infrastructure. "<br><br>And, because Americans go home after work, "the lifestyle doesn't<br>create as much demand for certain services," she noted.<br><br>Hanson said he doubts that the United States will reach its broadband<br>goals by 2007.<br><br>"In Korea, competition has been a driving force. In the U.S., you<br>often only have one cable company, and the company is not forced to<br>upgrade its speed," he said. "I have had DSL for three years and I<br>have never been approached about an upgrade. In Korea, you can even<br>watch television on DSL.<br><br>"What we have now is good for print, but multimedia is very<br>challenging. We haven't invested in infrastructure the way other<br>countries have. If you have very high speed, the whole system<br>upgrades around that, you get applications for it, and congestions<br>and bugs get fixed," Hanson said.<br><br>South Korea goes Wi-Bro<br><br>Right now South Korea is changing over to wireless broadband, Wi-Bro,<br>and it will also have digital multimedia broadcasting.<br><br>"While I drive my car, I can enjoy my cellular phone that broadcasts<br>over the Internet while I simultaneously have Yahoo map service up,"<br>Kim said. "I can just switch between the two. The tests are already<br>done, companies will start selling these applications around<br>midyear."<br><br>The Korean government has a strategy designed to push the nation into<br>the next generation of broadband applications.<br><br>It calls for the introduction of eight new services, one of them Wi-<br>Bro, which will require building three networks. That infrastructure,<br>in turn, will pave the way for nine fast-growing technologies, such<br>as digital TV and multimedia broadcasting. The program aims to help<br>raise Korean gross domestic product to $20,000 per capita from<br>$12,600 in 2003, the latest available figure. In the United States,<br>GDP per capita was $40,000 in 2004.<br><br>One of South Korea's nine new technology sectors is a computerized<br>appliance, called a ubiquitous robotic companion, which you could<br>carry with you to connect to the Internet wherever you are.<br><br>Whether or not these applications will be popular, it is clear that<br>South Korea has created an environment where technology development<br>is very fast.<br><br>And the South Koreans are using their domestic market as a stepping<br>stone into the world. Korea's information technology sector accounted<br>for exports of $75 billion in 2004.<br><br>South Korean company SK Telecom supports rollouts of wireless<br>broadband services in other Asian countries. "We are also expanding<br>our experience to the U.S.," said SK Telecom Vice President Wonhee<br>Sull, citing a joint venture with Internet service provider EarthLink<br>in Atlanta.<br><br>While South Korea has focused on consumer products, HP's King said<br>she sees an opportunity for the United States in business tools.<br><br>"The U.S. may be able to regain its footing as a leader in offering<br>services to enterprises. This goes nicely with the U.S. focus on<br>capitalism and business," she said.</div>

In 2003, US vs PRC gdp output are respectively USD 11 vs 6.4 trillions.
