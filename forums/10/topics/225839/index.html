            <div class='col-md body'>Just now an old woman was complaining that she was dupe by NTUC.<br><br>She was at NTUC Kallang supermarket and when she paid for her purchases, she was given a voucher that says $5 on it and told to go and collect some products.<br><br>What you you think? That NTUC had given you a voucher to collect free gifts isn't it?<br><br>The old woman went to the displays and was told to select some items. After she selected the items, she was told to pay $5/-<br><br>OK maybe she misunderstood...<br><br>She told them she thought it was free gifts... and she does not want it if she had to pay.<br><br>Get this, she was told, "No you have to pay... you have selected the products..."<br><br>She paid the money. Is this daylight robbery? How low down can NTUC get, duping old people.<br><br>If those two guys told me "cannot" I would have thrown the "free gifts" in his face... and walked off.</div>
