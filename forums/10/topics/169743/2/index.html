            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ndsef:</div><div class="quote_body">I knew someone will bring this topic up and start critcizing the training methods etc of SAF and even PAP. Let me shed some light into this incident.<br><br>I am currently doing my RT at Maju Camp as well. Although I am not in the same training batch as LCP Ho, the training directives and methods would have been the same. Not to forget, the weather on Sunday is cool.<br><br>Let me brief you guys on what safety precautions are taken before, during and after IPPT or Remedial Training (RT)<br><br>At the age of 35, all NSmen who will be attempting IPPT or attending RT have to go through what is known as a FFI. It is a medical examination done in the camp by the Medical Officer to determine the fitness, physical well being of the NS man before he is allowed to attend any of the physical activities. This check is done at the age of 35, 37 and thereafter on a yearly basis until the NS men is release from NS. I personally have seen NS man failing the FFI checks due to high blood pressure.<br><br>If the NS Men fails his IPPT then he will have to attend RT at one of the three Fitness Conditioning Centres (FCC). Maju FCC is one of them. Before training, there is a warming up session (which I can tell you is so easy, even teenage gals can do it) the warm up usually last about 10 to 15mins and we are given a 10 minute break.<br><br>There will definitely be at least one water point near to the RT venue. After the 10 min break, the PTIs will check with everyone on their physical status before commencing the actual training. During the training, we are given breaks at regular intervals and allowed to fall out if not feeling well.<br><br>After the training which usually last less than 2 hrs, there will be a cooling down session followed by a de brief. During this time, the PTIs will check again if anyone is not feeling well.<br><br>Trust me, the PTIs never "force" anyone over the limits. YOU ARE ALLOWED TO FALL OUT FROM TRAINING AT ANY TIME!!! A typical RT Schedule last about 2 months.... you think SAF can turn your 2.4km timing from 15 mins to 9.45mins in 2 months? If that's the case, I would suggest the PTIs become instructors for our Young Lions.<br><br>Therefore, I conclude that this is really an unforeseen circumstances. IMHO, Maybe LCP Ho was exhausted the day before and didn't sleep well. This would have affected his BP and Heartrate.<br><br>My condolences to his family. IMHO, It is really an incident that could not have been prevented by SAF. </div></blockquote>If i m not wrong, u r n officer.  we r talking abt a human life. no matter how many condolences there is, it wont b enough 4 his family.  let me tell u my incident in my reservist training.  1 of my mates was bitten by a poisoness insect while training. we radioed "them" &amp; it took "them" 2 hr 2 get 2 us.  &amp; while we were giving details of how he was bitten &amp; all the mother f u c kers "there" asked were his qualifications.  KNNBCCB!!! he is bitten by a poisoness insect!!!  ok, story continues. aft help came, took my mate, halfway thru the vehicle broke down &amp; my poor mate devasted &amp; poisoned had 2 wait 4 another transport 4 another 2 hrs.  by the time he got 2 hospital was like 5 hrs later.  luckyily, he is still alive</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well currently i really have to say that this FFI is really too basic to determine if you are fit for tough training.<br><br>to that pervious poster who said it involved just a urine sample,i did not even have to do that.My FFI procedure then was just getting a single blood sample for them to test and nothing else.<br><br>It is also well known that army MO are idiots.When i just enlisted for NS,during the supposed "medical checkup" to determine my pes status,nothing was done for me,i went in to the room,the MO just asked me this single question:Hmm you think you have any problem you want to highlight? I reply nope i dun think so and immediately based on that i am given Pes A status.Wtf,that is considered a medical checkup?<br><br>IMO lots of MO should be charged in court for medical negilence,most of them do not even have the basic moral that their mission is to save life.</div>

And the stress you get from your job/career is higher now. You may be doing 2 persons job now. Then you go for remedial training and your mind think about the coming deadline.
