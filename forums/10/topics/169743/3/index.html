I reply nope i dun think so and immediately based on that i am given Pes A status.Wtf,that is considered a medical checkup?<br><br>IMO lots of MO should be charged in court for medical negilence,most of them do not even have the basic moral that their mission is to save life.  </div></blockquote>Anyway, what exactly does FFI stand for? Full Fitness Inspection?<br><br>I get the feeling FFI is just another administrative measure adopted by the Army to cover its own arse IE "Eh you cannot blame the army for your injuries because your FFI states that you were in perfect health on discharge".<br><br></div>
