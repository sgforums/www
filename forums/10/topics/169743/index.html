            <div class='col-md body'>I knew someone will bring this topic up and start critcizing the training methods etc of SAF and even PAP. Let me shed some light into this incident.<br><br>I am currently doing my RT at Maju Camp as well. Although I am not in the same training batch as LCP Ho, the training directives and methods would have been the same. Not to forget, the weather on Sunday is cool.<br><br>Let me brief you guys on what safety precautions are taken before, during and after IPPT or Remedial Training (RT)<br><br>At the age of 35, all NSmen who will be attempting IPPT or attending RT have to go through what is known as a FFI. It is a medical examination done in the camp by the Medical Officer to determine the fitness, physical well being of the NS man before he is allowed to attend any of the physical activities. This check is done at the age of 35, 37 and thereafter on a yearly basis until the NS men is release from NS. I personally have seen NS man failing the FFI checks due to high blood pressure.<br><br>If the NS Men fails his IPPT then he will have to attend RT at one of the three Fitness Conditioning Centres (FCC). Maju FCC is one of them. Before training, there is a warming up session (which I can tell you is so easy, even teenage gals can do it) the warm up usually last about 10 to 15mins and we are given a 10 minute break.<br><br>There will definitely be at least one water point near to the RT venue. After the 10 min break, the PTIs will check with everyone on their physical status before commencing the actual training. During the training, we are given breaks at regular intervals and allowed to fall out if not feeling well.<br><br>After the training which usually last less than 2 hrs, there will be a cooling down session followed by a de brief. During this time, the PTIs will check again if anyone is not feeling well.<br><br>Trust me, the PTIs never "force" anyone over the limits. YOU ARE ALLOWED TO FALL OUT FROM TRAINING AT ANY TIME!!! A typical RT Schedule last about 2 months.... you think SAF can turn your 2.4km timing from 15 mins to 9.45mins in 2 months? If that's the case, I would suggest the PTIs become instructors for our Young Lions.<br><br>Therefore, I conclude that this is really an unforeseen circumstances. IMHO, Maybe LCP Ho was exhausted the day before and didn't sleep well. This would have affected his BP and Heartrate.<br><br>My condolences to his family. IMHO, It is really an incident that could not have been prevented by SAF.</div>

Sudden Cardiac Arrest can happen at anytime. From your comments, I gather that we can sue the cinema operators for screening RA show and causing elderly men to suffer a heart attack in the cinema?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And read my comments, THE TRAINING IS NOT VIGOROUS AT ALL. In fact the whole idea of the training is to create a habit on us to train frequently, and showing us the correct way to train. Maju OC made it very clear to us on the 1st day of the RT that it is IMPOSSIBLE for them to train us up in that short span of time. What he hope to achieve is for us to adopt the good habit of exercising on a regular basis and using the correct training methods.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well said.<br><br>No one wants to see unnecessary deaths but things would inadvertently happen. people die doing all sorts of things, just cos it happens during army training doesn't make it the fault of the SAF. The water dunking rubbish was the fault of the SAF,bad command and control but these deaths during training and stuff..no one should be blamed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know, i think there is nothing wrong with current practices.<br><br>It is just that official rules are sometimes "improvised" by people on the ground...<br><br>e.g.<br><br>Official stand: Please rest or sound out if you are not feeling well, if you don't feel well, you may opt out and come back another day.<br><br>People on the ground: Anybody not feeling well? Take note if you don't feel well, you will be miss this training and hence subjected to more remedials., etc etc.<br><br>The person in question: I miss this training because i am not well i am subjected to penalties... then what's the diff?<br><br></div>
