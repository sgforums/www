              <p>I think this scenario given by DeerHunter hardly describes the situation our government is facing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The facts are, the government has huge amount of reserves, in the past they told us that the reserves will be used to help citizens through difficult times should it arise. But difficult times are upon us and they have gone back on their words.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is more a case of having 2 rooms in a villa, one room is where the elites will feast on meat and wine; while another room for the poor with only porridge to eat. Alot like Manor Farm.</p>

              <p>No. I had already mentioned 'moral dilemma'. I am not talking about any particular isolated incident or incidents. It is only a simple test, one each of us will have to go through.</p>
              <p>Even i as a private citizen went through it. Nothing as spectacular as people lives being taken away, but equally devasting for lives were impacted by my decision.</p>
              <p>I will reveal that i cried and screamed to the stars in the quiet of the night in a far away isolated land at why i was given such a task, but the only answer i had were the stars twinkling away merrily, as if mocking me for being given the chance to play God but am found weak, given the emotional state i was in.</p>
              <p>I sincerly hope none will ever be put into such a situation, but i know such hopes will never be realized, for each and everyone of us will face our moral dilemmas one day, sooner or later,  and wish them the strength to do what they must do.</p>

              <p>What kind of a  passenger ship is that? If the officers are properly trained and knew about the fire fighting system in the engine room, they would have evacuated the engine room and closed the door and then activate the automated fire fighting sysem, even if the captain died of a heart attack.</p>
              <p>You think the captain can do everything by himself meh? Without his officers?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">1) Ask the ship owner to reduce
              the salary of the captain and lieutenants, distribute the excess of
              these salaries to help your ship crew.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">or</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">2) Greedily keep all the money for
              yourself at the same time asking the ship owner for more salary
              because you get more from selling backside at the docks. Since you
              are no longer selling backside at the docks, you demand the same
              payment as you would get from selling backside.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">There is no right or wrong answer,

              <p><br>You should choose option A with a minor correction. The captain should also seal himself in with the crew, since it's his incompetence that led to the fire in the first place. His failure to delegate responsibility to the Minister of Fire Safety.</p>

              <p>Gazelle is incapable of writing such English standard. His English standard is simply pathetic.</p>
