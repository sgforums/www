            <div class='col-md body'>This may be a case of the siege mentality syndrome. Outside small pockets of a culture/people grasping to any thing of the culture and view it as something not to be lost while the main population of the culture had moved on. I think it is even more evident to Chinese population in Hong Kong and Taiwan. One example is they still hold onto the complicated form of Chinese writing..<br><br>Another such case could also be seen in the French speaking population in Quebec, Canada. Heard from Canadian friends that the French Canadians' French is an older form of the language and is slightly different form the mainstream French in Europe. But I don't know French, so I will not further elaborate on it.<br><br>This syndrome tends to happen to small detached populations to the main body of a culture/people because under the constant influence of other cultures, they tend to hold on to what they have got as their identity.</div>

Its political justification of culture implies that if a given Race who grew up in a similar culture enviornment that share the same value  suppose to derive to a similar conclusion or at least closely related.<br><br>But that is just a polical blackmail thru ethnic identity, politically its ignorance of other race that exist in our context and national identity.<br><br>Do u not find it disconnect when the main topic for that few days was Myanmar........ and 2nd topics for the day from LHL was a deepening economics relationship in China?  there is really nothing culture here other than a relation blackmail.<br><br></div>
