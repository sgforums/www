We have never made such a decision."<br><br>'Hindraf link'<br><br>News of the apparent ban emerged after leaders of Malaysia's ethnic Indian community complained that Hindu priests and musicians had been denied visas.<br><br>Lingering ethnic divide<br><br>Authorities had already stopped issuing work visas for Bangladeshi migrant workers, arguing that labour agents were bringing in more workers than there were jobs.<br><br>The government said that the move to stop issuing visas to Indians was taken three weeks ago.<br><br>An official from the Ministry of Home Affairs told the BBC that the decision "may be linked to Hindraf", the Hindu activists group which organised recent rallies by Malaysian ethnic Indians.<br><br>Thousands of ethnic Indians took to the streets late last year in protest against perceived social and economic discrimination by the Malay-Muslim majority.<br><br>Significant move<br><br>The announcement of a ban being put in place came on the final day of a visit to Malaysia by Indian Defence Minister AK Antony and took many people by surprise.<br><br>A Vaithilingam, president of a Malaysian inter-faith group, said that the decision came without dialogue and was "unprecedented".<br><br>The BBC's correspondent in Kuala Lumpur, Robin Brant, said such a ban would be a significant diplomatic move by the Malaysia government.<br><br>An Indian worker told Reuters that the Malaysian government should not have taken such a drastic step.<br><br>"They should recognise the contribution made by Indian workers and professionals in the economic growth of the country," he said.<br><br>Our correspondent says tensions are high with a general election expected to take place early this year.<br><br></div>
