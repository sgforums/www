              <p>And the reason why they did that is because the law in Singapore is unjust. It is unjust laws like preventing people from demonstrating and expressing their opinions on political issues that have pushed activists to engage in this kind of 'illegal' behaviour.</p>
              <p>In the first place, there is no such thing as laws or government. It only exists in the mind of people, I should say indoctrinated in the minds of the masses. Do you consent to be governed? Or do you not consent to being governed? But of course, if you want to achieve such freedom, you better pack some heat.</p>

              international press and Singapore's government have often clashed. We
              can't say which side would prevail if the Singapore public could hear
              an open debate, but the fact is that we know of no foreign publication
              that has ever won in a Singapore court of law. Virtually every Western
              publication that circulates in the city-state has faced a lawsuit, or
              the threat of one.<br> <br> Which brings us to the ruling against us this week in Singapore's High Court. <a class="jigluLink" title="See other pages Jiglu tagged with ‘Dow Jones’" href="http://stevenmcdermott-tagging.jiglu.com/overlay/42114434158e840d0115937dc439441f/Dow%20Jones">Dow Jones</a> Publishing (Asia) was found guilty of contempt of court for two
              editorials and a letter to the editor published in The Wall Street
              Journal Asia in June and July. The <a class="jigluLink" title="See other pages Jiglu tagged with ‘attorney general’" href="http://stevenmcdermott-tagging.jiglu.com/overlay/42114434158e840d0115937dc439441f/attorney%20general">Attorney General</a>, who personally argued the contempt case against us, characterized the articles as "an attack on the courts and judiciary of Singapore inasmuch as they impugn the integrity, the impartiality and the independence of the Court."<br> <br> In suing for contempt, Singapore chose to go after us for the most basic kind of journalism. The first editorial, "<a href="http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/archive/2008/10/25/democracy-in-singapore.html">Democracy in Singapore</a>," reported on a damages hearing in a defamation case brought (and won) by former Prime Minister <a class="jigluLink" title="See other pages Jiglu tagged with ‘Lee Kuan Yew’" href="http://stevenmcdermott-tagging.jiglu.com/overlay/42114434158e840d0115937dc439441f/Lee%20Kuan%20Yew">Lee Kuan Yew</a> against opposition politician Chee Soon Juan. The second editorial, "<a href="http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/archive/2008/07/15/judging-singapore-s-judiciary.html">Judging Singapore's Judiciary</a>," informed readers what an international legal organization had said about Singapore's courts.<br> <br> Regarding the first editorial, we'll note that <a class="jigluLink" title="See other pages Jiglu tagged with ‘court proceeding’" href="http://stevenmcdermott-tagging.jiglu.com/overlay/42114434158e840d0115937dc439441f/court%20proceeding">court proceedings</a> are privileged under Singapore law, which means they can be reported -- though Singapore's
              media rarely do the job. Mr. Chee wrote a letter in response to the
              first editorial, which we published and which is cited in the contempt
              charge. We also published two letters from Mr. Lee's spokeswoman.<br> <br> In the second editorial, we reported on the <a href="http://www.ibanet.org/images/downloads/07_2008_July_Report_Singapore-Prosperity_versus_individual_rights.pdf">International Bar Association's critical study</a> of the rule of <a class="jigluLink" title="See other pages Jiglu tagged with ‘Law’" href="http://stevenmcdermott-tagging.jiglu.com/overlay/42114434158e840d0115937dc439441f/Law">law</a> in Singapore. This is the same outfit that held its annual conference in Singapore last year, a meeting that Mr. Lee himself touted as a sign of confidence in Singapore's courts. The Law Society of Singapore is a member of the IBA. If reporting on what such a body says is contemptuous of the judiciary, then Singapore is saying that its courts are above any public scrutiny.<br> <br> Again, we published a letter from the Singapore government responding to the editorial. This one was from the Law
              Ministry, which blasted the IBA report and us for repeating its "vague
              allegations." The IBA then weighed in, in a posting on its Web site,
              saying it wished "to correct some inaccurate comments" in Singapore's
              letter. It invites readers to read the report and "see for themselves"
              that its views are "based on comprehensive examples and evidence."<a href="http://www.ibanet.org/"> The IBA homepage is www.ibanet.org</a>.<br> <br> In his ruling, Justice Tay Young Kwang refers to us as a "repeat
              offender." He's right in the narrow sense that this isn't the first
              time Singapore
              has pursued the Journal Asia for contempt. In 1985, the newspaper and
              its editors were sued over an editorial about legal actions against
              opposition politician <a class="jigluLink" title="See other pages Jiglu tagged with ‘JB Jeyaretnam’" href="http://stevenmcdermott-tagging.jiglu.com/overlay/42114434158e840d0115937dc439441f/JB%20Jeyaretnam">J.B. Jeyaretnam</a>. The editors apologized.<br> <br> In 1989, the paper was sued for contempt again, this time over a news story that quoted <a class="jigluLink" title="See other pages Jiglu tagged with ‘Dow Jones’" href="http://stevenmcdermott-tagging.jiglu.com/overlay/42114434158e840d0115937dc439441f/Dow%20Jones">Dow Jones</a>'s
              then-president, Peter Kann. Mr. Kann had criticized a libel judgment
              won by Mr. Lee against the Far Eastern Economic Review, the Journal
              Asia's sister publication. The paper, its editor, publisher, local
              distributor and local printer were all named. They lost.<br> <br> We are not eager to return to that fractious era, when the Journal Asia had its circulation severely restricted in Singapore
              and the paper's reporters were unwelcome. Since 1991, when the
              newspaper and Mr. Lee reached a settlement, our relationship with Singapore had been more or less stable until the latest contempt charge.<br> <br> Meanwhile, in September, the Far Eastern Economic Review lost a
              defamation case brought by Mr. Lee and his son, current Prime Minister
              Lee Hsien Loong, <a href="http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/archive/2008/09/24/singapore-s-%E2%80%98martyr-chee-soon-juan.html">over an interview it published</a> with opposition leader Mr. Chee. The elder Mr. Lee has long used
              defamation suits to silence his critics in the press and among the
              political opposition.<br> <br> As for this week's contempt ruling, the first line of Justice Tay's decision is revealing as a standard for Singapore
              justice. "Words sometimes mean more than what they appear to say on the
              surface," he writes, going on to interpret the words as contemptuous
              because they had an "inherent tendency" to "scandalise the court." The
              fine he levied, S$25,000 ($16,500), is the largest ever meted out for
              such an offense. Justice Tay expressed the hope that it will deter
              "future transgressions."<br> <br> We'll pay the fine. We'll also continue to express our views about
              politics, the courts and other subjects that we think our readers
              should know about. And we'll let readers decide what to make of the
              judiciary in Singapore.</p>
