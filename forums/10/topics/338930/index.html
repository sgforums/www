              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/peopleI/shafiie.jpg" border="1" alt="" height="130" align="right"><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/peopleI/isrizal.jpg" border="1" alt="" height="130" align="right"><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/peopleI/john_tan.jpg" border="1" alt="" height="130" align="right"><em>Singapore Democrats</em><br> <br>SDP
                  Assistant Secretary-General, Mr John Tan, was sentenced to 15 days
                  imprisonment by High Court Judge Judith Prakash for wearing a T-shirt
                  emblazoned with a kangaroo in a judge's gown during the defamation
                  hearing between Lee Kuan Yew and the Singapore Democrats.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Fellow activists Mr Shafi'ie and Mr
                  Isrizal were each sentenced to 7 days imprisonment also for wearing the
                  T-shirt. Mr Tan's penalty was heavier because he had handed the T-shirt
                  to the other activists.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>All three men were also ordered to pay $5,000 as cost to the Attorney-General.</strong></span><br><br>During
                  the hearing on 24 November, the Attorney General had wanted a harsh
                  punishment for the three because, according to Deputy Solicitor-General
                  Jeffrey Chan, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"calling the judicial system a kangaroo court is the
                  worst insult one can hurl against it."</strong></span><br><br>Mr Tan had argued that
                  since the presiding judge had conceded that the judiciary is not beyond
                  criticism, the court should then accept the message conveyed by the
                  T-shirt as fair criticism. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The SDP leader explained that the purpose of
                  his action was to point out weaknesses in our judiciary system and had
                  hoped that improvement to the quality of justice would be made.<br></strong><strong><br>The arguments, however, did not sit well with Judge Judith Prakash, who found the three men guilty as charged.</strong></span><br><br>In
                  another incident, Mr Gopalan Nair called on SDP's leaders and other
                  human rights advocates after he was released from jail on 20 Nov 08,
                  following his two-month imprisonment for insulting High Court Judge
                  Belinda Ang. Mr Nair bade farewell and the SDP wished him well and a
                  safe journey home to the US. He left Singapore yesterday. <br><br><em>Read also Yawning Bread's</em> <a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/">Conversation stoppers</a>.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Three Singaporeans jailed for wearing Kangaroo T-shirts<br></strong><em>Bernama</em><br><br>The
                  Singapore High Court Thursday sentenced three Singaporeans to seven to
                  15 days' jail for wearing T-shirts bearing a picture of a kangaroo in
                  judge's robes in the vicinity of the New Supreme Court Building last
                  May.<br><br>Muhammad Shafi'ie Syahmi Sariman and Isrizal Mohamed Isa
                  were jailed for seven days each and Tan Liang Joo John, 15 days, by
                  Justice Judith Prakash.<br><br>She also ordered each of them to pay the Attorney-General's Chambers S$5,000 in costs and disbursements.<br><br>The case against the trio for contempt of court was heard on Monday.<br><br>The
                  Attorney-General had applied for contempt proceedings to be instituted
                  against the three after they appeared in the T-shirts in the court
                  which was hearing assessment of damages in respect of a defamation
                  action brought by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and Prime Minister Lee
                  Hsien Loong against the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) leaders last
                  May.<br><br>The AG's Chambers took offence as it implied that the court was a kangaroo court.<br><br>Tan
                  was also heard saying: "This is a kangaroo court" to Lee when the
                  Minister Mentor walked past him outside Court No. 4B at the New Supreme
                  Court Building.<br><br>On 27 July this year, an article entitled "Police question activists over kangaroo T-shirts" appeared on the SDP website.<br><br>The
                  article reproduced a photograph of the three men wearing the same
                  T-shirts and it was meant to give wider publicity to their allegation
                  that the court was a kangaroo court, the AG had said.<br><br>At the
                  Monday hearing, the Attorney-General was represented by Deputy
                  Solicitor-General Jeffrey Chan Wah Teck, principal senior state counsel
                  Jennifer Marie and state counsel Gillian Koh Tan and Lee Jwee Nguan.<br><br>Tan and Isrizal appeared in person while Muhammad Shafi'ie Syahmi was represented by Chia Ti Lik.<br><br>After
                  reviewing the evidence from both sides, Justice Prakash found that each
                  of them was in contempt of court in the manner alleged.<br><br>In the
                  case of Muhammad Shafi'ie Syahmi and Isrizal, Justice Prakash found
                  that they were in contempt for wearing the T-shirts in the vicinity of
                  the court and inside the courthouse.<br><br>In the case of Tan, the
                  judge found him to be in contempt for distributing the T-shirt in the
                  court building and wearing the offending T-shirt and for being involved
                  in the posting of the photograph on the SDP website.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>The three
                  men also refused to apologise to the court or to withdraw their
                  insinuation about the Singapore court when given the opportunity to do
                  so by Justice Prakash.</strong></span></p>

              <h1>Singapore Strikes Again</h1>
              <h2 class="subhead"><em>The city-state resumes its campaign against the Journal.</em></h2>
              <p>Let us begin with an apology to our readers in Asia. Unless they are
              online, they will not see this editorial. For legal reasons, we are
              refraining from publishing it in The Wall Street Journal Asia, which
              circulates in Singapore.</p>
              <div class="insetContent embedType-image imageFormat-DV">
              <div class="insetTree">
              <div class="insettipUnit"><img src="http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-CT136_oj_1co_DV_20081128212248.jpg" border="0" alt="[Review &amp; Outlook]" width="262" height="394"> <cite>AP</cite>
              <p class="targetCaption">Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Our
              subject is free speech and the rule of law in the Southeast Asian
              city-state -- something on which the international press and
              Singapore's government have often clashed.</p>
              <p>We can't say which side
              would prevail if the Singapore public could hear an open debate, but
              the fact is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>we know of no foreign publication that has ever won in
              a Singapore court of law.</strong></span> Virtually every Western publication <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>that
              circulates in the city-state has faced a lawsuit, or the threat of one.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Which brings us to the ruling against us this week in Singapore's
              High Court. Dow Jones Publishing (Asia) was found guilty of contempt of
              court for two editorials and a letter to the editor published in The
              Wall Street Journal Asia in June and July.</p>
              <p>The Attorney General, who
              personally argued the contempt case against us, characterized the
              articles as "an attack on the courts and judiciary of Singapore
              inasmuch as they impugn the integrity, the impartiality and the
              independence of the Court."</p>
              <p>In suing for contempt, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore chose to go after us for the most
              basic kind of journalism.</strong></span> The first editorial, "Democracy in
              Singapore," reported on a damages hearing in a defamation case brought
              (and won) by former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew against opposition
              politician Chee Soon Juan. The second editorial, "Judging Singapore's
              Judiciary," informed readers what an international legal organization
              had said about Singapore's courts.</p>
              <p>Regarding the first editorial, we'll note that court proceedings are
              privileged under Singapore law, which means they can be reported --
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>though Singapore's media rarely do the job.</strong></span> Mr. Chee wrote a letter in
              response to the first editorial, which we published and which is cited
              in the contempt charge. We also published two letters from Mr. Lee's
              spokeswoman.</p>
              <p>In the second editorial, we reported on the International Bar
              Association's critical study of the rule of law in Singapore. This is
              the same outfit that held its annual conference in Singapore last year,
              a meeting that Mr. Lee himself touted as a sign of confidence in
              Singapore's courts.</p>
              <p>The Law Society of Singapore is a member of the
              IBA. If reporting on what such a body says is contemptuous of the
              judiciary,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> then Singapore is saying that its courts are above any
              public scrutiny.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Again, we published a letter from the Singapore government
              responding to the editorial. This one was from the Law Ministry, which
              blasted the IBA report and us for repeating its "vague allegations."
              The IBA then weighed in, in a posting on its Web site, saying it wished
              "to correct some inaccurate comments" in Singapore's letter. It invites
              readers to read the report and "see for themselves" that its views are
              "based on comprehensive examples and evidence." The IBA homepage is <a href="http://www.ibanet.org/">www.ibanet.org</a>.</p>
              <p>In his ruling, Justice Tay Young Kwang refers to us as a "repeat
              offender." He's right in the narrow sense that this isn't the first
              time Singapore has pursued the Journal Asia for contempt. In 1985, the
              newspaper and its editors were sued over an editorial about legal
              actions against opposition politician J.B. Jeyaretnam. The editors
              apologized.</p>
              <p>In 1989, the paper was sued for contempt again, this time over a
              news story that quoted Dow Jones's then-president, Peter Kann. Mr. Kann
              had criticized a libel judgment won by Mr. Lee against the Far Eastern
              Economic Review, the Journal Asia's sister publication. The paper, its
              editor, publisher, local distributor and local printer were all named.
              They lost.</p>
              <p>We are not eager to return to that fractious era, when the Journal
              Asia had its circulation severely restricted in Singapore and the
              paper's reporters were unwelcome. Since 1991, when the newspaper and
              Mr. Lee reached a settlement, our relationship with Singapore had been
              more or less stable until the latest contempt charge.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, in September, the Far Eastern Economic Review lost a
              defamation case brought by Mr. Lee and his son, current Prime Minister
              Lee Hsien Loong, over an interview it published with opposition leader
              Mr. Chee.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> The elder Mr. Lee has long used defamation suits to silence
              his critics in the press and among the political opposition.</strong></span></p>
              <p>As for this week's contempt ruling, the first line of Justice Tay's
              decision is revealing as a standard for Singapore justice. "Words
              sometimes mean more than what they appear to say on the surface," he
              writes, going on to interpret the words as contemptuous because they
              had an "inherent tendency" to "scandalise the court." The fine he
              levied, S$25,000 ($16,500), is the largest ever meted out for such an
              offense. Justice Tay expressed the hope that it will deter "future
              transgressions."</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We'll pay the fine. We'll also continue to express our views about
              politics, the courts and other subjects that we think our readers
              should know about. And we'll let readers decide what to make of the
              judiciary in Singapore.</strong></span></p>

              T-shirts</span></strong></p>
              <p>Thursday, 27 November 2008</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/peopleI/shafiie.jpg" alt="" height="130"><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/peopleI/isrizal.jpg" alt="" height="130"><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/peopleI/john_tan.jpg" alt="" height="130"><em>Singapore Democrats</em><br> <br> SDP Assistant Secretary-General, Mr John Tan, was sentenced to 15
              days imprisonment by High Court Judge Judith Prakash for wearing a
              T-shirt emblazoned with a kangaroo in a judge's gown during the
              defamation hearing between Lee Kuan Yew and the Singapore
              Democrats.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Fellow activists Mr Shafi'ie and Mr
              Isrizal were each sentenced to 7 days imprisonment also for wearing
              the T-shirt. Mr Tan's penalty was heavier because he had handed the
              T-shirt to the other activists.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>All three men
              were also ordered to pay $5,000 as cost to the
              Attorney-General.</strong></span><br> <br> During the hearing on 24 November, the Attorney General had wanted
              a harsh punishment for the three because, according to Deputy
              Solicitor-General Jeffrey Chan, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"calling the judicial system
              a kangaroo court is the worst insult one can hurl against
              it."</strong></span><br> <br> Mr Tan had argued that since the presiding judge had conceded that
              the judiciary is not beyond criticism, the court should then accept
              the message conveyed by the T-shirt as fair criticism. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The SDP leader explained that
              the purpose of his action was to point out weaknesses in our
              judiciary system and had hoped that improvement to the quality of
              justice would be made.<br></strong><strong><br> The arguments, however, did not sit well with Judge Judith Prakash,
              who found the three men guilty as charged.</strong></span><br> <br> In another incident, Mr Gopalan Nair called on SDP's leaders and
              other human rights advocates after he was released from jail on 20
              Nov 08, following his two-month imprisonment for insulting High
              Court Judge Belinda Ang. Mr Nair bade farewell and the SDP wished
              him well and a safe journey home to the US. He left Singapore
              yesterday.<br> <br> <em>Read also Yawning Bread's</em> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yawningbread.org/">Conversation

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Three Singaporeans jailed
              for wearing Kangaroo T-shirts<br></strong><em>Bernama</em><br> <br> The Singapore High Court Thursday sentenced three Singaporeans to
              seven to 15 days' jail for wearing T-shirts bearing a picture of a
              kangaroo in judge's robes in the vicinity of the New Supreme Court
              Building last May.<br> <br> Muhammad Shafi'ie Syahmi Sariman and Isrizal Mohamed Isa were
              jailed for seven days each and Tan Liang Joo John, 15 days, by
              Justice Judith Prakash.<br> <br> She also ordered each of them to pay the Attorney-General's
              Chambers S$5,000 in costs and disbursements.<br> <br> The case against the trio for contempt of court was heard on
              Monday.<br> <br> The Attorney-General had applied for contempt proceedings to be
              instituted against the three after they appeared in the T-shirts in
              the court which was hearing assessment of damages in respect of a
              defamation action brought by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and Prime
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong against the Singapore Democratic Party
              (SDP) leaders last May.<br> <br> The AG's Chambers took offence as it implied that the court was a
              kangaroo court.<br> <br> Tan was also heard saying: "This is a kangaroo court" to Lee when
              the Minister Mentor walked past him outside Court No. 4B at the New
              Supreme Court Building.<br> <br> On 27 July this year, an article entitled "Police question
              activists over kangaroo T-shirts" appeared on the SDP
              website.<br> <br> The article reproduced a photograph of the three men wearing the
              same T-shirts and it was meant to give wider publicity to their
              allegation that the court was a kangaroo court, the AG had
              said.<br> <br> At the Monday hearing, the Attorney-General was represented by
              Deputy Solicitor-General Jeffrey Chan Wah Teck, principal senior
              state counsel Jennifer Marie and state counsel Gillian Koh Tan and
              Lee Jwee Nguan.<br> <br> Tan and Isrizal appeared in person while Muhammad Shafi'ie Syahmi
              was represented by Chia Ti Lik.<br> <br> After reviewing the evidence from both sides, Justice Prakash found
              that each of them was in contempt of court in the manner
              alleged.<br> <br> In the case of Muhammad Shafi'ie Syahmi and Isrizal, Justice
              Prakash found that they were in contempt for wearing the T-shirts
              in the vicinity of the court and inside the courthouse.<br> <br> In the case of Tan, the judge found him to be in contempt for
              distributing the T-shirt in the court building and wearing the
              offending T-shirt and for being involved in the posting of the
              photograph on the SDP website.<br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> The three men also refused to apologise to the court or to withdraw
              their insinuation about the Singapore court when given the
              opportunity to do so by Justice Prakash.</strong></span></p>

              <p>if jail term is inevitable then yes in that i agree but i still feel jail was unnecessary. since these are people who are so public spirited some other punishment could be given for first timers. like doing hours for charity work instead of jail.</p>
              <p>and if they do not repent after being let off and try the same thing again, let them have a taste of 6 mths jail to feel the contrast.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Fellow activists Mr Shafi'ie and Mr Isrizal were each sentenced to 7 days imprisonment also for wearing the T-shirt. Mr Tan's penalty was heavier because he had handed the T-shirt to the other activists.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>All three men were also ordered to pay $5,000 as cost to the Attorney-General.</strong></span><br><br>During the hearing on 24 November, the Attorney General had wanted a harsh punishment for the three because, according to Deputy Solicitor-General Jeffrey Chan, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"calling the judicial system a kangaroo court is the worst insult one can hurl against it."</strong></span><br><br>Mr Tan had argued that since the presiding judge had conceded that the judiciary is not beyond criticism, the court should then accept the message conveyed by the T-shirt as fair criticism. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The SDP leader explained that the purpose of his action was to point out weaknesses in our judiciary system and had hoped that improvement to the quality of justice would be made.<br></strong><strong><br>The arguments, however, did not sit well with Judge Judith Prakash, who found the three men guilty as charged.</strong></span><br><br>In another incident, Mr Gopalan Nair called on SDP's leaders and other human rights advocates after he was released from jail on 20 Nov 08, following his two-month imprisonment for insulting High Court Judge Belinda Ang. Mr Nair bade farewell and the SDP wished him well and a safe journey home to the US. He left Singapore yesterday.<br><br><em>Read also Yawning Bread's</em> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yawningbread.org/">Conversation stoppers</a>.</p>

              <p>And the reason why they did that is because the law in Singapore is unjust. It is unjust laws like preventing people from demonstrating and expressing their opinions on political issues that have pushed activists to engage in this kind of 'illegal' behaviour.</p>
              <p>In the first place, there is no such thing as laws or government. It only exists in the mind of people, I should say indoctrinated in the minds of the masses. Do you consent to be governed? Or do you not consent to being governed? But of course, if you want to achieve such freedom, you better pack some heat.</p>

              <p>Don't see anything wrong with wearing that t-shirt (provided that it's a democratic government and not a authoritarian one).</p>
              <p>There are caricatures of western leaders like thatcher, reagan, carter, but when someone wanted to do a caricature of LKY, he was strongly against it. The same can be said for countries like North Korea, where the leaders are held in high esteem (by knife point). Countries that are democratic are more tolerable of folks wearing t-shirts brought up by you.</p>
              <p>If you wear a t-shirt with a "fxxx you Bush" and "fxxx you LKY" in public, guess which one will bring about the attention of the police.</p>
