So if you are unpopular to one party, then you are not unpopular to the other party with the opposite point of view...now does that make sense?<br><br>If you are so worried about being cast in a bad light, that is your choice. I'm not worried about that, a big part of credibilty lies in the points substantiated by facts and how logical your argument is. You cannot rely on popularity among forumers to get your points across. There will always be different points of view in most topics, if you choose to 'play' the clique game of ''i like you, so i will defend your views no matter what'', then go ahead. The strength of one's words is the most important thing to me. If you are intimidated and you feel that others are intimidated by me, then next time you should have stronger arguments to support your point of view.</div>
