And bear in mind, i never said that all out censorship was a good thing, a little bit of censorship would be useful if executed fairly and properly, but in this context, i think it is used poorly, when clearly there are other ways to have his voice heard instead of posting in the website.<br><br><strong>maybe you can enlighten us and tell us how we can all go about countering the censorship on the 'many avenues of internet?"
