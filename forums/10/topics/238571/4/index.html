By doing so, you are only setting yourself up for a fall (which we all know will happen), so what's the point in doing the obvious? Roberteh must have been able to anticipate that he would be censored; for someone who claims to write 'THE TRUTH', surely he would be able to foresee the move by the website owner. My guess is he wants to set himself as a martyr for the discontent and the anti-PAP.<br><br>For someone who claims to know the truth, he should also know that his 'truth' would be unpopular among some people. What i'm writing is also not popular which goes to show I don't have any kind of agenda, unlike some of the other people in this forum.</div>
