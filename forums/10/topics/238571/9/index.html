            <div class='col-md body'>The PM has talked about promoting service culture. He has forgotten that when ministries make a mistake and not willing to admit such mistake, it is a poor service.<br><br>For example, HDB has been selling its low cost public housing at full market price less a bit of discount claiming that it is subsidising public housing.<br><br>When exposed as not giving any subsidy at all but merely a discount the HDB has been tongue-tied and unable to reply to such rebuttal or substantiate that discoun as a subsidy.<br><br>Up to now HDB simply kept mum and carries on to insist that it is subsidising its public housing.<br><br>Is HDB not a public housing authority set up to provide low cost housing to the citizens?<br><br>Is it providing a good service to the taxpayers by acquiring lands using people's monies for public housing and selling the housing at full market price less discount calling it a subsidy?<br><br>Can PM Lee understand that to provide good service on the part of the government, ministers must first be prepared to admit mistakes such as wrongful over-charging of HDB flats.<br><br>But there is no change to the service culture at all two years after calling for improvement of service culture. It would appear that our service culture being promoted is to use one's power to do as one likes like increasing ministers' salaries and life-long pensions while leaving the majority of citizens to suffer from problems caused by over-taxing and over-charging by the HDB, LTA, JTC etc etc.<br><br>To promote our service culture it is first necessary for ministers to change their attitude to admit mistakes and take action to explain their tax increases and accepting feedbacks and making changes to wrong policies.<br><br>It would appear that it would continue to use its power to legalistically get what it want for itself to accumulate taxes as surpluses rather than excelling its service to the people.<br><br>So far after two years of calling for improvement to our service culture we only see more such behavior with ministers dismissing or explaining away problems instead of solving them as better service to the people.<br><br>If our leaders continue with such behaviour will we ever improve our service and claim that it is the world's best as MM Lee is now telling the Canberra University in being conferred the honorary degree last week</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>According to MM Lee's latest view about the need to keep top talents to protect jobs and homes, (Today's article "A Question of Dollars and Sense, 5.4.2007) justifying his continuous autocratic self-rewards of ministers and top civil servants to the tune of paying them the world's highest salaries, it would obviously be wrong to convict Durai of any irregularities over his peanut S$600 K salaries and the equally obscene bonuses as what Durai and his NKF board of directors did was merely trying to follow MM Lee's own government self-reward scheme to avoid underpaying and losing talents which may cause collapse of jobs in the charity sector.<br><br>Has NKF proven that higher salaries above S$100,000.00 will lead to more accountable and open running of KKF?<br><br>The benchmarking is selectively targeted in such a way that it is skewed to equate any increments in private sector's salaries to CEO as reflecting ministers' abilities. Where is the connection or relationship between ministers' abilities and private sector's CEO performance?<br><br>It is the artful selective benchmarking which will always show that ministers's salaries will forever not be enough even though the rest of the general popultion's salaries (administrative to executive in the 80% band) are dropping duringn the implementation of such self-rewarding scheme from 1970s to 1990s<br><br>In other words, in reality, MM Lee has yet to prove that by keeping up of ministers's salaries with increases of CEOs' salaries in the private sector, it will lead to better management or more accountable and open running of the government.<br><br>Instead we have only seen abuses of power by NKF CEOs even though higher salaries were paid to NKF CEO. He has not proven that by paying the current NKF CEO less than S$600 K pa NKF will lose talents, lose jobs and collapse.<br><br>The long and run of Government, NGOs and GLCs is that such organizations are merely responsible to collect public taxes and spening them. The ministers could simply blame on the people for lack of skills or retraining or globalisation in the event of recessions of large-scale retrenchments going on as seen during the last three recessions. Even today, Singapore's ministers have not yet succeeded in restructuring the economy to value-adding technology-driven model talked about for ages although there is now a small improvements due to world recovery from 2004 that enable the ministers to take credit and assume success.<br><br>Have they made the lives of median 80% of population better with higher salaries over the past 20 years as compared with Koreans or Finnists or Swiss. If 80% of population is not doing so well as the ministers or the private sector CEOs can we say our ministers are talented and safeguarding the interests of the people. What is the use of giving them higher salaries just to support more NKF ways of doing things or give them more power such as to carry on with past wrong policies which do not work through total control of the press.<br><br>All the powers in the world are corrupted by giving of more monies to the powers and increasing of such powers.<br><br></div>

There are a lot of people out there who could have contributed to raising standards, upgrading accountability and transparency in governance but these people have no opportunity to join the government at even the middle management level.<br><br>By excluding practical talents from the whole system, today we still see the same rhetorics about the need for leadership, talents, globalization without any of our ministers or top civil servants being recruited from result-oriented individuals. I remember, many years ago our ministers who were capable were not the scholars but ordinary people without all the degrees like PHD doing a better job because of proven abilities who rose up through the rank and file.<br><br>Today the situation is still the same e.g. people who created jobs in the private sector are mostly the ordinary people with knowledge application abilities and passions.<br><br>These kinds of result-oriented ministers and top civil servants are who we need to change the concrete-cast scholar-type of administers and ministers.<br><br><blockquote><span style="color: red;">These are certainly worrisome events, but are we not already experiencing all these events since 1987, when property values, unemployment, capital flight, reduction in CPF amounts, all having been affected by the boom and bust of 1987, 1997, 2002, and 2005 ?<br><br>Were we not paying our Singapore Ministers MILLION DOLLAR SALARY that are already comparable to that paid to CEOs in the Private Sector since at least before the 1997 bust ?<br><br>Singaporeans are now subjected to an uncertain future as a result of this Ruling Political Party aka the Government and its symbiotic self in the NTUC  accepting the recommendations from the Singapore Employers' and Singapore Manufacturers' Associations - that Singapore Workers should be employed only on short term renewable contracts,  resulting in the Employers being given the flexibility to trim and increase workers according to economic  conditions.</span></blockquote>I fully agree with you that during the period when our ministers had their salaries raised and benchmarked to the top earners in the selected few in the private sector some time around 1980s, the economy has not really been upgraded to the value-adding technology-driven and knowledge-based economy seen in Korea.<br><br>So it has long been proven that world-best salaries contrived by a system of NKF  self-reward has not worked as planned or conceptualized by assumptions.<br><br>The ministers owe it to the people now to prove that by helping themselves to increasing their own salaries from public fund, they have indeed proven they were worth such salaries.<br><br>[quote]<span style="color: red;">Are Singaporean Workers better off with such an uncertain employment future ?<br><br>This can hardly happen at a worst time, when the Government had also  implemented a decision that the HDB will no longer provide any loans for the home purchases but will pass this social contract to the Commercial Banks to conduct these subsidised home purchase with loans on commercial terms.<br><br>Are Singaporeans better off today then 20 years ago in 1987 ?<br><br>In 1987, Singapore experienced a sudden economic crash, and was floundering for the next five years.<br><br>Today, in 2007, Singaporeans are still floundering from the 2002 economic bust up, with many not seeing the income levels that they lost with wage and CPF cuts. Many Singaporeans remain unemployed or under employed, especially those who are over 40s and into their late 50s.<br><br>With higher wages to attract talents into politics, is MM LKY certain that it will also not help the Alternative Parties to attract more candidates into politics, with the prize of a Well Paying Ministerial Post ?<br><br>It is simply sheer arrogance on MM LKY's part to think that only those chosen by his political party will remain incorruptible, while anyone else joining the other side are of questionable material.<br><br>Over the last forty years, there were already three major cases of corruption during his term as Prime Minister, two were Ministers, and one a senior Party Member entrusted to lead a labor union.<br><br>Those Ministers were already remunerated with wages that were already above the average of any Singaporean Executive at that time; and yet some Ministers could not overcome their greed but to succumb to the privileges of their high office, and open themselves to the larger lucrative opportunities available to them.<br><br>Will more money dull the taste for more of it, or will it simply create an insatiable demand for more - as is happening now ?<br><br>Is this no different from those corrupt government raiding the Nation's Reserves to pay themselves better than the citizens whom they lead ?<br><br>It will seem that Singapore being reputed to be a law abiding country, will legalize the atrocious scheme of raiding our reserves, so as to make the  Singapore Ministers the Highest Paid Ministers in the World.<br><br>MM LKY proudly boasted that his government today incur a salary bill of S$42 MILLION for a Gross Domestic Product that is in excess of S$240 BILLION - as if the Gross Domestic Product is the result of the hard work of management of the economy by his Government.<br><br>If at all, the S$240 BILLION GDP is the hard work of all Singaporean Workers - including those in the secondary supporting roles as housewives, hawkers, retailers, transport operators, etc.<br><br>What have the Politicians and the Government Ministers done to ensure that such results are achieveable ?<br><br>All that it ever does is merely to spout out skeletal schemes for the Civil Servants to flesh out, which the Ministers will subsequently sell the concept; leaving the Singaporean Workers to work and see to its successful outcome.<br><br>Some of the grand schemes that fell flat include the Swiss Standard of Living for Singaporeans declared by GCT to be achieved by the end of his Term as PM. Unfortunately, nothing much came out of it, while we are definitely saddled with a Swiss Cost of Living, and with the Swiss Standard of Living nowhere in sight.<br><br></span><br><br></div></blockquote>Despite all the higher salaries being paid to the ministers, we have not seen true upgrading of the economy as mentioned nor any progress in motivating the ordinary workers with the same opportunity given to the favored few connected to the leaders or identified by their own same feathers for controls and perpetuation of political power.<br><br>Apart from ad hoc incentivising of pro-foreign investment and employment policies, there has been a lamentable lack of real solution for Singapore to catch up with the better-run countries like Korea which thrives on knowledge application, technology start-ups and motivation of the masses.</div>
