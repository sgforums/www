"They" fear you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>"Liberty is meaningless where the right to utter oneÂ’s thoughts and opinions has ceased to exist. That, of all rights, is the dread of tyrants. It is the right which they first of all strike down. They know its power. Thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers, founded in injustice and wrong, are sure to tremble, if men are allowed to reasonÂ…<br>There can be on right of speech where any manÂ…[is] compelled to suppress his honest sentiments.<br>Equally clear is the right to hear.

It's not your website, so of course the discretion will be theirs as to whether they want to ban you or not. You've got your own blog right? So you can also ban commentors that you don't like from commenting on your blog, if you choose not to, then that's your choice. If 'ban' is too strong of a word for you, you can use the word 'moderate', it's the same thing. If you keep on whining about being banned from the site, you just end up looking like sour grapes. I for one am not interested in reading your blog and most of your writing in this forum anyway, i tried to, but some of your post i find too tedious and long to read. Especially since you made the comment about hitler, i'm even more not interested to read your long posts.</div>
