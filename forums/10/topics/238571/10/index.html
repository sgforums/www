I am already a member of FBU and are involve in those discussion whenever I am not traveling. FBU is definately one channel. There should be more channel where productive conversation like this can be facilitated.<br><br>Good conversation needs to be facilitated so that effort can be focus to drive specific discussion that will result to practical actions to resolve people's problem.<br><br>Many of the feedbacks I see in this forum are describing the symptoms, but we need more in depth facilitated conversation to pin point the problems so that solutions can be raised for those in office to consider. Then we will have everyone working towards the good of this country.</blockquote>If you want to make a difference you should get MM Lee to support your "consensus" building approach which has already been tried by Goh Chok Tong but failed to be carried out after his "OB" marker warning speeches when he was the PM.<br><br>MM Lee did not appear to be concilliatory from his speeches. He would always insist he is right in regard to giving more first prize winning lottery tickets to his ministers. He has undone the consensus building by GCT. So far he has shown himself to be more superior when many of his policies no longer work like top-down autocracy or leadership by a few or group of elites. He ought to realize his shortcomings as a result of lack of solutions by his ministers throughout the recessions.<br><br>That may be why now the post-65 MPs one by one including V Bala became tame and not speaking up on real issues or problems.<br><br>To begin with if your proposal is to work closely with forumers instead of countering or debunking them like PM and MM Lee said they would do, let us lay down certain fundamentals for all to agree.<br><br>List down whether there would be high-level policy change on basic and essential problems affecting the people of which ministers' trying to equate their pays to the lottery winners in the private sector is only one/<br><br>The perpetual taxing and cost-recovering and profiteering by government to build its surpluses to the exclusion of people's struggles for a living and retirement is another.<br><br>If you could not even convince the higher up to build consensus on the round but every government policy which has gone wrong is still so deeply and stubbornly entrenched then there is hardly any case for you to build consensus.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Almost every policy was made in the same manner - identify a fear or problem, put up a look-good objective and after that not allowing any citizens to point out or criticise shortcoming with many more problems being caused by tweaking and manipulating all the hidden detailing to suit their own narrow agenda.<br><br>That was how "Welfarism" was identified as a problem and government services were corporatized into GLCs with the whole government run on cost centres to make monies and hoard taxes into surpluses which leaders then claim as created by them from which to pay themselves the highest pays and lifelong pensions. This system has resulted in rising costs of living to the ordinary citizens and none of the MPs and ministers held up as our talents can even understand the suffering that were caused'<br><br>So was the same with meritocracy. It is fine for government to run a system of recruitments of talents based on meritocracy. In practice, the concept meritocracy can be exploited as a political tool to control people and create elitisms to serve the interest of a few leaders at the top.<br><br>So was the same with goodness of promoting foreign investments. The result is today it has been deteriorated into using foreigners to replace local more loyal citizens and none of our post-65 MPs could see such manipulations to give more power to a few people at the top including giving themselves more benefits like the winning first prize big sweep tickets.</div>
