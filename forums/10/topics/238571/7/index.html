You made a very quick judgement about being banned and you came straight to the forum and made a big hoo haa out of it, then your league of discontent joined you,  you are just looking for any excuse to bash the gov.<br><br><span style="color: red;">My guess is that you want to get banned so that you have a valid excuse to continue your ranting. Why not do the reasonable thing and wait and see whether you are really banned or not. Instead you go on to create more suspicion that you are being banned. C'mon, you really think that people can't see what you are doing? </span><br>That is not what i call objective thinking, that is outright bias and i have no respect for people like that no matter what their views are. Of course you can judge the gov, but in this issue, you have no basis to judge. You are unapologetic in your mistake...instead you want to continue your ranting, no use whining about something that didn't actually happen. Only your league of discontent will listen to you.<br><br>Realist (me) and idealist (you) will not share the same views most of the time.<br>Better you move to US or parts of europe if you want more transparency in the gov.Transparency is subjective, to some people it might mean being able to walk in and out of the white house as a tourist. But there's no guarantee that the govs there will be more 'accountable' than the sing gov, but you can give it a try.</div>

You can set up your own website and deploy some tactics so that you can get those who are anti-pap to go to your website. If the gov try to shut down your website, then you can say that your paranoia is really valid. Now what you have is only suspicion, no proof. Has anyone tried to close down your blog before?<br><br><strong>It is worse if it has to do so under surreptitious pseudonyms which are rather unbecoming of elected representatives of the people. </strong><br>This shows how paranoid you really are. Just 'cos you use your real name, u think that automatically gives you credibility on what you write. I see that move as a tactic to score points on the credibility scale. It doesn't increase your credibility whatsoever, (maybe only to the gullible ones it does). At the end of the day, you just want to be recognized in this forum and 'prove' how brave you are by using your real  name and you would have an excuse to accuse those  people who use pseudonyms as being sneaky or coward or cyberagent or pro pap...the list goes on.  So by any chance that you should take a 'fall' (cos your real name is exposed), then you can assume the position of a martyr and you can rally more support for your cause.<br><br></div>
