U can call me a dog and cat but then since u r so good, log in show me the picture u have succeed.<br><br>U see, nobody is able to log in, so they banned everybody ? Roberteh, u can go to an internet bar, and register a new name, tat is if u r even able to register. Otherwise the more u deny, the more u embarrassed yourself and how shameless u r trying to resort to lies to confuse the people. If u just admit u make an error from the start, then u will inflict lesser political damage to yourself. The more u want to argue, the more tis thread bump up and the more people get to know about your mistake and denial. I put the link so people can try it more conveniently.

            <div class='col-md body'>Do we still want to compare our public sector's salaries with that of the private sector after so many public feedbacks to which ministers could not and have not been able to reply.<br><br>Public sector employees are wage earners who are employed to collect revenues or safeguard laws and orders or provide services using public funds. They are iron ricebowlers who are not in the same categories as those CEOs or bosses in the private sector.<br><br>Can our ministers be compared with people in the private sector like Sim Wong Hoo, Banking Chiefs like Mr. Wee Chaw Yao, property tycoons like Mr. Ng Teng Fong, or Hoteliers like Ong Beng Seng or any of their proven CEOs who have succeeded in building up business investments or enterprises which provide jobs to our citizens.<br><br>These private sector CEOs are usually the bosses themselves who could pay themselves any amount of salaries from their own business investments as otherwise the business profits will be paid towards the taxes. Of course they will justify by any means in order to avoid paying too much taxes.<br><br>Very few private enterprises pay their CEOs multi-million salaries with the exception of people like Ioccoca or Jack Welch who have proven their track record in particular industries over some years.<br><br>In a business downturn, these working bosses who call themselves CEOs may be making losses or going into bankruptcy or getting nothing for their salaries. Iaccoca has foregone his own million-dollar salaries in years of downturn.<br><br>Without drawing a line between public sector wage-earners and business working bosses and their proven CEOs there is no apple-to-apple comparison of any kind and there is no justification for benchmarking our ministers' or civil servants' salaries or worth against the private sector business bosses or their proven CEOs of the Iaccoca or Jack Welch categories.<br><br>It has been a wrongful or artful comparison. Citizens have no power to tell MM Lee that he was wrong in making such comparison so the abuse of power has gone on unchecked for years. Such a wrong remain a wrong and any such wrongful or artful comparison eventually will have to stop.<br><br>Let the private sector's salaries remain private sector salaries.<br><br>If the so-called best talents wish to join the private sector for greater monetary rewards, let them join the private sector instead of using artful method to increase their salaries non-stop.<br><br>There will be no end to any such comparison. Now the men in the street see only self-rewards by the ministers and civil servants and there is a great deal of discontent. That is why they reacted very emotionally to Durai's self-rewards especially when our ministers are seen as openly supporting such wrongful self-help by the public sector to get as much salaries and bonuses for themselves as possible.<br><br>Yes there is a good argument that we need to pay our public sector well so as not to lose our talents in the public sector. However to make comparison of their worth against the private sector in such benchmarking is abuse as there is no objective basis for comparing with only the top CEOs or bosses at all.<br><br>If we continue to make such comparison there will be more abuse of power and more Durai-type of people lurking around to give themselves high rewards irrespective of actual market-driven conditions in practice.<br><br>We do have many people who are highly educated and capable but because our politics go by connection only those who are connected are given the opportunity to be chosen for top jobs.<br><br>Many proven and successful executives in the private sector are not paid that high and even a chance they could outperform the existing civil servants at half or lesser of their salaries.<br><br>Many principals and teachers in the private sector will willingly accept half the salaries of existing principals and teachers and do a better job.<br><br>Furthermore it has been a well-established fact that our so-called talents in the public sector have not been able to turn around the economy during the last three deep recessions and they have failed to catch up with the Korea or Finland in producing technology start-ups to avoid loss of economic competitiveness.<br><br>So how can they be worth the million-dollar salaries and be comparable to people of the status of Stanley Shih or Jack Welch.<br><br>So it is not correct to benchmark public sector salaries to the private sector as there will be no end to such comparison as parameters for comparison are not well established objective or accountable.<br><br>Entrepreneurs are entrepreeneurs and let them enjoy the highest rewards in the private sector. If some of them prove to be well paid and paid much higher than our PM so be it.<br><br>If our PM or ministers prove to be capable of turning around the moribund foreign-investment-incentivised model to value-adding technology driven model which create value-adding jobs to re-employ our many retrenched executives let the parliament approve special performance-based rewards to these leaders instead based on well-established performance-based assessments.<br><br>Let us not become a greedy society where everyone in power will use their power like durai to reward themselves by artful and questionable means equivalent to abuse of power or conflict of interest.<br><br>Let us stop all the wrongful and immoral benchmarking of public sector salaries. Pay them well by comparing with wage-earners of the right bracket shouldering bill/revenue collection or provision of services from existing public funds instead of comparing with business bosses profit-tied self-rewards.<br><br>In formulating any government policies our ministers should not get carried away by wrongful comparison of this kind (without accounting for ministers' lifelong annuities at 2/3 of their last drawn salaries).<br><br>It is illegal to put up motion to increase one's own salaries or bonuses or making biased comparison for self-rewards with such heavy conflicts of interest.</div>

There are still four more years.'<br>--------------------------<br><br><span style="color: blue;">What's the point of asking questions when we all know the standard reply????</span></blockquote><blockquote>Ok basically opposition peoples are just opposition lah, they only want disturb gov, never really care citizens life! Only pap mp really want help citizens improve life, that why they ask community questions. I say already slyvia lim what she know? Go back school study somemore lah!</blockquote>Actually it is only a hype that we have the great talents among second-generation ministers or post-65 MPs who could upgrade or restructure the economy.<br><br>What has Minister Balakrishnan accomplished in his Remaking of Singapore Committee with so many recommendations publicized in the media for a few years to bring about a more vibrant and participative society ? He has been given so many opportunites to turn around our moribund economic model which depended too much on shallow foreign investments rather than capitalizing on our internal strengths and resources.<br><br>Has he made a difference or has he really succeeded in changing past policies or made the people more vibrant or restructure our own domestic sector of the economy?<br><br>The basic system of government is one of taxing and recovering all possible costs from the people resulting in high costs of living and our progressive loss of economic competitiveness to many countries like Korea and Finland or even Hong Kong or Taiwan.<br><br>Ministers who were inducted from those with academically qualified meritocrats all these years since the 1997s were seen to be playing with ideas and concepts all the time with a lot of promises made to remake the economy. Have we really reached the first world when the fact is the majority of the citizens are dropping to the 3rd world.<br><br>These academic ministers were just lucky as despite being given all the opportunities one term after another to prove their abilities to upgrade and restructure the economy, they are still around to try to experiment with their ideas and concepts.<br><br>They seem only to be able to continue to tax and recover all possible costs from the citizens and continue to run down our economic competitiveness.<br><br>So who should be thankful or grateful to who - people to the ministers or ministers to the people for giving them all the opportunities even though they continue to give excuses and play with words to avoid shouldering responsibilities to reach our desired objectives as a people.<br><br>To keep saying that the government is the world best in the face of the dropping standard of living of the majority is to continue to live in their own world or hide in their own ivory towers and postpone our problems.<br><br>There is an obvious lack of implementation abilities among our newer ministers who are still being given unending opportunities to prove their worth but sadly they continue to fail to do so.</div>
