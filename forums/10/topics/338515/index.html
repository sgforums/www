              <p>hi all i'm quite new here.. but after looking at some very interesting threads started by many of u here.. i kinda wanna give a try too lol..</p>
              <p>this topic tat i start has been around for many ages... many ppl in most countries wanna close the gap between the rich and the poor.. but is it possible?is the situation happening in Singapore?</p>
              <p>how poor is poor actually? no $$ buy toto/4d/sportsbetting? no meals to eat? no place to live? no car to drive? is squeezing with many ppl in the bus or train = poor? many singaporeans complainted poor but when coe $2 the car market soar..</p>
              <p>imagine there is a country with a very close income gaps between rich and poor..... so meaning lesser 'poor' ppl and lesser 'rich' ppl.. but i somehow couldn't explain the feeling tat i had... &gt;&gt; if there is no poor ppl... who willing to do those 'Hardcore' jobs? if no rich ppl who's gonna build up an economy? if all rich citizens = first world country then all poor ppl = third world country?</p>
              <p>to say it bluntly.. the rich need the poor and the poor need the rich.. so means when there r rich ppl there will definitely have poor ppl...</p>
              <p>how abt this scenario&gt;&gt; philipines and indonesia and our nearby southeast asia countries become developed countries... u think their citizens wan come work here in sg as maids, cleaners, pro, workers???? so then wad will happen??</p>
              <p>how abt blagadesh become a nation something like singapore? then who's gonna build our buildings here in sg? can we the singaporeans with our golden hands do the work that they come here to help us do?</p>
              <p>give some constructive comments pls <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>"<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; color: #111111; font-size: medium;">From the moment when the machine 
                                  first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people 
                                  that the need for human drudgery, and therefore to a great extent 
                                  for human inequality, had disappeared. <em><strong>If the machine were used 
                                  deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy, 
                                  and disease could be eliminated within a few generations</strong></em>.</span>... <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; color: #111111; font-size: medium;">But it was also clear that <strong>an all-round increase in wealth threatened 
                                  the destruction -- indeed, in some sense was the destruction -- 
                                  of a hierarchical</strong></span><strong> </strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; color: #111111; font-size: medium;"><strong>society</strong>. In a world in which everyone worked 
                                  short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a house with a bathroom 
                                  and a refrigerator, and possessed a motor-car or even an aeroplane, 
                                  the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality 
                                  would already have disappeared. If it once became general, wealth 
                                  would confer no distinction....</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; color: #111111; font-size: medium;">For if leisure and 
                                  security were enjoyed by all alike, <strong>the great mass of human beings 
                                  who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and 
                                  would learn to think for themselves;</strong> and when once they had done 
                                  this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority 
                                  had no function, and they would sweep it away. <strong>In the long run, 
                                  a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty 
                                  and ignorance</strong>... </span><em><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; color: #111111; font-size: medium;">Therefore, from the point 
                                  of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power, 
                                  human equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after, but 
                                  a danger to be averted." -</span></strong></em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; color: #111111; font-size: medium;">George Orwell, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Nineteen Eight-Four</em></span></span></p>
              <p>As a work of fiction, it is an excellent critique of society then, even today's society.</p>
              <p>That is why globalisation has wrecked the economies of Third World countries and has worsened the income inequality between the First World and the Third. More pertinently, if the establishment wanted relieve human suffering (Yeah, right...and threaten their position), it could easily be done. There is a perpetual amount of energy in geothermal sources, information suppressed. The world has a surplus of food, again suppressed. And if we use our huge technological capability, manuel labour would be done by machines, eradicating the need for human labour. But then, that would mean the end of the monetary system, the end of political power, even though Humanity would have reached its zenith.</p>

              <p>anyway i stating we can't stop globalisation in sg.. for our free trade ports and our massive imports and our advanced technology.. its hard to even stop all of these and go back our kampung days.. globalisation in sg already started even be4 our ah kong ah ma come here work liao.. during days of british coloney..</p>

              <p>Communism still maintained the monetary system and political hierarchy just like <em>our great Democracy</em>. This is totally different while using the earth's natural resources to further humane goals instead of corporate agendas of profit and power consolidation. For instance, if a community needs to build a geothermal energy reactor to work towards energy independence, instead of asking "How much does it cost?", we ask "Will it benefit the community?" and then "Do we have the necessary resources?". Rather than falling into divisive political labels that enable the establishment to divide and rule, why work to promote the social good (a humane-oriented society and worldview), instead of adopting the bullshitty and fraudulent left-right paradigm and consolidating the statist system.</p>

              <p>Thats based on mentality in a monetary system where competition and self-preservation totally preoccupies people. When scarcity has been eradicated, peoples' mentality will change. In a society of abundance, abberant behaviour will mostly disappear because the drive for money that causes complex social neurosis is gone. Of course, in such a system, political power disappears and our elites, the world elites, wouldnt want that. Thats why the education system and society in general has been conditioned to think within this box, and to help the elite maintain their power. In other words, social engineering, which Edward Bernays, the person who coined "public opinion" wrote:</p>
              <p>"The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organised habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democractic society"</p>
              <p>On the technical issue of maintainance, I dont know. Neither do you, or anyone else for that matter. But given that supercomputers have breached the petaflop level and quantum computing is becoming a reality, it wouldnt be a problem. The real challenge that must be overcomed is the elites' resistance eroding their power and the psychological barrier that self-proclaimed defenders of the status quo has (for instance, your own mentality).</p>

              <p>The monetary system, initially, was the natural result of scarcity. When goods are scarce, people put value on them. But in today's technological society, scarcity could be eliminated, removing the need for money. But by now, money is used as a tool of economic warfare by the elites on those being ruled. The fractional reserve banking system creates money through debt. Hence, bankruptcy and poverty is built-in and once you realise that, the fraudulent nature of the system becomes evident. Money today, is merely the new kind of slavery that society imposes on everyone to maintain the status quo. In other words, it is a tool to monopolise power worldwide.</p>
