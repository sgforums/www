            <div class='col-md body'>The real issue here behind Catherine Lim's open letter to PM is not that people like her are anti-government.<br><br>We have a government which keeps boasting of its talents and leadership and yet it has been unable to solve the most fundamental and crucial problems facing our country like Catherine has written - government has stubbornly believed that it and only it alone has the talents and abilities without being willing to listen to alternative views and solutions.<br><br>If the government is like the Myanmar military junta probably people will not criticise them as much because such a government does not go around the world boasting to everybody how good it is.<br><br>But once a government boasts about its having so much leadership and world-class ministers they must be prepared to be criticized heavily for any policy failures or mistakes like the Shin Corp blunder, NKF or any other incompetency like failing to stop the blatant fire risks in Hougang or create jobs to overcome the frequent deep recessions.<br><br>Its people will be entitled to debunk such a government for any lies and hypocrisy and nail down where the true cause of all the problems.<br><br>This is a state of denial which is the duty of every citizen to correct and if they have to go to the street to do so they are justified to do so.<br><br>People only want to have a more caring government which is considerate to the people and stop all the unnecessary and unjustified over-taxing taxing and profiteering when government every year has been making surpluses.<br><br>Has it listened despite many feedbacks for the past umpteen years ? Has the government cared to present proper budgets to show not only regular incomes and expenditures but to show all the hidden windfall profits it has been quietly making in presenting the annual budgets or asking to increase GST or hospital fees and all kinds of charges.<br><br>Like the NKF's Durai trying to deny problems by misrepresenting its patient subsidy the government sadly is doing worse in claiming its needs to build more surpluses without showing all the profits and surpluses it has been accumulating.<br><br>People have shown their displeasure with Durai paying higher and higher salaries to himself and his staff with this kind of wrong doings and wrong policies supported by government ministers and patrons and their spouses.<br><br>Some NKF staff has even got super increments beyond all imagination within a space of two to three years and even extra months of bonuses when she has already resigned.<br><br>When this kind of mentality to tax and accumulating taxes as surplues the government is not a caring government. That is why people have been experiencing much problems.<br><br>Now when we are experiencing world recovery and Singapore has won a respite of some kind it is real time for government to listen to the people who has the courage and intellect to understand the real problems and speak up.<br><br>We should not condemn critics like Catherine Lim and call them anti-government or negative as some government cyber-agents like Friedquest is doing.<br><br>Instead Catherine Lim and many critics like her are good people who are doing all a favor. They are asking government to stop its past autocratic decision makings and stop all the excessive over-taxing, creaming of surpluses which should have been used wisely to create jobs or lower costs of medical treatments etc for citizens.<br><br>Has the government listened? It seems it is still denying problems and claiming credits for such taxing and cost recovering at the expense of growth of the economy and trying to tell the world they have done such a wonderful job which on closer examination is self-praise and hypocrisy.<br><br>So to all the ministers, just do your jobs professionally and do not be hypocrites. Try to consider all the persistent problems like the rising costs of living and our losses in competitiveness due to autocratic uncaring and unmotivational governance of the past era.<br><br>It is time for our ministers to grow up from only caring for their own career path due to fear of autocracy and delay in solving real problems.<br><br>Government has over-taxed the people and people are getting poorer with no or little saving to fend for their retirements as already been found out and admitted due to wrong policies of the past.<br><br>So make changes and stop making unnecessary profits and make use of existing surpluses for creating jobs or lower costs of living or increasing our economic competitiveness.<br><br>It does not make sense to pay ministers millions just to make them more afraid to speak up to MM or PM to correct the real cause of all the problems.<br><br>Like Metaphorical said, it is as simple as that - ministers are too afraid to tackle real problems caused by autocracy and are only caring for their own career and goodwill of MM and PM who therefore withdraw to their own comfort zone and refuse to change to be more caring for the people.<br><br>Catherine Lim is right. People are being taken for granted because of autocracy which has already reared its ugly head in many hidden problems like exposed in NKF.<br><br>We the people hope PM could see the validity of Catherine Lim's open letter and not regard her writing as defiance or challenge. For all we know by listening to her there is nothing to do but everything to gain depending who is looking at the problems facing the nation.</div>
