Not just with the government, but going by the gist of this thread too... We're trying to be more open and inclusive to diverse views but intellectual arrogance or pure and simple "NATO" gets in the way...  </span></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">''NATO'' ?<br><br>Each of us have our own contribution in society, by labelling others as ''NATO'' - have you questioned your own contribution to eradicating the grieviances that you may have in common with others ?<br><br>Does it not reflect a certain degree of <span style="font-style: italic;">''intellectual arrogance''</span> towards others whom you think are ''NATO'' ?<br><br>The problem with many Singaporeans today is that they have allowed LKY's effort to succeed at <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>''Filling the Stomach, and Dull the Brain''</strong></span>.<br><br>It is a pity that highly educated Singaporeans will willingly gloss over the many <span style="font-style: italic;">'contradictions'</span> of LKY and his MIW clones in Government, and prefer to tow the line - exchanging their political rights for material gains.<br><br>You are correct that Catherine Lim's piece is aimed at encouraging this MIW Government to be more open and inclusive to diverse views.<br><br>Have you realised that implicit in her call, she is calling for more liberal political space to be returned to Singaporeans ? </span><br><blockquote><strong><span style="color: darkblue;"><br>I don't believe in complaining just for the sake of complaining (which many singaporeans seems to be very good at...)<br><br>I also don't believe in arguing for its own sake.<br><br>The question of freedom of speech, or a more open, inclusive Singapore, is largely sterile. </span></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">With the present difficult level of quality in the ordinary lives of Singaporeans today, do you seriously believe that Singaporeans complain simply for the sake of complaining ?<br><br>With the Government Ministers and Civil Servants honing their skills in giving oblique replies that are ''non-replies'' - literally stone-walling - surely you can understand Singaporeans for having so much to complain about ?<br></span><br><blockquote><strong><span style="color: darkblue;"><br>Even in the best of places, pple cannot eat democracy. If freedom of speech and political openness can achieve the greater good of better jobs, better economic opportunities and ensure the nations survival as a cohesive and viable entity, then its simply horses for courses.<br><br>There are valid arguments that suggests this to be so... the Knowledge Based economy is not about drones assembling cheap products in a production line. Its about intellectual capital being able to work in an attractive place that provides the environment that best taps their know-how and fosters innovation.<br><br>It is still about bread and butter issues. </span></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">This piece is the gem from your deliberate analytical effort.<br><br>Where do you think we should move from this point of your understanding ?<br><br>Can Singapore's present political environment allow any intellectual space for the intellectually challenged to progress in step with other advanced countries ?<br><br>Is POLITICS merely about political parties competing with other political parties to gain political points to form the next government ?<br><br>Or does POLITICS also involve the total complex relations between people living together, carefully managing their affairs for the purpose of economic, social and cultural advancement as a community and-or nation ?<br><br>Under such circumstance, is POLITICS not the responsibility of all Citizens and not the exclusive realm of Professional Politicians - so as to allow the community / nation to progress? </span><br><blockquote><strong><span style="color: darkblue;"><br>Singapore is not yet such a place because of its relative restrictiveness.<br><br>In proceeding with this civil discussion, may we have counter-arguments or alternative views instead of just rhetorical questions?<br><br></span> </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Unfortunately, questions need to be asked in order that one do not make the wrong assumption and end up with a useless endless arguments that should have been a civil discussion or debate of ideas.<br><br>How can Singapore not yet be such a place when even LKY has already claimed that Singapore has already attained First World status in his memoirs written more then five years ago ?<br><br>What are you referring to with your term <span style="font-style: italic;">''relative restrictiveness''</span> ?<br><br>Are you referring to the current state of <span style="font-style: italic;">''political restrictiveness''</span> that exist for the last four decades ?<br><br>Or is Singapore not ready for full democracy due to the <span style="font-style: italic;">''relative restrictiveness''</span> of Singapore's physical size that makes Singapore vulnerable if there is no political cohesion ?<br><br></span><br><br></div>
