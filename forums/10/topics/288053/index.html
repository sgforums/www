            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all,<br><br>For your information please.<br><br>AN OPEN LETTER TO THE PRIME MINISTER<br><br>Dear Mr Prime Minister,<br><br>This open letter is a plea which, as a concerned  Singaporean, I  am making with some confidence, since at no time has your government  been more sincere and earnest in  inviting feedback to make our society an even better place to live in.<br><br>My plea concerns the long-standing issue of political openness. It had, in the more than 40 years of  PAP rule, been a source of much unease in the relationship between the government and the people. Now and then, the unease would erupt in the open, with the people agitating (usually through permitted channels  such as letters to the press, public forums, dialogues with members of parliament, etc)for a long overdue political opening up,  and the government firmly, often sternly, reminding them of more important national concerns, such as bread-and-butter matters that affect the lives of everyone.<br><br>But despite the lack of agreement, there was reason to hope.  For there were signs that the PAP leaders saw a political opening up as a necessary goal , even if a very disagreeable one, to be achieved sometime in the future, even if a very distant one. There was no escaping the fact that Singapore ,being a permanent member of the free world of practising democracies, is open to international scrutiny. I recollect your PAP colleagues talking about the need to proceed cautiously in the controversial matter of political reform, the need to avoid the perils of Â‘revolutionÂ’, by adopting the peaceful process of Â‘evolutionÂ’, variously  called   Â‘incrementalismÂ’ and Â‘gradualismÂ’, to emphasize the small, even imperceptible, but definitely forward-moving steps. The message seemed to be: Â‘Be patient. In good time. When we are ready.Â’<br><br>Now I note with  alarm that this is not going to happen.  For the new model of PAP governance which, under your premiership, is shaping up to provide the definitive, final framework for  government  policy in the next 40 or more years, has no place or role for political freedom. There are two principal features of the model that provide the evidence to support this worrisome thought.<br><br>Firstly, the current nationwide campaign of sweeping change to transform Singapore   into a world-class society able to hold its own among the best in an increasingly competitive world,   pointedly excludes political reform. Such a conspicuous and complete exclusion has never been seen before. It  bears the marks of a major policy decision, and clearly has a message to send out.  Hence while business, technology,  education, civic society, the arts and entertainment have undergone spectacular changes that  are transforming both the physical landscape and the national psyche, the political domain has shrunk into a tiny backwater, stuck in the Dark Ages of  neglect while a brilliant Renaissance is sweeping on. The few political clubs that had existed in the past have closed down, and no new ones are expected to appear. Even the very term  Â‘political reformÂ’ has vanished from the national vocabulary, like something too irrelevant, embarrassing or tiresome to mention.<br><br>Recently I asked some friends if they thought that the ongoing process of liberalisation might somehow reach even the isolated political precinct , and they would at last see what they had witnessed only in other countries or on TV - public assemblies, placard-waving  street demonstrations, political satire in the media,etc. Â‘Not in our lifetime,Â’ they said.<br><br>The message sent out by the government is clear:  We donÂ’t need all these. Without the noise and unruliness of political activism getting in the way, we get our job done quickly, smoothly, effectively. Look at the mayhem itÂ’s creating elsewhere.<br><br>The second feature of the new model of governance is the systematic use of fear to silence existing dissident voices and discourage potential ones. While there has always been a climate of fear under PAP rule, the new model seems to have developed it into a distinct strategy of control, making special use of an instrument that has come to be known as the Â‘out-of-bounds markersÂ’. These are rules  which stipulate  what Singaporeans can and cannot say should they choose to criticise the government. The effectiveness of the markers is derived from  their being deliberately left  undefined and unexplained, for two obvious reasons. Firstly, it allows the government to have its own interpretation of each case as it arises, to suit its purpose. Secondly, since no one knows when or whether the markers are being overstepped, everyone plays safe by practising self-censorship which can be a more effective curb than direct censorship.<br><br>In general, the markers may be said to allow criticism only on the governmentÂ’s terms, that is, only on subjects it approves, and only in a manner that does not undermine respect for its authority. In theory, then, any criticism  can be construed to be a violation of the markers. In practice, the government not only tolerates, but encourages criticism regarding practical matters of day-to-day living, such as maid levies, safer roads, saving water, the CPF. But it responds severely to any criticism of government style or competence, creating enough fear for the critic to make  quick and  often permanent retreat.<br><br>Hence while the fear experienced by Singaporeans is by no means the kind experienced in a police state, it is still a palpable one, creating wariness and affecting behaviour, even in routine, everyday activities.  There is much anecdotal evidence to suggest that it could become pure paranoia, as seen in the many coffeeshop stories about Singaporeans not wanting to talk too freely with taxi drivers who may be government spies, not daring to be seen with ex-political detainees or members of the opposition parties, in case of secret surveillance , not voting for the opposition in the  general election for fear of being found out  and losing their homes, jobs, promotions,etc. The most feared punishment  is the defamation lawsuit which  can result in permanent financial ruin.<br><br>And now, having painted this rather direful picture, Mr Prime Minister, I must go on to make an observation with something of admiration mixed with puzzlement. Your strategy of  fear, questionable though it is,  is being used to serve a purpose that is totally laudable. Not even your severest critic can doubt that your purpose is no more than the well-being and prosperity of Singapore . Indeed, the true starting point for an understanding of the Â‘whyÂ’ behind all your policies would the assumption of this commitment, and the starting point for an understanding of  the Â‘howÂ’ for their implementation would be that of a practical, realistic problem-solving approach. These two assumptions of commitment and pragmatism clearly sum up the entire PAP strategic framework.<br><br>In this particular instance of your use of fear, your pragmatic rationale must have gone something like this: It is our job as the government to give the people a good life; we will not be able to do so if  we are constantly subjected to the disruptions that come with political activism; therefore we must get rid of the hindrance quickly by using the most effective means of all  - instilling fear.<br><br>Hence the fear becomes, in a  rather roundabout and paradoxical way , the itÂ’s-only-for-your-own-good strategy of a caring parent. It is this paterfamilias role that softens the PAP image into that of a  protective and  thoughtful leadership, in  stark and edifying contrast to the many corrupt regimes  around, where fear is used for pure self aggrandizement.<br><br>Moreover, as if to soften the image further by compensating for the use of an instrument that has brought anxiety to many and misery to some, you have, Mr Prime Minister, in keeping with what has been observed to be a generally kind and compassionate disposition, made tremendous efforts to reach out to all those in the society who are by no means enjoying the good life Â– the poor, the old and infirm, the unemployed, the handicapped, the mentally ill. You have certainly fulfilled your promise,  made at the start of your premiership, to create  an inclusive society where no one will be left out.<br><br>Material prosperity infused with warm humanitarian impulses Â– this is as good as it can get for any society. Singaporeans, enjoying life in arguably one of the safest, most comfortable and  most prosperous societies in the world, and at the same time being constantly reminded to show concern for the less privileged, can  only give wholehearted support to such a salutary model of governance.<br><br>Indeed, your new, unique model may have an appeal beyond its own shores. For in its ingenious blending of carefully selected elements from the democratic system on the one hand, and autocratic rule on the other, it may be just the model sought by  new, fledgling democracies in Asia that have become disillusioned with the western model.  The Singapore model must be the only one in the world where capitalism at its most liberal , comports well with  autocracy  at its most fearsome. Political pundits may see it as  a desirable compromise model, whether it is called Â‘benign authoritarianismÂ’, Â‘enlightened autocracyÂ’, or Â‘inspired paternalismÂ’, and even recommend it as an alternative model  worth emulating. Singapore, the small city state once described by a much bigger neighbour as no more than a little red dot on the world map,  will have reached prominence on the world stage  when and if that happens.<br><br>Into this glowing picture, I will now have to inject a sombre note, running the risk of being a spoilsport( even an ingrate, for I came to Singapore from Malaysia forty years ago, and have been enjoying a wonderfully safe, comfortable and happy life since). I would like to draw attention, very respectfully, Mr Prime Minister, to a certain flaw in your model of governance, which could have serious consequences in the future.<br><br>The flaw is in the governmentÂ’s assumption, indeed its unshakeable belief, that the excellence of leadership will continue well into the future, well beyond the earthly lives of the present leaders and the leaders who come after, because of a special continuing process of self-renewal that it has so carefully and painstakingly built into the model. By this process, using the most stringent standards, promising young men and women are selected, tested and trained for leadership, so that the core principles of hard work, discipline and incorruptibility laid down by the party founder Mr Lee Kuan Yew, can be preserved for all time. Since the corollary of good leadership is trust and support from the led, there will be a strong and enduring government-people relationship through the generations, ensuring the permanent well-being of Singapore . Hence, if the PAP aims to be a government in perpetuity, it is only because of this highest of goals.<br><br>HereÂ’s where this idealised picture falls apart: it ignores the inevitability of change through time.  Twenty, thirty years down the road, there is certain to be a change in quality in the leadership. And it will be a change in the direction of decline, simply because in a globalised world of rapid, overwhelming change that has greatest impact on the young, the original core PAP principles and values will steadily lose their influence and may even disappear altogether. The future PAP leaders will therefore be very different. As I have often pointed out in my commentaries, in the worst-case scenario, a corrupt leader could appear on the scene, and get away with it, because of the ingrained, unquestioning trust of a fearful, overdependent people. Recently, during the question-and-answer session at a ministerial forum at Nanyang Technological University, Singaporean students mainly stayed silent, leaving foreign students to ask questions of Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>However, it will only be  a matter of time, in this era of increasing and intense global exposure, before we see a change in the attitude of the younger generation. For one thing, they will not feel the same gratitude for the good life, as their parents and grandparents; for another, they will be less deterred by the climate of fear. This is because the impulse for political freedom is a very powerful one, being an innate driving force in human nature, seen in every society , in every era of human history. No matter how much it is suppressed, diverted or ignored, it never goes away, but eventually asserts itself in one form or other. Young Singaporeans, at some point in the future, will realise that no amount of material prosperity can compensate for the denial of this basic human right, and will feel the need to strike out to claim what is rightfully theirs.<br><br>It is illuminating, Mr Prime Minister, that in your current dialogues with college and university students,  they are less interested in what you tell them about the challenges of economic and social development, than in your thoughts and intentions with regard to the issue of human rights, public debate, public consultation, alternative voices,etc. Among them must be individuals who will be the futureÂ’s tiny minority of rebels , such as the wildly creative artist  ready to defy conventions, and the ferocious non-conformist with political leanings, ready to challenge the establishment. It is a pity that your model has a place for the first but not the second,  for surely true progress in society depends on the nurturing of both. And it would be the greatest pity of all if the young political rebel soon lost heart, got absorbed into the majority, and  concluded, like them,  that compliance  with the powers that be,   made for a more comfortable life. Fear, whether it results in people yielding in submission or lashing out in resentment must be the most damaging force in society.<br><br>I had begun this letter with a plea. It is an earnest plea to consider what can be done to remove this fear, for only then can the process of political reform begin, to lead eventually to what every society needs for resilience and the capacity for renewalÂ– a continuing core, even if only a tiny minority, of alert, savvy, skeptical, dedicated and above all, unafraid citizens who can be relied on to be the movers and shakers. Indeed, no nation can be called great unless it can claim such a citizenry which transcends all governments. The greatest legacy of the PAP may, ironically, be in the creation of a society that no longer needs it.<br><br>Mr Prime Minister, the reality is that this process of political education and nurturing can only be initiated by you and your colleagues. For other parties, such as the media and the educational institutions lack the necessary clout; in any case, they would prefer to look to you to set the tone and direction. A political opening up  in Singapore - a real one, not the tokenism of a SpeakersÂ’ Corner -  is the work of many years, and would require much honesty, patience and perseverance. But if you and your colleagues  begin the process with the same  resolve, energy and  intelligent planning that you have brought to the  many economic and social challenges  of recent years, it will be the most promising start indeed.<br><br>Yours respectfully<br><br>Catherine Lim<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Catherine Lim is a well known writer, there was a time when she wrote critical of PAP government, then one of the PAP leader asked her to join politics if she wants to criticize the government. I think the government dont give a damn, for any feedback or constructive criticizm, because they always have their own reasons to implement things, like the recent protest by the Kranji Farm to do away the storage of granite at Lim Chu Kang. The government dont give in. so I think it is pointless, to give feedback or any suggestion because this is a autocratic government which does not open the door for change or discussion</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My own personal thought of Catherine Lim's open letter:<br><br>Catherine Lim is right in viewing the current autocratic leadership system negatively in the larger perspective of our political evolution. We are only a young nation which seems to have many doubts about certain aspects of democracy as practised in the west.<br><br>Therefore our political leaders have resorted to tampering with the original parliamentary democracy known as Westminster Parliamentary Democracy. Over time this democracy taken over from the British has been tweaked to become an autocratic leadership system cloaked in some forms of democratic flesh like the one-man-one-vote representation system, parliamentary system of government but many working processes to ensure such a democratic system will work as found in established democracy elsewhere have been gradually eroded.<br><br>Our so-called autocratic democracy today no longer respected the basic and fundamental aspects of democracy as practised in western countries and is one which in name is democracy but in fact it is full of hypocrisy and serving only the self-interest and glory of the leaders and their own elites. It is like a time bomb waiting to explode one day and back fire.<br><br>Even if such an autocratic democracy is truly good for the people it has resorted to using all tricks in the book to over-tax the people treating them as money tree for the leaders to shake and pluck.<br><br>It is not a good or sustainable system and should have been changed or discarded. Our leaders are not the great autocratic leaders like the Deng Xiao Peng or Hu Jin Tao who at least did not come across as practising power play on the people or self-glory or self-interest. They achieved many successes far greater without trying to benefit themselves.<br><br>Anyone could see our system as wrongful and self-serving. It is time for Singaporeans to realize that such a system may one day fall into the wrong hand and the whole government machinery get abused for their personal interests.<br><br>Anyone could just tweak the system just as MM Lee himself has done and started helping himself to whatever he wants.<br><br>He could reverse all the good institutions set up and make all the civil servants and ministers serve only his own interest and make compliant the chief justice or newspaper editors, army or police chief and what could anyone do to check such possible scenarios of our present autocracy/<br><br>There will be no check or balances and no Ombudsman as such a democratic institution is beyond the power of citizens to check.<br><br>What we have witnessed is a tip of the iceberg and it could be worse. In that day the whole leadership system as being promoted by MM Lee will fall apart no matter how good intentioned it may be to begin with. MM Lee apparently is aware of such a pitfall as expressed by Catherine Lim but he probably prefers to keep mum about such a possibility of abuse as it does not serve his own interest to reveal such truth or thought.<br><br>We should be happy that such a vulnerability to abuse of our systme has now been succinctly described by Catherine Lim in her letter.<br><br>I share the same view that no matter how good it such a system which we have witnessed it is a seed of great future calamity in time to come.<br><br>It will be the ultimate test of MM Lee as a great statesman or leader for him to own up and admit such a vulnerability and do something to check its further abuse before it becomes too late.</div>

Indeed, no nation can be called great unless it can claim such a citizenry which transcends all governments.<br><br>The greatest legacy of the PAP may, ironically, be in the creation of a society that no longer needs it.''</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">In different way, many have also said that Singapore cannot possibly depend on a Political System that believe it is the only one that possess the TALENT, and is the only one able to attract the ELITE.<br><br>In a 2003 thread, I had posted an interview of a retired Senior Civil Servant - Ngiam Tong Dow - that was titled <strong><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=58178" rel="nofollow">''S'pore Bigger than PAP''</a></strong>.<br><br>In this same 2003 thread, I had also posted the retired Civil Servant comments that it is dangerous for the Ruling Party to continue with new blood thinking that they can continue flying on auto-pilot, and that the Party can monopolise all talents - as described in an article posted on 22 November 2003 - 04.22 AM - <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>''Spread the Talent, Leaders' urged''</strong></span><br><br>This has been an issue that has dragged on since the early 1980s, and LKY  is putting Singapore's future in jeopardy with his hardline policies of a close political system that has only the PAP at the front, and manipulate all political perimeters to its own advantages.<br><br>Catherine has taken to challenge the system and PM LHL words for change - let us see what the outcome will be like.<br></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when a country or empire gets prosperous, its people grow to be weaker and complacent.  (consider what happened to the roman empire).  to ensure people are always on their toes and struggle in life is one way to bring up good leaders for the country.  the only way to ensure people struggle and yet able to succeed is by taxing them to slightly above their break-even cost of living.  to be able to tax them so much requires a perpetual government which does not worry of losing its power at elections.<br></div>
