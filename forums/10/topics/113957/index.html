            <div class='col-md body'>Today i read an article,a Taiwanese compare Singapore n Taipei,he wrote that "Singapore is a city where u easily fall in love with,but wont last long.Whereas Taipei is a city where u wont easily fall in love with,but once u fall in love,u will truly admire it."I have never been to Taipei before,so i wont comment on that.But i think what he say about Singapore is very true.[]<br><br>Becoz during Lou Goh times,the government have anyhow constructed unncessary facilities.For instance Toa Payoh Centre n the park beside it,i am sure many ppl who live there since childhood can hardly recognised that place anymore!And also,the high cost of living n the low payment of jobs have turn this country into a highly pressurized place.The government also built too many railings at the centre of the roads n it make this place seem like a "jail".Yes,at first sight,Singapore seem to be a clean n secure place to live in.But when u live long enough,u will realise that this place is an "empty shell".[]<br>It just like some ppl who only have a pretty face,when u know them long enough,u will realise that they are "brainless" n very hard to get along with.Or u can take Lou Goh as an example,when u see Lou Goh the first time,he seem to be a smart guy.But once he open his mouth n speak n the way he do thing....ALAMAK!!!!(Me slap my forehead) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
