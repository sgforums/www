            <div class='col-md body'>What happened in Bali has caused shockwave around the world. Many nations have condemmed the act even though some nations are saying that it is because of US policies that are causing these incident. Bullshit...... No amount of excuse can justify the killing of so many innocent lives. They are just plain murders even though some people called them terrorists.<br><br>Regardless of their religion, these people should be hunted down and made to pay for their action. I hope that all nations will put in a combined effort to do it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let this blast be a very harsh warning to muslim states in the region. I remembered someone told me that the twin towers won't be a target, and gave me a few very good reasons. Well, Indonesia is a muslim country, and has a deep terrorism background. If it can happen there, it can happen anywhere now. If anyone says that they go after spots frequented by Americans, then KL is a pretty likely target, so is Sentosa. It is about time everyone woke up and stopped saying that "this can't be a target, that can't be a target".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that more things can be done to prevent the Bali incident. No one expect that the bomb will go off in Bali as its population are mostly Hindus. One thing for sure, Indonesia is a much safer place when Suharto was around. At least everyone in Indonesia has food to eat and the number of deaths were low. Those issues about freedom are bullshit if you can't feed the population and the whole country is unstable. Not every country can use a particular model of democracy. If China was not a communist country, it will not be able to feed its population.<br><br>Anyway, nobody in Indonesia is strong enough to rein in the terrorist network so we will still see them floundering in the next few months on the Bali bomb blast. There are rumours that the next target is either in Singapore or Malaysia so we hope that our ISD is doing a good job preventing it.<br><br>Lastly, I hope that we can have a period of mouring by not posting anything on this fourm on 18th October 2002 from 0900hrs - 1300hrs (Singapore time) as a mark of respect for the victims of the Bali bomb blast.
