            <div class='col-md body'>However isn't the show of force from israel too much ? Although the hezbollah do fire rockets over to israel, israel respond by literally invading the country and destroy many infrastructure, which many are probably neutral and innocent. Thousands of Lebanonese lives will change and they will hate the Israel for attacking them. Even the UN post is destroyed and 4 innocent people are killed. Is these 4 innocent people lives worth lesser than the 2 Israel soldiers ? If the involved countries such as china use tic for tat method of the Israel to revenge the single life lost, we will probably see world war 3 in the making. To date the total number of casualty from Lebanon is more than 400. Billions of dollars of infrastructure are destroyed. Compare this figure with the 2 soldiers that were captured during the conflict. Does attacking so harshly result in them being rescued ? I think their chance of survival becomes slimmer by the day. Even if hezbollah never killed them, the Israel will accidentally finish the job by their attacek<br><br>Furthermore, will the attack result in a more peaceful world and Isreal ? No. The Muslims are more infuriated with this attack, they become more isolated and the extremist will get more sympatisers. In the end it just result in more conflicts and more lives lost. The innocent Lebanese whose lives have been affected due to the invasion will hate Israel and they themselves will become the lightly candidate of terrorism. Even when America attack Afghanistan and Iraq, terrorism still increase</div>
