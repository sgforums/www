They are really good in psychological warfare. They turn things around, black becomes white, white becomes black. Imagine, even you got sent this 'message'.  Im not surprised at all. But I would be surprised if someone sent you a message from the Palestinian president or Lebanese president, speaking eloquently about their nation struggle. Do you have any?

So imagine the reach and their effect.<br><br>They are really good in this stuff man, just recently they hacked into Hezbollah TV and FM radio stations in Lebanon.</div>
