            <div class='col-md body'>As off topic as this has gone,  Hmm ... I have always thought that were 50 states in this great country, with Guam, Puerto Rico and couple others as territorial appendages and political protectorates (Egypt being one of them and Libya vying to be another).<br><br>Any way, it would be great to start a caucus to unify Mexico with the great USA -  the United States of North America. It makes sense - Mexicans are literally dying to stream into the United States. American industry needs Mexicans. We might condescend if Canada wants to join too, provided they start stopping those alqaeda people into their country. Any Americans in this forum want to join my caucus?<br><br>Otherwise, I still think there are only 50 states.<br><br>We have to make sure that the unification is by referendum, otherwise "poor" nationalist Mexicans might start strapping bombs to their bodies and committing acts of tourism (errr ... I mean terrorism) in Houston and Los Angeles. Actually the US has already confiscated Utah(indirectly by Mormon expansionism) , California, New Mexico (Was Nevada part of that too?). Compare with SBC buying up its former parent AT&amp;T and then renaming themselves AT&amp;T.<br><br>How about Russia having pushed its eastern frontier during the time of the czars? And China annexation of Tibet? And Australia's, until late 1960's, policy of whites-only Australia.  What about the great Goldern Mongolian Horde unleashed upon Baghdad? How about the Visigoth and Ostrogoths being displaced as consequence of Chinese conquest forcing them into Europe?<br><br>How about the 800,000 Jews expelled from Iran, Iraq as well as some Arab countries - which would never let descendents of exiled Jews return to those villages.<br><br>4 million Palestinians? Did Golda Meir not say there is not a "Palestine" at all?  Palestine was like Iraq and Congo ... consequence of reckless British colonial policy. Jews were to blame to - for bringing in immigrant Arab labour when the Rothschild Foundation started purchasing lands from Turkish landlords.<br><br>But Israel is Is real (pun intended). During Passover, Jews say, "Next Year in Jerusalem" for hundreds, if not thousand +, years. "By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and wept".<br><br>"Palestine", except for five cities/towns was desolate, and deserted. The Arabs were not interested in populating them. They were fighting their brothers the Turks. It's like you had a big cousin who robbed away your toy and keeps it but would not play with it until you started to play with it and he gets jealous.<br><br>Why would the Bedouin Arabs side with the Jews during the 1930's? At least the northern Israeli Bedouin (while the southern Bedouins respected not even their Arab neighbours).  These Beduoins today serve proudly in the Israel Defence Force. They liken themselves to American Natives of the land guiding the Jews to settle. The real "Palestinians" are the Bedouins, who roamed "Palestine" outbacks with their sheep and cattle (and today their beaten-up toyota pickups and plastic tents).<br><br>Is a that tiny piece of unwanted land too much for the eye-sight of Arabs and Muslim to bear? Muslims and Arab territory stretch from Africa to Turkey to China to India and to Saudi Arabia.<br><br>Is Israel's reaction too swift and too agressive? Recall the six day war? Egypt, Syria, Jordan and other Arab entities were intent on wiping out Israel. Did not Rabin offer huge concessions to Arafat? Since Arafat rejected it (as a way to keep him in power - he even refused to die in "Palestine" but in France! Or did he die in Italy?), they will not get that offer today. Because Jews remember Masada, Jews remember the Crusades and Inquisition and the Nazi. And the foresight of the institution of Passover more than 2500 years ago continues to remind Jews the responsibility towards themselves to avoid extinction.<br><br>It is easy for Christians to say, "what are you Jews fighting for?" Their crusades and Inquisition were responsible for killing countless Jews as well as murdering millions of their own. It is easy for Buddhists to say the same - they never had the prospect of being extincted throughout the course of history. Again and again. Why don't certain Singaporeans just forget about Mandarin and Tamil and use only Malay? There is an instinct for a culture to live on.<br></div>
