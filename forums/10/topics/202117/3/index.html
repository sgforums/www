            <div class='col-md body'>The problem in the Middle-east requires a long-term solution...that I agree with the US. Unfortunately, it is also the US and Israel that have no stomach for an effective long-term solution.<br><br>Such a solution must encompass the right to return of Palestinian refugees. There are 4 million Palestinian refugees, many of whom holding deeds to their land and keys to their homes, who have been displaced by the multiple Arab-Israeli wars. Unless Israel respects their right to return to their homes, Israel faces an opposition the size of Singapore from which terrorist groups like Hizbollah can always count on for support. Whatever international force you create to separate the two parties will inevitably end up being caught in the cross-fire.<br><br>With regard to the current crisis, Israel must understand that often it's the grief, not just the grievance, that feeds the circle of violence. A BBC interview with a Lebanese Christian doctor who is a victim of the bombing 2 days ago well illustrates this. He said, "I am not Hizbollah...I do not support the Hizbollah...but now I do."<br><br>Imagine someone who just want a peaceful life to bring up his children like we all do, someone who does not care about the politics or religious conflicts in the area. One day, Israel bombs his house and kills his family. He has no job, no house, no wife and no children...he has nothing to live for. Is it difficult to understand why such a person might want to strap a bomb belt around himself and blow up Israeli children and women, so the other side also experiences his grief? We can condemn such actions all we want and we should do so, but that will not stop the violence.<br><br>Until the 4 million displaced Palestinians are allowed to go home in Israel and the occupied West Bank, there will be no shortage of recruits for the likes of Hizbollah and Hamas. Even if Israel destroys one group, another will take its place.<br><br>What can Israel do if it will not ever allow Palestinian refugees the right to return (as they have said repeatedly)? This circle of violence will go on unless they intend to do what the Nazis failed to do to them some 60 years ago: exterminate the 4 million Arabs? I shudder at the thought but sometimes history does have the habit of repeating itself.<br><br></div>
