I do agree that throughout history, countries have risen and fallen, borders have shifted and changed, political leaders have been installed, risen to power and fallen from power.<br><br>Yet in the particular issue, both sides are almost equally matched tactically and that promises a high death toll. I'm not saying that the palestinians have a strong army, don't get me mistaken. I'm saying that its almost a stand off. Israel is not out to conquer entire mid east, while the muslim nations are constantly financing and aiding those who oppose Israel. Israel can neither win nor lose via an outright conventional war unless they conquer all those nations who finance the terrorist. And even if Israel decide to go crazy and try to attack all those countries that finance the terrorist, they would end up like USA, overstretched military, high death toll and poor public opinion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My Malaysian cousin emailed the below article to me which i believe reflects what many people think:<br><br>Israel has lost the plot<br>Dean Johns<br>Jul 28, 06 6:45pm<br><br>At the risk of appearing to echo the Malaysian government's sectarian sentiments on the subject, the current Israeli attacks on Lebanon and Gaza are an absolute outrage. Israel, of all nations, should be aware of the evils of submitting innocent civilians to the kind of blitzkrieg it's indulging in.<br><br>Firstly, as the UN and many of its members insist, it's collective punishment, specifically ruled out by international law. Secondly, such indiscriminate killing and destruction will only generate more hatred and resentment of Israel in the Arab world than ever and, perhaps worst of all for Israel's future, it is appalling public relations.<br><br>Everybody on earth has been aware since soon after the creation of Israel that it's a client state of the US. Witness the old American witticism that Â‘a Zionist is a Jew who pays another Jew to live in IsraelÂ’.<br><br>But as dependent on US aid and diplomatic support as it has been, and as it is richly entitled to be, in my opinion, considering how shabbily the US and other allies dealt with the plight of the Jews during World War II, it should be pointed out that Israel has previously fought its own battles, in its own fashion.<br><br>It easily won all-out wars with Arab nations whenever they got together to gang-up on this tiny, industrious democracy amid the swamp of oil-fueled indolence, ignorance, incompetence and fanaticism that comprises so much of the Middle-East.<br><br>And it has always dealt with every lesser insult and assault from the Entebbe hijackers to the sponsors of suicide bombings and rocket-firing in its own highly-efficient fashion, with extremely efficient commando operations, highly-selective (and richly-deserved) assassinations, and more recently, a security fence.<br><br>But this time Israel has gone totally overboard using not just its arsenal of US armaments but also US methods. The kind of bully boy, blast-em-back-to-the-Stone-Age heavy bombardment that murders, maims and terrorises a great many more civilians than combatants has proven such a criminal fiasco and failure everywhere it's been practiced, from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan.<br><br>A full circle<br><br>So now, for once and for all, Israel has emerged not just as a US dependant and ally, but some new kind of entity that looks very much like a mini US itself.<br><br>Which seems a shame to me, because I've always admired both the concept and the reality of Israel, as well as the spirit with which it has - albeit with US help - fought, prevailed and prospered as a David among hostile neighbouring Goliaths.<br><br>But now that it has allowed itself to be conscripted as a fully-fledged member of the so-called Â‘coalitionÂ’ in the Bush regime's ill-conceived, ill-executed and ill-fated War on Terror, Israel has lost the plot.<br><br>It also seems to have lost its memory, to have forgotten the fact, apparently, that the state we know today as Israel was forged 50-odd years ago out of what was previously known as British Palestine over the dead bodies of British occupiers.<br><br>And the people who did the killing back then were the Stern Gang and other groups of what were in those days considered Jewish terrorists. The determination of these terrorists sprang from their desperation for a Jewish homeland; a safe haven from the horrors of Hitler's gas chambers and later, the refugee camps in which so many of the survivors were dumped after the Nazis were defeated.<br><br>Now, however, the wheel of history has come full circle. Now the terrorists are not Jews desperate for a homeland, but Arabs displaced from theirs, and living, in the Gaza strip and elsewhere, as permanent refugees from the Israelis.<br><br>And now the Israelis are attacking both the Gaza refugee camps and the people of Southern Lebanon with a ferocity and inhumanity that's eerily reminiscent of anti-Jewish atrocities like the notorious Warsaw Ghetto. Not quite so malicious or massive in scale yet, admittedly, but getting there.<br><br>Too fixated<br><br>And yet this is the nation whose whole reason for existence is founded on declaring Â‘never againÂ’ to the holocaust. In the almost sixty years since European Jews (not to mention gypsies and other largely overlooked and unlamented groups) were slaughtered in their millions, there have been countless other holocausts, of course, none of which appeared to bother Israel too badly, as they happened to non-Jews.<br><br>Like the ethnic Chinese following the Suharto-led coup in Indonesia; the Karen and other Christian tribes in Burma; the Ibo in Nigeria; first the Â‘intellectualsÂ’ then all city-dwellers and finally anyone who laughed, sang or wore colours in Cambodia; the Kurds in Iraq and Turkey; the Albanians in Serbia; the Serbs in Kosovo; every species of Â‘dissidentÂ’ from Tibet; the Falun Gong in China and both the Hutus and Tutsis in their turn in Rwanda.<br><br>And so the grisly list goes on. Liberal Jews around the world, notably including those who own and run The New York Times, have protested against these events. But Israel, as a nation, seems to have been too fixated on its own problems to be bothered about those of other peoples, including the Arabs it has been responsible for displacing and dispossessing.<br><br>And now, its attitude of indifference to the plight of others appears to be turning into outright aggression. Israel's war on the god-forsaken inmates of the Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza and the mostly innocent men, women and children of Lebanon won't amount to a full-scale holocaust, of course.<br><br>Even if they wanted it to, Bush, Blair and Nato wouldn't stand for it. But their victory certainly will be a hollow one, and it'll come at a terrible cost. Not just to the victims, but to Israel itself - its image, reputation, credibility, and, most damaging of all, its future security in the face of the whole new levels of hatred that this Â‘Operation OverkillÂ’ is engendering among its enemies.<br><br>DEAN JOHNS is an Australian freelance journalist now living in Kuala Lumpur and a former occasional columnist for The Sydney Morning Herald.</div>

Do you think both states inside Gaza &amp; outside Gaza both have their time &amp; effort to develop their own land &amp; society.

Israel have offered money to help re-develop Gaza &amp; other parts before with conditions of no bombing, rockets .... but the controlling parties does not have control of minority groups in these area that are causing the problems. Gaza government do wanted Peace in some way or another. That is for sure for both sides. They are lacking of abilities to pay, educate &amp; control minor groups. Take for example, shell pull out of Gaza cause they are not paid for 3 months. Palestian police officer in Gaza are not paid for 6 months continuous. How is the society going to be peaceful? We all know, un-employment rate increase with crime rate. It's happening.<br><br>I remember in May.

Like you have said chinese SOLDIER as you have said. It's a soldier against a soldier. What was happening here in Israel? It's minorit groups, not the main stream Army that is causing the problems. Worst, these people are hiding within Civilians. I still dis-agree at Israel for doing massive destructions. Likewise without an operation, the turmor cannot be remove inside your body. There is sure for loss of blood. NVA and Vietcon are also army against army. Vietcon &amp; NVA war are direct into each others state. Here it's more like against an Race, meaning Civilian or not, they kill as long as not their race.<br><br>It's near impossible to single out the terrorist within Civilians.

            <div class='col-md body'>This articles makes very good points -<br><br>Here are the excerpt from the article<br><blockquote><strong>Israel, not Hizbullah, is putting civilians in danger on both sides of the border<br><br>Â“The Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert embeds his soldiers in Israeli communities, next to schools, beside hospitals, close to welfare centres, ensuring that any Israeli target is also a civilian target. This is the practice the UN's Jan Egeland had in mind when he lambasted IsraelÂ’s Â‘cowardly blending ... among women and childrenÂ’.<br>*****<br>Giving the lie to the Â“human shieldsÂ” theory, HRW says its researchers Â“found numerous cases in which the IDF [Israeli army] launched artillery and air attacks with limited or dubious military objectives but excessive civilian cost. In many cases, Israeli forces struck an area with no apparent military target. In some instances, Israeli forces appear to have deliberately targeted civilians.Â”<br><br>In fact, of the 24 incidents they document, HRW researchers could find no evidence that Hizbullah was operating in or near the areas that were attacked by the Israeli air force. Roth states: Â“The image that Israel has promoted of such [human] shielding as the cause of so high a civilian death toll is wrong. In the many cases of civilian deaths examined by Human Rights Watch, the location of Hezbollah troops and arms had nothing to do with the deaths because there was no Hezbollah around.Â”<br>*****<br>Echoing comments by the UNÂ’s Jan Egeland, he says Hizbullah fighters are Â“cowardly blendingÂ” with LebanonÂ’s civilian population. It is difficult to know what to make of this observation. If Freedland means that Hizbullah fighters come from Lebanese towns and villages and have families living there whom they visit and live among, he is right. But exactly the same can be said of Israel and its soldiers, who return from the battlefront (in this case inside Lebanon, as they are now an invading army) to live with parents or spouses in Israeli communities. Armed and uniformed soldiers can be seen all over Israel, sitting in trains, queuing in banks, waiting with civilians at bus stops. Does that mean they are Â“cowardly blendingÂ’ with IsraelÂ’s civilian population?<br>*****<br>Egeland and FreedlandÂ’s criticism seems to amount to little more than blaming Hizbullah fighters for not standing in open fields waiting to be picked off by Israeli tanks and war planes. That, presumably, would be brave. But in reality no army fights in this way, and Hizbullah can hardly be criticised for using the only strategic defences it has: its underground bunkers and the crumbling fortifications of Lebanese villages ruined by Israeli pounding. An army defending itself from invasion has to make the most of whatever protection it can find -- as long as it does not intentionally put civilians at risk. But HRWÂ’s research shows convincingly that Hizbullah is not doing this.<br>*****<br>There are hundreds of similar military installations next to or inside IsraelÂ’s northern communities. Some distance from Nazareth, for example, Israel has built a large weapons factory virtually on top of an Arab town -- so close to it, in fact, that the factoryÂ’s perimeter fence is only a few metres from the main building of the local junior school. There have been reports of rockets landing close to that Arab community.<br><br>How these kind of attacks are being unfairly presented in the Israeli and foreign media was highlighted recently when it was widely reported that a Hizbullah rocket had landed Â“near a hospitalÂ” in a named Israeli city, not the first time that such a claim has been made over the past few weeks. I cannot name the city, again because of IsraelÂ’s press censorship laws and because I also want to point out that very Â“nearÂ” that hospital is an army camp. The media suggested that Hizbullah was trying to hit the hospital, but it is also more than possible it was trying to strike -- and may have struck -- the army camp.<br>******<br>Audiences ought to be alerted to this danger by their media. Any reports touching on Â“security mattersÂ” are supposed to be submitted to the countryÂ’s military censor, but few media are pointing this out. Most justify this deception to themselves on the grounds that in practice they never run their reports by the censor as it would delay publication.<br><br>Instead, they avoid problems with the military censor either by self-censoring their reporting of security issues or by relying on what has already been published in the Israeli media on the assumption that in these ways they are unlikely to contravene the rules</strong>.</blockquote><a href="http://www.jkcook.net/Articles2/0269.htm#Top" rel="nofollow">http://www.jkcook.net/Articles2/0269.htm#Top</a><br><br>I especially like this part : - makes alot of sense.<br><br>Â“The Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert embeds his soldiers in Israeli communities, next to schools, beside hospitals, close to welfare centres, ensuring that any Israeli target is also a civilian target.

What's next ... built Jewish settlements called " jewish Neighbourhood" and when these settlement are attcked... the media will gives the impression that Israel proper is attacked... and another incursion into Nth Lebanese.. then drop leaflets caling the Lebanese to vacate their country.. else anyone killed is their fault ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>It's about annexation, stupid!</strong><br>By Kaveh L Afrasiabi<br><br>Officially, Israel's ground invasion of Lebanon is an act of self-defense against Hezbollah's threat, aimed at creating a security buffer zone until the arrival of a "multinational force with an enforcement capability". But increasingly, as the initial goal of a narrow strip of only a few kilometers has now been extended up to the Litani River deep in Lebanon, the real motives behind Israel's invasion are becoming crystal-clear.<br><br>It's about (de facto) annexation, stupid. This is a war to annex a major chunk of Lebanese territory without necessarily saying so, under the pretext of security buffer and deterrence against future attacks on Israel.<br><br>Already, since the Six Day War, Israel has annexed the Sheba Farms, considered part of the Syrian Golan Heights, although the<br><br>government of Lebanon has long complained that the 25-square-kilometer area was a part of Lebanon. Now the Israeli army is sweeping the area south of the Litani River as a temporary occupation.<br><br>"We have no intention of extending our operation more than 70 kilometers north of our borders with Lebanon," stated Lieutenant-Colonel Hemi Lini on the Lebanese border on July 17, one week  after the war's outbreak.<br><br>This would put Israel, assuming for a moment that the Israel Defense Forces' operations prove ultimately successful, in control of the Litani River, thus fulfilling Israel's founding fathers' dream, stretching back to Chaim Weizmann, head of the World Zionist Organization, who in 1919 declared the river "essential to the future of the Jewish national home".<br><br>Consequently, contrary to the pro-Israel pundits' reassurances that this war is not about occupation, all the tangible signs indicate the exact opposite, ie, the distinct possibility of a "war of acreage" whereby Israel would expand its territory, acquire a new strategic depth, and simultaneously address its chronic water shortage by exploiting the Litani.<br><br>Access to the Litani would translate into an annual increase of water supply by 800 million cubic meters. This in turn might allow Israel to bargain with Syria over the Golan Heights, source of a full one-third of Israel's fresh water. However, a more likely scenario is Israel's continued unwillingness to abide by United Nations Resolutions 242 and 338 calling for its withdrawal from the Syrian territories.<br><br>The entire Western media have settled on a naive perspective of the reasons for Israel's invasion of Lebanon, namely as a defensive measure against Hezbollah. Conspicuously absent is any serious consideration of a viable, alternative explanation while focusing on, in essence, the same ingredients as in the 1982 invasion: "deceit and misleading statements" by leaders, "inaccurate announcements" by the military spokesmen, and "gross exaggeration" of threats, to paraphrase a candid reflection of an Israeli general, Yehoshafat Harkabi.<br><br>Following this scenario, Israel has dropped leaflets throughout southern Lebanon warning the civilians to leave or risk their lives, as they would be considered "Hezbollah sympathizers" if they refused to leave. Reminiscent of Israel's annexation of Palestinian lands in 1948 and beyond, the present war is causing mass refugees, who in all likelihood will not return to their homes any time soon.<br><br>The geostrategic and water dimensions of Israel's quest to possess southern Lebanon notwithstanding, the question is, of course, whether or not the world community will tolerate such a development that would remake the map of the Middle East.<br><br>There are plenty of reasons to think that in light of the United States' complicit silence on Israel's violation of the territorial integrity of Lebanon, Israel will somehow manage to ride out the international criticisms and stick to its undeclared plan to annex southern Lebanon. However, what is less certain is that the combined efforts of Hezbollah and the rest of Lebanese society, not to mention other Arab contributions, will prevail over Israel's appetite for a decent part of Lebanon.<br><br>With the military balance disproportionately in Israel's favor, we can safely assume that the new Operation Litani will succeed and thus create a "new Middle East" with a "greater" and geographically expanded Israel and a shrunken or diminished Lebanon.<br><br>If so, then the chronology of events narrated by future historians will closely follow this line of thought: that Israel deliberately provoked Hezbollah into action, after a six-year hiatus, by pressuring Hezbollah's ally, Hamas, which was subjected to a campaign of terror, financial squeeze and intimidation.<br><br>The laying of such a trap by Israel would not have happened in a vacuum of strategic thinking on Israel's part. The fact that Hezbollah fell into the trap is a result of several factors, including an adventurist element lending itself to the "reckless" action of Hezbollah on July 11 with respect to crossing the Blue Line and attacking an Israeli patrol.<br><br>Since then, the Israelis have put on the mask of being reluctant warriors, delaying their troops' entry into south Lebanon and thus perpetuating Israel's self-image as disinterested in any imperial grand objectives. Yet the facts on the ground speak louder than words and, indeed, what fact is more important than Israeli leaders' announced intention to occupy up to the Litani River?<br><br>Again, what is understandably omitted in those announcements, adopted as the real reasons by CNN and other US networks, is Israel's predatory lust after Litani's water sources, as well as for new geographical and strategic depth. This in turn might explain the otherwise inexplicably blatant overreaction of Israel to a border incident with Hezbollah.<br><br>Instead of searching for answers in the Israeli collective psyche or in the context of action, we must probe the answer in the writings of Israel's founding fathers, including Theodor Herzl and David Ben-Gurion, commonly yearning for Israel's control of the Litani River. As a timely addition to their old wish, Israel today has a security-related explanation, justifying the territorial takeover in the near future in terms of the lessons of the present war, the main lesson being Israel's dire need to gain strategic depth to avoid rocket attacks.<br><br>Indeed, the verdict will soon be out in Israel about the precious lesson of Lebanon War II, that is, how to prevent future rocket attacks in the only feasible way, that is, direct control of southern Lebanon. </blockquote>http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HH05Ak01.html<br></div>
