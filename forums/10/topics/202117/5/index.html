            <div class='col-md body'>In all ancient counties during their establishment, there are sure some people loss out in their controls, homes, land, life.... during this time. Israel &amp; palestinian situation is reflecting this. Romans kills a lot of people &amp; en-slave much more when they occupy lands also. The world is not balance, sad to say, usually is the stronger ones wins. Israel &amp; Palestinian situation is reflecting this also. It will be never ending by who owns what &amp; should return what. No doubt the weaker will fight with all their might, only the stronger one wins &amp; stay put. This is nature's law to ensure the world goes round.<br><br>Such situations now we seeing, cannot be blame on just one side. Both did something wrong &amp; both are not going to work for their future. If you were here for sometimes, please notice how the people behave. They can only contain their own views &amp; liking. Not even a sand of others can be contain. This very behaviour effects current situations a lot.<br><br>As why Israel holds Hama money when they are elected. Do you know Hama's are known to link very tightly to Terrorism? Would you give money to someone buying guns to kill you? Isreal hold their money having some reason, I wish you read more or find out more informations before stating this fact. Israel &amp; UN did want to un-freeze Hama's bank with promises that they cut ties with terrorism. This was not reach till now. Why can't have more patience to work towards peace? More rockets was launched right away.<br><br>The confiscated money was written in newspaper. It maybe wrong for the usage of money but to the lesser extend, it should be coming into Palestianian thru bank transfer. Not smuggling. Don't you know travelling with large amount of cash is an offence already? Some may argue the bank account is frozen. This falls back to "Stops terrorism &amp; Bank account will flow."<br><br>Again, don't just see hear Isreal uses extreme harassment tactics. There is some methods used to control people. Again it was both sides are also doing the extreme. If there is no rockets, suicide bombing, .... there is no extra cautious taken against. All country under such situation will take up counter-measures. I only agreed to some points Isreallis sometimes have taken too much cautious, but we cannot put all blames on one side. We are talking about life &amp; death. Who would like to work in check points to face potential suicide bombers? No one likes to do this. If Singapore were to face rocket attack, I am sure more counter-measures are taken also.<br><br>I cannot do estimations on death in Lebanon. If you read more, notice country with report higher amount of deaths to claim pity &amp; money thru donations. Points to know, do your donations wisely. Don't donate to people the harm others. The recent collapse building in Lebanon was reported 54 deaths including 27 kids. The very next day reported only 21 body was found inside that building with 16 kids. Don't just believe News, they could sometime reflect some wrong informations. In many cases, a lot of times news is "NOT THAT CORRECT."<br><br>Don't jump on one side. It takes 2 hands to clap. I believe there will be ways for peaceful time, but it's not in our near future.<br><br>Israel time 9:18pm. Could still hear in great distant non-regular bombing the north started early afternoon, till now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">If Israel will allow the 4 million Palestinians to return to their homes in Israel and the occupied WEst Bank, it will remove the constant supply of recruits for the likes of Hamas and Hezbollah.<br><br>It is not culture that teaches people to hate. Even Lebanese Christians, who used to be the enemy of the Hezbollah, are now supporting Hezbollah. I have also heard a Palestinian Christian talk about volunteering to be a suicide bomber. Why? It is not culture or religion. It is much more simple: they have lost their wives and children, their homes and jobs....they want vengeance.<br><br>It's not just the grievance, it's the grief.... and Israel is doing a good job at building the level of grief and the reservoir of hatred among the Arabs.</div></blockquote>Don't just see hear. I believe there is lot of hate on what Israel is doing. Don't just blame one side. I would like to know where this 4 million people are now for my knowledge to this region? Numbers can be easily said, 4 millions is a lot of people. But why? I believe if so many were un-justified UN will speak something. Maybe I do not know this. Tell me.<br><br>When north &amp; south Korea split, so many families are broken also. But do the North or south Korean display so much hate that became terrorism? There is north/south Korea war, &amp; it's about that's all. Not such act of Terrorism like what's happening now. It's the people's behaviour here. They can contain only themself. Not even a sand of others.<br><br>Don't you know Singapore also uses HDB quota to mix malays, indians &amp; chinese. So that there is no area that have very high concentrated of one kind of race. I think Israel is doing this also. Mixing people, moving people, re-location of people to reduce concentrated threats. This is known to be effective to some extends, but it takes a long time. Singapore is a huge sucess in this area.<br><br>The Holy Land has lots of tears &amp; blood shed. Promotions of LOVE have not come to deliver it's result. It's human' behaviour &amp; refusal to accept what it is causes now what. If people themselves do not change their fixed point of views &amp; behaviour, LOVE will not deliver it's result even it's holy land. It's acceptances of others that lead to more friends &amp; people. Hate &amp; violence drives away friends, people &amp; create enemy. Built bridges not walls.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all.. I am just reply to your over - simplistic post<br><br>and I will only reply some portion of your post.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by surfer188:<br>In all ancient counties during their establishment, there are sure some people loss out in their controls, homes, land, life.... during this time.

The reason why the money was held was that they are not happy the Hamas was elected almost immediately.. they voiced this openly... If it were because of Terrorism than why don't they reject HAMA participation.. Israel do has nukes and bigger guns.<br><br>Finally, UN has nothing to do with the withholding the money.. in fact .. the opposite.. where do you read your news.<br><br><blockquote>The confiscated money was written in newspaper.

Nice media manupilation.<br><br>Even in Natural earthquake, when a building collapse, even with heavy machinery.. it takes a week to dig out bodies.. so the 13 missing are presumed dead and is probably under the rubble. They are reported by relatives who couldn't find them on top soil and couldn't stay .. because you know they will either be called human shield, terrorist or simply starved to death.<br><br>And the IDF was honest about those rockets being fired from/near the building ??? and is it not that more children was killed than IDF soldiers ??<br><br><blockquote>Israel time 9:18pm. Could still hear in great distant non-regular bombing the north started early afternoon, till now.</blockquote>You should be proud of your boys.. 9000+4000(yesterday) arty shells for 1800++ rockets.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Mobydog,<br><br>I think you don't accept that both party Israel &amp; Palestinian did something against each other. It's not just here do not have world moral ethics. Many places. Let me ask you a straight question, "Have you been in Israel, Gaza or Lebanon?" You will find each is painting their own stories. Modern world do not face out stronger wins, it's the way to do it humanly. Weather Isreal has bought this land from Palestinian or have snatch them away. Both Israel &amp; Palestinian should solve it "world moral ethics" "no matter which party is poorer or richer or lesser in weapon".  Don't you agree? Resulting in Terrorism, Rocket, War, ... are all "NON-Moral Ethics." That's include both.<br><br>To reject Hamas's participations or not is really not for you &amp; me to understand. It's political. If to kick Hamas out of elections, it will shows Israel or that government then is sidings some parties. Hamas did have a long history with Terrorism. Their elections speach was always inclusive of using forces/methods to kick out Israel.<br><br>In airports of Customs. I remember the maximum Cash can be carried do have some limits. Don't mind you can search this. April this year, when I was in China Beijing, the maximum Cash one can carry is RMB or equilvent is RMB$20,000 if I am not wrong. Most country have this laws to block money laundry or illegal transactions.<br><br>There is always a out-cry of illegal occupations of Palestnian land. Some may be true, some not. From the Israellis side, not my view, their land was mostly bought thru a transactions of gold. Then I believe Israelli grow or expand their land. This may have cause the confusion. I think Isreal have uses some methods to suppress others. Not ethical either.<br><br>As you can see, the news you have seen &amp; what I have see can have different figures. All painting their different storys. From my side of the news, it's 21 body found with 16 kids. Let it be with the numbers, people are been hurt &amp; killed at this very moment. The very un-expected was, war started for sometimes, most logical is to leave war zone areas, like the millions who had left. There may be reasons why they are there. If rockets are to fly near me. I am sure be in my car to a safer area. War in urban areas, always more civilian dead. IDF have stronger fire power &amp; it's fighting on Lebanon land, no doubt Lebanon suffer more.</div>

From the Israellis side, not my view, their land was mostly bought thru a transactions of gold. Then I believe Israelli grow or expand their land. This may have cause the confusion. I think Isreal have uses some methods to suppress others. Not ethical either.</blockquote>You mean they bought the lands inside GAZA.. where Israel built their Settlements.. or are you trying to mix it up with inside Israel ??</div>

I, the Prime Minister of Israel,<br>am speaking to you from Jerusalem in the face of the terrible pictures from<br>Kfar Kana. Any human heart, wherever it is, must sicken and recoil at the<br>sight of such pictures. There are no words of comfort that can mitigate the<br>enormity of this tragedy. Still, I am looking you straight in the eye and<br>telling you that the State of Israel will continue its military campaign in<br>Lebanon.<br><br>The Israel Defense Forces will continue to attack targets from which<br>missiles and Katyusha rockets are fired at hospitals, old age homes and<br>kindergartens in Israel. I have instructed the security forces and the IDF<br>to continue to hunt for the Katyusha stockpiles and launch sites from which<br>these savages are bombarding the State of Israel.<br><br>We will not hesitate, we will not apologize and we will not back off. If<br>they continue to launch missiles into Israel from Kfar Kana, we will<br>continue to bomb Kfar Kana. Today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.<br>Here, there and everywhere. The children of Kfar Kana could now be sleeping<br>peacefully in their homes, unmolested, had the agents of the devil not taken<br>over their land and turned the lives of our children into hell.<br><br>Ladies and gentlemen, it's time you understood: the Jewish state will no<br>longer be trampled upon. We will no longer allow anyone to exploit<br>population centers in order to bomb our citizens. No one will be able to<br>hide anymore behind women and children in order to kill our women and<br>children. This anarchy is over. You can condemn us, you can boycott us, you<br>can stop visiting us and, if necessary, we will stop visiting you.<br>�<br>A voice for six million citizens<br>�<br>�<br>Today I am serving as the voice of six million bombarded Israeli citizens<br>who serve as the voice of six million murdered Jews who were melted down to<br>dust and ashes by savages in Europe. In both cases, those responsible for<br>these evil acts were, and are, barbarians devoid of all humanity, who set<br>themselves one simple goal: to wipe the Jewish race off the face of the<br>earth, as Adolph Hitler said, or to wipe the State of Israel off the map, as<br>Mahmoud Ahmedinjad proclaims.<br><br>....cont.</div>

The Jewish people are now<br>capable of standing up to those who seek their destruction - those people<br>will no longer be able to hide behind women and children.

This must be stated clearly and<br>publicly, once and for all. You are welcome to judge us, to ostracize us, to<br>boycott us and to vilify us. But to kill us? Absolutely not.<br><br>Four months ago I was elected by hundreds of thousands of citizens to the<br>office of Prime Minister of the government of Israel, on the basis of my<br>plan for unilaterally withdrawing from 90 percent of the areas of Judea and<br>Samaria, the birth place and cradle of the Jewish people; to end most of the<br>occupation and to enable the Palestinian people to turn over a new leaf and<br>to calm things down until conditions are ripe for attaining a permanent<br>settlement between us.<br><br>The Prime Minister who preceded me, Ariel Sharon, made a full withdrawal<br>from the Gaza Strip back to the international border, and gave the<br>Palestinians there a chance to build a new reality for themselves. The Prime<br>Minister who preceded him, Ehud Barak, ended the lengthy Israeli presence in<br>Lebanon and pulled the IDF back to the international border, leaving the<br>land of the cedars to flourish, develop and establish its democracy and its<br>economy.<br><br>What did the State of Israel get in exchange for all of this? Did we win<br>even one minute of quiet? Was our hand, outstretched in peace, met with a<br>handshake of encouragement? Ehud Barak's peace initiative at Camp David let<br>loose on us a wave of suicide bombers who smashed and blew to pieces over<br>1,000 citizens, men, women and children. I don't remember you being so<br>enraged then. Maybe that happened because we did not allow TV close-ups of<br>the dismembered body parts of the Israeli youngsters at the Dolphinarium? Or<br>of the shattered lives of the people butchered while celebrating the<br>Passover seder at the Park Hotel in Netanya? What can you do - that's the<br>way we are. We don't wave body parts at the camera. We grieve quietly.<br><br>We do not dance on the roofs at the sight of the bodies of our enemy's<br>children - we express genuine sorrow and regret. That is the monstrous<br>behavior of our enemies. Now they have risen up against us. Tomorrow they<br>will rise up against you. You are already familiar with the murderous taste<br>of this terror.

            <div class='col-md body'>...cont.<br><br>And Ariel Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza. What did it get us? A barrage of<br>Kassem missiles fired at peaceful settlements and the kidnapping of<br>soldiers. Then too, I don't recall you reacting with such alarm. And for six<br>years, the withdrawal from Lebanon has drawn the vituperation and crimes of<br>a dangerous, extremist Iranian agent, who took over an entire country in the<br>name of religious fanaticism and is trying to take Israel hostage on his way<br>to Jerusalem - and from there to Paris and London.<br><br>An enormous terrorist infrastructure has been established by Iran on our<br>border, threatening our citizens, growing stronger before our very eyes,<br>awaiting the moment when the land of the Ayatollahs becomes a nuclear power<br>in order to bring us to our knees. And make no mistake - we won't go down<br>alone. You, the leaders of the free and enlightened world, will go down<br>along with us.<br><br>So today, here and now, I am putting an end to this parade of hypocrisy. I<br>don't recall such a wave of reaction in the face of the 100 citizens killed<br>every single day in Iraq. Sunnis kill Shiites who kill Sunnis, and all of<br>them kill Americans - and the world remains silent. And I am hard pressed to<br>recall a similar reaction when the Russians destroyed entire villages and<br>burned down large cities in order to repress the revolt in Chechnya. And<br>when NATO bombed Kosovo for almost three months and crushed the civilian<br>population - then you also kept silent. What is it about us, the Jews, the<br>minority, the persecuted, that arouses this cosmic sense of justice in you?<br>What do we have that all the others don't?<br><br>In a loud clear voice, looking you straight in the eye, I stand before you<br>openly and I will not apologize. I will not capitulate. I will not whine.<br>This is a battle for our freedom. For our humanity. For the right to lead<br>normal lives within our recognized, legitimate borders. It is also your<br>battle. I pray and I believe that now you will understand that. Because if<br>you don't, you may regret it later, when it's too late.<br><br>-end-</div>

Because my whole general post is about... " what made a Suicide bomber do what he does ".. and not all suicide bombers are religious fanatics.<br><br>In today's straits Times papers, an article mentioned that out of 41 Lebanese suicide bombers, only 8 are fanatics, the other 28 are resistance to occupation, which includes christians.</div>
