              <p><span style="line-height: 14px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px;">
              </span></p><div style="margin-top: -6px;">
              <p>In his <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/STForum/OnlineStory/STIStory_506015.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">article to the forum</span></span></a>, Straits Times reader Kong Siong Kwong suggests that the banning of walkovers in the next general election would be ‘inequitable’ to the nominees that run for political office.</p>
              <p>They are ‘also Singaporean and entitled to his rights’, and we cannot ‘insist’ that they must secure more than 50 per cent of the vote ‘in order to establish that they have the support of the constituents.’</p>
              <p>Mr. Kong has clearly interpreted the nature of the voting process on its head, and most certainly lopsidedly.</p>
              <p>The onus is on the political nominees running for office to prove their support of the constituents, not for the constituents to prove that the nominees do not have their support.</p>
              <p>The default position that should be first assumed is that the political nominees <em>do not</em> have the support of the constituents, and thus the need for a democratic process of voting to alter this default position.</p>
              <p>Mr. Kong makes the assertion that the political nominees are ‘also Singaporeans’ and are ‘entitled to (their) rights’, but it is vague on what sort of ‘rights’ he is trying to bring into the argument.</p>
              <p>In any case, if it is ‘rights’ that is the issue at stake here, can anything matter more in a period of general elections than the political rights of the vast number of Singaporeans in the constituent that do not have the chance to vote for who should represent them?</p>
              <p>Mr. Kong then tactfully shifts the blame onto the opposition parties who, according to his line of argument, are unable to prove their mantle in the general elections by successfully fielding an opposition team comprising of 5 – 6 members in a GRC ward.</p>
              <p>But this is not even the issue of contention over here. The real debate centers on whether we should allow a team of politicians who might not have the mandate of its constituents to represent them politically in office.</p>
              <p>Should a group of 5 – 6 politicians who have only, say, 9% of total support in a GRC comprising of 60,000 people if a real vote is carried out, be allowed to represent them in the parliament just because there was no contest?</p>
              <p>Taking our line of argument, the politicians do not have the mandate of the people in the event of a walkover. The default position that we have assumed has not altered.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have been accused of been a politically apathetic lot. But can one really blame them if they played no role in the political process that elected their representatives of parliament?</p>
              <p>The GRC system serves to widen the distance between the constituents and those politically responsible to represent them, because the individuals running for political office were not elected on the basis of their constituents support in the first place.</p>
              <p>Simply ask any one person in a GRC ward which had a walkover to name all of their MPs.</p>
              <p>I am one of them and I am unable to name the entire team.</p>
              <p>This is solely because I had no chance to vote in the previous election, and I took no part in the political process in putting them in office.</p>
              <p>Surely my vote should not be assumed to be <em>for</em> the political nominees just because there was no contest?</p>
              <p>This is the default position that Mr. Kong takes in shifting the onus of proof onto the constituents.</p>
              <p>In his suggestion that opposition parties are not ready to field a team to contest a GRC ward, Mr. Kong neglects the fact that the GRC system can sometimes stymie the opposition parties efforts to do so.</p>
              <p>In making his ’singular declaration’ that the GRC system serves the ‘honorable and pragmatic thoughts’ of the People’s Action Party (PAP) to equally represent all races, Mr. Kong seems to have contradicted himself when he pushes for a reduction of the number of individuals comprising a GRC team, from 5-6 to 3-4.</p>
              <p>Would not such a reduction cause the races to be represented less equally, according to his argument?</p>
              <p>It is clear that something is very fundamentally wrong with Mr. Kong’s position.</p>
              <p>The GRC system is most certainly in need of a complete overhaul to account for the political rights of all Singaporeans to vote.</p>
              <p>And this right cannot be denied no matter the circumstance.</p>

              <p>Personally i find it very unfair on the way PAP treat us Singapore Citizens , take the rules of house renting for example:</p>
              <p>If the tenant rents the house &amp; commits any illegal acts which offends the law ( like illegal subletting or illegal booking etc.) the owner of the house will face forfeiture of house , they can just say we ( as the owner) didn't conduct checks , but if they are not going to change this law , they should be voted out as the tenant can say " Nevermind la , after all i rented this house , anything we do inside , we don't need to bear the responsibility , the landlord bears it  , if we're caught , we just go find another place to stay , what is so big deal?</p>
              <p>Of course the tenant will think its none their business as the do not need to held any responsibility or bear any consequences as the consequences is being beared ny the landlord , don't you find it ridiculous? You think landlord will ever want to rent a house to someone like this? Of course not!!! The landlord is innocent!!! The tenants are the ones that should be held responsible! Do you agree?</p>
