              <p>You seem dun understand what is HDB? it is not a private house like mine ok, HDB stand for House Don't Belong to you, only lease to you. So, you are actually renting from them, you are not the landlord like me, for HDB, govt is the landlord, they only give the name as leaser, and landlord is only a phrase to make you happy, but actually, you are the same as those foreigners renting from you. So govt being the landlord, you being the first rental and the foreigners being the second rental, who have the final said?? The govt ya, the lord of the Ring</p>

              <p>A fair government should be a fair mixture of Opposition and Government politicians. This is essential of democracy. Our president is a bit useless. To me i propose a form a governemnt like US. intro Upper house and Lower House. The prime minister turn should be 2 terms. After the 2 terms, there should not be position like SM or MM. They should step down and not enter parliament as MP. We are able to dissolve the government at any time and hold new elections. Singapore is really one party country which seem no opposition voice to speak up for us. GRC should be abolish and further more we do not need so many ministers.</p>
              <p>ISA and ISD should not touch on opposition politicians and jail them for no apparent reasons. Politics is always dirty. Being a opposition like SDP and WP is not an easy job. To me, i salute them as they are brave enluff and have the courage. A lot of citizen like us got the mouth to talk but reflect no actions.</p>
              <p>I am sure 1/2 of the singaporeans like just like grass. Wind blow where they follow.</p>

I am not saying PAP is completely bad, there are good things about PAP, at least the nation is run like a well oiled machine unlike the politically dominated government of Malaysia, run like pig-stail on wheels. But you have to make sure that PAP don't get too many seats and have 70% control. There needs to be checks and balances. The opposition needs to have a sizeable say in the government.</p></div>
