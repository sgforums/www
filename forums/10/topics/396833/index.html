Remember communist from china? this is not written in history books here is the way i put it.Communist have the support of workers from their own countries.British have been trying to put down communists,Mr LKY saw the chance,and told communist that they should take down the british together.And communist got the people to vote for PAP,PAP won,British gone,but communist? Oh,Drive them out,they are communist.Tada,you have THE PRIME MINISTER! But it is for the good of all anyways,look how our current minister mentor led singapore to be? Our good life,it is all because of his hard work and his genius brain,be thankful for what you are given people,you could be born in third world countries and be enslaved by slavers and the govt don't care/cannot do much about it? Even though we have a merciless education stystem,it brings out the BEST,think about it the other way,instead of whining about it,the govt devotes resources to give education for the people,how many chances are you given? People are DYING for these chances,you could say,we have a very fair government already</p></div>

              <p>Hmm,well politics are harsh,think about it,how the holy potato
              did Sir Mr LKY lead singapore to independence with the British so
              powerful? Remember communist from china? this is not written in
              history books here is the way i put it.Communist have the support
              of workers from their own countries.British have been trying to put
              down communists,Mr LKY saw the chance,and told communist that they
              should take down the british together.And communist got the people
              to vote for PAP,PAP won,British gone,but communist? Oh,Drive them
              out,they are communist.Tada,you have THE PRIME MINISTER! But it is
              for the good of all anyways,look how our current minister mentor
              led singapore to be? Our good life,it is all because of his hard
              work and his genius brain,be thankful for what you are given
              people,you could be born in third world countries and be enslaved
              by slavers and the govt don't care/cannot do much about it? Even
              though we have a merciless education stystem,it brings out the
              BEST,think about it the other way,instead of whining about it,the
              govt devotes resources to give education for the people,how many
              chances are you given? People are DYING for these chances,you could
              say,we have a very fair government already</p>

              <p>frankly speaking, everyone on the ruling regime work for themselves and the party.</p>
              <p>fairness can only be achieve when there are balance of power. be it in union, negotiating of contracts, arms deal, treaty etc.</p>
