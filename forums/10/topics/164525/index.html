Please remember that this was in 2002, when young people were dying at a very considerable rate from overdosing on the quality of heroin that was being brought into this country at the time.<br><br>3.We have a new demographic of dementia patients in Australia. Whilst the truly elderly are getting older before, fortunately, this terrible affliction strikes them, we now have people in their late 40s and early 50s moving into aged persons homes because they have fried their brains with the sorts of drugs that this man was trying to bring into our country. Consequently, I cannot support this motion.<br></div><div class="quote_body">I ask that my name be recorded as the sole objector to this motion.</div></blockquote></div>
