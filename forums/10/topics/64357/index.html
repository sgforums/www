And yes, a declining population is a very major problem which we must face. Hell in fact Germany's government is encouraging their citizens to get married and reproduce because of this issue. So what you are saying here is a very sweeping statement.They are just being concerned over an issue..But they are not forcing anybody to do it.Maturity, yes, our people needs to mature. I have been overseas and i have seen how singaporeans behave out there and it really sickens me. How the people behave is not the government's job. It is everybody's individual responsibility.Ultimately, such decisions are to be made by the individual. The government, whether communist, socialist or democracy cannot influece them.What they can do is to raise the issue.<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by Viper52:<br><strong><br><br>Rather the force-feeding us "Get married, have kids" exhortations <span style="font-style: italic;">ad nauseum</span> and making single or married-but-childless Singaporeans feel like they're less-than-worthy citizens<br><br></strong></div></blockquote><strong>In any case, this is your interpretation.
