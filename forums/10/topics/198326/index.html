            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by orwell76:</div><div class="quote_body">The poor are still very selective about their choice of profession.</div></blockquote>Selective -<br><br>If I have to spend 8 hours of my time working for $20 a day for 30 days = $600/month. If I only have myself to feed and I live in rented HDB 1 room flat. It would be passible. If there is a family to take care, this amount is not possible. I have to find another 8 hour job to work to make $1200 to support my family.<br><br>Foreign workers bunk in rented rooms with 5 other person.<br>They are playing on the exchange rate difference to bring wealth to their own family back in India/China. We make SingDollar and spend SingDollar. They make SingDollar and spend Rupee/Rupiah/Yuan. S$100 converted back to their currency is a lot to them over in their homeland. So $600 can be considered a large amount for them. They all have a goal that they would only suffer X number of years here working hard and then go back and start their business using the seed money they make over here. To start a business in their country is far easier than over in SG. In addition, they can go back after a couple of years and live in relative good life.<br><br>Therefore we cannot compare and the rich elites and whoever should not complain poorer Singaporeans are selective. If I have to spend that 8 hours working my butt off, then I better make sure that job pays for my labour and the chances of getting on a 2nd job after burning out at the first job would be really hell for anyone over long term. But if the poor decide to take 2 or 3 jobs to support their family -&gt; how many hours they get to spend with their family? Would the family be nelected and create social issues? Then it is a hypocritical message from LHL to talk about more family life. For SG poor people, there is no where to go, no light at the end of the tunnel. They will always be trapped in this situation of not making enough and struggling with the high cost of living created by the policies. In addition, they now have to fight with foreign workers for the same job who now drive the price of labour down further -&gt; which translates to the fact that they cannot ask for more salary as no employer would want them.<br><br>The current situation is just a game and full of B.S. created to the benefit of someone who hold absolute power.<br><br>Macroeconomics is interesting.</div>
