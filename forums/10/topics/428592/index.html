              <p>The recent developments in the opposition parties are refeshing ie more and better candidates are joining the opposition. With the latest the former principal private secretary Mr Tan Jee Say joining SDP, the PAP has to face former top civil servants who no longer agreed with the recent policies adopted by the PAP government.</p>
              <p>Will PAP allow its former MPs and Ministers and permanent secretaries to join the opposition to voice their disagreements with the recent policies adopted by the government for the betterment of Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Has the PM mis-calculated in the choosing of the current batch or mix of candidates and he did not expect the former top civil servants, scholarship holders, outstanding and successful individuals to join the opposition for the coming election and as a result many of current PAP candidates pale in comparison to these opposition candidates ?</p>

              <p>I think the real problem is that since PAP took over in 1959, PAP had deliberately created a repressive atmosphere in politics and depoliticised Singapore society which resulted in a lack of quality political leaders.</p>

              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">In a rare public interview in 1997 Radio Corporation of Singapore, Dr Toh passionately bemoaned the lack of idealism and creativity among the young and its implications for the future of Singapore. He said:<br><br></div>

              <p>If indeed the political atmosphere in repressive in Singapore, then the WP and Chiam must be part of PAP.  I salute people like Low TK, Sylvia Lim, Chiam...and the group of people who have been standing as opposition for years. If indeed singapore society is depoliticised, then the candidates, from all parties are now asking for a highly paid jobs, are they not politicians, with political ideas?</p>
              <p>As for "quality political leaders", I don't put you up in the position of leaders, earning the salary, and later then decide if you have the quality. You tell me if you have the quality to be a leader!!!</p>
              <p>Election battles are getting more and more interesting in Singapore, because there are more and more qualified people coming forward, and the ruling party is now less able to disqualified opposition with law suit or any other reasons.</p>
              <p>Let's do some credit to the oppositions, see some positive remarks about what they  can do now. Hammering the pap will not make the opposition any better. No matter how stinking the others are, it does not alter the fact that you are a piece of sh i t.</p>

              <p>I don't see anything wrong with Opposition defecting to PAP and vice versa.</p>
              <p>They are humans. They have the right to join the party which is of best interest to Singapore for the long run.</p>
              <p>LKY used to be under Progressive Party before he formed his own party. So are you saying it is an insult to LKY?</p>
              <p>Under what circumstances do you consider it an insult? Integrity towards Party or Nation.</p>
