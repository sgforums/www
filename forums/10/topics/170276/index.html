            <div class='col-md body'>NO loved ones rushed to his side at the Singapore General Hospital after a car hit the 70-year-old not far from his home.<br><br>Mr Lai Kem Pin (above) tidying Mr Chong's (below left) belongings, most of them discarded items which Mr Chong had picked up. --HEDY KHOO<br>No one cried for Mr Chong Shee Kian when he died from head injuries less than three hours later.<br><br>And no one has claimed his body after a week.<br><br>His roommate of 11 years, Mr Lai Kem Pin, 71, did not even know Mr Chong had died until this reporter informed him.<br><br>He said in Mandarin: 'The police woke me at 2am (on 14 Dec) and told me my roommate was in hospital. But I didn't know who they could call. They didn't say he was dead.'<br><br>Mr Lai thinks his roommate was a bachelor with no siblings. But he is not sure.<br><br>The two men did not talk much and had very different habits.<br><br>Mr Chong's meagre belongings of empty boxes, old shampoo bottles and items picked up from trash cans gave no clue to his background.<br><br>Like many older people, Mr Chong cherished his independence and did not reach out to others.<br><br>NOT REGISTERED<br><br>He did have his drinking buddies. Yet, none of them knew if he had any relatives who should be informed of his death.<br><br>Mr Chong was not registered with The Redhill Moral Seniors Activity Centre at Block 89. Those who register give information on their medical condition, next-of-kin and financial status.<br><br>Volunteers check on registered residents in Blocks 89 and 90 if they do not hear from them after two days.<br><br>Mr Chong sometimes left the flat by 9am to sell snacks by the roadside.<br><br>He would become a 'hawker' whenever he used up his $260 welfare money on cigarettes and beer before the month was up.<br><br>Other times, he would stay out the whole night after he had had too much to drink and returned home only in the morning.<br><br>Fifth-floor neighbour Ho Soh Har, who has helped clean Mr Chong's flat for five years, was stunned when he found out about his death.<br><br>'Maybe he was going to meet his friends for supper when the car hit him along Henderson Road,' said Mr Ho, 59, an odd job worker, in Mandarin.<br><br>He found Mr Chong 'strange' as he would bring back 'rubbish', like a broken pair of shoes or an almost empty tube of toothpaste.<br><br>And he would scold anyone who suggested throwing these items out.<br><br>But Mr Ho eventually made friends with him.<br><br>'He told me once he had a grandson whom he visited during Chinese New Year. He also said he belonged to a Zhang clan in Geylang that would take care of him if anything happened to him.'<br><br>However, a check with several branches of Zhang clans, including one in Geylang, showed they had no record of Mr Chong.<br><br>'If I had been around when the police came, I would have rushed to SGH in a taxi to see if he had any last instructions,' said Mr Ho.<br><br>'We'll wait 49 days, according to Chinese tradition, before throwing his things away if no one comes to claim them.'<br><br>Mr Chong's unclaimed body is now at the mortuary at the Health Sciences Authority.<br><br>Community organisations can arrange for unclaimed bodies to be buried or cremated. Doctors can also ask for them for research and teaching purposes under the Medical Act.<br><br>Call police<br><br>THE driver of the car is assisting the police in their investigations.<br><br>Mr Chong's next-of-kin can call the police hotline at 1800-2550000.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Many live alone<br><br>MR Chong Shee Kian was just one of Singapore's growing number of people aged 65 years and above who are on their own.<br><br>There were 15,300 of them five years ago, according to the 2000 census. The number is expected to rise with an ageing population and more people remaining single.<br><br>Elderly folks can join seniors' activity centres. Befriending services, home help or medical care are also available.<br><br>Neighbours can reach out to elderly people too, especially those who shy away from help<br></div>
