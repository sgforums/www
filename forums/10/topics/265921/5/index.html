I am afraid to say that so far I don't even see my MP doing this.  He is new and yet he can't be bothered to conduct house visit or do anything to build rapport with the people.  Problem with the ruling govt is they place themselves so high up there.  It is - whatever we decide and implement, you follow and better don't question.</div>

But no for singapore's future if MM pass away one day.  If my memory serve me right, he (MM)  or others from PAP said that even if MM were to go they are still capable of leading the country.
