If it is him, you go ask him to be nice to us, don't suka suka increase prices for this and that, ask him to be considerate.  As a PM, he should be putting his heart and soul to serve us with passion with unselfish attitude.  Politicians serve the nation.  Nation judge their performance.  People of the country is the boss of the PM.</div>
