It is just plain fact that he just doesnÂ’t have the sort of calibre and intelligence to manage to be the PM.  So we gotta swallow bitter pill for the fact that he is being paid super high salary.  No calibre, no intelligence to manage, passion to serve people and reaching down to the level of common people are questionable Â– base on all these he just donÂ’t seem to deserve $3.1m.  He is simply earning easy $$$.  Taxpayers work hard to pay him $3.1m, what a pain!!</div>

He is nothing outstanding; in fact he does not display the sort of qualities and ex-factor for a position as a PM.   May be it is because of his background.   His predecessors labour, and he is enjoying the fruit of their labour now.    He is the luckiest man in politics in Singapore.</div>

He has inherited quite a smooth-running system from his predecessors and has yet to really meet up with a serious crisis. In my opinion, crisis-handling is one of the hallmarks of whether a person is a good leader or not. Hence, it may be a genuine concern whether LHL would be capable of leading the country through a major crisis and emerge with credit.</div>
