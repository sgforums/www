If a government acquires lands for public housing at cheap prices like S$0.10 per square foot under the Land Acquisition Act for public housing how much is the land cost paid by HDB for every unit of 3-room or 4-room flat. Did HDB pay for such land costs with its own monies?<br><br>Is the government not elected to look after the citizens including providing basic low-cost housing, etc, If so with lands acquired at such low costs or near-zero costs for public housing is it morally or legally right for the government to sell the HDB flats to the people at market price or near market price.<br><br>If people make monies from the HDB flats is it wrong to do so?<br><br>Isn't taxes used for construction of low cost housing for the people precisely people's own monies and investments and assets and if people benefit from the provision of low-cost housing selling such flats at double or triple the original price any mistakes?<br><br>Why must any government be jealous or envious of its own people making monies from its own lands and assets.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the latest statement on TV tonight, Minister Khaw started to say that he has to introduce Means Test to stretch the tax dollar to avoid abuse and spread out subsidy to families that need it most.<br><br>He appears to have a change of heart about his early statement that means test was needed to prevent abuse. He did not show whether means test was needed because the original tax allocated for medical services (said to be 8% of total tax i.e. $6 bil all-in inclusive of land sale profits and capital gains and surplus incomes) has been exceeded due to such presumed abuses by rich patients.<br><br>So it appears that he must have only now realized that he should revealed whether original tax allocations for medical services (8% of $6 bil) have been exceeded by abuses of class "C" patients.<br><br>So he now has to issue daily statements and addendum to his earlier statements to make it look like the means test is now needed for more reasons like helping to stretch the medical tax allocations to benefit more people.<br><br>If original tax allocated at 8% is not exceeded why is it necessary or imperative to deprive tax payers of some deserving basic medical service for which people are paying tax rich or poor. Why cook up the abuse excuse or spreading of tax excuse to come up with another scheme which consequence might be more hoarding of taxes and less service to the citizens.<br><br>Citizens now are confused reading such reasons for introducing means tests.<br><br>They will never know whether means test was necessary because original tax allocations for medical services was not enough or is it enough but he only wanted to add values and stretch the medical allocations or prevent running out of allocated budgets.</div>
