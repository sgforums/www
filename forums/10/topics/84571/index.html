            <div class='col-md body'>There are lessons we can draw from this.A tale of national leaders gone amok in a control frenzy.We can certainly relate to this, especially from the fact that our "truths" are information fed to us for the last few decades, only till the present have we greater access to news from other POVs and are more able to formulate our own thoughts and opinions on issues that matter to us.However, when we become more enlightened, the starker the image we see of the reality...Pathetic.Who's to shoulder the blame?Go figure.<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>July 2, 2004<br>OP-ED COLUMNIST<br>Moore's Public Service<br>By PAUL KRUGMAN </strong><br><br>Since it opened, "Fahrenheit 9/11" has been a hit in both blue and red America, even at theaters close to military bases. Last Saturday, Dale Earnhardt Jr. took his Nascar crew to see it. The film's appeal to working-class Americans, who are the true victims of George Bush's policies, should give pause to its critics, especially the nervous liberals rushing to disassociate themselves from Michael Moore.<br><br>There has been much tut-tutting by pundits who complain that the movie, though it has yet to be caught in any major factual errors, uses association and innuendo to create false impressions. Many of these same pundits consider it bad form to make a big fuss about the Bush administration's use of association and innuendo to link the Iraq war to 9/11. Why hold a self-proclaimed polemicist to a higher standard than you hold the president of the United States?<br><br>And for all its flaws, "Fahrenheit 9/11" performs an essential service. It would be a better movie if it didn't promote a few unproven conspiracy theories, but those theories aren't the reason why millions of people who aren't die-hard Bush-haters are flocking to see it. These people see the film to learn true stories they should have heard elsewhere, but didn't. Mr. Moore may not be considered respectable, but his film is a hit because the respectable media haven't been doing their job.<br><br>For example, audiences are shocked by the now-famous seven minutes, when George Bush knew the nation was under attack but continued reading "My Pet Goat" with a group of children. Nobody had told them that the tales of Mr. Bush's decisiveness and bravery on that day were pure fiction.<br><br>Or consider the Bush family's ties to the Saudis. The film suggests that Mr. Bush and his good friend Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the ambassador known to the family as Bandar Bush, have tried to cover up the extent of Saudi involvement in terrorism. This may or may not be true. But what shocks people, I think, is the fact that nobody told them about this side of Mr. Bush's life.<br><br>Mr. Bush's carefully constructed persona is that of an all-American regular guy Â— not like his suspiciously cosmopolitan opponent, with his patrician air. The news media have cheerfully gone along with the pretense. How many stories have you seen contrasting John Kerry's upper-crusty vacation on Nantucket with Mr. Bush's down-home time at the ranch?<br><br>But the reality, revealed by Mr. Moore, is that Mr. Bush has always lived in a bubble of privilege. And his family, far from consisting of regular folks with deep roots in the heartland, is deeply enmeshed, financially and personally, with foreign elites Â— with the Saudis in particular.<br><br>Mr. Moore's greatest strength is a real empathy with working-class Americans that most journalists lack. Having stripped away Mr. Bush's common-man mask, he uses his film to make the case, in a way statistics never could, that Mr. Bush's policies favor a narrow elite at the expense of less fortunate Americans Â— sometimes, indeed, at the cost of their lives.<br><br>In a nation where the affluent rarely serve in the military, Mr. Moore follows Marine recruiters as they trawl the malls of depressed communities, where enlistment is the only way for young men and women to escape poverty. He shows corporate executives at a lavish conference on Iraq, nibbling on canapÃ©s and exulting over the profit opportunities, then shows the terrible price paid by the soldiers creating those opportunities.<br><br>The movie's moral core is a harrowing portrait of a grieving mother who encouraged her children to join the military because it was the only way they could pay for their education, and who lost her son in a war whose justification she no longer understands.<br><br>Viewers may come away from Mr. Moore's movie believing some things that probably aren't true. For example, the film talks a lot about Unocal's plans for a pipeline across Afghanistan, which I doubt had much impact on the course of the Afghan war. Someday, when the crisis of American democracy is over, I'll probably find myself berating Mr. Moore, who supported Ralph Nader in 2000, for his simplistic antiglobalization views.<br><br>But not now. "Fahrenheit 9/11" is a tendentious, flawed movie, but it tells essential truths about leaders who exploited a national tragedy for political gain, and the ordinary Americans who paid the price.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How about our very own Farenheit 8/9??<br>-----------<br><br>While the world awaits with bated breath the first ever post Sep 11 film which begins to question the politics involved in the annexation of Iraq ostensibly as an extension of the war against terror, Singaporeans should also wait with bated breath to see what happens after Aug 9.<br><br>The processes of placing our PM-elect onto the pinnacle of political power in Singapore is well into place. The swift economic recovery which has yet to be fully felt on the ground, reported day in day out by Straits Times, the confidence to restore top civil servants' pay coming in the back of wage austerity and restraint only fairly recently emphasised by the Minsta of Manpower late last year, points to an effort to make every one happy. The new PM will come into power with the bells of prosperity ringing nice and loud for the regional and international community. What about the Singaporeans? There is still people being retrenched, Singapore Pools just axed 20 staff, the property market is still barely alive, rents remain at an all-time low, office space take-up is still hardly any thing to cheer about.<br><br>Will we have our own Michael Moore to put into celluloid some of the very interesting contradictions alive in this entire political process? Or are all these issues only debated freely in cyberspace and always in a non official environment? Look at the White Horse issue, how it was always mentioned as a 'fact' in our private talks and discussions until it blew up in the public domain as how the gahment well and truly cocked up.<br><br>Well, one thing Farenheit 8/9 can boast will be its ability to look into next year's economic forecast and predict that doom will return once this sustained momentary boom is runs its course politically. Who is our Michael Moore? The heartland favourite Jack Neo or our enfant terrible Royston Tan?<br><br>Zhong Eh<br>18.06.04<br>thevoiddeck.org</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Royston Tan would have the backing of my whole two hands.I think he's more capable of turning this whole circus of ours into something the world will look at.His films have been to Cannes and I think if he is "touched", the world will take notice.Definitely.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yep. I think he definitely has a pulse for the Sg society.  Except for being abit carried away by his Wong Kar Wai stylo-mylo-ness, I think he will create something that can really show it as it is. Keepin it real.</div>
