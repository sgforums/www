              <p>Supposely the richer pays less tax to give back to the contry by means of more investments and opportunities. But in the past 10 yrs , the rich as been getting richer and the poor , poorer. middle class has not really moved much. Or just maybe its too early to tell.</p>

              <p>Trust a business owner to give workers more salary? How is that possible? Should ask around all the business owners, if they make more profits this year, will they give out the excess of all their profits to workers? Most of it ploughs back into reserves to expand his business. Only when bonuses are mandated, then they will comply.

              <p>Please. I wasn't even referrring to the 10% tax baby. You have
              missed the forest for the trees.</p>
              <p>If the poor fully utilise the $10,000 every year, a 10% tax will
              decrease their disposable income to $9,000. How do you suggest they
              pay their mortgage to HDB, their meals, their bus transport, their
              children's education?</p>
              <p>$10,000 might not mean alot to the rich, but $1,000 means alot
              to you if you only have just enough to make ends meet.</p>
              <p>It's not the genius fault that the handicapped and retard makes
              less, but what do you suggest we do? Leave him to his own devices?
              I thought we live in a humane society, obviously alot have given up
              compassion in the sake of making more money. They have become money
              faced like our Ministers.</p>
              <p>Yes, I am willing to take a 50% tax rate, provided all my taxes
              are used to fund social programmes for the less privilege of
              society and not the Ministerial salaries.</p>
              <p>That's why the tax rate is progressive. If you make below
              $20,000 there is not tax, then I think $10,000 above is taxed at
              afew percent. As you make more the level changes and you get taxed
              for the amount that is above the earlier bracket.</p>

              <p>Can you go and read focal's post first ?? Geesh !</p>
              <p>If you keep increasing the tax rate of the rich, you will eventually get to a point when the net income will not be very far off from each.</p>
              <p>Look, I used to think like you. When I was really poor.</p>
              <p>I want the rich to pay for my welfare, I want the rich to pay for my everything. And no I don't want to pay for shyt. Why ? Because I am poor, and so I am under priviledged.</p>
              <p>Now that I worked my way up the income scale.. you think I care to give away a big chunk of my hard earned money to someone just to close the income gap ?</p>
              <p>It's all relative.</p>
              <p>But like I said, the welfare system needs to be set up to support the needy. Without overly penalizing the rich.</p>
              <p>Like my friend who is a Canadian, he left his country to go work somewhere else because he can no longer tolerate the high income tax rate in Canada.</p>
              <p>This is real life, this is how it works. There's no running away from it.</p>

              <p><br>That's because our tax system from a top bracket of 40% has been reduced to 20% in the past few decades.</p>
              <p>The taxes collected by the government goes into state coffers and failed investments, not directly into developments to improve the citizens. What kind of welfare do we have here?</p>
              <p>More investments doesn't mean more pay for the poor, it just means more opportunities to employ more PRC because our labour force is limited.</p>
              <p>Trust a business owner to give workers more salary? How is that possible? Should ask around all the business owners, if they make more profits this year, will they give out the excess of all their profits to workers? Most of it ploughs back into reserves to expand his business. Only when bonuses are mandated, then they will comply. Like the recent request by government that businesses give out inflation bonus, only 20 companies comply and I am wonder out of this 20, how many are government related companies.</p>

              <p>I once argued with this Australian business graduate who told me that his professor has less disposable income after tax than his assistant who is paid less.

              <p><br>Obviously you never heard of diminishing marginal utility of income.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Few generalizations in the social sciences enjoy such wide-ranging support as that of diminishing marginal utility of income. Put simply, this proposition states that the effect on subjective well-being of a $1,000 increase in real income becomes progressively smaller the higher the initial level of income. As the quotations above attest, distinguished scholars in psychology, sociology, economics, and political science who have made major contributions to the study of subjective well-being concur on this assertion. </span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Its policy appeal is great, because it implies that raising the income of poor people or poor countries will raise their well being considerably, while an increase of <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">equal amount for the rich will have comparatively little effect (see, for example, the last two quotations above and Garhammer 2002, 219).</span></span></em></span></p>

              <p>If you keep increasing the tax rate of the rich, you will eventually get to a point when the net income will not be very far off from each.</p>
              <p>Look, I used to think like you. When I was really poor.</p>
              <p>I want the rich to pay for my welfare, I want the rich to pay for my everything. And no I don't want to pay for shyt. Why ? Because I am poor, and so I am under priviledged.</p>
              <p>Now that I worked my way up the income scale.. you think I care to give away a big chunk of my hard earned money to someone just to close the income gap ?</p>
              <p>It's all relative.</p>
              <p>But like I said, the welfare system needs to be set up to support the needy. Without overly penalizing the rich.</p>
              <p>Like my friend who is a Canadian, he left his country to go work somewhere else because he can no longer tolerate the high income tax rate in Canada.</p>

              <p>Types of taxes</p>
              <p>I prefer a system of taxation where more revenue is collected from income tax. Those who earn more, pay more tax.</p>
              <p>In recent years, there has been a move to shift taxation from income tax to consumption tax, which is known as goods and services tax (GST) in Singapore. GST has increased the cost of living for everyone and has hit the lower income people hardest.</p>
              <p>I hope that the GST will not be increased further from the current level. If possible, it should be reduced to 5 percent or lower. If more tax revenue is required, it can be collected from income tax, property tax and other sources.</p>
              <p>Conclusion</p>
              <p>Our past economic strategy has contributed to the economic success of Singapore. They have also contributed to social problems. Some of these problems have not been understood or analysed.</p>
              <p>I believe that a system of higher corporate and income taxes, and lower consumption tax (i.e. GST) may be more beneficial to citizens and permanent residents living in Singapore.</p>
              <p>We also need to review the current policy on “means testing” and also the manner of distributing budget surpluses based on type of housing. I prefer a system of equal access to the social benefits. I hope that these issues can now be considered.</p>

Many still think that a return of Suharto, Marcos and Saddam Hussein will solve their ills. No matter how bad a dictatorship is, it will still benefit certain segments of the population. Like the policies of Saddam in Iraq where he marginalised the Shi'ite, cause genocide amongst the Kurds, while elevating the Sunnis.</p>

              <p>Actually LKY may be right about western styled democracy not
