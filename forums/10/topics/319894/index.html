              <p>Such a statement only reflects the in-born nature of this man.<br> <br> He was probably born with a suspicious nature perceiving all
              fellow citizens as negative, lawless, disorderly and potential trouble
              makers. By regarding all citizens negatively, at the end it becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy.<br> <br> Just look at all the laws passed from the early days of his career and we can better understand his negative perception of his people.<br> <br>Based on such negative outlook or perception, he passed all sorts of law to deprive freedom of expressions, control of newspaper media, prohibit public assembly of 5 persons even for not non-political civil
              purposes, Professions like the legal profession are tightly controlled. There is a heavy presumptuous Ipower of arrest of any one suspected of threat to government under the SA laws. Election processes were bent to prevent anyone from standing freely for elections and civil defamation laws twisted for persecution of political oppositions.<br> <br> Government over-taxes the people both in direct as well as indirect and
              over-charges on basic necessities from medicare to housing and sets up
              all sorts of GLCs to profiteer while hoarding tax monies for his own
              glory and other hidden agenda.<br> <br> Unions are tamed, Workers are controlled and kept as slaves.<br> <br>Despite such controls citizens are not cooperating or loyal, Thousands have migrated to seek refuge from such oppressions or better opportunities elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Controls beget controls so gradually controls justify need for more controls ad nausem.<br> <br> Such controls up to a certain points require even harder and sterner
              controls leading to controls for the sake of controls and runaway of
              control now.<br> <br> More laws and regulations have to be put up for additional controls to control any loopholes to prevent disarray.<br> <br> What is the alternative to controls? Think out of the box and stop
              assuming citizens are potential enemies to be controlled or punished
              and let people look after certain behavioral problems.<br> <br> People can govern themselves without so much government interventions or interferences by laws.<br> <br> Look at an average family behavior. The more a parent tries to
              discipline his or her children with punishments based on over-tight
              controls or criticisms the more the children end up as rebellious and
              uncooperative.<br> <br> Now how are we to build a more cooperative and cohesive society with so
              much controls and curbs on their basic freedoms. Even participating in
              internet forums are heavily intervened with so much loud and rowdy
              counter-insurgency threats and name-calling of all kinds by gazelle or
              point_blank.<br> <br> Will this kind of human nature succeed in building a competitive and
              vibrant society with so much controls and deprivations going on for
              years to no end. <br> <br> Does he know that many successful Fortune 500 companies of which Singapore has not yet produce many yet are better run than such control model?</p>
              <p>So he needs to know a bigger world exists outside his little red dot and there are many better and greater solutions to our type of control freakish dictatorship.<br> <br> Does he know he has lost controls of his bureaucracy as demonstrated in Mas Selamat despite his famous legalistic control methodology ? <br> <br> With such records what right has he to advice the Russians that the Western democracy promoting liberties is not the only solution implying his control freakish dictatorship is more successful? Why? <br> <br> If he truly hopes to convince others of his own superiority he ought to examine the reactions of his own fellow citizens and how they prefer to regard him in the internet and coffee shops.</p>
              <p>With such general widespread unhappiness one wonders how is he going to back up his advice with facts from his own turfs.</p>
              <p><br> He probably needs to consult a psychologist to gain a more greater insightful understand why while he keeps
              trying to control people ad nausem yet he is not producing any unity,
              loyalty, cooperations or cohesiveness among his own people.</p>

              <p><strong>Giving equal access to social benefits<br>4 June 2008<br>Tan Kin Lian</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A Government needs to collect sufficient tax to pay the expenses of running the country and to provide the social benefits to its citizens.</p>
              <p>The tax should be collected fairly from the citizens. Those with higher incomes should pay more tax. A high income earner should pay more tax willingly. It is better to earn more and pay more tax, rather than be in the opposite situation.</p>
              <p>After paying a higher amount of tax, the high income earner should be entitled to the same social benefits as other citizens. They do not expect to receive more social benefits, but they should not be given less.</p>
              <p>Subsidised Healthcare</p>
              <p>I am against means testing for subsidized health care. I believe that all citizens should be entitled to education, safety, security and the other benefits of living in Singapore, including access to subsidized health care.</p>
              <p>We should avoid the requirement for people to provide proof and be labeled as “poor” in order to receive subsidized health care. It is best that this type of classification be avoided.</p>
              <p>Type of Housing</p>
              <p>The Government now distributes budget surpluses to the citizens in some years, based on income tax level or type of housing.</p>
              <p>I prefer the distribution to be made equally to all citizens or be based on objective criteria such as age or number of members in the family.</p>
              <p>There is some inequity in distributing the benefits based on type of housing. Some retirees have little or no income, but live in private properties bought at a low price many years ago. Some live in the private property as tenants, not owners. These people are not as well-off as the owners.</p>
              <p>We also have the cases where the residents of HDB flats own expensive cars and are quite wealthy. They enjoy the higher payouts based on their type of housing.</p>
              <p>It may be argued by the proponents of the current method of distribution that the percentage of odd cases (i.e. those who receive more or less than they should be entitled to) is small. Nonetheless, it is better to avoid this anomaly entirely.</p>
              <p>Types of taxes</p>
              <p>I prefer a system of taxation where more revenue is collected from income tax. Those who earn more, pay more tax.</p>
              <p>In recent years, there has been a move to shift taxation from income tax to consumption tax, which is known as goods and services tax (GST) in Singapore. GST has increased the cost of living for everyone and has hit the lower income people hardest.</p>
              <p>I hope that the GST will not be increased further from the current level. If possible, it should be reduced to 5 percent or lower. If more tax revenue is required, it can be collected from income tax, property tax and other sources.</p>
              <p>Minimum Wage</p>
              <p>I recent years, the low wage earners in Singapore are hit hard from two sources – lower wages due to competition from the influx of foreign workers and a higher cost of living.</p>
              <p>It is time for us to consider the need for all workers to be given a minimum wage that will allow them to earn enough for a hard day’s work to maintain a basic standard of living for the family. The same minimum wage can apply for foreign workers, but as the foreign worker’s levy is deducted, their net wage will be lower.</p>
              <p>A minimum wage will raise the operating cost for some businesses. The business can still be made competitive through lower rents, levies and a lower profit margin (but still attractive to the investor). If wages are raised to the minimum, it is likely that there is less demand for business premises. This will lead to lower rentals that will offset the higher wages.</p>
              <p>Foreign Investments</p>
              <p>The low corporate tax strategy is aimed at attracting foreign investments into Singapore. We should examine some of its negative impact.</p>
              <p>I observe that some foreign investors set up businesses in Singapore but depend heavily on low cost foreign workers. These businesses create few jobs for Singaporeans. They create a high social cost – depressed wages of local workers, congestion in housing and public transport and changes to the social fabric.</p>
              <p>We have also attracted many wealthy foreigners to bring large sums of money into Singapore. They increase the prices of private property to levels that are not affordable to most citizens.</p>
              <p>Low interest rate</p>
              <p>Even the money brought into Singapore by foreign investors has a negative impact on Singaporeans. They cause interest rate to be at a low level, among the lowest in the world. The low interest rate means less interest income on the savings of Singaporeans, especially the retired persons. The low interest rate makes it difficult for them to have a sufficient income to meet the cost of living.</p>
              <p>Conclusion</p>
              <p>Our past economic strategy has contributed to the economic success of Singapore. They have also contributed to social problems. Some of these problems have not been understood or analysed.</p>
              <p>I believe that a system of higher corporate and income taxes, and lower consumption tax (i.e. GST) may be more beneficial to citizens and permanent residents living in Singapore.</p>
              <p>We also need to review the current policy on “means testing” and also the manner of distributing budget surpluses based on type of housing. I prefer a system of equal access to the social benefits. I hope that these issues can now be considered.</p>

              <p>I also heard him say on the news that there are widespread corruption in China and Vietnam as they progress towards capitalism. What has brought about this corruption? The vesting of powers in a single dominant figure. In auditing, fraud and corruption is highly probable if too much powers rested in one individual (Director), that's why there are different individual heads CFO, CIO and CMO. With the saggregation of duties, corruption is still possible with collusion, but there would be more mouths to gag. Provided all your department heads are independent and not being controlled like our MM. In the words of Francis Seow, "they are all scared of him....it's just pathetic....they hold him in awe".</p>

              <p>The tax should be collected <strong>fairly</strong> from the citizens. Those with
                                      higher incomes should pay more tax. A high income earner should pay
                                      more tax willingly. It is better to earn more and pay more tax,
                                      rather than be in the opposite situation.</p>
              <p>After paying a higher amount of tax, the high income earner
                                      should be entitled to the same social benefits as other citizens.
                                      They do not expect to receive more social benefits, but they should
                                      not be given less."</p>

              <p>In which here it states fair tax collection.</p>
              <p>"</p>
              <p>The tax should be collected <strong>fairly</strong> from the citizens. Those with higher incomes should pay more tax. A high income earner should pay more tax willingly. It is better to earn more and pay more tax, rather than be in the opposite situation.</p>
              <p>After paying a higher amount of tax, the high income earner should be entitled to the same social benefits as other citizens. They do not expect to receive more social benefits, but they should not be given less."</p>
              <p>A progressive tax is not a FAIR tax structure.</p>

              <p>Then how do you suggest we make it fair? Take $45,000 and give it to the intellectually challenged? Isn't this the same with the other advanced country model of income redistribution? Or we just ignore this unfair distribution and proceed to tax both at 10%? Let the poor, retarded and the old fend for themselves, if they can't survive it's their business.</p>

              <p>Supposely the richer pays less tax to give back to the contry by means of more investments and opportunities. But in the past 10 yrs , the rich as been getting richer and the poor , poorer. middle class has not really moved much. Or just maybe its too early to tell.</p>
              <p>Anyways i still believe in less tax for the rich. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>Please. I wasn't even referrring to the 10% tax baby. You have missed the forest for the trees.</p>
              <p>If the poor fully utilise the $10,000 every year, a 10% tax will decrease their disposable income to $9,000. How do you suggest they pay their mortgage to HDB, their meals, their bus transport, their children's education?</p>
              <p>$10,000 might not mean alot to the rich, but $1,000 means alot to you if you only have just enough to make ends meet.</p>
              <p>It's not the genius fault that the handicapped and retard makes less, but what do you suggest we do? Leave him to his own devices? I thought we live in a humane society, obviously alot have given up compassion in the sake of making more money. They have become money faced like our Ministers.</p>
              <p>Yes, I am willing to take a 50% tax rate, provided all my taxes are used to fund social programmes for the less privilege of society and not the Ministerial salaries.</p>
              <p>That's why the tax rate is progressive. If you make below $20,000 there is not tax, then I think $10,000 above is taxed at afew percent. As you make more the level changes and you get taxed for the amount that is above the earlier bracket.</p>
