              <strong>May I humbly suggest that for laymen with little policy experience, pls DO NOT START OFF THINKING LIKE published ECONOMIST in order to first build oneself a good, organic foundation in the study of economics/ politics etc.</strong><br>I.e. DO NOT THINK ABOUT INFLATION/ DEFLATION as published economist think but in terms of how the poor man on the street thinks.<br>E.g. <br>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">public school/ uni education</span> is Singapore is heavily subsidised (price DEFLATED): this is akin to deflating the price of education so more children can have a good (INFLATED) shot at doing well in life.<br>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cigarette</span> prices are legislatively INFLATED as a means to preserve health and as a claw back mechanism since smokers are expected to contribute less income taxes (retire early(Ill health/ stroke)), stay in hospital more (heart attack, diabetes etc)/ DEFLATE the future burden of ill health through a DEFLATED % of active smokers.<br>- cost of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">owning a private car</span> for in Singapore is legislatively INFLATED (COE, ERP, ARF, petrol tax, road tax, parking fees etc) to recognise the premium nature of private transport and to DEFLATE the number of road congestion causing cars around.<br>-<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Bus fare/ public transport prices</span> are DEFLATED with the S$1.1 bus service enhancement programme (BSEP) to improve commuter experience so that fewer will depend on private car/ taxi transport and thus DEFLATE overall frequency of road congestion etc.<br>-<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Hospital medical care </span>prices are DEFLATED with INFLATED subsidies for C class wards to help less educated/ poorer Singaporeans cope with increasing healthcare costs over the years etc.<br>- access to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dangerous addictive/hullicinogenic drugs</span> (LSD, heroin etc) is DEFLATED with legislatively INFLATED trafficking penalties such as the mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking etc.<br>-------------------------------<br><br>The reason for Japan's economic stagnation AFAIK is because of its growth bubble &gt;20 yrs ago when greed drove its property prices shot through the roof resulting in widespread demoralisation of society if not an increased rich-poor divide (people who rent become demoralised and prefer to sleep on streets than work to pay escalating rentals).<br>General inflation favours those who are sly/smart enough to take advantage of it and disadvantages those who just sit on their pile of cash without being aware what inflation is doing to it.<br><strong>Investment bankers LOVE INFLATION because it allows them MORE REASON to gamble with depositors $$$: these folks thrive on instability</strong>: e.g. merger/ acquisition jobs, selling unit trusts, trading I'm futures/ other derivatives etc etc. In the short term, there is increased economic activity since people hand their savings to bankers to invest out of fear of erosion due to inflation, however, in the long term, there might be severe repercussions if the investment is not in socially benificial growth but in unjustified asset price increase/ Potemkin investments like Japan had been in 1990s: only serving to frighten away investors due to stratospheric rental costs: a consequence of inflated (property) asset prices and even larger population of urban poor having squandered their savings on unwise/ reckless investment (as advised by greedy investment bankers that is).<br><br>It remains a pity that most Japanese do not have a good understanding of God that mainly comes from the study of Abrahamic religion/ similar and currently consider Shinzo Abe their god and leader (like their emperor in WW2): only time will tell when they will have to find a new god since Abe will surely fail given to the weakness of his structural reforms (if any is to be seen at all): again aggravating the wealth divide which adds to societal problems etc.<br><br>So it is better to first look at the items being considered and how the regulation of such prices improves or degrades society rather than using the terms "inflation/ deflation" closely (and recklessly) as economist ought to do because a majority of economists employed/ paid by political parties are there only to give support to a political agenda, paid to justify a private political interest with little concern for the small man in the street.<br><br><strong>Only honestly thinking people can/ deserve to demand accountability from dishonest politicians. Thus the need to think of inflation/ deflation in simple, honest, itemised (organic) terms, based upon how it affects the poor man in the street.</strong><br>Inflation in the access to good through subsidies to 'good' (legislative price deflation) and <br>Deflation in access to what is evil/ harmful (increases in tobacco tax etc) through inflated prices discouraging access to the tobacco drug.<br><br>This is how inflation / deflation should be seen. People on the ground should learn this to demand accountability from economist and politicians hiding in their ivory towers with the golden question: is the quality of life of poor individual IMPROVING OR DETERIORATING. That is much more important than pie in the sky definitions of 'inflation'/ 'deflation' when the basket of good in respect of such pronouncements is yet publicly defined let alone agreed upon.<br><br>Communism was one eminent economic theory/ system of thought, yet time revealed its ponzi elements: revolutionaries: mainly stressed-out trouble makers who stole power by promising the moon if not the sun, only to follow the tyrannical ways of whom they overthrew once themselves gained power. Abenomics will follow somewhat in this shadow, given the vagueness of 'structural reforms' that Mr Shinzo Abe promises, which untill now seems to only benefit the rich, making Mr Abe very likely to be voted out due to his neglect of the very poor he ought to uplift.</div>

              <p> ...Such changes of prices, either inflationary or 
              deflationary, have been major forces in history for the last six 
              centuries at least.</p>
              <p>Over that long period, their power to modify men's 
              lives and human history has been increasing. This has been reflected in 
              two ways.</p>
              <p>On the one hand,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> rises in prices have generally encouraged 
              increased economic activity, especially the production of goods,</span></span> while, 
              on the other hand, price changes have served to redistribute wealth 
              within the economic system.</p>
              <p>Inflation, especially a slow steady rise in 
              prices, encourages producers, because it means that they can commit 
              themselves to costs of production on one price level and then, later, 
              offer the finished product for sale at a somewhat higher price level. 
              This situation encourages production because it gives confidence of an 
              almost certain profit margin.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">production is 
              discouraged in a period of falling prices</span></span>, unless the producer is in the
               very unusual situation where his costs are falling more rapidly than 
              the prices of his product...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>..<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>.Rising prices benefit debtors and injure creditors, while falling 
              prices do the opposite.</strong></span> A debtor called upon to pay a debt at a time 
              when prices are higher than when he contracted the debt must yield up 
              less goods and services than he obtained at the earlier date, on a lower
               price level when he borrowed the money.</p>
              <p>A creditor, such as a bank, 
              which has lent money—equivalent to a certain quantity of goods and 
              services—on one price level, gets back the same amount of money—but a 
              smaller quantity of goods and services—when repayment comes at a higher 
              price level, because the money repaid is then less valuable.</p>
              <p>This is why
               bankers, as creditors in money terms, have been obsessed with 
              maintaining the value of money, although the reason they have 
              traditionally given for this obsession—that "sound money" maintains 
              "business confidence"—has been propagandist rather than accurate...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>...<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Another paradox of banking practice arose from the fact that 
              bankers, who loved deflation</strong></span></span>, often acted in an inflationary fashion 
              from their eagerness to lend money at interest. Since they make money 
              out of loans, they are eager to increase the amounts of bank credit on 
              loan....</p>

              <p>Think your start is right but your conclusion wrong/ less significant.</p>
              <p>Interest rates in excess of inflationary rates means more work for bankers e.g. higher targets to hit for unit trusts, less people making risky investments (less bankers commission to earn) etc etc.</p>
              <p>===   xxxx. ====</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bankers being the 2nd most dispicible 'professionals around town (the worst are those who teach/preach FALSE religion), LOVE  to have their cake and eat it too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In short they love inflation since it creates FEAR in people who are then more likely to take loans from them/ give banks M&amp;A jobs etc/ invest $$$ like ants running around on a hot pan: good for short term GDP numbers but fatal for the future development of a country (politicians with greased palms are too stupid to know this). </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Higher interest rates make it slightly more difficult to do bank business since the cost of borrowing also increases but ultimately, inflation is best for bankers since it also means that it is easier to repay borrowed $$$ since inflation makes cash less valuable over time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only problem is that inflation makes the poor and retirees poorer over time and widens the wealth divide, however, by then, most bankers would have already bought their paradise islands and far from the societies that they destroyed. Fortunately, God created venenomous snakes, and bankers being human, can die of venemous snake bites too...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So main thing is high inflation: bankers LOVE inflation as a tyre repair workshop owner LOVES punctured tyres...</p>
