Anyways, we have so many hypocrites all over.<br>I don't think the highly ed are any where better than the common street people on recognising the facts. I know many like the ivory tower and would abdicate decision making to these so call govt. Most people are too lazy to think, too apathic to care and too scared to question. We take so much for granted. rude shock indeed. I had a rude shock when I hear the many things that happen elsewhere fro friends and colleagues. I know we are "safe" right now but I am wondering about the life lessons we are deprived of so as to become better people. And I had come to realised that local Singaporeans are going to lose in this race. Its going to be at a terrible cost to the people.<br><br>We have a problem here!
