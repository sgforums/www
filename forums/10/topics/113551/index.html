            <div class='col-md body'>AT 27, what credentials does Eunice have? Can she think and rationalise in a logical and mature manner and grasp the depth of economic, social and political issues at hand? It is very easy for anyone to stand up to say that we need youths to do more blah blah blah, but how? Nothing concrete was mooted.<br>I seriously doubt her credibility as an MP - she is too inexperienced and has eaten less salt than other NMPs. She is no match for Dr Geh Min's eloquence and incisive speech about the right of citizens for information.<br>I wonder if Eunice had considered the sacrifices that she would have to make as an NMP. Her job as an entertainer means that she will have concert engagements both locally and overseas. Will she give the same excuse for each Parliament sitting?<br>There are so many more credible and experienced people in both the government and private sectors to fill the post of NMP. Why choose Eunice in the first place? Perhaps it is to project the image that the government does take youths seriously and that it is never too early to enter politics. Is there really such a dearth of potential political talent out there that Parliament has to choose Eunice?</div>

The NMPs are politically non-partisan; they do not belong to any political party. They can therefore give voice in Parliament to dissenting views and views of the protest voters, those who are unhappy with the Government over certain policies but want the PAP to form the Government. Many such voters do not identify themselves with the Opposition even though they do not think that PAP MPs can speak out convincingly enough on their behalf. The scheme also caters to people who for legitimate reasons are not able to stand for election as MPs, but who can make valuable contributions in public policy debates. NMPs can fulfill a useful role in Parliament and it will not be in our national interest to do away with the scheme. The NMPs are not paid an allowance but an honorarium of about $1,500 pm.<br><br>Miss Seow Soh Keng<br>Senior Mangager<br>Prime Minister?s Office<br>Tel: 68356634<br>E-mail address: seow_soh_keng@pmo.gov.sg<br><br>so it's not true NMP do not receive any money</div>

The NMPs are politically non-partisan; they do not belong to any political party. They can therefore give voice in Parliament to dissenting views and views of the protest voters, those who are unhappy with the Government over certain policies but want the PAP to form the Government. Many such voters do not identify themselves with the Opposition even though they do not think that PAP MPs can speak out convincingly enough on their behalf.
