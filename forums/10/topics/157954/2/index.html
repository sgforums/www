            <div class='col-md body'>This is for the benefit of those who don't subscribe to ST:<br><br>Straits Times Interactive<br>Oct 22, 2005<br>Finances, not freedom, worried Warwick University<br>By Sandra Davie and Ho Ai Li<br><br>IT WAS money, not a feared deficit of academic freedom, that scuttled Warwick University's hopes of setting up a campus here.<br><br>The British university finally broke its silence on its aborted plan yesterday and suggested that much of the opposition by its academics was centred on the proposed 'governance and financial structures' for the second campus.<br><br>Warwick spokesman Peter Dunn would not elaborate on what exactly these sticking points were, only that the concern over academic freedom was just one and not the 'key' issue in the final decision.<br><br>'If it was, would we be talking further to EDB?' he asked, referring to the Economic Development Board, stressing that the 'deal is by no means over yet'.<br><br>He said the Warwick management will be in Singapore next week to meet EDB officers, to work out 'Plan B', but stopped short of giving further details.<br><br>'Plan A did not have the backing of the academics, so we are putting together Plan B.'<br><br>In a statement, Warwick vice-chancellor David VandeLinde said the university firmly believes that Asia is key to any international vision for Warwick. And its culture and geography make Singapore an ideal setting for Warwick's key Asian presence.<br><br>'The university also feels that it is unlikely to receive a better invitation to raise its international profile,' he said.<br><br>Expensive plan<br><br>NO DOUBT, Warwick's Singapore proposal is ambitious and would be expensive.<br><br>Earlier reports estimated that the campus for 10,000 students would cost Â£85 million (S$257 million).<br><br>Of this amount, the EDB would put in Â£10 million of grant money and a Â£37.75 million loan, and the shortfall would come from Warwick.<br><br>More recent estimates are higher.<br><br>In a feasibility study released early this month, building costs are put at around Â£152 million over three phases, with facilities such as libraries and computers costing another Â£130 million. This excludes research funding.<br><br>The report did not say how much EDB was prepared to fund, but suggested that it was 'unacceptable'.<br><br>The economics of the deal led many Warwick academics to conclude that the Singapore venture would be a risky one, fraught with implications for the university's reputation if it failed to achieve an impressive footprint here.<br><br>This concern was also coupled with fears that Warwick may end up stretching itself too thin at home base.<br><br>It was thus argued that it would be better off husbanding its resources entirely for the British campus.<br><br>Some of the Warwick professors who went on the record said as much.<br><br>Professor Malcolm McCrae said he did not doubt that for some of his colleagues, the issue of academic freedom was important.<br><br>But it was not his perception, he said, 'that issues around the question of academic freedom were the main reason'.<br><br>Apparently, Warwick did try to convey its doubts over the commercial viability of the second campus to the EDB.<br><br>But according to Prof McCrae, in the end, 'the reassurances that were provided by the Singapore end...were just not sufficient to tip the risk versus benefit equation'.<br><br>His colleague in the economics department, Prof Andrew Oswald, agreed that academic freedom was only one of many considerations.<br><br>To him, the main dilemma was whether Warwick should concentrate on being a world-class research university in just one location.<br><br>'International students should come to our site, not the other way around,' he said.<br></div>

Many staff are opposed to the plans over the financial risk involved, worries over academic freedom and a perceived threat to Warwick's reputation.<br><br>A full feasibility study, the cost of which went over-budget by 100 percent to Â£800,000, had reported that <strong>the venture would be financially viable but gave no guarantees on academic freedom or human rights.</strong><br><br>A confidential University letter sent last week, obtained by the Boar, reveals a last gasp attempt to obtain concessions from the Singapore government on the lingering question of academic freedom......"<br><br>(http://www.warwickboar.co.uk/boar/news/singapore_dream_hangs_in_balance_as_staff_vote/)<br><br>Who's right?
