Although the vote is non-binding, it is likely to put pressure on the university council to abandon the Singapore plan when it makes a final decision on October 18.<br><br>Warwick and Australia's University of New South Wales are the only two foreign universities selected by Singapore's Economic Development Board to set up a full-scale campus.<br><br>The city-state has succeeded in attracting smaller schools operated by several top institutions, including Insead and the University of Chicago Graduate Business School, in an effort to triple the number of university students to 150,000 in the next decade.<br><br>The Warwick vote came as the outgoing US ambassador to Singapore warned in a farewell speech that Singapore's limits on expression might cause the government to “pay an increasing price for not allowing full participation of its citizens”.<br><br>Faculty and students at Warwick have questioned the costs of the nearly Â£300m ($525m) project and the university's ability to attract quality students and staff to the Singapore campus. But much of the criticism has focused on limits on academic freedom and civil liberties, including curbs on gay rights and high execution rates for criminals.<br><br>Warwick recently sent a letter to EDB asking that its students in Singapore be exempt from strict laws limiting freedom of assembly, speech and the press, and the removal of bans on homosexuality and certain religious practices on campus.<br><br>It also sought guarantees that staff and students would not be punished by the Singapore government for making academic-related comments that might be seen “as being outside the boundaries of political debate”. EDB said it would not comment.<br><br>The demand that the Singapore campus enjoy the same degree of academic freedom as in the UK came in response to an advisory report by Thio Li-ann, a law professor at the National University of Singapore, which said freedom of “speech is permissible as long as it does not threaten real political change or to alter the status quo”.<br><br>She warned that “the government will intervene if academic reports cast a negative light on their policies” but said the presence of Warwick in Singapore could “serve as an impetus for continued liberalisation”.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Any Warwick graduates here? can tell us what is Warwick good at? engineering, business, IT, or in some humanity subjects, or what?<br><br>My boss was from University of Chicago and through him I came to know of the big and strong network among the top american business graduates, who are expats working in singapore and many are graduates from the University of Chicago Graduate Business School (UCBC). The success of the UCBC in singapore is greatly enhanced because of its connection with the local business community. This benefits the graduates from the singapore campus a lot.<br><br>Insead is one of the most prestigeous european business school with campus in Philidelphia and Singapore. Certainly Insead give singapore students a choice to study European managment and the international network of insead graduates is certainly a great plus.<br><br>So what is warwick, even among the brits, are they anything comparable to cambridge or oxford, or u of london?? or just another UK university?  Time for warwick graduates here to speak out!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I find the demand by Warwick rather amusing, " its students in Singapore be exempt from strict laws limiting freedom of assembly, speech and the press, and the removal of bans on homosexuality and certain religious practices on campus. " Exactly what kind of education do they intend to bring for the benefits of singapore? The word "Liberal" alone is too broad a term to justify anything here, given the diversities in races, religions and the Asian cultures, confined within a physically very small Singapore.<br><br>Unless they have anything special to offer, I certainly do not want a bunch of foreign idiots here in singapore thinking they are more superior than average singaporean (morally they are certainly not, IMO), and they will come as "FT", wont they?<br><br>I won't loose my sleep because of warwick.<br><br>I wonder why EDB invite warwick.

Anybody who has lived overseas for a period of time will be different from those who have not stepped out of the country. And those who graduate from UK will be different from those from US and Australia, academic achievements aside.<br><br>The problem is when you see many overseas grads speaking out only when they are out of singapore, but their focus turns to making money when they leave universities and come home.<br><br>Besides, not all who speak out against the government here are from overseas universities.<br><br>It is the local environment that is not condusive to speaking out, especially on political, racial and religious issues. The responsibilities for what you speak is greater and the price is higher. Want to fight the system then be more careful with what they say and be prepared to pay higher price. To ask for a protection or guanrantee on "free political will" from the singapore government<br>is naive and stupid, like the chinese says, "yu hu mou pi", asking the tiger for his skin. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>If the university is protected by some agreements from the government, then what they do is not relevant to the local context, for the locals do not have the same kind of protection. We don't need people from the ivory tower. Those born out of the super clean room cannot survive even a flu virus in a normal environment.<br><br>A good university produces graduates who know how to practise they knowledge anywhere in the world. Imagine if a MIT grad demand the PRC governemt to provide protection or he would not be able to use his knowledge.<br><br>Outside of the university campus is the real world!<br><br></div>

Not sure about course fee but food and lodging will be substantially cheaper, but the students won't get to taste the life away from home.
