              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The state owned and controlled Singapore
                                  newspaper; just as in North Korea where all media is state owned and
                                  controlled like in Singapore; Channel News Asia has an article on Feb
                                  17, 2008 which reads "Singapore holds first speed dating event on the
                                  MRT".<br><br>It tells about the government’s efforts to get more people
                                  to marry and have children. One of Singapore's major problems is its
                                  low birth rate, so low that births cannot even replace those dying, and
                                  were it not for the government permitting hundreds of thousands of
                                  immigrants from Communist China, India and other places, the population
                                  by now would have seriously declined.<br><br>This article refers to the
                                  latest of a series of attempts to encourage more births, which have all
                                  failed so far; this time advertising for both men and women to line up
                                  facing each other in train stations hoping that they will instantly
                                  fall in love and procreate soon thereafter! A sign of desperation on
                                  the part of the Singapore government, don't you think?<br><br>The
                                  article speaks of a low miserable figure of 52 men and women having
                                  turned up at the train station for a chance at matrimony on a train; in
                                  response to the government's advertisements throughout the island! A
                                  miserably low number of 52 men and women!<br><br>Jeraldine Toh, a Bank
                                  Relationship Manager; is reported to have said that she was very
                                  excited because it was the first time that matrimony was attempted on a
                                  speedy train. I can sympathize with her, and tell her that it is not
                                  her fault for not being able to marry. It is the fault of this
                                  tyrannical government and their unpopular policies which has created a
                                  sense of fear and insecurity among Singaporeans preventing them from
                                  wanting children.<br><br>Michael Wee a technician like Jerldine Toh
                                  also thought it was a good idea because he feels people have
                                  insufficient time in Singapore to meet the opposite sex.<br><br>Lee
                                  Kuan Yew's minister who is paid as a salary 5 times what the president
                                  of the United States George Bush is paid, being $3.7 million a year,
                                  Mr. S Iswaran, was the matrimonial “how to woo and romance” instructor
                                  for the day. He was on duty at the Boon Lay MRT Train station and was
                                  reported to have given "a little encouragement and dating tips" but
                                  what actually this meant or to what detail the instruction was; was not
                                  explained in the news article. Also, as to what qualifications he had
                                  for this romantic instructor position was also not explained. Was he a
                                  successful womanizer in the past or another Rodolfo Valentino? Such
                                  questions remained unanswered!<br><br>The report states that only
                                  singles between 20 and 40 years of age were permitted to engage in this
                                  activity of a labor of love, so sympathies and commiserations to those
                                  above 40, both men and women who may be capable in more ways than one,
                                  in such activity. Surly age discrimination here, don't you think?<br><br>The
                                  romantic aspirants were give very little time, only about 6 minutes, or
                                  the equivalent of 2 stations of travel time, when they forced to go on
                                  the next person, so as the largest number can meet and make a judgment
                                  on their life long partners! Very little time indeed to decide on such
                                  an important issue!<br><br>Ms Toh, another woman marriage aspirant who
                                  took part, complained that despite many people there (54 hardly appears
                                  many) and despite her meeting all of them, she still could not find a
                                  friend.<br><br>I must say, reading this news shows a country in utter
                                  desperation. Willing to do almost anything to remedy a situation which
                                  has become hopeless. The government, instead of trying these desperate
                                  attempts at increasing the population of Singapore should first ask
                                  itself why it finds itself in this position anyway.<br><br>The reason
                                  for people not wanting to marry and have children is the appalling
                                  political situation in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Where people are afraid of the
                                  government. Where there is no job security. Where jobs are given to
                                  foreigners and Singaporeans retrenched. Where there is no social
                                  security or social welfare. Where if you lose your job, you are given
                                  $200.00 a bag of rice and asked to fend for yourself.</p>
              <p>Where you can
                                  succeed only if you tow the government line and join Lee Kuan Yew's
                                  political party and parrot whatever he says. Where there is no rule of
                                  law and no human rights. Where there is no free press and free debate
                                  on ideas. Where children are deprived of their childhood being
                                  overworked with no chance to play.</p>
              <p>In other words, Singapore is a
                                  dictatorship where Lee and his family rule with some very silly
                                  policies and where criticism is not tolerated at all. So they do not
                                  want to have children in Singapore. Many want to immigrate to Australia
                                  and leave Singapore for good. In Australia I believe they will have
                                  children. Many children.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>Speed dating was an idea that sprung up in the US mainly by bars and clubs so that they could still make some money during down times, eg those weekdays when few people went out drinking. Think Zouk tea dances on Saturday at 4:00pm.</p>
              <p>It was a marketing idea to attact customers who did not have luck picking up sexual partners during a normal night out.</p>
              <p>The rational was that if you chatted someone up and got turned down, your chances to pick up the next person falls if there were witnesses to your being turned down. Generally because everyone doesn't know each other and so assumed that you were turned down for a reason and there was no need to go through the whole chatting up with you. You had been pre-disapproved. Conversely people who get picked up usually have a higher chance of getting picked up again.</p>
              <p>That led to bar hopping, where if you were turned down at one bar, you'd save time and go to another bar where your chances were supposedly better as you hadn't been turned down there yet. More people started bar hopping to see their friends who might be in any number of bars and probably didn't get lucky and go home with a stranger. So it became a fad.</p>
              <p>After a while, bar hopping begin to be seen as being desperate. You either could not get laid or you were a stalker and needed to get your own life. Only those not in the know thought it was trendy and this was falsely maintained by celebrites bar hopping so the paparazzi had a greater chance of taking their picture with the current love interest.</p>
              <p>It became noted that the old formula of put alchol in a room and watch the customers come in was old school and new marketing ideas begin to proliferate.</p>
              <p>Someone then came up with the bright idea of "speed dating" that allowed you to chat with someone. Your preferences were recorded down and then you'd be put in touch with that someone if you both happened to pick each other out from the crowd. You didn't have to spend a lot on drinks, you got to speak to a large number of potential real date material, it was an efficient use of time and most of all, it was private.</p>
              <p>It became a real fad but after a while it became the fashion to believe that people who went on speed date sessions after speed date sessions had been more efficiently rejected by even more people and were therefore even less worthy of consideration and so it fell out of fashion with the bar crowd as it had the taint of being the resort of misfits.</p>
              <p>The less knowlegeble crowd still thought it was a good way to date but they are becoming fewer and fewer.</p>
              <p>So basically there is a time and limit to the use of speed dating and I think Singapore has already passed that "use by" date.</p>

              <p>We can compare the Singapore middle class outlook with the USA middle class outlook and note the similarities, here is an analysis of the USA middle class family and their outlook:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> <em> ... In marriage, as in so many other things, Western
                  Civilization has been subjected to quite antithetical theories; these
                  we might call the Western and the Romantic theories of love and
                  marriage. The Romantic theory of these things was that each man or
                  woman had a unique personality consisting of inborn traits, accumulated
                  by inheritance from a unique combination of ancestors. This is, of
                  course, the same theory that was used to justify permissive education.
                  In Romantic love, however, the theory went on to assume, simply as a
                  matter of faith, that for each man or woman there existed in a world a
                  person of the opposite sex whose personality traits would just fit into
                  those of his or her destined mate. The only problem was to find that
                  mate. It was assumed that this would he done, at first sight, when an
                  almost instantaneous flash of recognition would reveal to both that
                  they had found the one possible life's partner.</em></p>
              <p><em>     The idea of love at first sight as a flash of
                  recognition was closely related to the Manichaean and Puritan religious
                  idea that God's truth came to men in a similar flash of illumination
                  (an idea that goes back, like so many of these ideas, to Plato's theory
                  of knowledge as reminiscence). In its most extreme form, this Romantic
                  theory of love assumed that each of the destined lovers was only part
                  of a person, the two parts fitting together instantly on meeting into a
                  single personality. Associated witl1 this were a number of other ideas,
                  including the idea that marriages were “made in heaven," that such a
                  Romantic marriage was totally satisfying to the partners, and that such
                  a marriage should be "eternal."</em></p>
              <p><em>     These ideas of Romantic love and marriage were
                  much more acceptable to women than to men (for reasons we have not time
                  to analyze) and were embraced by the middle class, but not, to any
                  great extent, by other classes. The theory, like so much of the
                  middle-class outlook, originated among the medieval heresies, such as
                  Manichaeism (as the Swiss writer Denis de Rougemont has shown), and was
                  thus from the same tradition that saw the rise of the bourgeois outlook
                  in the Middle Ages and its reinforcement by the closely associated
                  Puritan movement of modern times. The Romantic theory of love was
                  spread through the middle class by incidental factors, such as that the
                  bourgeoisie were the only social class that read much, and Romantic
                  love was basically a literary convention in its propagation whatever it
                  may have been in its origins. It made no real impression on the other
                  social classes in European society, such as the peasants, the nobility,
                  or the urban working craftsmen.</em></p>
              <p><em>     Strangely enough, Romantic love, accepted as a
                  theory and ideal by the bourgeoisie, had little influence on
                  middle-class marriages in practice, since these were usually based on
                  middle-class values of economic security and material status rather
                  than on love. More accurately, middle-class marriages were based on
                  these material considerations in fact, while everyone concerned
                  pretended that they were based on Romantic love. Any subsequent
                  recognition of this clash between fact and theory often gave a severe
                  jolt and has sometimes been a subject for literary examination, as in
                  the first volume of John Galsworthy's The Forsyte Saga.</em></p>
              <p><em>     Opposed to this Romantic theory of love and
                  marriage, and almost equally opposed to the bourgeois practice of
                  "sensible" marriage, was what we may call the Western idea of love and
                  marriage. This assumes that personalities are dynamic and flexible
                  things formed largely by experiences in the past. Love and marriage
                  between such personalities are, like everything in the Western outlook,
                  diverse, imperfect, adjustable, creative, cooperative, and changeable.
                  The Western idea assumes that a couple come together for many reasons
                  (sex, loneliness, common interests, similar background, economic and
                  social cooperation, reciprocal admiration of character traits, and
                  other reasons). It further assumes that their whole relationship will
                  be a slow process of getting to know each other and of mutual
                  adjustment—a process that may never end. The need for constant
                  adjustment shows the Western recognition that nothing, even love, is
                  final or perfect. This is also shown by recognition that love and
                  marriage are never total and all-absorbing, that each partner remains
                  an independent personality with the right to an independent life. (This
                  is found throughout the Western tradition and goes back to the
                  Christian belief that each person is a separate soul with its own,
                  ultimately separate, fate. )</em></p>
              <p><em>     Thus there appeared in Western society at least
                  three kinds of marriage, which we may call Romantic, bourgeois, and
                  Western. The last, without being much discussed (except in modern books
                  on love and marriage), is probably the most numerous of the three, and
                  the other two, if they prove successful, do so by gradually developing
                  into this third kind. Romantic marriage, based on the "shock of
                  recognition," has in fact come to be based very largely on sexual
                  attraction, since this is the chief form that love at first sight can
                  take. Such marriages often fail, since even sex requires practice and
                  mutual adjustment and is too momentary a human relationship to sustain
                  a permanent union unless many other common interests accumulate around
                  it. Even when this occurs and the marriage becomes a success, in the
                  sense that it persists, it is never total, and the Romantic delusion
                  that marriage should be totally absorbing of the time, attention, and
                  energies of its partners, still expected by many women brought up on
                  the Romantic idea, merely means that the marriage becomes an enslaving
                  relationship to the husbands and a source of disappointment and
                  frustration to the wives.</em></p>
              <p><em>     Middle-class marriage, in fact, was not romantic,
                  for, in the middle class, marriage, like everything else, was subject
                  to the middle-class system of values. Within that value system,
                  middle-class persons chose a marriage partner who would assist in
                  achieving middle-class goals of status and achievement. A woman, with
                  her parents' approval, chose a husband who showed promise of being a
                  good provider and a steady, reliable, social achiever, who would be
                  able to give her a material status at least as high as that provided by
                  her own parents. A man chose as a wife one who showed promise of being
                  a help in his upward struggle, one able to act as hostess to his
                  aspirant activities and to provide the domestic decorum and social
                  graces expected of a successful business or professional man.</em></p>
              <p><em>     Such a marriage was based, from both sides, on
                  status factors rather than on personal factors. The fact that a man was
                  a Yale graduate, was trained for a profession, had a position with a
                  good firm, drove an expensive car, could order dinner with assurance in
                  an expensive restaurant, and had already applied for membership in a
                  golf or country club were not reasons for loving him as a person, since
                  they were simply the accessories of his status. Yet middle-class
                  persons married for reasons such as these and, at the same time,
                  convinced themselves and their friends that they were marrying for
                  Romantic love (based on the fact that they were, in addition to their
                  mutual social acceptability, sexually attracted).</em></p>
              <p><em>     For a time the new marriage could keep up these
                  pretenses, especially as the elements of sex and novelty in the
                  relationship helped conceal the contrast between theory and fact and
                  that the marriage was basically an external and superficial
                  relationship. But this fact remained, and in time unconscious
                  frustrations and dissatisfactions began to operate. Often these did not
                  reach the conscious level, especially a few generations ago, but today
                  the question is posed by every women's magazine, "Is your marriage a
                  success?" But unconsciously, long before this, realization had been
                  growing that the marriage relationship was not based on love, which
                  must be a recognition and appreciation of personal qualities, not of
                  status accessories. Without personal feeling based on such personal
                  qualities, the relationship was really not a personal relationship and
                  was really not based on love, even when the partners, with the usual
                  lack of introspection associated with middle-class minds, still
                  insisted that it was based on love. The consequences of such
                  unconscious recognition of the real lack of love in the bourgeois
                  marital relationship, in a society that never stopped reiterating in
                  song, cinema, magazine, and book the absolute necessity of love for
                  human happiness and "fulfillment," will be examined in a moment.</em></p>
              <p><em>     Three generations ago the bourgeois wife rarely
                  became aware of her frustrations. She was largely confined to her home,
                  was kept too busy with children and housework to find much time for
                  meditation on her situation or for comparison with other wives or the
                  outside world generally. Brought up in a male-dominated family, she was
                  prepared to accept a similar situation in her own life. This means that
                  her outside contacts and her general picture of the world came to her
                  through the screen of her husband's vision of these things.</em></p>
              <p><em>     The decrease in the number of children in
                  middle-class families and the spread of labor-saving devices, from
                  vacuum cleaners to frozen foods, gave the bourgeois wife increasing
                  leisure in the 1920's and 1930'5. Enterprising editors like Edwin Bok
                  filled that leisure with new slick women's magazines (like the Ladies' Home Journal).
                  Popular novels and, to a lesser extent, the early movies, dramatic
                  matinees, and spreading women's clubs allowed women to build up a
                  vision of a fantasy world of romantic love and carefree, middle-class
                  housewives with dazzling homes and well-behaved and well-scrubbed
                  children. By 1925 the average bourgeois housewife was becoming
                  increasingly frustrated because her own life was not that pictured in
                  the women's magazines. Her increasing leisure gave her time to think
                  about it, and her more frequent contact with other wives encouraged her
                  to raise her voice in criticism of her husband whose financial
                  inability to provide her with the life she came to regard as her due
                  seemed to her to justify her desire to nag him onward to greater effort
                  in pursuit of money. To him this became nagging; to her it was only an
                  occasional reminder of the expectations under which she had entered
                  upon the marriage relationship.</em></p>
              <p><em>     While this was going on, the outside world was
                  also changing. Women became "emancipated" as a consequence of World War
                  I, with considerable urging onward from the women's magazines. Shorter
                  skirts and shorter hair became symbols of this process, but even more
                  significant was the appearance in the outside world of a great increase
                  in the number of jobs that could be done best, or only, by women. As
                  part of this process, there took place considerable changes in
                  bourgeois morality, the ending of chaperonage, greater freedom between
                  the sexes, and the acceptance of divorce as morally possible in
                  bourgeois life (a custom that came in from the stage and cinema).</em></p>
              <p><em>     As part of this whole process, there occurred a
                  dramatic event of great social significance. This was the reversal in
                  longevity expectations of men and women in adult life. A century ago
                  (to be sure, in a largely rural context), a twenty-year-old man could
                  expect to live longer than a twenty-year-old wife. In fact, such a man
                  might well bury two or three wives, usually from the mortality
                  associated with childbirth or other female problems. Today, a
                  twenty-year-old man has little expectation of living as long as a
                  twenty-year-old woman. To make matters worse, a twenty-year-old woman a
                  century ago married a man considerably older than herself, at least in
                  the middle classes, simply because future preference required that a
                  man be established economically before he began to raise a family.</em></p>
              <p><em>     Today, from a series of causes, such as the
                  extension of the female expectation of life faster than the male
                  expectation, the increased practice of birth control, coeducation
                  (which brings the sexes into contact at the same age), weakening of
                  future preference and of the middle-class outlook generally, which
                  leads to marriages by couples of about the same age, husbands now
                  generally die before their wives. Recognition of this, the increased
                  independence of women, adaptation to taxes and other legal nuisances,
                  has given rise to joint financial accounts, to property being put in
                  the wife's name, and to greatly increased insurance benefits for wives.
                  Gradually the wealth of the country became female-owned, even if still
                  largely male-controlled.</em></p>
              <p><em>     But this had subtle results; it made women more
                  independent and more outspoken. Bourgeois men gradually came to live
                  under a regime of persistent nagging to become "better providers." To
                  many men, work became a refuge and a relief from domestic revelations
                  of the inadequacy of their performance as economic achievers. This
                  growth of overwork, of constant tension, of frustration of emotional
                  life and of leisure began to make more and more men increasingly
                  willing to accept death as the only method of achieving rest. Bourgeois
                  men literally began to kill themselves, by unconscious psychic suicide,
                  from overwork, neurotic overindulgence in alcohol, smoking, work, and
                  violent leisure, and the middle class slowly increased its proportion
                  of materially endowed widows.</em></p>
              <p><em>     One notable change in this whole process was a
                  shift, over the past century, from the male-dominated family to a
                  female-dominated family. The locality in which the young couple set up
                  their home had an increasing tendency to be matrilocal rather than
                  patrilocal. In increasing numbers of cases, where the young couple
                  married before the groom's educational process was finished, they even
                  lived with her family (but very rarely with his family). Increasingly
                  part of the burden of housework was shifted to the husband: washing
                  dishes, buying groceries, even tending the children. In 1840 a child
                  could cry at night and would invariably be tended by its mother, while
                  the father slept peacefully on, totally unaware of what was going on.
                  By 1960, if a child cried at night, the chances were as likely as not
                  that the mother would hear nothing while the father took over the
                  necessary activities. If this were questioned by anyone, the mother's
                  retort was pointed: "I take care of baby all day; I don't see why he
                  can't take care of it at night!".</em></p>
              <p><em>     Closely related to this confusion, or even
                  reversal, of the social roles of the sexes was decreasing sexual
                  differentiation in child-rearing practices. As recently as the 1920's

              <p>O my this situation isnt good...  Low birth rates plus so many leaving = less working people = lesser GDP = lesser growth = no more reason to justify expotential pay increments..... not good..... for the government that is...</p>
