            <div class='col-md body'>guys... I just got this idea while i was bathing in italy few mths ago.. just like to share and discuss if it's workable.... feel free to comment and flame mi hor...<br><br>ok... idea is....everytimes we complain how unfair it is for government to confirm the GRC and single sit con last min... therefore not going enough time for opposition to work on those area....<br><br>so...why not..after this GE, see which GRC lose by a smaller margin or based on other basis.... then announce officially that will be the GRC or area that they will be contesting for in the next GE and start working on that area for the next 4 or 5 yrs.<br><br>if we cannot change the rules we have to find ways to deal with it.. whining also no use one...then... we always see so many singaporean complain and say we wont vote for PAP... so if this news is out officially... we can ALL start moving in the next few yrs to that GRC, or some how get our name registered in that area ( ask those parent that wan their kids to be in branded sch.. they will tell u how it can be done). And vote there( dunno if there is a minimum yr limit u have to stay in that area to vote or not.. anyone can confirm?? but of coz if 5 yrs canont then 10yrs lor should can one right?)<br><br>of coz this will coz alot of trouble and cost some money for ppl... but we just need to do it once to help in shaping the future singapore for your kids, so no choice... or even opposition can set up some special fund to subsidize ppl who move or start some helpline to teach and help ppl to change their address... of coz all this must be done in legal ways.. and some nice lawyer can help in this part and advice....<br><br>with so many ppl that dun like PAP.. do u think we can actually lose that GRC if we concentrate and united together??? bet u all heard about the chopstick story right??? united make them unbreakable.<br><br>we can hit the place where it hurt them most.. like tampines or eastcoast area... get as much big shot minister out at 1 go, they cannot run also.. if not they will admit they are scared.....e.g. if LHL tio voted out.. how shocked they will be?<br><br>we can also inform those neutral citizen to just make a void vote if they are not daring enough to go against PAP.. just dun get into the ways of the making of a better singapore, also about those rumour we all heard about how ppl that vote for PAP can be track and got future problem.. dun worri... if we are united... they cant sabo so many of us right??? e.g.. u wont see all the kids staying in tampines studying in jurong right? or fired all the civil servant in tampines right?? then ppl will know already..<br><br>once a GRC is down.. the rest will fall too... and once we have enough MP.. all the secret like HDB and CPF and GIC will be out..things will change after that....<br><br>so guys what to u think.. workable? pls discuss.... and hope i wont be sue for my bath room idea....<br><br>MOD, please dun close this...it's related to the NEXT GE anyway...<br><br></div>
