The early Republic years were tumultous and full of in-fighting, betrayals and corruption. The Republic isn't even really united until 1928 (By Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek) - fighting between warlords, and later with the communists sapped its power to effectively fend off Japanese invasion in 1937. The KMT were defeated on the mainland in 1949 and fled to Taiwan. Ever since then, they have dreamed an increasingly impossible dream to reunifying China under the ROC political structure.<br><br>China (PRC) was born in 1949, after the communists successfully chased the remnants of the KMT government out to Taiwan. The CPC led by Mao Zedong, considered the ROC extinct, and the PRC became the new China, centred on Beijing. The reality is that the world now considered Taipei the new capital of China, until 1971. Indeed the PRC did try to finish off the nationalists with a series of coastal attacks in the 1950s, but suffered huge losses. The PRC government wants reunification with Taiwan as a subset of the PRC political structure.<br><br>Taiwan (Republic of) is a short-lived state born in 1895. It was the first republic in East Asia and was declared by Governor Liu Ming Quan. There were two major reasons for its existence. The Taiwanese have moved to Taiwan (Formosa at that time) since the Ming Dynasty, and have enjoyed de facto self-governence for hundreds of years. Unfortunately, Japan's increasing aggression towards the Qing Dynasty forced them to cede Formosa to become Japan's first overseas colony. The local leaders were fed up of mismanagement by the mainland and opposed Japanese rule, so they declared an Republic, althought it was crushed by the Japanese in less than a year. This rebellious spirit remains active in Taiwan today.<br><br>The Chinese nationals (PRC,ROC) want reunification with each other, but under their own respective power structure. The Taiwanese nationals (especially from southern Taiwan like Tainan and Kaohsiung) are suspicious of mainlanders of any political affliation. They want to minimize cultural similarities with the mainland, because they want to maintain their own self-determination, rather than let "outsiders" in either Taipei, Beijing, even Washington DC or Tokyo to control them.<br><br>Please do more background reading before calling other people a bunch of morons.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

The DPP government is starting to do this, whereas the KMT (when it was government) and the CPC have been adjusting their history for many years.<br><br>Let me provide an example. The KMT government bore the brunt of the casualties during the Sino-Japanese War from 1937-1945. Around 3 million Nationalists soldiers died in the brutal and largely one-side war. Of course the KMT are eager to highlight the fact that the CPC used this destructive conflict as an opportunity to increase their military strength and eventually oust the ruling government.<br><br>Not surprisingly, the CPC highlighted the indecisiveness of the KMT government, and its weakness during the War, while proclaiming its disproportionately better performance despite a smaller army size.<br><br>Whose version is more objective? The same events can be interpreted 180 degrees from each other. The DPP government is no angel but its counterparts in either PRC or ROC (and Japan) have not set any good examples.<br><br></div>

Then just give up everything. And if they want to remove all the labels that identify Chinese identity in the ROC national museum, they'd better return those treasures to the Mainland, instead of claiming as their own. Don't take it as Taiwanese knowing too well that they are the remnants of Ancient Chinese civilization. Don't they feel ashame at all??<br><br>Singapore's history proves that it does not have anything related to China at all except it has Chinese majority.<br><br>Don't just look down upon the Mainland as a mere communist regime. It is just too convenient to bring that up. I urge you look back to yourself. [b]In essence, S'pore is no different than a communist country masked by western parliament and modern facade. All in all it is governed by the Lee Dynasty. Just speak up and criticize in the public harshly against them and see what happened. Democracy under ironfist is just a fake democracy. Admit it.</span></strong><br><br>And I don't mean that Thailand has achieved those democratic values or is superior to S'pore. Still long way to go. But at least we have started to enlighten that democracy is not limited to facades like constitutions, elections, and parliament.[/b]</blockquote>I wrote my post to address the TS's comment that:<br><br>"Taiwan ROC deserve to be invaded by the PRC. What do they think they are trying to do? acting like the Japanese? bunch of moron! "<br><br>Let me state that I personally disagree with the move to make such changes in their history books. However, I also disagree that this is "acting like the Japanese" or "bunch of moron" since I have already explained their rationale for doing this.<br><br>This is a political decision, just like China's decision to shoot down a satellite and add thousands of pieces of dangerous debris in space.<br><br>You claim that the Taiwanese are progressing towards "giving up everything" and "removing all the labels that identify Chinese identity". I don't think it's that extreme. I doubt the DPP government is denying that their ancestors come from China, just overemphasizing that they are not the same political entity with CPC, which unfortunately carries the "China" label.<br><br>As for your statement "Singapore's history proves that it does not have anything related to China at all except it has Chinese majority" let me also remind you to read more about Singapore's history first before making snap remarks.<br><br>Also, your personal attack on Singapore is unwarranted and outside the topic of this discussion. If you are unhappy about certain posters, please address them directly rather than making overgeneralized insults.</div>

The KMT government bore the brunt of the casualties during the Sino-Japanese War from 1937-1945. Around 3 million Nationalists soldiers died in the brutal and largely one-side war. Of course the KMT are eager to highlight the fact that the CPC used this destructive conflict as an opportunity to increase their military strength and eventually oust the ruling government.<br><br>Not surprisingly, the CPC highlighted the indecisiveness of the KMT government, and its weakness during the War, while proclaiming its disproportionately better performance despite a smaller army size.<br><br>Whose version is more objective?
