That written by China, Taiwan or the West that is ideologically aligned with Taiwan and thus might be inclined to side by TW in the arguments. Truth is always a constructed notion, relative to the audience it is targeting and the interests that are being served. Truth is an interpretation, if I could put it this way. However, fact is not. Using your example, the basic fact that Chiang was kidnapped by Chang in the Xi'an incident must be preserved and respected. However, your interpretation as to who is the good guy and who is the bad guy in this incident is essentially colored by your own ideological proclitivities and interests and political opinions which are always relative.  For whatever reasons pro-independent TW politicians do not want TW to be associated with mainland China, I do not care. But if they went to the extent of stop recognizing Sun Yat Sen as their founding father in the official textbooks is a bit jarring. My opinion is then that facts must be stated in books. However you interpret that is a different matter.<br><br></div></blockquote>Perhaps,u can come down to Changi Airport n scuk my C, I pay u S$1000 per scuk!!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Bear in mind that their passports invariably show the name of "Republic of China".<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Cystaire:</div><div class="quote_body">As I mentioned earlier, there are three political entities in this turmoil: China (PRC), China (ROC) and Taiwan (Republic Of).<br><br>You state that the Taiwanese politicians are twisting the basic facts of history. But they did not deny that Dr. Sun Yat-Sen is the founder of modern China, just that Dr. Sun is not the founder of Taiwan (Republic Of) which was started by a more obscure anti-Japanese uprising by President Liu Ming Quan in 1895.<br><br>Remember that after the KMT fled to Taiwan, China (ROC) ruled Taiwan by martial law until after the Kaohsiung Incident. Native born Taiwanese who have been on the island since the Ming Dynasty are not appreciative of people (Dutch, Qing Chinese, Japanese, ROC Chinese) who march in and impose their own laws on the local people.<br><br>In addition, mainland China is currently ruled by the PRC government under a single party system which makes it impossible to dissociate the label of "China" from its political power structure. When you say China today, very few people will think of the KMT government.<br><br>The DPP political desire for self-determination is what fuels this textbook change.<br><br>I don't agree with the action, but it is understandable. Arguably more understandable than anti-satellite missiles.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
