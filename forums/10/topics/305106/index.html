This saying indeed should be the central values of society.<br><br>Power like monies are just the means and not the end. It is not evil. However covetousness or worshiping of monies as our ex-chief minister David Marshal called it worship of the golden calf is the root of all evil.<br><br>Monies collected from the citizens should be put to create values for our lives and to sustain our social and economic wellbeing and to maximize the use of all monies as well as our total available resources for nation building.<br><br>However we have a government which uses many excuses to get more and more monies for itself so that it can claim success and use such monies for their own purposes. So to the government monies have become the be all and end all of its whole being and its governing philosophy.<br><br>Monies have become an opium to all government leaders and their elites. For monies they seem to be prepared to do anything. That is why it is taking away endlessly citizens' monies through all kinds of schemes and has forgotten the original purpose of taxes which should be put to good use to provide basic services like medical care or hedge against unemployment or poverty traps etc.<br><br>Such taxes should be put to good use to enable people to lead a better and more fulfilling life. It should have been used to inculcate values and morality to build an inspiring nation for the good of all. It is their worshiping of the monies which has become the evil.<br><br>Such worship and intoxication with monies has created a selfish society where people try to steal, to conspire, to do wrong.<br><br>Now similarly power is not a bad thing. Like you said you may be even good. Military power can be used as deterrent as China presently believes. China leaders have said many times it will not be the first to use its nuclear weapons.<br><br>A true Shaolin Master who has acquired real marshal art power will not use it. He will possess and practise it for deterrent purpose or defend himself for its most effective use. The moment he tested it he will lose that power.<br><br>The former Soviet Union was powerful in term of its nucruel capability and prowess. However the moment it flaunted its power in actual conflicts in Afghanistan it began to erode and finally lost its power.<br><br>Americans seemed to have exploited Soviet Union later flaunting of its military power in Afghanistan to its advantage and brought about the final collapse. Had Soviet Union followed the Shaolin Master strategy to conserve its power for deterrent purpose with practices of morality and humility today Soviet Union might well be still around.<br><br>It is the ambition to control the world that makes the powerful power-crazy to murder to wage war and commit genocides etc.<br><br>Because of its self-arrogance and its open and unashamed and excessive show and use of its power to get its way, government is slowly and surely losing the real power.</div>
