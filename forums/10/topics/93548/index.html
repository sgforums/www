            <div class='col-md body'>What did we learn from their tit for tat slime balls besides that both sides can't be trusted and have their own personal agenda? Please add on...<br><br>1. MIW still as intolerant as ever despite Young Lee's pledge to handle more criticism<br><br>2. Chee probably getting funding and backing from some parts of the US gahment<br><br>3. MIW still thinks lawsuits are cool to intimidate the opposition, probably because Lau Lee was a lawyer and that's all he knows on how to screw people<br><br>4. Chee, oso ARDA chairman, spends more time overseas in ARDA work and courting an international (mainly US) audience, than on SDP priorities and engaging a more important Sg audience<br><br>5. MIW is petty and goes berzerk about the slightest remotest implication that they are corrupt or incompetent (the supposed loan to Indonesia which the defamation lawsuit was about)<br><br>6. Chee, seemingly thriving on foreign backing and attention, looks like more concerned about having a poor thing image like Ghandi (remember Chee's 1993 hunger strike?) and wants to be a confrontational wannabe martyr rather than cleverly skipping lawsuits (do they use SDP money to pay up the lawsuits?) and smartly fencing with MIW<br><br><a href="http://www.thevoiddeck.org/columns/col_217.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thevoiddeck.org/columns/col_217.htm</a><br><br><img src="http://www.thevoiddeck.org/deck/vd28.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear SuayKia,<br><br>Everybody just think that you can't win LKY, but have you ever tried?<br><br>If you like to gamble a bit, sometimes, it is about "buao huang"! Many dictators, past and present, all use the similar tactic; twenty years ago, many people in Indonesia also think they can't win Suharto. Many people in Manila also think that they can't win Marcos. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Nobody thought the Communist regimes in East Europe will ever be won over.<br><br>I think it is just a matter of time of evolution; even if we really cannot win LKY in his lifetime, the Natural law of birth, age, illness and death will take care of that. Nobody could possibly be above this Law of Natural; impermanence.<br><br>Many people think that PAP is very solid and strong, but my prediction is that it will take less than 15 years for it to experience total collapse and decay, if they are not going to do something about it. Ironically, it will be the GRC system that will do them in! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>PAP is fast becoming like a snail. Hard shell on the outside, soft like toufu in the inside. Why? All thanks to the GRC system. A warrior that doesn't fight any war before, no matter how many "simulated" trainings he has, he will never become a great warrior.<br><br>It is in fact a sign of WEAKNESS that PAP keeps trying to avoid fighting and avoid the failures and loosing seats. Loosing small number of seats isn't a big deal and not the end of the world yet! The fight and struggle continues! It is the process and experience that is valuable, not the results alone. It is truly a sign of WEAKNESS when PAP tried everything all it could to avoid loosing; redrawing of boundaries, breaking up "danger" zones like ChengSan, Anson, Braddel Heights.... using HDB upgrading as carrots. You see, these are all signs of weaknesses. If you are good and convincing enough, you do not need to use HDB upgrading as carrot! If you are really good, you could have worked even harder in those "danger zones" to regain the respect, confidence and most importantly votes from the voters. By practically "running" away from the difficult fights demonstrated two characteristic of the present PAP. First, they are weak, really not good enough  and lack the confidence to fight a difficult battle. Secondly, they are getting overly complacent, always thinking of the easier way out. It is just like soldiers who like to "geng", avoid difficult trainings and such; how could such soldiers be great warriors in battles?<br><br>Thus, the trend for PAP is only regressive until doom. Cannot win LKY? You must be joking. Sooner or Later, we will win the weaklings that he has cultivated throughout his political carreer! That will be his greatest mistake he had ever made in his life.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SibeiSuayKia:</div><div class="quote_body">Chee is fighting a battle he can't win..<br><br>What makes you think that Chee won't be assasinated by ISD?<br><br>LKY is the LAW , much more powerful control then what Mahathir has..<br>tens of thousands of people dared to protest against Mahathir during last time DPM Anwar's sacking<br><br>You dare to play with the CJ Yong Pung How?
