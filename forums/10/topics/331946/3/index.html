              <p>Nah , i just ass sniff the the truths in what they say about u thats all.</p>
              <p>I dont really have to do anything. I am just watching u dig urself a bigger hole. I am just wondering how much of the bullshit can come out of you before u finally.. like ur like-minded compradres before you, disappear or realise that, in here, there are smart people, intelligent people, experienced people, and the real mc coys here. You, i must say, are just full of shit. I am serious. I only say a person is full of shit , when the person is really REALLY full of shit.</p>
              <p>I just cant believe u think you could bamboozle us with ur cock and bull.</p>
              <p>I almost know exactly how u are going to react to my post. U are gonna reply, and spout this and that, and as replies gather momentum, u do the slipper slope argument, u twist and turn, like Gendekan said, spinning one whole round while u are still rooted firmly to ur original position, trying to decieve us, sometimes i dont even think u know what u are talking about. If there were gonna be dedicated people who is gonna piece together every single reply and threads related to your character Parn, you will be so damn discredited.</p>
              <p>Pls dun try to be me, which u will reply.. 'Who wants to be a TRASH like you. ASS SNIFFING gay' *yawn* saying u are unmoved by peoples remarks and opinions,trying to.. 'save' or 'help' the unfortunate with ur 'flawed' principles, however u failed to realise the difference with me and u is that, u are inconsistent and full of shit, while, i can happily back every single damn thing i say and claim in sgForums since 2004. I mean come on.. really ? Yes.. REALLY!</p>
              <p>Thats why i just love busting peoples balls. Especially people like you. I have been doing that since my teenage years to my working days.</p>
              <p>And once again ur assumptions are wrong.. all wrong.. from ass sniffing , to being an sg gay .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> i forgot to add.. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
