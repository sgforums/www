            <div class='col-md body'>THE precision engineering industry suffers from a serious image problem.<br>Singaporeans see it as a dirty and smelly business and are avoiding it in droves.<br><br>So despite creating about 2,000 jobs each year in the last two years, only about one in three has been taken up.<br><br>Precision engineering, or PE, includes metal stamping and machining parts for the semiconductor, aerospace and automotive industries.<br><br>'The situation is very bad. Almost half of the industry's workforce of 50,000 is made up of foreigners,' said Dr Moh Chong Tau, chairman of the PE Industry Skills Training Council, set up by employers to provide training.<br><br>'Young Singaporeans, even the engineers, prefer to work in the city and dress smartly. It's also very hard to attract them because of the misconceptions and myths of this industry.'<br><br>This is happening despite a higher entry-level salary for the PE industry.<br><br>A tool and die maker with GCE O levels, for example, can earn between $1,700 and $2,302 a month. In comparison, a customer service clerk with GCE A levels takes in just between $1,200 and $1,550.<br><br>The difference is largely because a PE worker gets more training, both before and on the job, said the Workforce Development Agency (WDA).<br><br>However, the popular picture of the PE worker is not an attractive one. 'The perception is that he is dirty, smelly, works on a lathe all day, grinding away at metal pieces,' said WDA director (manufacturing and construction division) Jeffrey Lam.<br><br>Worse, most people perceive the work as being done in hot and humid workshops.<br><br>This is no longer accurate as many companies have air-conditioned their work areas. Said Dr Moh: 'The environment is actually very clean and fully automated.<br><br>'We use a lot of computers. If you are good at playing computer games, you'd have no problem doing the work.'<br><br>The industry generated an output of $20 billion in 2005, a figure that should reach $28 billion by 2018.<br><br>But the labour shortage is worrying because of its direct impact on other sectors, in particular, manufacturing.<br><br>Said Mr Lam: 'Some people call the PE industry the mother of manufacturing industries. It produces the tools, moulds, components, and machinery to support other manufacturing activities including electronics, pharmaceuticals, aerospace.'<br><br>For example, in aerospace, PE is needed to produce landing gear and engine cases.<br><br>If the labour problem persists, PE companies here would migrate to countries like China, where manpower is in abundance, said Dr Moh, who is also president of PE company Makino Asia.<br><br>To attract more Singaporeans, the WDA is developing a nationally recognised training programme for the industry.<br><br>The Workforce Skills Qualifications, or WSQ, helps upgrade workers by developing career paths and giving them structured training.<br><br>It may also be packaged into apprenticeship or scholarship schemes.<br><br>Straits times 22 Mar</div>

Singapore labour laws do not allow a company to hire 90% foreigners..since when can you get so many work permits?

They also have transparent business reporting unlike Singapore.<br><br>Temasek has not performed and instead incurred a few billion dollars in fines  ( which translate to losses) by the Thai government - how come the CEO was not fired? How come even in a downturn , ministers are still upping their pay while people are complaining of their jobs being taken away by foreigners and the GST is being hiked?<br><br>That loyal piece of dead wood could also be referred to your NS and NS reservist men. They don't have an advantage over foreigners in job employment because of their obligations to the country. Are you willing to ditch all those men who spent 2 - 2.5 years of the life in training to favor foreigners?<br><br>Loyal piece of dead wood - in Australia, there is a lot of them there but they do take pride in their work.  Australia is booming even when their labor costs and wages are high. And yes they do favor their locals more unlike Singapore.<br><br>I am not saying to cancel the foreign talent policy absolutely. I am asking for a fairer one . Only take in people when the skill market is short. Not just take them all in.<br><br></div>
