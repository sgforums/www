              <p><em>a lion puppet</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people the impression that there are others out there that would agree with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A <strong>sockpuppet</strong> is an <a title="Online identity" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Online_identity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">online identity</span></a> used for purposes of deception within an <a title="Internet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Internet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Internet</span></a> community. In its earliest usage, a sockpuppet was a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a <a title="Hand puppet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Hand_puppet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">hand puppet</span></a>.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[1]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In current usage, the perception of the term has been extended beyond second identities of people who already post in a forum to include other uses of misleading online identities. For example, a <em><a title="NY Times" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/NY_Times"><span style="color: #0066cc;">NY Times</span></a></em> article claims that "sock-puppeting" is defined as "the act of creating a fake online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company."<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[2]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The key difference between a sockpuppet and a regular <a title="Pseudonym" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="color: #0066cc;">pseudonym</span></a> (sometimes termed an "alt") is the pretense that the puppet is a third party who is not affiliated with the puppeteer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To "flame wars" and "phishing" we can now add "<strong>sock puppet</strong>." A <strong>sock puppet</strong>, for those still boning up, is a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a hand puppet. Recently, a senior editor at The New Republic got in trouble for some particularly colorful <strong>sock puppet</strong>ry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Lee Siegel began blogging for The New Republic, he found, as many others have, that Internet posters tend to be fairly outspoken — and a good number of the posters on the blog were harshly critical. An exception was ''sprezzatura,'' who regularly offered extravagant praise. After Mr. Siegel was criticized for his writing about Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' sprezzatura wrote: ''Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.'' A reader charged that sprezzatura was in fact Mr. Siegel, but sprezzatura denied it.</p>
              <p>The reader turned out to be right. ...</p>

              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned. Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>
              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by this "makepeace" was as such:</p>
              <blockquote>

              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Hence lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20 minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace. Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>But after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to makepeace</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Note the bad acting, where he pretended to be "excited" and "surprised" about what he wrote himself.</span></p>
              <p>Now this is the funny part, if his account was really hacked as he claimed it to be, he would certainly not be replying back to his "hacked" account so happily in such a way.</p>
              <p>But in any case when he was exposed he made this very funny, frantic and desperate post trying to suddenly divorce himself from the actions of his sockpuppetry by claiming he was hacked. Unfortunately all a basic look at the thread will reveal what really happened, and that is nothing other then lionnoisy was caught red-handed sockpuppeting.</p>

              <p>but sorry friend, i do contribute significantly to Singapore...
              this i may have to contest you with; you do not know what i've did
              and am doing for the people of Singapore. i have no interest to
              elaborate or disclose either. i accept that Singapore isn't the
              best of countries to live in. i accept that we are not the best
              however, i am doing my part in trying to get things change in my

              <p>Ok, I give respect to people who accept their mistakes. So yes, I have some respect for you now.</p>
              <p>The jab from me on the above is not to make you disclose anything. It's to make you think.</p>
              <p>Do not keep accepting the positive points of Singapore only, such as the Threadstarter here. People like him contribute nothing, just stepping on other countries to make our nation look good. But does it truly help us? NO.</p>
              <p>That's my issue with our govt. LKY has been stepping on other countries' foot (by comparing us against them) just to justify why they are needed to be paid so much. But have they truly reflect on whether purely just economic progression = a good life for the citizens?</p>

              <p>His English is poor, his arguments are far below the acceptable levels of the average person, I really wonder what sort of 'trauma' he has gone through to reach such depths</p>

              <p>If the noisy pussy is clear headed enough to state that "higher salary in HK is meaningless, when HK property prices continue to go up" - is the Singapore situation not made worst when Singapore's HDB units have been continuously inflated even as the Singapore Dollar increase in value; and even when Singaporean wages are frozen, and employment contracts are deliberately made into short period of 3 to 5 years renewal terms ?</p>

              <p><br>This is another classic display in idiocy by the resident noisy pussy.</p>
              <p>Can the ONE-Room HDB Flat in Singapore provide any better ventilation than the same type of 1-Room Unit found in Hong Kong ?</p>
              <p>With the architectural layout of the Singapore One-Room HDB flat requiring windows only on one side of the unit, and the doors facing a common corridor that run in the center of the block - can there be any cross-ventilation that makes the Singapore unit better than Hong Kong's ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Is the noisy pussy comparing like for like - when the pussy deride the 40 square feet as the standard Hong Kong 1-Room Unit ?</p>
              <p>This 40 square feet room will measure 8 feet x 5 feet that some Singapore landlord will illegally sub-divide a terrace house for rent.</p>
              <p>Can the Hong Kong 1-Room unit - without toilet or kitchen - be comparable to the larger 1-Room HDB unit that is built in Singapore ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is the indoor temperature of 37 degrees Celcius so unusual in Hong Kong during summer that last for at least three months ?</p>
              <p>What about Singapore when the hottest months can see outdoor temperatures rising to at least 35 degrees ?</p>
              <p>Did anyone bother to listen to the complaints about the high temperatures of those living in the 1-Room HDB flat - who cannot even afford to operate an electric fan ?</p>
              <p>Should Singaporeans then envy the HongKongers when they experience cooler months for the better part of 70 percent all the year that last from autumn, winter and spring ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it not surprising that in a First World Country such as Singapore, there should be so many Singaporeans having to live in 1 and 2-Room flats ?</p>
              <p>"<a rel="nofollow" href="http://luxuryasiahome.wordpress.com/2009/06/20/fast-facts-about-rental-flats-in-singapore/"><em>There are 42,800 rental flats in Singapore, of which 19,700 are 1-Room and 23,100 2-Roomers</em>. </a><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>They range is size from 280 to 484 square feet each, with a monthly rent of $26 to $205 for 1-Room unit, and $44 to $275 for 2-Roomers</em>."</span></p>
              <p>Should Singaporeans be surprised that <span style="color: #0000ff;">"<em>Demand for rental flats far outstrips supply today. While 300 applicants join the queue each month, only about 150 people return flats in the same period. As of February this year, the average waiting time for a one-room flat was 19.5 months, almost five months longer than in December 2007. The wait for a two-room flat was 15 months, five months more than in 2007</em>." (This is an abstract from a report that is dated 20 June 2009).</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"To meet the growing demand, the government converted vacant three- and four-room flats in Woodlands and Boon Lay to one- and two-roomers last year. The HDB says the total number of rental flats will increase to 49,860 by the end of 2011. The next batch of 290 converted units in Redhill should also be ready by the end of this year. New HDB rental flats are also being built in Yishun, Sembawang and Choa Chu Kang. This will increase the stock of rental flats to 50,000 units by 2012, a 17 per cent increase from the 42,800 units now."</span></em> </p>
              <p>It seems that despite the supposed attaintment of becoming a First World Nation, there is an increasing number of Singaporeans falling into hardship and have to give up their homes, and to resort to rental.</p>
              <p>Those who cannot afford to keep up to the rentals will be subjected to harsh eviction notices that arrive in pink.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb111/atobe-album/HDBOne-RoomFlatQuitNotice.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should we be surprised that after 44 years of independence, prosperity continue to be elusive amongst Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>While Singaporeans have been brain-washed to accept the idea that there is no iron rice bowl, that short-term employment contracts with low wages is a necessity, the elite leadership will insist on being paid their glorious wages for their supposed talents in leading Singapore forward.</p>

              <p>Just for your information, in Toronto, there is a Four Seasons Hotel, a Four Seasons Center ( a theater or something for art) and a Four Seasons project, which comprises a hotel, shopping center, and some apartments, mainly 2 rooms type, in Yorksville.</p>
              <p>There is no Four Seasons apartment in down town toronto where you can buy an equivalent of the Four Seasons apartment in Singapore. Of couse, you can pay 1.5m to buy a 2 bedroom apartment there, if you wish and have the money....hahaha...</p>
