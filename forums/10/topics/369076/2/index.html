              <p>Not true about your 5000 psf. The most expensive property so far I see on the market is at most $3000+psf.</p>
              <p>Coming back to HK, if you want to compare, I have a cousin who is a doctor in HK, general practitioner, he earns S$50,000 per month, more than 5x the amt of a doctor in SG. You can also get an apartment in a good area in HK for about $1.5m, albeit its size is smaller than the regular Singapore apartment.</p>
              <p>But most importantly, if you are stupid, you will buy an apartment near the sewage for $1m. Smart people know that buying property takes time and you must invest time to look around for the best buy.</p>
              <p>That happens as well for Singapore.</p>

              <p>As I mentioned, the regular price ain't that high. 99% of our residences are within the amount I am talking about. As I said, you need to have brains to buy residences. Paying $1m to live by a sewage is downright stupid.</p>

              <p>not interested in politics. Coz its frustrating to serve people like you who is too myopic and have not seen the world and believes Singapore is everything. Citizens like you tend to live in your comfort zone and will never contribute anything significant to Singapore. So what if I criticize? At least I have given my ideas to my PAP friends to let them think about it. Criticism means bad? You are just one of those who cannot take criticism and improve *shrugs*</p>
              <p>On the other hand, I have worked in many cities before, and have done an ample comparison amongst the cities. I may not have 100% objective view, but I have seen enough in my global position</p>
              <p>Sure, Singapore ain't that bad. But it's not that good as well. There are many cities that offer other aspects of life that beats Singapore hands down.</p>
              <p>We are not on the top 10 most livable cities for nothing :)</p>

              <p>He's offering an overly skewed view of HK residences by quoting $1m living by sewage.</p>
              <p>That's not true. Only a jackass will spend $1m living by a sewage, and end up on the newspapers :)</p>
              <p>People who do not perform sufficient research and quote anything JUST to make their point, aren't worthy of respect *shrugs* That's the same for the guy who quoted the Trillium at $15k psf. Too desperate to prove his point that he never did his study properly. And hence, the thoroughly stupid mistake.</p>
