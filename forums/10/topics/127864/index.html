A person with proper grammatical foundation would write: "Can you just stop <span style="text-decoration: underline;">commenting on the NEL issue</span>".<br><br>2.  If the NEL is making $$, would you complain?<br><br>THis sentence is illogical for firstly, it makes no sense and secondly, it bears no relation to the gist of the topic in question.  And proper grammar dictates that it be written as:<br>"If the NEL <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> generating profit, would you be complaining?".<br><br>3. And the bus rts, wasn't when SMRT came, they had to cancel bus rt?"<br>"Wasn't" is not used in conjunction with "come". Other than that, it's so grammatically flawed it's meaning is indecipherable (if you know what this word means).<br><br>4. If you want to comment, you go comment to LTA and criticise them... Dun do it here.<br><br>"Comment" is used with "on".<br><br>5.
