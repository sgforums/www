              <p>It does not matter whether a nation win or lose in a war. What matters is if the people are prepared <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to make a stand</span> to protect their families, relatives, loved ones and all that they and their forefathers had painstakingly built up.</p>
              <p>Our forefathers faced the brutal japs, whom thought they could annihilate them all, but they couldnt. The next generation grew up stronger, determined never to be bullied again, and so far, no one dares to, for they know what kind of price they will pay in blood if they do so. We may lose, but we will never kneel the way our forefathers did, whom were deprived of organisational trainning by the thieving brits.</p>
              <p>For every minute we delay them, even if at the cost of our own lives, it will mean more fellow citizens - children, women and old folks, will get to be saved when international help arrive.</p>
              <p>North Korea are playing with fire by attempting to produce nukes. It will only lead to nuclear proliferation, with every ruler wanting one. When that happens, the world's humanity will tremble with fear when some nutcase leader such as the tyrant Kim, who had enslaved his citizens, attempts to enslave or hold the rest of world as hostages for ransom, for his mismanagement and failure to his own country .</p>
              <p>If his nuke does strike our country, rest assured N. Korean leaders will NEVER know a peaceful day again as those remnant citizens that are alive, will use our military trainning to bring them down in their own country and wipe out every single one of them for the horror they brought to our country.</p>
              <p>We must never back down, fear or be bullied by the short assed nutcase kim, whom the world joins us in condemnation of him.</p>
              <p> <br>If everyone were to be a coward like you, then we have no right to be called a nation. Let any ambitious foreigner claim our country as theirs, walk right over us and deny our citizenship rights, votes and independence. Cowards have no rights, and should crawl on all fours like a dog and go between the legs of any other man and be thus condemned.</p>
              <p>Go ahead and crawl between another man's legs, lose your dignity, and forever be branded for life, if you can live such a life, for having forsaken all that had been provided for you by a society when you run away with your tail between your legs.</p>

              <p>I had already answered your question many times and in many posts. Refresh your own memory, Uncle Chia. You and I are sitting here in aircon comfort today, in a peaceful world.</p>
              <p>But many of our forefathers did not have such a choice. They faced war and brutality daily, kept stupid by the despicable brits, the avowed protectors and defenders of Singapore, whom fled in the face of the japs. The unled citizens had to make choices, choices of which you and I can either praise or condemn easily today in our comfortable existance and with perfect hindsight.</p>
              <p>If we can forgive criminals whom are rehabilitated and vow never to do their crimes again, how much more must we forgive our ignorant forefathers, who were only young men who were worried if they will die or live the next fateful war day during the next years which seemed like a hellish eternity ?</p>
              <p>Do not ever attempt to sway public opinion with comments such as yours Uncle Chia, for you will only end up making the person whom you hate on a personal basis become a public hero. But then it is your choice. Despicable stupidity seems to be your best trait.</p>

              <p><em>Responding to media queries, Singapore’s Foreign Ministry said <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore takes seriously the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and if the allegation is true, the ministry said <strong>Singapore will act appropriately</strong></span>.</em></p>

              <p>North Korea has declared that any country that stop and board a North Korean ship is tantamount to declaring war on North Korea.</p>

              <p>North Korea President Kim had been insane enough to authorise the assassination of 18 South Korea Government Officials including 4 ministers - when they visited Myanmar in 1984.</p>

              <p>Singapore will not sink the ship.</p>
              <p>That ship will be seized if it enter Singapore water.</p>
              <p>If the crew resist, the ship will be crippled and prevented from leaving once it enters Singapore water.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are too young to know how to swim and prefer to sink, you will not be allowed to sink and will surely be taught how to swim.</p>
              <p>Those who have been through NSF know how to handle those with "sinking thoughts".</p>
