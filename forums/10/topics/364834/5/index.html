              <p>U really think that when war breaks out, there will be time or even the chance to leave the country? Where will u escape to? Msia?? Cos if u think that u are gonna run to switzerland or any other neutral ctry to hide u are so wrong. </p>
              <p>U are giving stupid arguments that only the inexperienced and cowards will give. During a war, while some citizens might get the chance to escape the country, majority will not be able to becos there is a very slim chance of leaving the country. Air traffic will be disrupted so u cant fly out. So what u gonna do? Swim with ur family towards Thailand???</p>
              <p>That is the reason y all of us have to go thru ns. Becos during a war, when u haf nowhere to go but bring the fight to the enemy, then thats wat u gotta do to protect what u care for. </p>
              <p>But then lets not waste our breath on u. I'd rather people like u leave as soon as possible becos u people consume our national resources. Go run to some other country while u still can.</p>

              <p>Leave the poor fella alone. Judging by his posts, I doubt if he is a singaporean, and if he is, he would be a 'was' - an ex citizen here to stir shit. Seems like one of those pathetic and pitiful young men who fled the country so as not to serve his civic duty for society thru NS.</p>
              <p>Here only to justify their cowardice. I had came across many, and could only pity them as they pile on excuses after excuses for their self-centredness and abandonment of our society, which they cannot even convince themselves, haunted by it and wear a mask of arrogance to cover up for their irresponsibilities.</p>
              <p>Let them live, and may they find happiness elsewhere, as we ourselves seek deep within our hearts not to follow them, but to make a stand for our loved ones and those whom we cared for, never to be ever bullied again as our forefathers were.</p>
              <p>We citizens here on our homeland are not heroes, Only simply ordinary men who happen or would happen to live in extra-ordinary times, with the need to perform more than ordinary should a crisis or war be declared, a duty to our loved ones we must not shirk from, come what may.</p>

              <p>In actual truth, nutcase Kim is not really interested in his ships being boarded. It's all bombast. Whether if it's somalian pirates boarding their ships or Singapore navy boarding their ship and seizing their missiles is not an issue with him. And he would not bother with retaliation on other states and be distracted.</p>
              <p>Simply because he is keeping to an even more important schedule , and that is - arming his nuke missile, getting it ready and firing it into Japan. The nuke missile launch should be ready soon, and that's when all hell will break loose, more so for Japan.</p>
              <p>Japan had been a long time avowed enemy of N.Korea, and it would serve as a demostration purpose of his nuke ability. No sense in sending it to Hawaii as it serves no purpose.</p>
              <p>Secondly, it is hoped that with his 4 kilotonne nuke that would effectively wipe out Tokyo, and with the East monsoon winds during the rest, it would put fear to the japs to not retaliate but sue for peace.</p>
              <p>Japan, his closest neighbour, with one stroke thru the nuke, will cease to be a threat to Korea forevermore, and economically minded China with a vast population to feed held at bay with more N.Korean nukes in production</p>
              <p>Thirdly, he wants to gooble up S.Korea whole, for he needs the rich resources there. He will not want to nuke S.Korea and destroy the wealth there. Destroying Japan will put fear into S.Korea to submission, enough to not necessitate the need for further missile strikes.</p>
              <p>If S.Korea will not submit, then it will be gottermerung - all die together using the balance 5 nukes in his possession, as the nutcase knows he will not win in all out battle with S. Korea and US army, using his half starved troops by now and a probably cannibal N. Korean population, with sanctions in full swing.</p>
              <p>His media mouthpiece will scream for days, but only because his missile launch is not ready yet. Once ready, the world can go to hell for all he cares, he intends to fulfilled his crazed and deluded spoilt child fantasy of owning S.Korea before he dies, or destroying it so that no one else will get to own the 2 koreas.</p>
              <p>All tyrants and despots think alike. Hitler did the same and ordered gottomerung - the destruction of everything in Germany including the murder of his fellow citizens just before he pulled the trigger on his ownhead, but his generals 'act blur' and surrendered what's left of bomb razed germany and its population to the allies instead.</p>
              <p>So, Singaporeans got really not much to fear even if we board and seize their ships. It's ultimately Japan who will face destruction from his nuke missile being prepared for launch in this moment even as I write.</p>

              <p>Here are the implications:</p>
              <p>1)  The UN Sanction has a loop hole....US Navy ship cannot board the ship on the highsea without consent unless the ship dock at a port. The Host country will have to take UN resolution in effect if it is suppected.</p>
              <p>2) Last week BBC reported that Myanmar is attacking Karen faction and drove the refuges into Thailand. It is possible that this is a Arm shipment to supply Myanmar military Junta for the offensive.</p>
              <p>3) If this shipt is indeed Arm shipment, Than Singapore is a Transhipment hub for illicit arm shipment via Singapore. A PROOF.....evidents.</p>
              <p>Conclusion:</p>
              <p>Congradulation to PAP relationship with Myanmar....we now can proof ourselves that Singapore is part of the illicit arm transhipment and our relationship with Myanmar has just given ourselves a black eye.</p>

              <p>Singapore is a free port if not for those warnings frm US, we would have allow the shipments to pass through.</p>
              <p>Anyway, North Korea wouldn't waste their precious Nuclear on us, we are not worthy opponent. Maybe the authorities can try talking to AYG NKorean youths for information.</p>

              <p>U really think that when war breaks out, there will be time or
                  even the chance to leave the country? Where will u escape to?
                  Msia?? Cos if u think that u are gonna run to switzerland or any
                  other neutral ctry to hide u are so wrong. </p>
              <p>U are giving stupid arguments that only the inexperienced and
                  cowards will give. During a war, while some citizens might get the
                  chance to escape the country, majority will not be able to becos
                  there is a very slim chance of leaving the country. Air traffic
                  will be disrupted so u cant fly out. So what u gonna do? Swim with
                  ur family towards Thailand???</p>
              <p>That is the reason y all of us have to go thru ns. Becos during
                  a war, when u haf nowhere to go but bring the fight to the enemy,
                  then thats wat u gotta do to protect what u care for. </p>
              <p>But then lets not waste our breath on u. I'd rather people like
                  u leave as soon as possible becos u people consume our national
                  resources. Go run to some other country while u still can.</p>

              <p>I would love to leave the country if i can. This place sucks. Anyway, u are not looking at the political side. u just want dignity u are very self-centered, anyway, most singaporean are like you, i've seen them all. As if u would want to fight in the war, i bet at the losing end you would surrender, with all the other people who are in the war.</p>
