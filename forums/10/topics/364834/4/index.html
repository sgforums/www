              <p>It does not matter whether a nation win or lose in a war. What
              matters is if the people are prepared <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to make a stand</span> to protect
              their families, relatives, loved ones and all that they and their
              forefathers had painstakingly built up.</p>
              <p>Our forefathers faced the brutal japs, whom thought they could
              annihilate them all, but they couldnt. The next generation grew up
              stronger, determined never to be bullied again, and so far, no one
              dares to, for they know what kind of price they will pay in blood
              if they do so. We may lose, but we will never kneel the way our
              forefathers did, whom were deprived of organisational trainning by
              the thieving brits.</p>
              <p>For every minute we delay them, even if at the cost of our
              own lives, it will mean more fellow citizens - children, women
              and old folks, will get to be saved when international help
              arrive.</p>
              <p>North Korea are playing with fire by attempting to produce
              nukes. It will only lead to nuclear proliferation, with every ruler
              wanting one. When that happens, the world's humanity will tremble
              with fear when some nutcase leader such as the tyrant Kim, who had
              enslaved his citizens, attempts to enslave or hold the rest of
              world as hostages for ransom, for his mismanagement and failure to
              his own country .</p>
              <p>If his nuke does strike our country, rest assured N. Korean
              leaders will NEVER know a peaceful day again as those remnant
              citizens that are alive, will use our military
              trainning to bring them down in their own country and wipe out
              every single one of them for the horror they brought to our
              country.</p>
              <p>We must never back down, fear or be bullied by the short assed
              nutcase kim, whom the world joins us in condemnation of him.</p>
              <p> <br> If everyone were to be a coward like you, then we have no right to
              be called a nation. Let any ambitious foreigner claim our country
              as theirs, walk right over us and deny our citizenship rights,
              votes and independence. Cowards have no rights, and should crawl on
              all fours like a dog and go between the legs of any other man
              and be thus condemned.</p>
              <p>Go ahead and crawl between another man's legs, lose
              your dignity, and forever be branded for life, if you can live such
              a life, for having forsaken all that had been provided for you by a
              society when you run away with your tail between your legs.</p>

              <p>SEOUL (Reuters) - A North Korean ship that the United States is shadowing is likely headed for Myanmar, South Korean television reported on Sunday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>YTN channel quoted a South Korean intelligence source as saying the final destination of the Kang Nam looks to be Myanmar, after leaving a North Korean port on Wednesday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>North Korea has raised tensions in the region in the past months by test-firing missiles, restarting a plant to produce arms-grade plutonium and holding a May 25 nuclear test, which put it closer to having a working nuclear bomb.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Analysts say the North's moves are partly aimed at building internal support for its leader, who is believed to have suffered a stroke last year and appears to be laying the foundation for his youngest son to eventually take over the impoverished nation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A Japanese newspaper said that Kim's third son, Kim Jong-un, has assumed the post of acting defence chief, cementing his position as the successor to his father.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U.S. officials have declined to say what the North Korean ship might be carrying but said it was "a subject of interest". North Korea has five similar ships used for weapons trade.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fox News quoted a senior U.S. military source as saying the ship appeared to be heading toward Singapore and that the navy destroyer USS John McCain was positioning itself in case it gets orders to intercept, according to a story on its website.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore, a U.S. ally, said it would act "appropriately" if the vessel heads to its port with a cargo of weapons. Singapore has the world's busiest shipping port and is also the world's top ship refuelling hub.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Kang Nam is the first North Korean ship to be monitored under the new sanctions, adopted this month in response to Pyongyang's May nuclear test. The resolution authorised U.N. member states to inspect North Korean sea, air and land cargo.</p>
