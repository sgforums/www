              <p>Austin News Net, 19 Jun 2009<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Singapore government threatens action against North Korean vessel</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The Singapore government has warned North Korea
              that it will take action if one of their ships, supposedly being chased
              by the US Navy, is carrying nuclear weapons.</strong></span><br> <br> The ship had supposedly been in international waters, where it encountered the US ships.<br> <br> It started to head for Singapore while trying to shake of its pursuers.<br> <br> The North Korean flagged ship is called Kang Nam 1.<br> <br> News reports have said the US Navy will continue to monitor the ship
              under new UN sanctions that seek to prevent Pyongyang from exporting
              weapons.<br> <br> ----------------------------------</p>

              <p>AHN, 18 Jun 2009<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>U.S. Tracking North Korean Ship, May Carry Banned Cargo</strong></span><br> <br> Melvin Baker - AHN Reporter<br> <br> Washington, D.C. (AHN) - The U.S. military is tracking a North Korean ship suspected of carrying banned weapons or technology.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>U.S. military sources said the ship, the Kang Nam,
              left a North Korean port on Wednesday. It is currently in international
              waters off the coast of China and is believed to be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">headed to Singapore</span>.</strong></span><br> <br> The ship is believed to have transported such cargo as missile parts
              and nuclear technology in the past. It is of interest to defence
              officials now because a recent United Nations resolution banned the
              Communist country from trading in such material and authorized naval
              powers to request permission to search the ship.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>North Korea has warned that any attempt to stop its ships would be considered an act of war.</strong></span><br> <br> An alternative action, according to unnamed military sources, would be
              to track the ship until heads to a port to refuel, and then ask that
              country not to allow refueling.<br> <br> -----------------------------<br> <br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>More on <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.

              <p>but this is complicated. Singapore need to consider if boarding ship result in NK attack SK and Japan.</p>

              <p>but i don't think Kang Nam will have enough fuel to reach here. So it looks like it will dock in China.</p>
              <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy is monitoring a North Korean ship at sea under new U.N. sanctions that bar Pyongyang from exporting weapons, including missile parts and nuclear materials, U.S. officials said on Thursday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Officials said the vessel, called Kang Nam, is based in North Korea and became "a subject of interest" after leaving a North Korean port on Wednesday. They could not confirm media reports describing the vessel as North Korean flagged.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, could not say what the ship, now in international waters, might be carrying.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One official said the Kang Nam would be the first North Korean ship to be monitored under the authority of the U.N. sanctions adopted last week after Pyongyang raised tensions by test-firing missiles, restarting a plant to produce arms-grade plutonium and conducting a May 25 nuclear test.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Navy and the Pentagon both declined to comment on the vessel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution last Friday that banned all weapons exports from North Korea and most arms imports into the country. It authorized U.N. member states to inspect North Korean sea, air and land cargo, requiring them to seize and destroy shipped goods that violate the sanctions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, declined to discuss specifics when asked about the ship at a briefing on Thursday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I wouldn't go into any kind of details at this particular point in time, except to say that it's very clear that the resolution prohibits North Korea from shipping these kinds of materials ... from conventional weapons up to fissile material or nuclear weapons," Mullen said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mullen, the highest-ranking officer in the U.S. military, stressed the U.N. resolution would allow the Navy to search a ship only with permission.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a vessel refused to allow a search, Mullen said the home country of any port where the vessel docks would be required to search its cargo.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the Obama administration was also concerned about the possibility of North Korea firing off more missiles, possibly in the direction of Hawaii.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We're obviously watching the situation in the North with respect to missile launches very closely, and we do have some concerns if they were to launch a missile to the West in the direction of Hawaii," he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Without telegraphing what we will do, I would just say we are in a good position -- should it become necessary -- to protect American territory."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gates said he had directed the redeployment of anti-missile assets in the Pacific region, including advanced radar and other defensive systems capable of bringing down medium-range ballistic missiles as a precaution.</p>

              <p>but i don't think Kang Nam will have enough fuel to reach here. So it looks like it will dock in China.</p>
              <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy is monitoring a North Korean ship at sea under new U.N. sanctions that bar Pyongyang from exporting weapons, including missile parts and nuclear materials, U.S. officials said on Thursday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Officials said the vessel, called Kang Nam, is based in North Korea and became "a subject of interest" after leaving a North Korean port on Wednesday. They could not confirm media reports describing the vessel as North Korean flagged.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, could not say what the ship, now in international waters, might be carrying.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One official said the Kang Nam would be the first North Korean ship to be monitored under the authority of the U.N. sanctions adopted last week after Pyongyang raised tensions by test-firing missiles, restarting a plant to produce arms-grade plutonium and conducting a May 25 nuclear test.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Navy and the Pentagon both declined to comment on the vessel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution last Friday that banned all weapons exports from North Korea and most arms imports into the country. It authorized U.N. member states to inspect North Korean sea, air and land cargo, requiring them to seize and destroy shipped goods that violate the sanctions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, declined to discuss specifics when asked about the ship at a briefing on Thursday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I wouldn't go into any kind of details at this particular point in time, except to say that it's very clear that the resolution prohibits North Korea from shipping these kinds of materials ... from conventional weapons up to fissile material or nuclear weapons," Mullen said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mullen, the highest-ranking officer in the U.S. military, stressed the U.N. resolution would allow the Navy to search a ship only with permission.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a vessel refused to allow a search, Mullen said the home country of any port where the vessel docks would be required to search its cargo.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the Obama administration was also concerned about the possibility of North Korea firing off more missiles, possibly in the direction of Hawaii.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We're obviously watching the situation in the North with respect to missile launches very closely, and we do have some concerns if they were to launch a missile to the West in the direction of Hawaii," he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Without telegraphing what we will do, I would just say we are in a good position -- should it become necessary -- to protect American territory."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gates said he had directed the redeployment of anti-missile assets in the Pacific region, including advanced radar and other defensive systems capable of bringing down medium-range ballistic missiles as a precaution.</p>

              <p><br>Sure it will not come here, u all simply do not understand about shipping lines, even if it enter singapore water, it may not be the same ship anymore, somewhere and somehow, the ship cargo will change hands, and KangNam will be an empty vessel upon the arrival of US navy. And once they got nothing, NK will be demanding US of A and the world of unfair and prejudice treatment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore govt are very smart, they know that the ship will not come, thereby proudly threaten and warn NK just to show to the world and support USA.</p>
