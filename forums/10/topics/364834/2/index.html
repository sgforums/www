              <p><strong><span class="title"><span id="ctl00_ContentArea_lblTitle">Suspect North Korean Ship Has Been Detained Several Times for Maritime Violations</span></span></strong><br> <span class="date"><span id="ctl00_ContentArea_lblPostDateTime">Friday, June 19, 2009</span></span></p>
              <div><strong>(CNSNews.com)</strong> – The North Korean cargo ship reportedly
              being tracked by the U.S. military on suspicion of carrying illicit
              cargo has been detained by Asian port authorities at least three times
              for serious maritime problems since it was bought by a North Korean
              company in 2003.<br>  <br> Most recently, the <em>Kang Nam 1</em> was
              held by port officials in Haikou in southern China for nine days in
              June-July 2007, when five “detainable deficiencies” relating to faulty
              documentation and safety and navigation equipment were found, Port
              State Control database searches show.<br>  <br> The ship, owned by the Kumrung Trading Co. Ltd. in Pyongyang, was also
              detained in Hong Kong harbor in October 2006, when 25 deficiencies were
              found, and in Guangzhou, southern China, in July 2006, when 17 problems
              were identified.<br>  <br> U.S. officials have told Fox News and wire services that a North Korean ship named the <em>Kang Nam</em> is being monitored as it makes way along the China coast. It is said to
              be the first of its kind to be tracked under a June 12 United Nations
              Security Council resolution drafted in response to Pyongyang’s recent
              missile and nuclear provocations.<br>  <br> Resolution 1874 requires governments to inspect ships on the high seas
              where there are “reasonable grounds to believe” the vessel is carrying,
              either to or from North Korea, various categories of weapons as well as
              missile- and weapons of mass destruction (WMD)-related cargoes.<br>  <br> Inspections are to take place with the permission of the country whose
              flag the ship is flying. If the flag country refuses to allow at-sea
              inspections, the resolution obliges it to direct its ship to an
              “appropriate and convenient port” for inspection by local authorities.<br>  <br> On June 13, the North Korean government responded to the resolution by
              declaring that “an attempted blockade of any kind by the U.S. and its
              followers will be regarded as an act of war and met with a decisive
              military response.”<br>  <br> “No matter how hard the U.S.-led hostile forces may try all sorts of
              isolation and blockade, the DPRK, a proud nuclear power, will not
              flinch from them,” it said in a statement. DPRK – the Democratic
              People’s Republic of Korea – is the Stalinist state’s official name.<br>  <br> After President Obama met his South Korean counterpart, Lee Myung-bak,
              in Washington this week, Pyongyang issued another statement,
              threatening a “one hundred- or one thousand-fold retaliation” if the
              U.S. and others infringe upon its sovereignty.<br>  <br> At a Pentagon press briefing Thursday, Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of
              the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, was asked what had aroused suspicions
              about the ship now under observation.<br>  <br> “I wouldn’t go into any kind of details at this particular point in
              time,” he replied, “except to say that it’s very clear that the
              resolution prohibits North Korea from shipping these kinds of materials
              … from conventional weapons up to fissile material or nuclear weapons.”<br>  <br> Mullen pointed out that the resolution does not allow for “noncompliant boarding.”<br>  <br> If the ship refused a request to board and inspect, the resolution
              provided for it to be directed to enter port, where the local
              authorities would inspect it, he said.<br>  <br> <strong>‘Scrap metal’</strong><br>  <br> Maritime databases record three North Korean-flagged vessels named <em>Kang Nam</em> – numbered 1, 3 and 5 – all owned by Kumrung Trading. <em>Kang Nam 1</em> and <em>Kang Nam 5</em> are cargo ships while <em>Kang Nam 3</em> is an oil tanker.<br>  <br> In October 2006, Hong Kong’s Marine Department detained both <em>Kang Nam 1</em> and <em>Kang Nam 5</em> within three days of each other.<br></div>

              <p>The
              incident came just weeks after an earlier Security Council resolution
              was passed in response to North Korea’s first nuclear weapons test.
              That resolution, 1718, allowed for the stopping and searching of ships
              suspected to be carrying WMD-related items, while stopping short of
              obliging states to do so.<br>  <br> The timing of the detentions prompted speculation that they could be
              linked to the resolution. South Korean media reported that the U.S.
              government had requested the authorities to search <em>Kang Nam 1</em>, and reports at the time said the U.S. and Japan had tracked the ship since it left North Korea.<br>  <br> Hong Kong officials said the inspection was routine, and Marine
              Department records show that the two ships were among a total of six to
              be detained in Hong Kong that month for maritime violations.<br>  <br> <em>Kang Nam 1</em> was allowed to sail 13 days later, and <em>Kang Nam 5</em>,
              which was found to have 23 deficiencies, was detained for two months
              before it was allowed to leave after making repairs to communications
              and other equipment to meet maritime requirements.<br>  <br> Chinese media at the time reported that the North Korean ships’ usual cargo was scrap metal.<br>  <br> The <em>Kang Nam 1</em> made an appearance again in May 2007, when it docked in a port near
              Rangoon, Burma, prompting suspicions about the possible shipment of
              illicit cargo from one pariah state to another.<br>  <br> The military junta’s foreign ministry subsequently issued a statement
              to foreign embassies, saying the ship had been permitted to dock for
              repairs and to take on supplies after being caught in a storm at sea.<br>  <br> The statement said authorities had inspected the vessel and found no “suspicious cargo or military equipment” on board.<br>  <br> Maritime records show that <em>Kang Nam 1</em> was bought by the North Korean company in 2003, prior to which it flew
              the South Korean flag. Before that, it was registered in St. Vincent
              and Grenadines, a common flag of convenience country.<br>  <br> Previous names for the ship included <em>Jang Yung Ace</em> and <em>Hai Da</em> and it was evidently built at a German shipyard in 1989.<br>  <br> According to a directory of companies available via a North Korean
              government Web site, Kumrung Trading exports “concentrates of gold,
              lead and zinc, base bullion, pyrites, nonmetallic minerals, marine
              products, clothes [and] pure silk sashes.” It imports “heavy-duty
              machines, rolling stocks and parts, pitch, mining equipment and
              materials [and] stone processing tools.”<br>  <br> The directory gave a Pyongyang telephone number. A woman who answered the phone Friday declined to talk and hung up.<br>  <br> <strong>Past seizures</strong><br>  <br> North Korean ships have been interdicted on the high seas in the past.<br>  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> In December 2002, a North Korean ship flying no flag and carrying Scud
              missiles was intercepted in the Arabian Sea by a Spanish warship acting
              on an American request.</strong></span><br>  <br> The ship, crew and cargo were turned over to the U.S. Once it was
              established that the missiles were destined for the government of Yemen
              rather than for Iraq or terrorist groups, it allowed the vessel to go.<br>  <br> The following May, President Bush lay the groundwork for the
              Proliferation Security Initiative, a program designed to prevent WMD
              proliferation by stopping and searching suspect ships. The PSI began
              with 11 participating allies – the U.S., Australia, Japan, Britain,
              Italy, Spain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal and Poland –
              but has since expanded significantly. South Korea, after years of
              reluctance, joined the PSI the day after the North’s second nuclear
              test last month.<br>  <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In April 2003, Australian helicopter-borne special forces landed on a North Korean cargo vessel, the <em>Pong Su</em>, off the Australian coast near Sydney and seized control of the bridge.</strong></span><br>  <br> The dramatic operation took place after the ship’s crew refused orders to head to the nearest port.<br>  <br> The authorities had begun shadowing the <em>Pong Su</em>  after crew offloaded 150 kilograms of heroin by dinghy off the coast about 600 miles to the south-west.<br>  <br> The captain and crew were arrested and charged, but some were
              discharged while four senior officers were later acquitted and
              deported. Pyongyang is believed to use the narcotics trade to finance
              its military and WMD programs.<br>  <br> In 2006 the Royal Australian Air Force sunk the <em>Pong Su</em> with two laser guided bombs, in an exercise designed both as target practice and to send a message to North Korea.<br>  <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In August 2003, a North Korean ship, the <em>Pegaebong</em> sailing from Thailand to North Korea, was searched – at U.S. request –
              by Taiwanese officials when it docked in Taiwan’s Kaohsiung port.</strong></span> The
              Taiwanese found and confiscated a cargo of phosphorus pentasulfide, a
              chemical compound that can be used in insecticides and lubricants, but
              also in making chemical weapons like the deadly nerve agent VX.<br>  <br> Pyongyang protested the seizure, calling it “a criminal act in wanton
              violation of international law” and describing the cargo as a legal
              “reagent necessary for dressing non-ferrous metal.”</p>
