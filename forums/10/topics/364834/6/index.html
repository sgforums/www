                  is a singaporean, and if he is, he would be a 'was' - an
                  ex citizen here to stir shit. Seems like one of those pathetic and
                  pitiful young men who fled the country so as not to serve his civic
                  duty for society thru NS.</p>
              <p>Here only to justify their cowardice. I had came across many,
                  and could only pity them as they pile on excuses after excuses for
                  their self-centredness and abandonment of our society, which they
                  cannot even convince themselves, haunted by it and wear a mask of
                  arrogance to cover up for their irresponsibilities.</p>
              <p>Let them live, and may they find happiness elsewhere, as we
                  ourselves seek deep within our hearts not to follow them, but to
                  make a stand for our loved ones and those whom we cared for, never
                  to be ever bullied again as our forefathers were.</p>
              <p>We citizens here on our homeland are not heroes, Only simply
                  ordinary men who happen or would happen to live in extra-ordinary
                  times, with the need to perform more than ordinary should a
                  crisis or war be declared, a duty to our loved ones we must not
                  shirk from, come what may.</p>

              <p>As stated, i am a Singaporean. Being a Singaporean does not mean i have to love the country and boasts like its the best of the best. its you people who are self-centered, not looking at different side of views. you just want dignity. And i would love to go to other countries to escape NS. Did u not realise each "excuses" i give u also gave an excuse? Aren't u arrogant too? I dont believe u will never be bullied again when u're at war, in fact u will be bullied much further.</p>

              <p>The UN has only passed a resolution to sanction North Korea to prevent it from exporting weapons and nuclear material.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/la-fg-un-north-korea13-2009jun13,0,2828544.story">The U.N. sanctions encourage, but do not require, member countries to interdict North Korean ships they believe to be carrying banned weapons. If the ships refuse permission to be boarded, they are to be directed to a nearby port for inspection. </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The report had it that the North Korean ship was sailing close to China's territorial waters but is still in international sea lanes.</p>
              <p>The US Naval Ships cannot do force the North Korean Captain to allow boarding.</p>
              <p>A forced boarding in international waters is tantamount to a "declaration of war" - as already stated by North Korea.</p>
              <p>China has joined the other members of the UN Security Council to sanction North Korea but has also objected to the interdiction and boarding of North Korean ships.</p>
              <p>The US Navy can force a boarding but will risk an all out war in the Korean Peninsular.</p>
              <p>The next best option available is to force the North Korean ship to enter a port that is willing to force the North Korean ship to allow inspection of the cargo.</p>
              <p>The North Korean ship has avoided calling all ports along its route - as it passes Taiwan, Hongkong, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand; and going pass Singapore to head for Myanmar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps the noisy pussy will talk to Kim Il-sung to get the North Korean Captain to steer the ship closer to Indonesia, and see if a neutral Indonesia will help the US Navy to interdict the North Korean ship.</p>

              <p>Speaking at the annual family day celebrations at Jalan Kayu, Uncle Lee said: "Bonuses are down, unemployment has gone up, not as much as we feared, but it is higher than it would be. And we can see the effects as MPs, because in our Meet—the—People sessions, the numbers have gone up."</p>
              <p>And Uncle Lee said the government will help those looking for jobs and assistance.</p>
              <p>He said: "The government has done what it needs to do through the GST offsets, the Resilience Package and the many schemes which Singapore has in the Budget and off the Budget, in order to help people in the ways which would help them to help themselves — keep their jobs, find new jobs and help their families."</p>
              <p>However, the Prime Minister stressed that help must be given at different levels.</p>
              <p>Tackling the economic crisis in Singapore also involves the "many helping hands" approach. And one programme which the Jalan Kayu division has launched is called Heartstrings. It will benefit a hundred needy families in the division.</p>
              <p>Wee Siew Kim, MP, Ang Mo Kio GRC, said: "By using the Heartstrings approach, the local grassroots organisations, which is the RC, can reach out to them directly with a package of household necessities. We intend to make it an on—going project, it is not meant to be mandate just for these trying economic times.</p>
              <p>"And we intend to start it small with a package of S$40—50 a month on the basis that we can sustain it. We also (that) intend every two months, the RC works with the other entities in the constituency, whether it is the merchants association, mosque or temple, and together they can reach out to the needy households in our midst, and the households also see that these entities are working together as part of a community."</p>

              <p>Hope you enjoyed your laughter. The Pakistani terrorists laughed too, back in the 90s when they hijacked our SIA plane and ridiculed our small little red dot military as easy meat. But they were the ones who ended up on meat hooks instead.</p>
              <p>This is no longer the 90s. It's 2009 and our military had not stop improving since then but had evolved and progressed in leaps and bounds in built up and tech advancement.</p>
              <p>Actions speaks louder than words.</p>
              <p>When that time comes to act, you will see and may your finally be able to solemly rest your heart and say a final rest in peace for those who had perished in the hands of our enemies, if the enemies dare engage us in an armed conflict when diplomacy fails.</p>

              <p>Hope you enjoyed your laughter. The Pakistani terrorists laughed too, back in the 90s when they hijacked our SIA plane and ridiculed our small little red dot military as easy meat. But they were the ones who ended up on meat hooks instead.</p>
              <p>This is no longer the 90s. It's 2009 and our military had not stop improving since then but had evolved and progressed in leaps and bounds in built up and tech advancement.</p>
              <p>Actions speaks louder than words.</p>
              <p>When that time comes to act, you will see and may your finally be able to solemly rest your heart and say a final rest in peace for those who had perished in the hands of our enemies, if the enemies dare engage us in an armed conflict when diplomacy fails.</p>

              <p>One thing is a certainty.</p>
              <p>When the chips are down, the SAF will be mobilised.</p>
              <p>The billions spent over the years - on equipment and training in Singapore and overseas - is all done not for nothing.</p>
              <p>Singapore will not be like Kuwait, where someone can walk right in and takeover Singapore in 48 hours.</p>
              <p>It will be sheer stupidity for North Korea to send a missile towards Singapore, and even worst to hijack a Singapore vessel as retaliaton - as the North Koreans will face the full weight of a response from the UN.</p>
              <p>Kim Jong-il may not get to see his son succeed him, as the Kim dynasty will be over when a UN sanctioned a retaliation towards North Korea for an unprovoked attack against Singapore.</p>
