              <p>What is this "diverse democratic learning"?? Are you refering to the Liberal Arts?</p>
              <p><br>If by anything, the real problem in Singapore for our engineers in particular is a lack of exposure to "proper real life engineering". This is largely due to our economy lacking a diverse array of engineering jobs. An engineer is only as good as his skills and experience. Both of which need serious nurturing.</p>

              <p>....I can't really see what you mean by repressed learning. It's not like we're a communist/theocratic state and prohibited to research certain sciences. Our universities are still young by comparsion to say harvard and cambridge, i say give them time.</p>
              <p>The answer is perhaps much simpler, because our ancestors are migrant workers they would prefer that their children find a job in the outside world after their studies than be a scholar.</p>
              <p>I mean, from young we are taught to study hard and find a decent paying job. Being a researcher/scholar sounds too vague a future for their pragmatic way of looking at things.  At least, that's how i see it.</p>
              <p>Whether we want to be stimulated to learn more and do research is up to our own personal choices. Our education system needs work yes but so far it has done a adequate job.</p>
              <p>Shouldn't we blame parents first for not giving their chilldren the curiousity and mental stimulations before we push all the blame to the education system? They're only in charge of giving the information and knowledge, how we chose to utillize it is not for them to be responsible for.</p>

              <p><br>This is one of the few sensible statements I've read in this forum. The illerate people are not the uneducated people. Many schools and universities impact knowledge, but not much in terms of education.</p>
              <p>For imparting knowledge, NUS does too well, but sad to say not so much in education.</p>
              <p>Not all the universities in Australia are good at all subjects. Achitecture firms in Singapore prefer local graduates than OZ graduates, and they pay local graduates higher.</p>
              <p>One thing for sure, if you want easy life in the university, go Australian.</p>

              <p><br> If by anything, the real problem in Singapore for our engineers in particular is a lack of exposure to "proper real life engineering". This is largely due to our economy lacking a diverse array of engineering jobs. An engineer is only as good as his skills and experience. Both of which need serious nurturing.</p>

              <p>i agree with u, engineering in singapore is close to useless...My nephew studied it in poly  in the late 1990s and he says its just like studying pre school..facts book and  calculations and cough them all out during exams.</p>

              <p><br>you haven't answered the question, what is repressive learning? and for your info, fresh graduate from AUS are not paid any higher than the local grads for sure. And even in Singapore, the SMU grads in business are getting higher pay than those from NUS. It is not just the universities that counts, and definitely not because those are australian universities!! the days when everything overseas are better are gone, that you can take it to the bank.</p>

              <p>sgd,</p>
              <p>whether you get an education in nus or not, or anywhere else, depends on yourself. you make the best of the situation you are in. how involved you are, your outlook and what you want to get out of the 3/4 years in tertiary or any school will pad on to the knowledge that will come as standard.</p>
              <p>fancy you generalizing about nus. are you a nus grad? otherwise, you should refrain from talking about things you have not experienced 1st hand. if you are, don't blame the uni for the lack of education you received. i am not sure what is your inadequacy. maybe you can share. do you even know what you are talking about.</p>
              <p>your last statement is equally shallow, give credit where credit is due. australia, amongst other countries, are recognized for their world class tertiary education offered to the masses. btw, what is an `easy life' in your view? </p>
              <p>lastly, robertteh's comment is nothing sensible. what he said is true, however, it is the most partial view anyone with strong emotional attachment to anything(school included) will say.</p>
              <p>BK's swiss double cheese is the best burger in the world wide world. a sensible statement?</p>
