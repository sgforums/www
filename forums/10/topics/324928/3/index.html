              <p>Enough already... US education is the best! Singapore Uni are for bookworms and aristocrat wannabes; Aussie Uni are for lazy bump-arounds who wants a short-cut to a tertiary education</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In my years of interviewing and hiring, except of the very few bright ones (mostly NUS; NTU students are geeks), most local graduates think that just because they have a local degree, the world owes them a living.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Beside US graduates, those who did their degree part-time usually turn out better too and probably why SMU students are catching my attention and preferred over NUS and NTU grads. Aussies? They come in and tell you they know everything but expect others to do their work for them. I’ve hired a few and fired just as many.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For me.. US is first choice, follow-by SMU, then part-timers and then probably UK graduates.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Local grads have to try really, really hard to get my attention and trust.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But that’s just my view as an hiring manager…</p>

              <p>I am sure from the few engineering undergrads' complaints
              about the lack of opportunities for internship, I know it for sure
              in the petrochemical industries that Chemical engineers are much
              preferred over mechanical and electrical engineers. But that is
              from the few I know, and the petrochemical industries only.</p>
              <p>I can be wrong. I don't know about all the other industries.</p>

              <p>Internship is different, because mostly, interns do not contribute a lot to the company; rather, the company contributes the training and interns might not even return to the company after their internship period ends, thus in some cases, companies are rather reluctant to hire interns.</p>
              <p>From what I know, the industries that electrical engineers are relevant and applicable are far and many. This includes the manufacturing industries, the research areas (IME, ASTAR), the military defence (DSO, DSTA, CSIT, ST Kinetics), system engineers and maintenance, etc. So I believe it is not right to say that these engineers will find little relevance in Sg industries.</p>
              <p>However, chemical engineering graduates might find it easier to find a job perhaps because their numbers are far less than electrical/mechanical engineering graduates; that's the only reason I can think of if that's what you have observed.</p>

              <p>That's what I told my friend when he was demoralised for getting quite a bad CAP, with only year 4 (1 year) left.</p>
              <p>I told him that he should work very hard for an A for his final year project, because that shows that he can do work well, and the A is achieved by impressing his professors.</p>
              <p>He did get an A for his Final Year Project in the end, and I'm happy for him.</p>

              <p>Yeah i am stupid, and Aussie education is inferior rite?...Listen to this NUS is nothing when compared to 100 year old Unis . So where did out template for education come from?..Its from those western countries lamer...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And local MNCs tapping into local educated population now is no longer valid since the floodgate for FTs has been opened. So if yr argument hold true, why are they not hiring local grads if NUS is so good over foreign grads in singapore. Go and have a reality check on why. A guy in a backyard in the US can have  invented a car which runs entirely using water as fuel and your NUS grads did sh&amp;t after graduating. What happened to their superior mathematical and reasoning skills. The only thing when  u learn this in singapore very well is during Primary and secondary school. And thats about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On FYI, about yr argument on the US quantum physics thing, Let me tell u why they let u touch on the surface of that topic is because u are clearly so "best" compared to their own scholars who sent men to the moon in 1969, invented electricity, invented Windows operating system and  invented all other things which your NUS now runs on.. U are "right", the US are lousier than Singapore's NUS. And so are inferior degrees from India and China who are chief engineers in Asus and Microsoft. Lamer.</p>

              <p>Yeah i am stupid, and Aussie education is inferior
                  rite?...Listen to this NUS is nothing when compared to 100 year old
                  Unis . So where did out template for education come from?..Its from
                  those western countries lamer...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And local MNCs tapping into local educated population
                  now is no longer valid since the floodgate for
                  FTs has been opened. So if yr argument hold true, why are they
                  not hiring local grads if NUS is so good over foreign grads in
                  singapore. Go and have a reality check on why. <span style="color: #ff0000;">A guy in a
                  backyard in the US can have  invented a car which runs
                  entirely using water as fuel and your NUS grads did sh&amp;t after
                  graduating.</span> What happened to their superior mathematical and
                  reasoning skills. The only thing when  u learn this in
                  singapore very well is during Primary and secondary school. And
                  thats about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On FYI, about yr argument on the US quantum physics thing,
                  Let me tell u why they let u touch on the
                  surface of that topic is because u are clearly
                  so "best" compared to t<span style="color: #ff0000;">heir own scholars who sent men to
                  the moon in 1969, invented electricity, invented Windows operating
                  system and  invented all other things which your NUS
                  now runs on</span>.. U are "right", the US are lousier than
                  Singapore's NUS. And so are inferior degrees from India and
                  China who are chief engineers in Asus and Microsoft.

              <p>Haha...listen..u are the one who started to look down on our education system. What I am trying to say is NUS is NOT as lousy as any aussie uni. U started to put words into my mouth!!</p>
              <p>For the underline red part, pls use ur brain.....spore has a smaller population and we are equipped to work as an effective workforce, not some inventors. Ur argument always base on singularities...so all american can work in their backyard to create cars that run on water???</p>
              <p>BTW, show me the link of the person who uses WATER as FUEL to run car??? U mean HYDROGEN CELLS using WATER as source of hydrogen??? We have that project in NUS. And if u believe water can be literally used as fuel, then u are as stupid as president Yudhoyono who believes in a conman to produce fuel out of water!!!</p>
              <p>And let me tell you why we still cannot match top unis in the USA...it is because while they have started researches , we are still struggling with colonism ....they, the whites are responsible for inhibiting our technological growth. TIME IS THE FACTOR HERE!!! NOT QUALITY OF EDUCATION!!!!!!!</p>
              <p>FYI, majority of the work force is still breed by spore education system...u have any idea how much foreign students govt have accepted and how they are recruited into the work force????</p>
              <p>If they (the MNCS) really wanted FTS....it makes more sense to set their companies in India or China ONLY....because locals are too "stupid" in ur context to work.</p>
              <p>U would better just go to ur AUS and stay put there....spore dont need a Angmoh wannabe here....</p>
              <p>FYI, the main argument here is U belittling our local unis using nonsensical argument...and that is why I fire at ur backside...I did not claim NUS to be the most superior....dun put words in my mouth!!! U just OVERATE ur AUSSIE UNIS and UNDERATE NUS!!!!</p>

              <p>U see the problem with FTs causing to us sporean is that they demanded a lower pay. It makes economic sense to employ them, not because we are inferior.</p>
              <p>That is why I would say, local grads should accept the initial lower pay and prove ur worth in the companies. Many of my friends who have master degree stared with pathetic pay of 3k....but now, they earn nearly 10k per month....after working for a mere 3 years.</p>
              <p>If we have no faith in ourselves...how are we going to compete in the future??</p>
              <p>Sporean esp the younger generation are definitely more knowleageble than average ppl in the world.</p>
              <p>It is up to us how to trust ourselves and make full use of our knowleadge.</p>
