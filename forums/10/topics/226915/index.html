Hence your academic and CCA achievements matter, but not your socio-economic background. The government uses scholarships to rope in the top talents, not to help those in need to attain higher education.<br><br>I believe there are some scholarships in Singapore awarded on a needs-basis, but these are relatively rare, with only a handful given out each year.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I guess there are two main arguements that can be identified from this issue. One is that the 'meritocratic' means in awarding scholarship irregardless of income background will allow individuals to be awarded for their academic achievements based upon their talents and not their income background. Hence, the scholarship system will effectively identitfy 'talent' and not be transformed into a welfarist mechanic. Others will argue that those who are academically inclinded possess the resources in the first place which enable them to succeed academically. Hence, Scholarships should function as a means to re-allocate resources to those who never had a chance to possess of equal opportunity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some 25 years ago, when we applied for PSC scholarships, I can say that a large proportion of those awarded scholarships were in the low to lower middle income groups.

Now you got the CCAs and what's not to get into JC - poor kids don't have that opportunity. Some scholarships have the criteria of doing community work....well how is the poor going to help the poor when they have to help their own parents out to survive?</div>

Scholarships are awarded to kids who have achieved outstanding acadamic grades in their respective fields...<br><br>But more and more of these vehicles which helps promising students, are being given to those who are better off yet not necessarily of great intellect and maturity...<br><br>Tell me if i'm wrong...the average scholarship achiever now, has hardcore tuition which their parents are able to afford, and on top of that probably has studied in a top JC...And their parents drill them into success, where there is no room for failure...thats the elite child that Singapore is churning today...<br><br>And the normal Singaporean family (which you say is not poor), tells their kid who is studying in a lower-end JC, "study hard cause thats all you have. Sorry we cant give you anything extra, we can just pay you your school fees and thats that." The kid studies hard, but he cant achieve the same level of competency as the kid who has even better support.<br><br>And your question: Are these children as hungry as we were for success and how much are they prepared to sacrifice to achieve a better life?<br><br>I feel that abit sweeping, not all the children are not hungry, then again are you assuming the reason they dont get the scholarship is because they are not hungry?<br><br>25 years ago, i can say you were right. Now? It's not the same...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sure nobody has any qualms about giving scholarships to those deserving, irregardless of financial background. However, more has to be done to aid those who are not as academically inclinded, but are determined to craft up a life for themselves and are curtailed by their financial background. Afterall, one of the failings of meritocracy are those who get left behind becuase they do not measure up with the 'cream of the crop'. Adopting a mentality that these are 'social repurcussions' is just unacceptable and inhumane. I believe there is a need for trust or funds to be set up not just for deserving students, but for those eager and yearning to reach a higher plateau, but are held back because of their social and financial situation.</div>

Scholarships can be viewed as a sort of opportunity for socio-economic advancement, of which there are many others. These people don't need scholarships; they need other things, like say, venture capitalist funds, to help them set up businesses and live their dreams.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Tell me if i'm wrong...the average scholarship achiever now, has hardcore tuition which their parents are able to afford, and on top of that probably has studied in a top JC...And their parents drill them into success, where there is no room for failure...thats the elite child that Singapore is churning today...<br></blockquote>What's the evidence for that statement? On the other hand, you will find that the scholars selected have all performed well both in academic studies and in extra-curricular activities, based on the stringent selection criteria of the PSD. But I agree scholars tend to come from a top secondary school or JC but that has nothing to do with wealth. Any poor but talented student can get into a top secondary school or JC, based on his PSLE and O level results.<br><br>Sure, many may have had lots of tuition, but if most students have it nowadays, it will not help. In any case, the truly talented will do well despite not having any tuition at all, whether he be rich or poor. Tuition may push the mediocre into consideration for a scholarship but at the end of the day, the poor but talented student will not lose out. There are a serie sof rigorous interviews and assessments before a scholarship is awarded and the selectors are experienced enough to distinguish the truly talented from the mediocre made good with tuition.<br><br>And getting a scholarship is not the end of the matter. You have to do well consistently in your examinations in University to retain it. Many people do not realize this but I know of a President's scholar who lost his scholarship because he failed his examinations in Uni and made to give back his scholarship. Of course that is a rare, isolated instance and despite the care taken in selection, the selectors are human and can be wrong. That chap is now very successful in his career in any case. But it sends the message loud and clear: a scholar who does not perform will be thrown out unceremoniously.<br></div>
