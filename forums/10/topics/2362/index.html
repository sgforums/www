I took the train before and it was very very slow, slower than taking the coach.<br><br>Such a tactic would hardly have the element of surprise and the train would be easily derailed or bombed by the SAF.<br><br>What is more likely to happen in the event of a war, is that you will see a long line of SAF soldiers lining up along the Malaysian railway land from Tg Pagar to Woodlands, and then when the war starts, they will suddenly rush in and take it over. (This is meant as a joke)<br><br>Whilst on the topic of railways, note that if you ever take the train from Tg. Pagar to my, you must keep your train ticket until you return to sg because the my immigration at Tg Pagar will not stamp your passport. They will not do it because doing so might anger the sg authorities who might interpret it as a claim that the railway land is part of my. As such you have to produce your train ticket to the my immigration on your return to sg to prove that you came in legally, and also make sure that they write in your passport that you came in by train, otherwise you might have problems next time you go there.<br><br>Actually it is faster to take the coach, so i wouldn't bother with the train unless they improve their track so that they can go faster.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I haven't fire yet but got touch before...so these are my views.<br><br>The SAR21 is heavier than the m16...about 1kg more but it felt lighter becoz it's compact and short compare with the M16. Which is longer and very "ting teh" at times.<br><br>The SAR21 is bullpup designed.....meaning the magazine is at the butt. This can be odd for older soldiers who are used to the M16. In the M16, you click press the button with your index finger and the Magazine come out. The SAR21 button is at the back so you need t use the other hand to press. Very odd position :/<br><br>The scope is cool. You see clearer and it's easier to aim. Dun need to aglin any front sight and rear sight coz there's just a crossshair in the scope. They also cum with rubber covers to cover the scope if not use.<br>I ask those who use before. They say raining the scope sometimes "fog out" or if got water it blur the vision. So if not using better cover the scope to protect.<br><br>Cocking the weapon need some getting used to. The charging handle is relatively difficult the pull the bolt back cause the handle is twistable and rather flimsy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> It's also rather stiff when I tried out with the display set but it could be due to the lack of oil in the bolt. (m16 sometimes also like that)<br><br>One thing that I concern about the rifle is whether does it have a "combat loading" function. You see, the M16's bolt will locked back when the last round has been fired. So you just need to change the magazine and ease the spring so the bolt will slam back with the new round. They don't teach these in BMT due to safety resons with units will teach.<br><br>I spoke to the demostrator about it, he say that SAR21 also has comabt loading function but it's hard to simulate without a round. hmmm.....<br><br>I also scared the SAR21 will make you deaf. The chamber is near to your face so it'll surely be very loud when you fire.</div>
