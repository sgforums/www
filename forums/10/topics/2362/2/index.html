"key assholes"</div></blockquote>they wont head for tanjong pagar if they can get through woodland checkpoint.<br><br>heading for tanjong pagar is as good as heading right into the fist of the SAF.<br><br>the better strategy if ever they breech woodland is to drop troops all along the entire railway track and start to hit and kill anything they come across.<br><br>for every 600 unarmed singaporean man they killed, they effectively eliminates an entire reserve battalion.<br><br>secondly, by spreading throughout singapore, it will tied down singapore forces to hunt them down, they could also hamper military mobilization if they could hit power station and communication towers with spies and traitors already in singapore.<br><br>thirdly, if they managed to obtain local malay support, they would be given protection, cover and supplies that could stretch their terrorism for a much longer time and perhaps becomes more effective as they can blend into the local population in the day and don the military uniform at night.<br><br>fourth, their presence in the heartland of singapore would cause anxiety and affect the morals of SAF reservist who are called back to camp, fearful of the safety of their family members.<br><br>fifth, certain elements could attempt to poison the water supply, set fire to key industries, assasination of key personal and govt officials and shaken the buissness confidence in singapore plus taking the glow out of the invincible SAF.<br><br>sixth, they could be used to secure a beachhead for additional malaysian soldiers coming by speed boats if not a counter invasion into singapore.<br><br>seventh, they could be used to subvert local sentiments by spreading distrust between malays and other races or even attempt to start a racial riots with the aim of tearing the SAF along racial lines.<br><br>eigth, they could be used to take out strategic targets like AMMO base, SAM sites or mortar the airfield.<br><br>ninth, the train could carry large amount of ordanance to arm and equip malaysian soldiers already in singapore as workers or visitors or even local malays who may wish to join them in their 'liberation'.<br><br>IN short, if they breech woodland checkpoint.... we are gonna be in for one heck of a nightmare.<br><br>it gets worst if malaysia forward base its military camp nearer towards singapore. the train attack could buy MAF precious time to rush to the johor straits and cross over before SAF can react.<br><br>the key is to hit and nullify SAF in under 6 to 12 hours.<br><br>BUT this is of course a worst case scenario. hehehee<br><br>in times of crisis between singapore and malaysia, rest assured that (according to a source) the woodland CIQ, isnt so simple a CIQ, in fact, if need to, it can stop the malaysian train in its track.<br><br>and if singapore govt or intelligience services find something odd, they have every authority to simply tear up the rail tracks up to woodland CIQ. without tracks.... hehee<br><br>and if the malaysian protess against the removal of the tracks... tough luck for them, cause according to the IPA between the 2 govt, singapore effectively own the tracks and the land around the tracks  after the woodland CIQ is completed for 5 years.<br><br>and even if singapore dont own those tracks, please understand that the land of the KTM is still singapore's sovereign territory, meaning.... if singapore desires... it can be place under police or military control or supervision. and when neccessary... the KTM service can be suspended indefinitely as and when singapore desires by simply closing the border.<br><br></div>

Russia has never liked muslims, especially after afghanistan.  Worst of all, people like Osama bin Laden isn't making the muslims look good at all.

Why am I not surprised?</div></blockquote>because, to the rest of the world, the muslims of various regions and races are little more then the same wolf wearing different color sheep skins.<br><br>And for a long time, even CHINA has been fighting the muslims. so it would seems that the muslims are getting onto everyones nerve. just that nobody wants an all out war against those pesky nuts because they all have greater problems on their hand than to worry about these troublemakers.<br><br>Sadly, the smaller nations now bear the brunt of the those rodents incessant attempt to expand and breed. in time.... the superpowers might decide to bridge their differences and see to the end of these rodents tyranny and squish them like the stink bug that they are, like iraq.<br><br>those muslims thought that IRAQ having fought a 8 year war with IRAN would have the most capable armed forces in the muslim world, shocking for them to realise that their so call elite brothers are little more then a bunch of useless rojaks when compared with the US. they are like the frogs in the well and see the sky the size of a fifty cent coin.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I bet those ragheads who attacked Israel during the Yom Kippur war found out the same thing.  Sure, some of those ragheads in the middle-east are veterans, but they are technologically inferior.  I suspect there is this extraordinary mentality in them that makes them lose fights like that.  They think that they are being suppressed by foreign powers when its them who go stepping onto everyone's shoes.<br><br>In anycase, if Israel loses temper with the Palestinians, Palestine is gonna dissappear under a pile of smoke and rubble.  Of course, if that happens, probably all the arab nations will go to war with Israel under their Muslim banner.  Of course, not that they can defeat the IDF... The only Arab nation that will tip the scales in the favor of the ragheads will be Egypt.<br><br>If Egypt enters the war... most likely the United States will, as well as Half of NATO. Russia will benefit as they can sell more tanks and equipment to the ragheads.  Keep an eye on the Israel palestine conflict, if there is gonna be a war, its gonna start there.</div>
