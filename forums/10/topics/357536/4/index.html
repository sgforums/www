              <p>The logic is. As long as there are jams along a certain stretch
              of road, they only need to sign a paper to erect a gantry to
              collect money. Simple? Not an insult, just a friendly reminder that
              1 solution does not work for all the problems. They are simply
              pushing the problem to other part of the world.</p>
              <p>Imagine the fustration of paying to go into Orchard and paying

              <p>Remember the old days COE was at sky rocketing price while our roads was using the RPS $2 per day license? Back then traffic was pretty smooth.</p>
              <p><br>Simply because pop growth is one thing.. Another thing which I believe is e main cause is e increased traffic load which meant longer travelling time for the buses as well. End up there's only 2 ways the operator can do, either with the longer journey increase the number of buses to maintain the same freq or to keep with the same number of buses deployed but at a longer waiting time.</p>
              <p>Furthermore like I've mentioned, people no longer observe all those things like yellow boxes meant for buses to exit the bus bay easier or to keep right to be able to turn righ at the following junction to proceed to their destination i.e. turning right from Nicoll Highway to proceed to SMU/ Orchard Rd.</p>

              <p>Remember the old days COE was at sky rocketing price while our roads was using the RPS $2 per day license? Back then traffic was pretty smooth.</p>
              <p><br>Simply because pop growth is one thing.. Another thing which I believe is e main cause is e increased traffic load which meant longer travelling time for the buses as well. End up there's only 2 ways the operator can do, either with the longer journey increase the number of buses to maintain the same freq or to keep with the same number of buses deployed but at a longer waiting time.</p>
              <p>Furthermore like I've mentioned, people no longer observe all those things like yellow boxes meant for buses to exit the bus bay easier or to keep right to be able to turn righ at the following junction to proceed to their destination i.e. turning right from Nicoll Highway to proceed to SMU/ Orchard Rd.</p>

              <p>whatever, to them they take it that ERP can solve the problem and besides it is money making for them.    Money cannot solve every problem.</p>

              <p>as if they don't travel on CTE during peak.  sometimes jam occurs so what do they mean by more time spend with family.    talks so much cock and be careful later get choked by it.</p>

              <p>ERP is only useful..for now.</p>
              <p>look at the number of cars on Singapore's roads now, and this is not including the ever-growing immigrants/professional workers here who just might be able to purchase cars in a few years time.</p>
              <p>guess what? if you have like, a million cars running all over Singapore any time, ERP wont be able to stop only the problem, because cars will just take the routes which does not have ERP! (logical)</p>
              <p>and so what, you gonna start to build ERPs EVERYWHERE?</p>
              <p>imagine, ERP turn on, pass through 1 time $2 or so, and in particularly crowded places like rochor..imagine the $2 notes flying up into the sky, and landing into god-knows-whose pockets.</p>

              <p>I feel sad for those who are brainwashed by state propaganda.</p>
              <p>There should be a certain level of media freedom to allow the public to be aware of diverse views and to develop critical thinking skills.</p>
              <p>If the media in a state is monopolised by a small clique of people, they will use it to serve their narrow interests and agenda and the people will be intellectually retarded and become brainwashed.</p>
              <p>This is the reason why people keep on voting for PAP.</p>
