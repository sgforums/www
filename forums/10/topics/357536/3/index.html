To a certain extent, ERP may deter some from driving to work. However, as we can see as driver on the road, ERP DOES NOT reduce traffic flow at all. This is a real problem and not one just to condemn the system as it is costly for us drivers. If you would bother to look around, the problem of traffic jams are very real. It is a daily occurance.</p>

Idiotic motorcycles who take up 2-3 lanes at the same time. Lorries who overtake you then slow to almost a complete halt, etc. It is because of people like these who caused a huge empty space on the road and refuses to let others fill up the space. If you can imagine. Should we be able to fill up more of the road, we can move more vehicles. Shouldn't our stupid "traffic police" do more than just make themselves invisible and take photos to earn commission? If need be, we can employ our own photographer to take nicer pictures of our cars. Thank you.</p>

              <p>yup, the effectiveness goes down. How effective it is, i can

              Than BAM! you can see if ERP is working or not. Will traffic be as

              <p>Dude, the thing is not a matter of turning off ERP or what shiet.</p>
              <p>We have been led to believe COE will curb the amount of cars on our road. However, is this happening? Same for ERP.</p>
              <p>If you do not want to restrict the car population on the road, then you simply enhance your roads. But since you don't drive, we shall have nothing more to have a meaningful discussion.</p>
              <p>In addition, road congestion is a problem worldwide. Just that other government does not make their citizens pay for their lack of competencies. That is why the people there have 1 lesser thing to complain.</p>

              <p>This topic is ERP leh, why out of nowhere, some pap bashing come in? lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of the ERP needs to be modified. For eg, the CTE exit via Havelock Rd that leads to Chinatown or Raffles Place. The erp ends at 8pm. Quite pointless cos by 7pm on weekdays, you dun expect much traffic going that way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the purpose of ERP is to make roads faster and smoothen traffic, then what an oxymoron by jamming up other roads. And the worse thing is if I wana get home for dinner on time, I have to pay ERP also.</p>

              <p>Some of the ERP needs to be modified. For eg, the CTE exit via
              Havelock Rd that leads to Chinatown or Raffles Place. The erp ends
              at 8pm. Quite pointless cos by 7pm on weekdays, you dun expect much
              traffic going that way.</p>

              <p>If the purpose of ERP is to make roads faster and smoothen
              traffic, then what an oxymoron by jamming up other roads. And the
              worse thing is if I wana get home for dinner on time, I have to pay
              ERP also.</p>

Not an insult, just a friendly reminder that 1 solution does not work for all the problems. They are simply pushing the problem to other part of the world.</p>

              <p>No need logic dude. We are irrelavant people who only know how to complain. Haha.</p>
              <p>The logic is. As long as there are jams along a certain stretch of road, they only need to sign a paper to erect a gantry to collect money. Simple? Not an insult, just a friendly reminder that 1 solution does not work for all the problems. They are simply pushing the problem to other part of the world.</p>
              <p>Imagine the fustration of paying to go into Orchard and paying to go home.</p>

              <p>the chunk is really chunky. if you did not only complain about
              ERP, than my post about only complaining does not apply to you. It
              will apply more for people who only complain and offer no
