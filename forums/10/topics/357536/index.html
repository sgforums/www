              <p>Queuing conundrums <br><br>Sep 11th 2008<br>From The Economist print edition<br>Strange as it might seem, closing roads can cut delays<br><br><br>DRIVERS are becoming better informed, thanks to more accurate and timely advice on traffic conditions. Some services now use sophisticated computer-modelling which is fed with real-time data from road sensors, satellite-navigation systems and the analysis of how quickly anonymous mobile phones pass from one phone mast to another. Providing motorists with such information is supposed to help them pick faster routes. But the latest research shows that in some cases it may slow everybody down.<br><br>Hyejin Youn and Hawoong Jeong, of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, and Michael Gastner, of the Santa Fe Institute, analysed the effects of drivers taking different routes on journeys in Boston, New York and London. Their study, to be published in a forthcoming edition of Physical Review Letters, found that when individual drivers each try to choose the quickest route it can cause delays for others and even increase hold-ups in the entire road network. <br> <br><br>The physicists give a simplified example of how this can happen: trying to reach a destination either by using a short but narrow bridge or a longer but wide motorway. In their hypothetical case, the combined travel time of all the drivers is minimised if half use the bridge and half the motorway. But that is not what happens. Some drivers will switch to the bridge to shorten their commute, but as the traffic builds up there the motorway starts to look like a better bet, so some switch back. Eventually the traffic flow on the two routes settles into what game theory calls a Nash equilibrium, named after John Nash, the mathematician who described it. This is the point where no individual driver could arrive any faster by switching routes. <br><br>The researchers looked at how this equilibrium could arise if travelling across Boston from Harvard Square to Boston Common. They analysed 246 different links in the road network that could be used for the journey and calculated traffic flows at different volumes to produce what they call a “price of anarchy” (POA). This is the ratio of the total cost of the Nash equilibrium to the total cost of an optimal traffic flow directed by an omniscient traffic controller. In Boston they found that at high traffic levels drivers face a POA which results in journey times 30% longer than if motorists were co-ordinated into an optimal traffic flow. Much the same thing was found in London (a POA of up to 24% for journeys between Borough and Farringdon Underground stations) and New York (a POA of up to 28% from Washington Market Park to Queens Midtown Tunnel). <br><br>Modifying the road network could reduce delays. And contrary to popular belief, a simple way to do that might be to close certain roads. This is known as Braess’s paradox, after another mathematician, Dietrich Braess, who found that adding extra capacity to a network can sometimes reduce its overall efficiency.<br><br>In Boston the group looked to see if the paradox could be created by closing any of the 246 links. In 240 cases their analysis showed that a closure increased traffic problems. But closing any one of the remaining six streets reduced the POA of the new Nash equilibrium. Much the same thing was found in London and New York. More work needs to be done to understand these effects, say the researchers. But even so, planners should note that there is now evidence that even a well intentioned new road may make traffic jams worse.</p>

              <p>I have no issues with implementing ERP in CBD area. After all, that's where traffic can potentially be the most congested.</p>
              <p>But ERP on expressways? ERP in Toa Payoh? ERP in other non-CBD areas, is total rubbish.</p>

              <p>What you are saying is that ERP works by marginalising the poor to take public transport. To a certain extent, ERP may deter some from driving to work. However, as we can see as driver on the road, ERP DOES NOT reduce traffic flow at all. This is a real problem and not one just to condemn the system as it is costly for us drivers. If you would bother to look around, the problem of traffic jams are very real. It is a daily occurance.</p>
              <p>If ERP are able to reduce traffic jams, I would think that lesser of us would complain day in day out. But ERP does not solve anything, resulting in all of us lesser mortals to think of it as a myth.</p>
              <p>It is common logic that if our dearest government wants to collect more taxes from cars, they would at last have to give us back something in the form of better network of roads (not a white elephant like KPE), wider road, reasonable laws to keep out those farking road hoggers who drive at 90km/hr at the 1st lane and does not think that giving way to vehicles to overtake is correct as they are within the speed limit. Idiotic motorcycles who take up 2-3 lanes at the same time. Lorries who overtake you then slow to almost a complete halt, etc. It is because of people like these who caused a huge empty space on the road and refuses to let others fill up the space. If you can imagine. Should we be able to fill up more of the road, we can move more vehicles. Shouldn't our stupid "traffic police" do more than just make themselves invisible and take photos to earn commission? If need be, we can employ our own photographer to take nicer pictures of our cars. Thank you.</p>
              <p>There are simply easier ways to solve our traffic problems. It is just that our dearest government who is so UP THERE that they chose to employ a more profitable one.</p>
              <p>P.s. there are no elements of slender nor threat. Please do not sue me. I am just one of the many unemployed out there trying to survive while you sit on your plush cushions.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, it is partially the fault of the people who have gotten them to what they are today.  They can just simply ignore the public's voice to go on to do things to meet their self serving agenda.   </p>
              <p>As politicians they are to serve people, fear people, meet people's needs, respect the choice of the people and place public service as top priority but what we seee it is the opposite that is happening.   the evil senile selfish bastard lky has made this so to benefit himself and the party.   He makes people fearful of him and gang.  can't wait for his demise.  </p>

              <p>In anyway, the deal is done. People are talking big about exercising our rights come 2011 or what shiet. However, we have failed to realise that some are just talking cock, some are too young to vote and some are simply too afraid of changes.</p>
              <p>No venture no gain. If nobody dare to take the first step out, we would only have ourselves to blame. Afterall, we can't expect things to change status quo. Up there will not see the need to change their SOP cuz we mortals are deemed too meek for them.</p>
