              <p>My wishful thinking of a non partisan thread and give a neutral view about this election.</p>
              <p>I thought ministers who lost in the election made the right decision not to rejoin politics. Assuming that they return to politics thru other channel, Singaporean would be cynical about PAP election; similarly to the opposition party that lost.</p>
              <p>So Singaporean must be aware that their vote does impact Singapore there are no assumption about someone can easily fill the shoes.     </p>
              <p>I also think Singaporean made a point to the government about greater voices and counter balance within government.</p>
              <p>The acknowledgement of political changes is a good start by the government. With George Yeo added voice of changes needed if Pap want to stay relevant.</p>
              <p>I also thought that the public acknowledgment by our patriach political figure helip significantly to allow Singapore political platform to evolve.  Although the resignation maybe a small gesture but i think it lead the way for peaceful transformation. The rest of the political evolution in Singapore will not rest YOU - Singaporean. Hope to see  the handover is very much peaceful detachment from the past.</p>
              <p>So for those folks who complaint much I hope you are ready to shoulder responsibilities.</p>
              <p>For all the Past credit we give to the old man, and the S, M.,  I think the abilities to let go is even greater.</p>
              <p>I could think of many fail examples like the military coup in Thailand, middle east uprising, and looking further back Tianamen square where leadership held by old man unwilling to let go.</p>
              <p>This changed hopefully the first step will lead to many more changes to come.  </p>
              <p>So i think Singaporean WIN in this election.</p>

              <p>It will be a nightmare if all the singaporean stop complaining and move out of the country.</p>
              <p>It is a year for singaporean to reclaim their right as a singaporean.</p>
              <p>We have entrusted the right to a bunch of elites for the past 10 years.</p>
              <p>However, our trust have already been misplaced many times for the honest mistakes that they failed and refused to admit.</p>
              <p>Yes, we are taking responsibility for our destiny as we suffered the direct impact of policies made to benefit certain portion of the population.</p>
              <p>We have to get involved or else we will be over-run by the foreign league imported into the place to replace our jobs and our vote.</p>
              <p>No, I am not expecting any changes that will improve the life of the people even though there are lots of wayang and promises of listening to the people (Something they defined as gossip during the election).</p>
              <p>As long as the policies do not change, the impact and effects will still remain as that is how they earned their GDP and KPI.</p>
              <p>But, I am only hoping that with more voices to question the policies and the budget spending, issues like the increase in president's pay can be justified instead of rubber-stamping.</p>

              <p>The hall mark of this election I hope is the distinction of Political party from the Government.</p>
              <p>I hope no more of the crap that PAP constituents will be served first. There is no justification for that. In time of crisis or war, all are involved, no such thing as only PAP wards considered, opposition wards not entitled. Can it be that PAP wards get water and rations, and opposition wards don't?</p>
              <p>Development should nationalistic and be across the board, regardless.</p>
              <p>We are all Singaporens, not PAP Singaporeans and Opposition Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Would the PAP try saying only those who vote PAP are entitled to defend the nation and therefore to serve NS, while those who vote Opposition would be exemped from NS.</p>
              <p>Or worse, those from the Opposition ward will be sent to the front line first, in case of war.</p>
              <p>One People, One Nation, One Singapore, Lau Lee, Lau Goh remember this refrain.</p>

              <p>I think the next few years of Governing Singapore would be by far one of the most difficult because it involved in "Changed Management" ....and Transformation Leadership.</p>
              <p>Current leadership were moled by the old guard so they were hired to manage because they thinked alike.....it would take a visionary to see beyond current constraint....It would depend on hindsight of LHL to use the newly elected GRC members to bring up a visionary leader.</p>
              <p>Current opposition WP is just an infant to learn how to walk, as a political party they still need time to evolve,  I am not sure they are much of a reformer.</p>
              <p>This election also bring about Singapore voters being more matured. They actually voted out PP.</p>
              <p>Not the old Pap and not the old oppposition.....</p>
              <p>So all in all, I certainly think that Singaporean wanted --- Change.  </p>

              <p>its a new beginning for the citizens to take charge...to participate constructively for the better political future of our country......its unseen, but a great awareness and triumph of the citizens are vested with the oppositions through the marginal votes, particularly the WP...it seems some members of the ruling party has to go if their unpopularity persists...its only a matter of time...</p>
              <p>it has to, and eventually will be...and they will have to change to win back the lost votes....</p>

She cried over someone unable to pay for her sons tuition fees during a rally, undoubtedly trying to get support, wanting ppl to think that she totally emphathises with them, but its so overly hypocritical. And many ppl support her saying that she is pretty etc, but this is about politics, not beauty! Moreover, her looks are fairly average. Seriously, by supporting her because she is supposedly better-looking than Tin Pei Ling only serves to show that these Singaporeans are, in fact, immature and unable to consider the bigger picture; they are ppl who are not able to think for he future of our country, they are not able to consider the more important aspects and issues involved in the GE.

              <p>Overall, I think this GE was quite a success in that there was greater participation by  Singaporeans, and more were engaged in it. However, there is a need to further educate the population on the issues involved, and most of all, the younger generation should learn to consider IMPORTANT issues rather than debate about the appearance of certain politicians. In this aspect, the younger generation are seen to be focusing on the WRONG thing entirely.</p>
              <p>(But of course, i acknowledge that not all of the younger generation are as puerile as that.)</p>
              <p>Anyway, there has been much positive progress as a result of this GE, such as the increase in the no. of opposition in the Parliment and the fact that the PAP realises a need to improve itself-fast. This is not to say that I am pro-opposition. On the contrary, in fact, I'm a rather pro-PAP person, and as much as I acknowledge the efforts and achievements that the PAP has made over the years, it really does need some upgrading and this GE is the wake-up call for them to do just that. In addition. the presence of opposition would provide just enough checks on the PAP so that it would not lose its focus but not enough to threaten or hinder its progress.</p>
              <p>On another note, i hope that Singaporeans would not be divided over the different parties or the different politicians. No matter who we support, everyone should remember that above all, we should be proud of our country because WE ARE SINGAPOREANS! :D</p>

              <p>AFter election, the lhl made some changes, i doubt his intentions, really.    I am just sitting back to see his motive being unveiled one day.     To get those 3 retire is good idea.     At the same time, he continues to bring in more foreigners to affect employment for locals.   How good and sincere is he after election?      </p>

              <p>The hall mark of this election I hope is the distinction of Political party from the Government.</p>
              <p>I hope no more of the crap that PAP constituents will be served first. There is no justification for that. In time of crisis or war, all are involved, no such thing as only PAP wards considered, opposition wards not entitled. Can it be that PAP wards get water and rations, and opposition wards don't?</p>
              <p>Development should nationalistic and be across the board, regardless.</p>
              <p>We are all Singaporens, not PAP Singaporeans and Opposition Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Would the PAP try saying only those who vote PAP are entitled to defend the nation and therefore to serve NS, while those who vote Opposition would be exemped from NS.</p>
              <p>Or worse, those from the Opposition ward will be sent to the front line first, in case of war.</p>
