              <p>Hi Sgdiehard,</p>
              <p>All I am saying is that opposition and supporters alike have to 
                  consider also that people because of immediate practical reasons, 
                  there's a need to move abroad, either to work and also sometimes to 
                  further their ambition because there's no more opportunities for them.</p>
              <p>For Election 2016, more new citizens will be coming in as voters. Oppositions will have to engage them as well even though new citizens' intentions are vague and unknown.</p>
              <p>People are leaving and that will affect and dilute opposition support base.</p>
              <p>Timing is vey important, this time round PAP was caught napping but it doesn't always happen.</p>
              <p>I do think that's a difficulty.</p>
              <p>People might also take a long hard look and because of their families and education issues, decide to settle somewhere else.</p>
              <p>I
                   used to think along the lines of quitters who leave Sinkapore, but 
                  nowsaday, I can see that there are immediate problems facing people that
                   the local gov will not solve for them and sometimes that's the only way
                   out.</p>
              <p>I think we are all drawn to various parties for different 
                  reasons but currently opposition still isn't in a position to solve more
                   of anything yet.</p>
              <p>There are children to be fed and also schooling issues and many other things that will push people to leave.</p>
              <p>It has already come to a point where currently the gov is importing people without QA.</p>
              <p>Sometimes
                   people will think about what they can do against an entire system that 
                  the PAP created that permeates every nook and cracks of this society.</p>
              <p>It has come to a point where I have come across people who are suffering from plato's cave syndrome.</p>
              <p>Sometimes people just want to live and not be a slave or a clog in an economic system.</p>
              <p>I will not blame people especially the young if they leave.</p>
              <p>I do encourage people to leave if they could and if they want to, simply because our gov did not truly appreciate us at all.</p>
              <p>5
                   years to wait again to vote is still quite a difficult period to wait 
                  if food has to be placed on the table everyday, and working for a 
                  pittance.</p>
              <p>In the current job market, career is very short, in a mere twenty years, it could have already ended for some. Some also faced career deadends or roadbloack due to the influx of foreigners.</p>
              <p>I
                   believe every moment in our lives are important, and likewise, for your
                   belief and loyalty to Sinkapore, that belief is worth upholding every 
                  moment of your life. I know it is a cornerstone of your life.</p>
              <p>Different people have different values and dreams. Some might 
                  just want their kids to have a good future irregardless of where. Some 
                  might just want a quiet retirement life with no money worries affecting 
                  them. Those are also important to people, and sometimes there will be a 
                  point where people will just want to.</p>
              <p>Some might not want to go but reality bites, and for some of them, it is more vicious than PAP.</p>
              <p>While it is clear that we stand apart from what we believe in,</p>
              <p>I thank you for your input and I recognize your patriotism for the country.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>In between these 5 years period, there will be more wayang shows, soft emotional talks of caring and singaporean only theme type of dialogues and seminars. The usual selling of sanitary pads and rubber tubes by the ruling party. As a capitalised economy driven state, a serious long term economy crisis will ultimately test their endurance and perhaps, their survive instinct, and it is also the time to really see how they perform. The last crisis was just a blip, but a long term one will see rises in unemployment reaching limit points, collapse of business and companies like dominos one after the other, and with a 6 millions all inclusive of foreigners here looking for jobs, what will happen next is beyong my comprehension, but one thing I know, people like TPL or some new MPs and ministers will be staying put at home and do nothing.</p></div>

              <p>Extracted from Stomp : Foreigners shoo family away from Botanic Gardens landmarks because they "booked it"</p>
              <p>Comments by one person I found require attention.</p>
              <p>By SophiaRosieHart</p>
              <p>1. if Foreigners weren't in singapore singapore would have heaps of poor people or heaps of people in jail</p>
              <p>2. if we werent here singapore would of been run to the ground singapore cant live without Foreigners because they the ones who are bringing all the money in and they the ones who are building all your malls like if i wasn't here also mbs wouldn't be up and running like it is now</p>
              <p>3. singaporeans race is mostly chinese and malay mixed</p>
              <p>4.everyone is a Foreigner to singapore because singapore doesnt even have its own real race</p>
              <p>5.my own real race is maori and english<br>and mbs is the only good looking building in singapore but crap inside sadly hahahaha i got here to late when it started flooding because these dumb *****s dont know anything about building</p>
              <p>6.@Darn walk out on a job i get paid 30 grand a month for mate you must be joking,found a job like that in new zealand nope because they all taken and i would rather travel the world i've been to most of asia i must say singapore was the worse place i ever landed in and i cant wait in till i get to move</p>
              <p>7.and u see i already have another job lined up thats mine if i want it and most of the new zealanders here get moved around by the same company they dont keep them here because they know they dont like it just like my boss knows i hate singapore thats why next is Bangkok or Dubai or Aussie.<br>he probably worked his ass of an lied to get the job thats why he cant move anywhere because he sucks and no one wants him ouch that must hurt hahahahahahahahahaa like no one wants you</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess our Governement is not aware of all these. Keep talking about about "talent". The Government need to have a system to weed out such Foreigner.</p>
