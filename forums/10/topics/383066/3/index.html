              <p>It becomes a self reinforcing fact isn't it ?</p>
              <p>By making the system favourable towards companies whose main interest is the bottom line and suppressed wages, your market would be full of companies who wants things to stay that way, projecting a skewed picture of what is wanted not needed.</p>
              <p>It's the same way with any organisations and government, once you made a system where it favours a certain group of people none of them are going to say the system is no longer relevant to the times.</p>

              <p>the minimum wage is commandeered by the politicians only.he is the main player,...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>people get reskilled from the time they entered the job industry when they were  sent to the place they work in.........if a person has really entered any workplace sin ce they finished schooling than it tells alot about you.have YOU WORKED OUTSIDE FIRST OF ALL OR NOT??REAL OR NOT FROM YUR THEORY OF UPGRADING ON SKILLS.I ASSURE YOU THE PEOPLE TEACHING THE SKILLS IN YOUR CLASSROOMS ARE THE ONES WORKING IN THAT INDUSTRY FOR YEARS.AND TO TELL U THE TRUTH NO ONE WOULD WANNA TEACH ANYONE VALUABLE HIGH TECH SKILLS DIRECT FROM WERKPLACE,USUALLY THOSE U GET ARE OLD TECHNOLOGY OR ALMOST OBSOLETE.SO IF U TRY GIVIN HOPE TO YERSELF BOUT UPGRADING YERSELF GET DEGREE GET FURTHER PAPERWERK FROM LOCAL INSTITUTES THEN U WILL BE FER A BIG NASTY SHOCK....A VERY EXPENSIVE TIME WASTING SHOCK.</p>
              <p>DID ANYONE HERE NEED TO GO TO SCHOOL TO LEARN A COMPUTER?HOW TO INSTALL WINDOWS SOFTWARE HOW TO BUILD IT????ITS FROM INTEREST ...UPGRADING ONLY CAN DO 50% ONLY THE OTHER 50% IS FROM PERSON.</p>
              <p>ANGEL7030:, as a market driven free economy we embraced, we must allow for flexibilities in wages, we ourselves must make our marketable and needed by the industries created here.</p>
              <p>HITMAN3:THE FLEXIBILITY IS FIXED BY THE MINISTERS...CHANCES OF THEY FIXING YUR SLARY TO 50 CENTS /HOUR IS HIGH AS LONG AS NO ONE QUESTIONS THEM!CURRENTLY MOST INDUSTRIES IN TECHNOLOGY ARE MOVING OUT OF SPORE.....WHEN THEY MOVE EVEN BUSINESS SELLING DURIANS WILL CLOSE DOWN.</p>
              <p>ANGEL7030:Fourth, as a country of no natural resource, we depend on business from both local and foreign, our flexi wage system was one the main attraction for people invest here, and for years we had provern again and again, that without a mini wage system, we performed much better than our surrounding region that impose mini wage system. We are definitely one if not two class higher than our competitor in term of labour progression.</p>
              <p>HITMAN3:IT WAS DONE AT A GREAT COST OF MANY GOOD,SMART AND HARDWOREKING SINGAPOREANS.THEIR LOSS AND SACRIFICES CANNOT BE MADE UP BY MANY A HUMS OR OLD ARMCHAIR THEORY.</p>
              <p>PEOPLE DONT NEED LABOUR ANYMORE...ITS ROBOTIFCS AND HIGH TECHNOLOGY THAT DONT NEED PEOPLE TO PRODUCE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INA YEAR.HUMANS N LABOUR CANT DO THAT MUCH.GO LEARN FROM THE JAPANESE ORHIGHER CLASS PEOPLE!</p>

              <p>There are arguments for and against minimum wages.</p>
              <p>I look at 2 arguments in favour of minimum wage, based on facts, <strong>not</strong> theory:</p>
              <p>1 )- A study of U.S. states showed that businesses' annual and average payrolls grow faster and employment grew at a faster rate in states with a minimum wage.</p>
              <p>2) - Historical evidence shows that at current levels, it neither hurts businesses nor reduces job creation</p>
              <p>There are many small business owners(in the US, unfortunately) who support minimum wage.</p>
              <p>If our gommen spends money to help these people in the lowest rung of the ladder, then it has less money to lose on speculation in the financial market.</p>
              <p>The gommen can set up business and hire workers with minimum living wages to rival those small business owners whose only concern is the bottom line.</p>
              <p>If there's a will, there's a way.</p>

              <p><br>Basically, as i said earlier, there are pros and cons in this policy, but since independency, we already undertook a non mini wage policy, and thru the 70s and the 80s whereby salary boomed almost 10 folds, until the 85' crisis came along and people started to realize that you need to have a flexible wage so that movement of business or the market can adjust itself for a more flavourable terms.</p>
              <p>I think compare to US, it is different scenerios altogther, they have to paid nearly 50% income tax and they also have welfare funds, and of cos, their cost of living are many times more than us. So, the social impact is very much different from us, but many of their private corporations move out to cheaper places especially in Asian or South America, where command of wages is flexible and low. This leave about more jobless in US, currently around 11%, so about 10 peoples in US, 1 is jobless. And when people are jobless, crime rates increases.</p>
              <p>Our economy social looks is base on good tripartism, the trust is important, given a govt led unions overseeing that the lowest wage do not compromise a person living condition into a street begger or willow, tell you that not only the market dictate the wothy of a person being employed, but also the care and ensuring that his bread and butter is on the table.</p>
              <p>However for an individual, if you dun live within your means, you need to struggle abit, or else you have to upgrade and work smarter if not harder, the govt is alway more then willing to give u the fishing rod, thru SPUR, e2i, Learning Hub which is almost free for older people, and at great subsidy for younger people, and that SPUR and e2i are for Singaporeans only. They also encourage bosses to go for best sourcing, rather than cheap sourcing.</p>
              <p>The ironic of mini wage is when set it at $1,200. but you are worth $1500, then you will come back to complain about mini wage.</p>
