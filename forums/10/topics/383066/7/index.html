              <p>Pay issue is mostly for 'convenient' easy to replace jobs such as clerks and stuffu.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And these are the jobs most people are expected to get especially in Singapore 'still-manufacturing' industry. So yeah, if you read statistics from Ministry of Manpower, you read articles all over the world, the issue is not minimum wages, issue is whether you have the 'value proposition'.</p>
              <p>If you are IT personnel they might as well get outsourcing from china or bangaladeshi, if you are an engineer they might as well get a cohort from china's universities (especially their students could take up more jobs for less pay and still work like cow:dun flame me on this)...</p>
              <p>So what is your value? If you do not have a signal (certification, past job experience, etc) you are not even considered under minimum criteria. And even if you have the signal, some things may not be 'signallable' such as managerial skills and communications skills.</p>
              <p>I suggest you work in a "COCK" SME first, know all the dirty and dark secrets of the industry, then slowly jump from ship to ship.</p>
              <p>Company loyalty is the thing of the past. Good companies know they NEED TO retent valuable personnel. Think this way, low wages in singapore mean that you can even have the CHANCE to 'jump start' yourself and study in the school of hard knocks which may be critical for you to understand what is the labour experience, and if you are already working in MNCs you could probably understand what are the labour experience outside singapore.</p>
              <p>Sounds like government never help us, but running like a private organization they have KPIs to attend to minimum employment figures, and anyways from looking at global perspective, I do support low wages but not most of their other policies, such as HDB and CPFs.</p>

              <p>The world is a global world now, as a labourer, be it accountants, cleaners, metalworkers, General manager, managers etc etc if you are taking wages, you are a labourers, just that the terms and conditons is different, or the title given, and some can be bogus too, giving you a GM post, but you work like a General Motor or worker.</p>
              <p>In a Global labour market, you sell yourself in a global market, not on our domestic wet or dry market ya. This mindset or paradigm shift of thinking must be change in order for you to accommodate the reality of what is happening. I know alots of people will be frustrated and angry over our govt open door policies, but that is the way it is, and my advices is that instead of mingling and blaming the society or the govt, which you have the right to do so, try to think where you are now, and what should you do to accomodate into such changes rather than wasting time on blaming and finger pointing. I can guarantee you, even if opposition govt took over, they will still adopt a FDI policies and expect you to be a global labourer. Because that is the way Singapore will have to go about, there is no 2 ways about it if you want this very country to progress. Unless you want to make Orchard Road back to be like JB backlane, then i have nothing to say, pack and go back taiwan.</p>
              <p>And as a Global player, we need to compete wages with others, leaving our wages flexible is one of the key benefit to us, we let the market decide, and if you are talking about mini wages, most of our surrounding countries mini wages are much lower than what our bangalas workers are getting? Indonesia is US $180 per month, that is about S$220++ only, are we going into paying our old workers that amount??? I think if that is the case, someone is really going to kill someone.</p>
              <p>Taking into the cost of living here, yes it is high, but if you are earning $1500, try to upgrade and make yourself more valuable, and the most important is live by your means, dun tell me you go clubbing n pubbings and buy expensive fashionable stuffs at ION, orchard while earning only a mere $3k in Singapore, you got to be crazy, even a 20k paid will find it difficult if that is the lifestyle of a Typical Singaporean.</p>

              <p>I think certain jobs in SG that contribute directly to GDP should have a minimum wage attached to it and they should be held by citizens only. Particularly in the public housing sectors.</p>

              <p>Minimum wage only ensure that if you work, you will be paid enough to start a family and have a decent life in Singapore.</p>
              <p>It is different to say that the government should guarantee all singaporean a job then having certain jobs that are reserved for Singaporean only. For such jobs, like many in the civil service, you still need to compete with other singaporean.</p>
              <p>To ensure that workers can find jobs, singapore gives you the opportunities to be educated to the highest level you can, provide training to upgrade you so that employers want you.</p>
              <p>No decent society want to guarantee anybody any job, especially those who are lazy.</p>

              <p>The world is a global world now, as a labourer, be it
              accountants, cleaners, metalworkers, General manager, managers etc
              etc if you are taking wages, you are a labourers, just that the
              terms and conditons is different, or the title given, and some can
              be bogus too, giving you a GM post, but you work like a General
              Motor or worker.</p>
              <p>In a Global labour market, you sell yourself in a global market,
              not on our domestic wet or dry market ya. This mindset or paradigm
              shift of thinking must be change in order for you to accommodate
              the reality of what is happening. I know alots of people will be
              frustrated and angry over our govt open door policies, but that is
              the way it is, and my advices is that instead of mingling and
              blaming the society or the govt, which you have the right to do so,
              try to think where you are now, and what should you do to
              accomodate into such changes rather than wasting time on blaming
              and finger pointing. I can guarantee you, even if opposition govt
              took over, they will still adopt a FDI policies and expect you to
              be a global labourer. Because that is the way Singapore will have
              to go about, there is no 2 ways about it if you want this very
              country to progress. Unless you want to make Orchard Road back to
              be like JB backlane, then i have nothing to say, pack and go back
              taiwan.</p>
              <p>And as a Global player, we need to compete wages with others,
              leaving our wages flexible is one of the key benefit to us, we let
              the market decide, and if you are talking about mini wages, most of
              our surrounding countries mini wages are much lower than what our
              bangalas workers are getting? Indonesia is US $180 per month, that
              is about S$220++ only, are we going into paying our old workers
              that amount??? I think if that is the case, someone is
              really going to kill someone.</p>
              <p>Taking into the cost of living here, yes it is high, but if you
              are earning $1500, try to upgrade and make yourself more valuable,
              and the most important is live by your means, dun tell me you go
              clubbing n pubbings and buy expensive fashionable stuffs at
              ION, orchard while earning only a mere $3k in Singapore, you got to
              be crazy, even a 20k paid will find it difficult if that is the
              lifestyle of a Typical Singaporean.</p>

              <p>The world is a globe after all, it started long even before 1914, from the begining of this existence, so to speak. The differences is when one get affected by the global market, one start to realize the impact of it existence. Our workforce had been working in a conceived domestic labour market from 60s to late 80s while serving a global world business. But the diversity of business and the booming of dot com and internet had swayed the inconnectivity among not only global business expansion, but also global labour interchangability and employment. One who had been accustomed to believeing his/her experiences, knowledge and skills in this domestic market suddenly found his/her competitors all across the global. In that very instance, one should know that he/she is selling in a global market and no more a domestic one. And if one fail to realize that, it matter of time, he/she will become dinosaur and suffer the impact of globalisation which one truely get to knows.</p>
              <p>Like or not, the world had slowly embraced capitalism, industrialisation and technologies, even the commies are going into it, by churning out many billionaires from all these commie countries, you should know where they are going. Capitalism is not really a good system, but nevertheless, better than many other systems, on that note, as a Transnational organisation, what expectations do you want before investing in country, think for yourself, it you are the boss of a big MNC. A 3 years old baby will tell you to save operating cost as much as possible. Our wages are moderate in comparing with a developed country, but against developing countries, we are certainly higher. But a 10 years old gal will tell you, you also needs to look at the infrastructual, facilities, trust and honesty, financial flexibility, system and efficiency, skill and knowledge of workforce in that particular country you want to invest in, because all these intangible factors are essential for business. And we Singapore, is in no doubt, provided that better than most of the countries around this region.</p>
              <p>For instance, some countries can have $2 per day paid labour, but if every day electricity stop here and there, order part that comes in months, road to port is completely block up by riots, ship delays, strikes, workers absent, sabotage, and even you teach them a 100 x they still dun understand how the machine works, you better close shop...</p>
