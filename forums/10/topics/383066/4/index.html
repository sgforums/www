              <p>the minimum wage is commandeered by the politicians only.he is the main player,...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>people get reskilled from the time they entered the job industry when they were  sent to the place they work in.........if a person has really entered any workplace sin ce they finished schooling than it tells alot about you.have YOU WORKED OUTSIDE FIRST OF ALL OR NOT??REAL OR NOT FROM YUR THEORY OF UPGRADING ON SKILLS.I ASSURE YOU THE PEOPLE TEACHING THE SKILLS IN YOUR CLASSROOMS ARE THE ONES WORKING IN THAT INDUSTRY FOR YEARS.AND TO TELL U THE TRUTH NO ONE WOULD WANNA TEACH ANYONE VALUABLE HIGH TECH SKILLS DIRECT FROM WERKPLACE,USUALLY THOSE U GET ARE OLD TECHNOLOGY OR ALMOST OBSOLETE.SO IF U TRY GIVIN HOPE TO YERSELF BOUT UPGRADING YERSELF GET DEGREE GET FURTHER PAPERWERK FROM LOCAL INSTITUTES THEN U WILL BE FER A BIG NASTY SHOCK....A VERY EXPENSIVE TIME WASTING SHOCK.</p>
              <p>DID ANYONE HERE NEED TO GO TO SCHOOL TO LEARN A COMPUTER?HOW TO INSTALL WINDOWS SOFTWARE HOW TO BUILD IT????ITS FROM INTEREST ...UPGRADING ONLY CAN DO 50% ONLY THE OTHER 50% IS FROM PERSON.</p>
              <p>ANGEL7030:, as a market driven free economy we embraced, we must allow for flexibilities in wages, we ourselves must make our marketable and needed by the industries created here.</p>
              <p>HITMAN3:THE FLEXIBILITY IS FIXED BY THE MINISTERS...CHANCES OF THEY FIXING YUR SLARY TO 50 CENTS /HOUR IS HIGH AS LONG AS NO ONE QUESTIONS THEM!CURRENTLY MOST INDUSTRIES IN TECHNOLOGY ARE MOVING OUT OF SPORE.....WHEN THEY MOVE EVEN BUSINESS SELLING DURIANS WILL CLOSE DOWN.</p>
              <p>ANGEL7030:Fourth, as a country of no natural resource, we depend on business from both local and foreign, our flexi wage system was one the main attraction for people invest here, and for years we had provern again and again, that without a mini wage system, we performed much better than our surrounding region that impose mini wage system. We are definitely one if not two class higher than our competitor in term of labour progression.</p>
              <p>HITMAN3:IT WAS DONE AT A GREAT COST OF MANY GOOD,SMART AND HARDWOREKING SINGAPOREANS.THEIR LOSS AND SACRIFICES CANNOT BE MADE UP BY MANY A HUMS OR OLD ARMCHAIR THEORY.</p>
              <p>PEOPLE DONT NEED LABOUR ANYMORE...ITS ROBOTIFCS AND HIGH TECHNOLOGY THAT DONT NEED PEOPLE TO PRODUCE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INA YEAR.HUMANS N LABOUR CANT DO THAT MUCH.GO LEARN FROM THE JAPANESE ORHIGHER CLASS PEOPLE!</p>

              <p><br>Basically, as i said earlier, there are pros and cons in this policy, but since independency, we already undertook a non mini wage policy, and thru the 70s and the 80s whereby salary boomed almost 10 folds, until the 85' crisis came along and people started to realize that you need to have a flexible wage so that movement of business or the market can adjust itself for a more flavourable terms.</p>
              <p>I think compare to US, it is different scenerios altogther, they have to paid nearly 50% income tax and they also have welfare funds, and of cos, their cost of living are many times more than us. So, the social impact is very much different from us, but many of their private corporations move out to cheaper places especially in Asian or South America, where command of wages is flexible and low. This leave about more jobless in US, currently around 11%, so about 10 peoples in US, 1 is jobless. And when people are jobless, crime rates increases.</p>
              <p>Our economy social looks is base on good tripartism, the trust is important, given a govt led unions overseeing that the lowest wage do not compromise a person living condition into a street begger or willow, tell you that not only the market dictate the wothy of a person being employed, but also the care and ensuring that his bread and butter is on the table.</p>
              <p>However for an individual, if you dun live within your means, you need to struggle abit, or else you have to upgrade and work smarter if not harder, the govt is alway more then willing to give u the fishing rod, thru SPUR, e2i, Learning Hub which is almost free for older people, and at great subsidy for younger people, and that SPUR and e2i are for Singaporeans only. They also encourage bosses to go for best sourcing, rather than cheap sourcing.</p>
              <p>The ironic of mini wage is when set it at $1,200. but you are worth $1500, then you will come back to complain about mini wage.</p>

              <p>Minimum wage of $1,200 means that the employer must pay at least $1,200 to employ the worker.</p>
              <p>The worker can always ask for $1,500 if the employee has more experience and higher qualification.</p>

              <p>Angel might not know that minimum wage is floor price, so just to explain to her the meaning of minimum wage as a floor price.</p>
              <p>There are 2 forms of price control in economics ie floor price (ie minimum price) or price ceiling (ie maximum price).</p>
              <p>A floor price is used when the equilibrium or market price is too low and a price ceiling is used when the equilibrium or market price is too high.</p>
