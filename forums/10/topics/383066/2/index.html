              <p>Although I'm tempted to suggest a universal minimum wage, I think that would only either 1, lead to a unacceptably low minimum wage, thus resulting only in form, OR 2, generating too much costs for companies that were attracted by the cheap labor force to flee.</p>
              <p>I think it would be best to allow the industry to coordinate the minimum wage wage with the labor force.  Industries and labor unions ought to do their job to come to an agreement on what their minimum wage ought to be. </p>

              <p>The low effective corporate tax for companies may actually be offsetting costs like electrical bills.  I've no data on that, so I can't really say for sure. </p>

              <p>the year is 2020,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the spore minimum wage is $4/hour</p>
              <p>most of the big time industries have left for countries like malaysia n thailand.because its cheapwer building 10 factories than singapore.and the expats love malaysian mud crabs,great big cheap lobsters ,huge bbq tiger prawns on weekends.and their fish n chips seems bigger n cheaper in malaysia too!and all plastic and iron ore for production are immense and limittless in largw warehouses next to factories.</p>
              <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>the year is 2025,</p>
              <p>the minimum wage is now $2/hr</p>
              <p>most of the big time industries are still overseas as the expats claim spore is too crowded with hungry looking people.besides it would be a bitch trying to overhaul tons of equipment ,3 production lines and logistics.and for what???for geylang???for casinos&gt;???wat bout cheap giant lobsters and cheap meaty mud crabs???they want a lobster dinner for $3!!and overseas labour in malaysia is still cheap.</p>
              <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>the year is 2030,</p>
              <p>after considerable thought and for future survival the minimum wage has been lowered to $0.50/hr</p>
              <p>the big time industries now believe spore would be better than the rest of asia n decides to uproot all operations n relocate back to spore.raw materials is still a setback as countries in region refuse to supply any because of big company relocation strategy n plans.</p>
              <p>half of all operations shutdown n returns back to country where they uprooted ops from.intergovernment diplomacy steps in and lesser country gets ridiculed.</p>
              <p>all big company operations cease to function in spore due to shortage of raw materials.</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>the year is 2031,</p>
              <p>war breaks out and the military stronger country wins n takes over raw materials from country thats abundant in raw material.big company keeps on producing in any country as long as factory isnt destroyed.</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>back to year 2009 xmas,</p>
              <p>its long isnt it???just to make ends meet only.</p>

              <p>There are arguments for and against minimum wages.</p>
              <p>I look at 2 arguments in favour of minimum wage, based on facts, <strong>not</strong> theory:</p>
              <p>1 )- A study of U.S. states showed that businesses' annual and average
              payrolls grow faster and employment grew at a faster rate in states
              with a minimum wage.</p>
              <p>2) - Historical evidence shows that at current levels, it neither hurts businesses nor reduces job creation</p>
              <p>There are many small business owners(in the US, unfortunately) who support minimum wage.</p>
              <p>If our gommen spends money to help these people in the lowest rung of the ladder, then it has less money to lose on speculation in the financial market.</p>
              <p>The gommen can set up business and hire workers with minimum living wages to rival those small business owners whose only concern is the bottom line.</p>
              <p>If there's a will, there's a way.</p>
