The gahmen of singapore is getting the highest pay in the world, so much more are demanded of them to deal with the widening of income gap, whereas UK government are not the highest paid govt in the world.  They the highest paid gahmen have better come out with excellent, practical solution, with focus on serving the nation on their mind and not to do it for their selfish interest and desire.</div>

A global problem indicates that that nobody has a perfect solution. The reasons for a widening income gap is clear: technological advances which render old services/skills obsolete and free movement of funds and labour in a global market which depresses salaries in developed nations. Incidentally, whilst salaries of low-skilled workers in developed nations are depressed, salaries of cheap workers from developing nations are raised as a result.<br><br>The problem with a widening income gap is that it highlights the failure of low-skilled workers in places like Singapore to move out of low-skilled industries and/or improve productivity.</div>

It is defined as a ratio with values between 0 and 1: the numerator is the area between the Lorenz curve of the distribution and the uniform distribution line; the denominator is the area under the uniform distribution line. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thus, a low Gini coefficient indicates more equal income or wealth distribution, while a high Gini coefficient indicates more unequal distribution. 0 corresponds to perfect equality (e.g. everyone has the same income) and 1 corresponds to perfect inequality (e.g. one person has all the income, while everyone else has zero income).</span> The Gini coefficient requires that no one have a negative net income or wealth.<br><br>The Gini coefficient was developed by the Italian statistician Corrado Gini and published in his 1912 paper "VariabilitÃ  e mutabilitÃ " ("Variability and Mutability").<br><br>The Gini coefficient is also commonly used for the measurement of the discriminatory power of rating systems in credit risk management.<br><br>The Gini index is the Gini coefficient expressed as a percentage, and is equal to the Gini coefficient multiplied by 100. (The Gini coefficient is equal to half of the relative mean difference.)<br></a><br><br></div>
