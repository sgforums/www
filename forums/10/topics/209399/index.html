"In order to give a new hope for our children, he must step down."<br><br>Taipei teacher Huang Pei-fang told AFP: "As a teacher, I want my students to tell right from wrong, and Chen would set an example if he steps down."<br><br>But despite the huge rally, Chen - who has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing and vowed to finish out his term - refused to bow to the pressure.<br><br>"I was elected by the people...Asking me to step down without a justifiable reason is against the principles of democracy," Chen told hundreds of supporters in southern Tainan county, a traditional DPP stronghold.<br><br>The Taiwan leader's troubles started in May after his son-in-law Chao Chien-ming was detained and later indicted on suspicion of insider trading and taking bribes. Chen has publicly apologised for Chao's actions.<br><br>Prosecutors then began looking at whether Chen had misused funds intended for national affairs, and questioned him last month.<br><br>Reports in the Taiwanese media have alleged that prosecutors found only half of the funds for which Chen's office had declared receipts and suspected that some of the money might have been used illegally.<br><br>In June, he survived an unprecedented vote in parliament to push him out of office, which failed to receive the backing of two-thirds of all lawmakers.<br><br>If passed, it would have triggered a national referendum on Chen's future.<br><br>His wife Wu Shu-chen is under investigation for allegedly accepting department store gift certificates in exchange for lobbying efforts.<br><br>But despite a petition signed by more than one million people and 100 million Taiwan dollars (three million US) in financial backing, Shih's campaign is not expected to push the embattled leader from office, analysts say.<br><br>Organisers had feared that torrential rains would lessen the impact of Saturday's rally and drive down turnout, but a hot sun beat down on Taipei as protesters flooded the streets.<br><br>Up to 4,600 riot police were on hand to prevent any violence and some 600 barbed-wire barricades were set up, according to Wang Yung-hui, deputy chief of the Taipei police department.<br><br>On Friday some 2,000 Chen supporters, joined by DPP chairman Yu Shyi-kun, rallied outside his office while several pro-Chen rallies were held in southern Taiwan ahead of Saturday's protest.<br><br>Taiwan, which split from mainland China in 1949 and is regarded by Beijing as a renegade province, had been governed exclusively for more than half a century by the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) until Chen was elected in 2000.<br><br>The independence-minded leader narrowly won re-election in 2004 for a second and final term. - AFP/ch<br><br></div>
