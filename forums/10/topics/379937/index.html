              <p><strong>From our correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>Singapore’s Manpower Minister Mr Gan Kim Yong has rejected calls to
              restore the CPF for older workers after the age of 50 “in order not to
              disadvantage these workers in the competition for jobs.”</p>
              <p>“If we were to raise the CPF now or restore the CPF for older
              workers, it may adversely affect the competitiveness of the workers and
              the competitiveness of companies,” Mr Gan said.</p>
              <p>Currently, Singaporeans above the age of 50 have their employers’ CPF contributions cut from 14.5 per cent to 10.5 per cent.</p>
              <p>A disgruntled Singaporean by the name of Kumar wrote in to the ST Forum lately expressing dismay at the cut:</p>
              <p><em>“The cut is steep – from 14.5 per cent to 10.5 per cent – and affects older Singaporeans like me drastically.</em></p>
              <p><em>Not only must I still pay off my debt to the Housing Board for
              my mortgaged flat on diminished income, but the price hikes are also
              eating into the rest of my salary,”</em> he wrote.</p>
              <p>Mr Kumar’s plight is shared by many Singaporeans in his age group.
              Many are struggling to pay off their housing mortages and support their
              families at the same time, leaving them with little savings in their
              CPF for retirement.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the plight of these elderly workers are oblivious to
              multi-millionaire ministers like Mr Gan who continues to stress that
              adjusting CPF rates would be “counterproductive” as it would create
              more “rigidity”.</p>
              <p>His views were echoed by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew who dismissed
              Singapore’s worsening income gap between the rich and the poor. Mr Lee
              claimed that it is more important to create jobs for Singaporeans with
              labor policies which will encourage companies to hire.</p>
              <p>Though Singapore’s unemployment rates remain low, many workers,
              especially those from the lower income group, are struggling to get by
              with their meager wages in the face of rising costs of living.</p>
              <p>This leads to some “abandoning” their parents as they cannot even
              earn enough to support their own families to which the government has
              implemented a law to criminalize those who do not support their parents
              financially, never mind if they have the means to do so.</p>
              <p>There is also a dearth of social welfare benefits for elderly
              Singaporeans whose bulk of their savings are used up in paying the
              mortage loans of over-priced public housing.</p>
              <p>As such, many have no choice but to continue working beyond their
              retirement ages. Some of them end up scavenging for cardboards in the
              street or as toilet attendants in order to feed themselves.</p>
              <p>Singapore has a public assistance scheme which gives a $330 monthly
              allowance to the destitute, but one has to have no living kin and
              medically certified to be permanently unfit to work in order to qualify
              for the scheme.</p>
              <p>While elderly workers are subjected to CPF cuts after the age of 50,
              Singapore ministers will get a pension on top of their monthly salaries
              which remain unadjusted when they reach 55 years of age.</p>
              <p>Singapore workers are at the losing end at the mercy of big
              businesses and the government because there are no independent trade
              unions to represent their interests and they are robbed of their
              political rights by a series of draconian laws put in place by the
              ruling party.</p>
              <p>The biggest trade union in Singapore – NTUC, is a quasi-government
              organization headed by a minister. Unlike Hong Kong where workers can
              gather and protest against their maltreatment easily, a solo protest
              anywhere in Singapore (except Hong Lim Park) is now considered illegal
              under a new law passed this year.</p>
              <p>With no opposition in parliament to check on the ruling party,
              Singaporeans will have little choice but to look up to ministers like
              Gan Kim Yong for “salvation”.</p>

              <p>What this minister doesn't know that people are suffering nearing to to blink of hell.</p>
              <p>$330? pay off Bills left less then $100</p>
              <p>and because of the company bidding for the stall in hawker, even now in schools. Price is ridiculous...especially the rental. Those poor ppl paid like $1k for the renovation, and what you know it, unable to do business due to renovation. come back. and to know your rental has been doubled.</p>
              <p>how u expect a kid like 13-16 who are not working to eat at school with your chicken rice price like those outside the school? what worst is outside of school the food is even more ridiculous?</p>
              <p>i spend my money mostly to visit restaurant. and i decided to eat hawker to find that the price is almost the same..</p>
              <p>this mean that the rental of the poor fellow singaporean ppl that is bring in good food into our life have to suffer more then any of us that is paying.</p>
              <p>end up is a lose lose situation, for both the ppl selling the food, and to the consumers.</p>

              <p>  Do you know why or not ? Cos our govt also have and run big companies . Any changes to the CPF or whatsoever money matter grant will affect themself directly also . Will you kill your goose that lays golden eggs or malnourish them so that the egg they lay will reduce in size and amount ?</p>
              <p>   Nowadays they even have an advertisement saying that " be contented that you have peanuts to eat , since you always like to eat peanuts also mah " . Its already hinting that we have rice to eat can liao you should be contented liao cos we like to eat rice mah then why so unhappy .</p>
