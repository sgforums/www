            <div class='col-md body'>Basically, the Ruling party are running scared. But they can't show it.<br><br>Low Thia Khiang and the WP have played a wonderful preparation role in carefully recruiting candidates quietly, away from the media and spotlight. And every candidate is not the previous run-of-the-mill quality; instead, these are people of sound academic ability and with good working background.<br><br>The once-proud Ruling party's claim that their candidates are better qualified is now effectively silenced.<br><br>Better still, the majority of candidates were totally unknown prior to the last few months, so secrecy played an important role in ensuring that WP spring genuine surprises to unsettle the usual command and control of the ruling party's campaign. Credibility attacks will be harder and less profound against these candidates who can, for the first time, actually articulate themselves on equal if not better terms then ruling party candidates.<br><br>Most important of all: the mistrust of the media and local news agencies was jusified to prevent them from acting as the usual 'spoilers' of the Ruling party. The news blackout by the WP and SDA parties ensured that they could go about the business of campaigning for support and recruitment without the glare of exposure.<br><br>If voted into a GRC, these candidates will almost certainly perform and meet the needs of the people. Perhaps more so than the Ruling Party.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: darkblue;">And the Ruling Party knows it. </span></span></strong><br><br>For the first time in 3 elections, WP has emerged a worthy challenger to the monopolistic leadership of the Ruling party and rightly deserves a sporting chance.
