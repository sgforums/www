              <div class="storybody">Here's a little math problem:<br><br>In 2005, just 45% of the fifth-graders at Ramona Elementary School in Hollywood scored at grade level on a standardized state test. In 2006, that figure rose to 76%. What was the difference?<br><br>

              If you answered 31 percentage points, you are correct. You could also express it as a 69% increase.<br><br>But there is another, more intriguing answer: The difference between the two years may have been Singapore math.<br><br>At the start of the 2005-06 school year, Ramona began using textbooks developed for use in Singapore, a Southeast Asian city-state whose pupils consistently rank No. 1 in international math comparisons. Ramona's math scores soared.<br><br>"It's wonderful," said Principal Susan Arcaris. "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Seven out of 10 of the students in our school are proficient or better in math, and that's pretty startling when you consider that this is an inner-city, Title 1 school</span>."<br><br>Ramona easily qualifies for <span style="color: #ff0000;">federal Title 1 funds, which are intended to alleviate the effects of poverty. Nine of every 10 students at the school are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches</span>. For the most part, these are the children of <span style="color: #ff0000;">immigrants,</span> the majority from Central America, some from Armenia. Nearly six in 10 students speak English as a second language.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yet here they are, outpacing their counterparts in more affluent schools</span> and succeeding in a math curriculum designed for students who are the very stereotype of Asian dominance in math and science.<br><br>How did that happen?<br><br>It's a question with potentially big implications, because California recently became the first state to include the Singapore series on its list of state-approved elementary math texts. Public schools aren't required to use the books -- there are a number of other, more conventional texts on the state list -- but the state will subsidize the purchase if they do. And being on the list puts an important imprimatur on the books, because California is by far the largest, most influential textbook buyer in the country.<br><br>The decision to approve the books could place California ahead of the national curve. The National Mathematics Advisory Panel, appointed by President Bush, will issue a report Thursday that is expected to endorse K-8 math reforms that, in many ways, mirror the Singapore curriculum.<br><br>The report could also signal a cease-fire in the state's math wars, which raged between traditionalists and reformers throughout the 1990s and shook up math teachers nationwide. Fundamentalists called for a return to basics; reformers demanded a curriculum that would emphasize conceptual understanding.<br><br>Mathematicians on both sides of the divide say the Singapore curriculum teaches both. By hammering on the basics, it instills a deep understanding of key concepts, they say.<br><br>Kids -- at least the kids at Ramona -- seem to love it.<br><br>Ramona, which received a grant to introduce the Singapore curriculum, is one of a sprinkling of schools around the country to do so.<br><br>Not all teachers like it, and not all use it. The Singapore books aren't easy for teachers to use without training, and some veterans are more comfortable with the curriculum they have always followed. But you can tell when you walk into a classroom using Singapore math.<br><br>"On your mark . . . get set . . . THINK!"<br><br>First-grade teacher Arpie Liparian stands in front of her class with a stopwatch. The only sound is of pencils scratching paper as the students race through the daily "sprint," a 60-second drill that is a key part of the Singapore system. The problems at this age are simple: 2+3, 3+4, 8+2. The idea, once commonplace in math classrooms, is to practice them until they become second nature.<br><br>Critics call this "drill and kill," but Ramona's math coach, Robin Ramos, calls it "drill and thrill." The children act as though it's a game. Not everyone finishes all 30 problems in 60 seconds, and only one girl gets all the answers right, but the students are bubbling with excitement. And Liparian praises every effort.<br><br>"Give yourselves a hand, boys and girls," she says when all the drills have been corrected. "You did a wonderful job."</div>
              <div class="storybody"><strong>Reinforcing patterns<br><br></strong>What isn't obvious to a casual observer is that this drill is carefully thought out to reinforce patterns of mathematical thinking that carry through the curriculum. "These are 'procedures with connections,' " Ramos said, arranged to convey sometimes subtle points. This thoughtfulness -- some say brilliance -- is the true hallmark of the Singapore books, advocates say.<br><br>

              After 10 years of studying the Singapore curriculum, Yoram Sagher, a math professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said he still has "very pleasant surprises and realizations" while reading the books. Sagher, who helped train Ramos and the other teachers at Ramona, said he is constantly amazed by "the gentle, clever ways that the mathematics is brought to the intuition of the students."<br><br>The books, with the no-nonsense title "Primary Mathematics," are published for the U.S. market by a small company in Oregon, Marshall Cavendish International. They are slim volumes, weighing a fraction of a conventional American text. They have a spare, stripped-down look, and a given page contains no material that isn't directly related to the lesson at hand.<br><br>Standing in an empty classroom one recent morning, Ramos flipped through two sets of texts: the Singapore books and those of a conventional math series published by Harcourt. She began with the first lesson in the first chapter of first grade.<br><br>In Harcourt Math, there was a picture of eight trees. There were two circles in the sky. The instructions told the students: "There are 2 birds in all." There were no birds on the page.<br><br>The instructions directed the students to draw little yellow disks in the circles to represent the birds.<br><br>Ramos gave a look of exasperation. Without a visual representation of birds, she said, the math is confusing and overly abstract for a 5- or 6-year-old. "The math doesn't jump out of the page here," she said.<br><br>The Singapore first-grade text, by contrast, could hardly have been clearer. It began with a blank rectangle and the number and word for "zero." Below that was a rectangle with a single robot in it, and the number and word for "one." Then a rectangle with two dolls, and the number and word for "two," and so on.<br><br>"This page is very pictorial, but it refers to something very concrete," Ramos said. "Something they can understand."<br><br>Next to the pictures were dots. Beginning with the number six (represented by six pineapples), the dots were arranged in two rows, so that six was presented as one row of five dots and a second row with one dot.<br><br>Day one, first grade: the beginnings of set theory.<br><br>"This concept, right at the beginning, is the foundation for very important mathematics," Ramos said. As it progresses, the Singapore math builds on this, often in ways that are invisible to the children.<br><br>Word problems in the early grades are always solved the same way: Draw a picture representing the problem and its solution. Then express it with numbers, and finally write it in words. "The whole concept," Ramos says, "is concrete to pictorial to abstract."<br><br>Another hallmark of the Singapore books is that there is little repetition. Students are expected to attain mastery of a concept and move on. Each concept builds upon the next. As a result, the books cover far fewer topics in a given year than standard American texts.<br><br><strong>Skilled at math</strong><br><br>Singapore is a prosperous, multicultural, multilingual nation of 4.5 million people whose fourth- and eighth-grade students have never scored lower than No. 1 in a widely accepted comparison of global math skills, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study. U.S. students score in the middle of the pack.<br><br>When the U.S. Department of Education commissioned a study in 2005 to find out why, it concluded, in part: "Singapore's textbooks build deep understanding of mathematical concepts through multi-step problems and concrete illustrations that demonstrate how abstract mathematical concepts are used to solve problems from different perspectives."<br><br>By contrast, the study said, "traditional U.S. textbooks rarely get beyond definitions and formulas, developing only students' mechanical ability to apply mathematical concepts."<br><br>Many eminent mathematicians agree. In fact, it is difficult to find a mathematician who likes the standard American texts or dislikes Singapore's.<br>"The Singapore texts don't make a huge deal about the concepts, but they present them in the correct and economical form," said Roger Howe, a professor of mathematics at Yale University. "It provides the basis for a very orderly and systematic conceptual understanding of arithmetic and mathematics."<br><br>The Singapore curriculum is not strikingly different from that used in many countries known for their math prowess, especially in Asia and Eastern Europe, math educators say. According to James Milgram, a math professor at Stanford who is one of the authors of California's math standards, the Singapore system has its roots in math curricula developed in the former Soviet Union, whose success in math and science sent shivers through American policymakers during the Cold War.<br><br>

              The Soviets, Milgram said, brought together mathematicians and developmental psychologists to devise the best way to teach math to children. They did "exactly what I would have done had I been given free rein to design the math standards in California. They cut the thing down to its core."<br><br>The Soviet curriculum was adopted by China in the mid-1950s, he said, and later made its way to Singapore, where it was rewritten and refined. The Singapore texts could easily be adapted for use in the United States because children there are taught in English.<br><br>"American textbooks are handicapped by many things," said Hung-Hsi Wu, who has taught math at UC Berkeley for 42 years, "the most important of which is to regard mathematics as a collection of factoids to be memorized."<br><br>One might think that school districts would be lining up to get their hands on the Singapore texts, but no one expects many to take the plunge this fall.<br><br>"Maybe in seven or eight years, but not yet," said Wu. For now, he said he'd be surprised if the Singapore books claim 10% of the market.<br><br>In part, that may reflect the inherent conservatism of the education establishment, especially in large districts such as Los Angeles Unified, whose math curriculum specialists said in December, a month after the Singapore texts were adopted by the state, that they hadn't even heard of them -- or of the successful experiment taking place in one of their own schools.<br><br>But there is also an understandable reluctance to rush into a new curriculum before teachers are trained to use it. Complicating that, experts said, is that most American elementary school teachers -- reflecting a generally math-phobic society -- lack a strong foundation in the subject to begin with.<br><br>The Singapore curriculum "requires a considerable amount of math background on the part of the teachers who are teaching it," said Milgram, "and in the elementary grades, most of our teachers aren't capable of teaching it. . . . It isn't that they can't learn it; it's just that they've never seen it."<br><br><strong>Training is key</strong><br><br>Adding to the difficulty is that the Singapore texts are not as teacher-friendly as most American texts. "They don't come with teachers editions, or two-page fold-outs with comments, or step-by-step instructions about how to give the lessons," said Yale's Howe. "Most U.S. elementary teachers don't currently have that kind of understanding, so successful use of the Singapore books would require substantial professional development."<br><br>Although some U.S. schools have had spectacular results using Singapore texts, others have fared less well. A study found that success in Montgomery County, Md., schools using the Singapore books was directly related to teacher training. At schools where teachers weren't trained as well, student achievement declined.<br><br>Sagher, the Illinois professor, said that he would love to see Ramona Elementary become a training ground for L.A. Unified teachers and that Singapore math could radiate out from its Hollywood beachhead. Districtwide, only 43% of fifth-graders last year scored at grade level or above in math, 33 points below Ramona students. "If LAUSD is smart enough to do it, it will be a revolution," he said.<br><br>mitchell.landsberg<br><br>@latimes.com</div>

              <h1>California Teachers Get Approval From Board of Education for State Funds to Use 'Standards Edition' of Math Textbooks Originally Developed by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore's Ministry of Education,</span> Used by No. 1-Ranked Students and Distributed by SingaporeMath.com Inc.</h1>
              <h2>
              <p>LAUSD School Uses Singapore Math Textbooks to Help Improve Scores by 29 Percent; CSUN Education Majors Use Singapore Math to Help Deconstruct, Teach Elementary Math''</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>SACRAMENTO, CA and OREGON CITY, OR--(Marketwire - November 14, 2007) - Students in the Golden State will soon be using state-approved versions of the math textbooks that helped their counterparts in Singapore crunch numbers better than any children in the world, according to Jeffery Thomas, president of the textbooks' North American distributor, SingaporeMath.com Inc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Elementary school teachers in California will, beginning next year, be allowed to use state funds to order adaptations of math textbooks that were developed by Singapore's Ministry of Education and helped students there earn first-place rankings in three widely cited studies of student math performance conducted in 1995, 1999 and 2003, Thomas said. The global study -- Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) -- is conducted every four years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The state-approved adaptations of the Singaporean texts meet the state's K-5 <a href="http://www.singaporemath.com/articles.asp?id=124"><span style="color: #0000ff;">math standards</span></a> and represent a "marked departure" from most math textbooks used in the U.S., Thomas said. The California State Board of Education included the adaptations, or "Standards Edition" titles, published by Singapore-based Marshall Cavendish International in its 2007 Mathematics Primary Adoption on Nov. 8 after receiving a list of recommended textbooks from the state's Curriculum Commission.</p>
              <p>The state's list of adopted math titles is available online at <a href="http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/im/mathprogramnov2007.asp"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/im/mathprogramnov2007.asp</span></a>. The state released its last mathematics primary adoption in 2001.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The "Standards Edition" textbooks generally replace Singaporean dollars and cents with U.S. currency, Singaporean proper names and various British spellings, Thomas said. Teachers in Singapore deliver classroom instruction in English.</p>
              <p>The adopted <a href="http://www.singaporemath.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore math</span></a> titles are relatively thin books<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> full of colorful illustrations of children, shapes and animals designed to support multi-step word problems that require students to work with numbers in various forms such as decimals, percentages and fractions. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"The presentation is astonishingly clear and child-friendly, yet is mathematically sophisticated," said Thomas Parker, a professor of mathematics at Michigan State University.</span> "Students learn through carefully-designed problem sets. By grade six, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">the Singapore texts are one to two years ahead of U.S.</span></span> texts, and the students are extremely well-prepared to start algebra."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jim Milgram, a<span style="color: #ff0000;"> professor emeritus of mathematics at Stanford University</span>, added that, "Singapore Math is one of the best programs out there -- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">especially in the lower grades." </span></p>
              <p>By comparison, in the U.S., elementary school math textbooks "frequently present mathematics in <span style="color: #ff0000;">'template' form</span>," Parker said.</p>
              <p>"The teacher does several examples, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">then the students do problems that are identical except for the choice of numbers,</span>" said <span style="color: #ff0000;">Parker, the co-author of "Elementary Mathematics for Teachers,"</span> which has been used by undergraduate education majors at various universities, including Cal State University, Northridge and the University of Michigan. "The 'reform' textbooks written in the 1990s go to the opposite extreme, omitting skill development and instead give problems that involve much writing and little mathematics."</p>
              <p>The Singapore books, he said, "strike a perfect balance."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Undergraduate teaching majors work with editions of "Primary Mathematics" in conjunction with Parker and Scott Baldridge's "Elementary Mathematics for Teachers." The teaching book often calls on undergrads to read a section of "Primary Mathematics," do problems and study the material from a teacher's perspective.</p>
              <p>"Teachers think about what skills are developed, how the problems are organized, what the prerequisite knowledge is and what order topics are developed," Parker said. "This becomes a challenging and effective college course because the emphasis is on understanding elementary mathematics at the level of 'teacher knowledge.'"</p>
              <p>Earlier editions of the Singapore math titles helped teachers at Ramona Elementary School in the Los Angeles Unified School District graduate 29% more fifth graders that met the state's "proficient and advanced" math standard in 2005-2006 than in 2004-2005, according to Robin Ramos, a district math coach at Ramona -- a Title I school in East Hollywood.</p>
              <p>"Our scores have jumped considerably," Ramos said. "We need to learn how to teach math differently from how we were taught -- or we'll get the same results."</p>
              <p>Ramos added that the improvement at Ramona is the byproduct of committed teaching, using the new textbooks and the training in Singapore math teachers received from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Yoram Sagher, a professor of mathematics at Florida Atlantic University</span>.</p>
              <p>The Singapore math title adopted by California this month for grades 1-5 is "<a href="http://www.singaporemath.com/FAQ_Primary_Math_s/15.htm"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Primary Mathematics Standards Edition</span></a>" -- which is adapted from the title developed by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore's Ministry of Education,</span> "Primary Mathematics." The Singapore math title adopted by California this month for kindergarten is "<a href="http://www.singaporemath.com/FAQ_Kindergarten_Math_s/14.htm"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Earlybird Kindergarten Mathematics Standards Edition</span></a>," an adaptation of the title "Earlybird Preschool Mathematics" used by kindergarten-aged children in Singapore. Student workbooks and teacher guides are also available from SingaporeMath.com as companions to the "Standards Edition" titles.</p>
              <p>Students who use Singapore math titles at Ramona Elementary "love the simplicity of the pictures" and "generally are very affectionate about them," Ramos said.</p>
              <p>"They love the little children giving advice," Ramos said. "There's joy, and they respond to that -- the book presents math simply and the students get that."</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Richard Askey, Ph.D. -- a professor emeritus of mathematics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison </span>-- added that the 2003 TIMSS results reveal that in elementary school "it is of primary importance to build a firm foundation of numbers and operations and leaning how to solve multi-step word problems, and the Singapore method does each of these."</p>
              <p>Askey is acknowledged by Marshall Cavendish International as a contributor on its state-approved title for grades 1-5.</p>
              <p>The distributor of the state-approved texts, SingaporeMath.com, will work with trainers from Staff Development for Educators and other Singapore math specialists to help California teachers use the textbooks, Thomas said.</p>
              <p>"We recognize that professional development is an essential part of the textbooks being successful in the classroom," said Thomas, a former community college professor. "There's no substitute for good teaching."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thomas and his wife, Dawn, a Singaporean, founded SingaporeMath.com <span style="color: #ff0000;">in 1998 after the couple returned to the U.S. after spending five years in Singapore. After returning to the U.S., the couple supplemented their daughter's math coursework with editions of "Primary Mathematics" from Singapore</span>.</p>
              <p>Shane Armstrong, senior group publisher &amp; head of Marshall Cavendish, said, "<span style="color: #ff0000;">The endorsement by the California Department of Education of 'Primary Mathematics' and 'Earlybird Kindergarten Mathematics' (Standards Edition) for use by schools in California as a core program is an exciting step forward, </span>and we will continue to work closely with SingaporeMath.com Inc. to provide the best math, teaching and learning support to educators and students in the U.S. -- particularly in California."</p>

              <p><br>For some reason lionnoisy sees the need to be noisy about just about every "achievement" done by Singapore, no matter how minor. Unfortunately he seems to have lost all sense of perspective on how minor these achievements truly are.</p>
              <p>Case in point, when we commissioned our Underground Ammo dump in mandai, he excitedly touted it as some kind of world first or as some revolution in engineering when actually the art of building underground military facilities have already been long perfected in the cold war to far larger and more complex extent in Cheyenne Mountain by the Americans.</p>
              <p>When this was pointed out to him, he tried to paint Mandai UAF as the equal of Cheyenne Mountain, which is not to say, quite a lost cause to begin with... and to make things funnier, when the vast disparity between what Mandai UAF is rated to survive (250 tons exposive force) versus Cheyenne Mountain (30 MEGATONs at 1nm), as well as the sheer difference in size and complexity between the two complexes (Cheyenne Mountain is designed to house an entire military base, along with the American Government with all its support facilities and survive nuclear attack, and sustain it for extended periods in an NBC environment, Mandai UAF is simply an ammo dump) was made known to him, he started to hint that maybe (in his wildest dreams) that Mandai UAF ought to be able to survive a 30 MEGATON blast.</p>

              <p>also our edu. system beaten by 3rd worlds countrys in math olymptics? Still got ongoing bullyings and dengues?</p>
              <p>In million dollars taxpayers world class education systems is this acceptables?</p>
              <p>This is because bullyings not adressed, no point for value add when you can't be free of bullyings.</p>

              <p><span>"SINGAPORE: More cases of bullying in schools have been reported in the past year and according to experts, the<span style="color: #ff0000;"> bullies are also getting younger</span>. <br><br>Last week, Channel NewsAsia ran a report on how <span style="color: #ff0000;">one special needs student was beaten up by his classmates in front of his mother</span>. <br><br>Two weeks ago, police received two reports on bullying. <br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">One involved a girl who was slapped, stripped and filmed by her schoolmates. <br></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">The other - a boy beaten up by his friends on his birthday - had to be hospitalised. <br></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">And now, a parent has called the Channel NewsAsia hotline about how her daughter's schoolmates were beating up their peers in the toilet, and locking them in the washroom.</span> <br><br>The parent, who did not want to be identified, said this took place in a girls school. <br><br>Is bullying a problem in Singapore schools? <br><br>In 2005, the Singapore Children's Society received 120 calls for help from victims of bullying. <br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Last year, this number was 176.</span> <br><br>The fact is, <span style="color: #ff0000;">most students do not even know about the existence of such a helpline. <br></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Furthermore, for every bullying case reported, there are dozens more who choose to remain silent out of fear. <br></span><br>The Coalition Against Bullying, who have been working with schools, say bullying is occurring at a younger age, even in pre-schools. <br><br>And with more students toting mobile phones, and innovations such as You Tube, cyber bullying is also becoming more rampant. <br><br>An increasing number of disturbing clips are also being posted online, prompting copy-cat behaviour. <br><br>"We have seen a few cases where they are very fearful to go to school because bullying happens in school. And recently one of my colleagues actually handled a case, this <span style="color: #ff0000;">Primary 2 girl, she's [having] <span style="text-decoration: underline;">suicidal thoughts</span> because the parents force her to go to school and the parents don't know that bullying happens in school</span>," says Tan Bee Joo, Head, Student Service Hub, Singapore Children's Society. </span></p>
              <p><span>Says Chia Poh Yok, President, Coalition Against Bullying, "<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>There are not many counsellors in schools, at most two in the secondary schools, and for teachers to rely on them, it would mean that teachers would just <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dump the cases on them.</span></strong> "</span></span></p>
