There was an underlying assumption in such a statement that the elected representatives were corruptible which obviously cast a big doubt on the ministers. Therefore the ministers being corruptible should not be trusted with putting up such self-reward motion. Moreover any forms of self-approved rewards unless they are properly tendered in pre-approved contracts of service or sanctioned by an organization through open and accountable remuneration system may be regarded as gratuities or corruptions liable to prosecution under the Corruption Act.<br><br>In other words the motion to pay the ministers the highest salaries equated to the highest earners in the private sector without sanction by independent pre-approved contracts of service or independent panels was tainted with bad and questionable motives. There was no study by independent panels of integrity or independence.<br><br>There was no explanation how to safeguard the interests of taxpayers after paying such salaries with holding the ministers of accountability and responsibilities in the event of failures or negligence in performance as practised in the private sector.<br><br>Most of the elected MPs had merely acquisced without saying a word to ask for open or public debates. The few who has said something were quickly shot down by authoritarian dares rather than convinced through objective debates or rationale. There was no rationale in equating the ministers' salaries to the highest earners in private sector like bankers or practising lawyers. Very simplistic comparison were given without the slightest semblance of giving objective apple-to-apple comparison as most or many of the highest earners in private sector were business owners themselves or  bosses who could easily inflate or pay their own highest wages as a means to avoid paying profits of their own firms to the taxes. So obviously the ministers were wrong in paying themselves the highest salaries equated to this group of business owners or bosses.<br><br>In any even if the ministers were to apply for any of those jobs said to be paid that kind of salaries they might not be qualified being lacking in relevant practical experiences for those jobs.<br><br>By that kind of reasoning argued in parliament it is very clear that the whole argument to pay ministers the highest salaries was without basis but was completely fallacious. Comparison was highly argumentative and irrational and the whole parliament was merely hookwinked.<br><br>So MM Lee thinks that he could use the same authoritarian argument to convince Malaysia to lend support to such apparently fallacious self-reward of ministers by paying Malaysian ministers also higher salaries to avoid corruption.  His rationale was easily dismissed by the Malaysian PM who said that he believed in integrity and paying the highest salaries was not the correct way.<br><br>Up to now MM Lee has been tongue-tied and unable to reply to Malaysia's PM rebuttal suggesting that paying his own ministers and his own salaries in such manner is morally untenable and is totally baseless and without justification. It has been easily debunked by Malaysian PM on the ground that ministers or government should be people with integrity not out to screw up people with paying themselve the highest self-reward using the public fund even though the ministers can succeed legally in pushing the vote with their own party majority. What is wrong will at the end still be wrong no matter how one tries to sugar-coat it with fallacious justification and arguments. No good arguments about self-rewards will ever make them less wrong. It smells rat !!!<br><br>When a government cannot see self-rewards as wrong and insists on using public monies to do so,  how is it going to preach to the people about rights or wrongs. For example when citizens vandalize public buildings after the NKF incident, government leaders openly advise people that two wrongs do not make a right. How is it going to determine what is wrong and right and who can decide what is right and what is wrong. Apparently without moral authority leader cannot govern the country and there is no meaning to such terms.</div>

Go and coduct a proper survey of how the ordinary tries to live with their dropping wages, and coping with rising costs of living. Try to understand that general perception painted by the state-controlled media has been artificially distorted by fallacies and all the look-good justification syndrome as shown in the Buangkok station case and past denials of high costs and other problems. There seems to be a government disease dogging our political scene for too many years, refusal to accept mistakes and negligence in performing duties and responsibility and act on them. They only want to carry on pushing the high-cost Goh Keng Swee doctrine (posted at PGPB thread) to no end even after all the feedbacks.<br><br>Eventually all the problems as posted in "People's Government Performance Benchmark" thread if not solved or postponed due to sycophantic praises by a few benefitting from the elitist system will just have to explode like the NKF. Take the many advices given by people who can see the whole picture and stop all the hypocrisy approach and act real.<br><br>It is hoped that they will become more objective in governing the country and not try to talk about past achievements which citizens do not deny. It is more important our leaders accept responsibility to keep up with the time the first being to accept their duties and responsibilities and taking pro-active actions to solve the PGPB problems. Only then can there be realistic and proactive corrections and earlier solutions to all the problems as posted here.</div>

No government is perfect, but ours is doing a very good job.

Surely the double charging on lands already owned by the taxpayers is wrong and morally reprehensible.<br><br>The fact that the GLCs and government are able to create all the high surpluses does not show at all to its own citizens that the country is doing well. It is not the same as people or the domestic sector of the economy doing well even if the top elites are doing well. You should know the difference. So by your saying that the government is objective and keeping things in balance is not in anyway helpful to solutions of existing problems.<br><br>In short you are unable to substantiate your  case that government is objective and keeping things in balance forgetting conveniently that as many of their policies in the past are not working any more and existing problems as posted at PGPB are causing unhappiness of the general population.<br><br>Should the government be excused from its failure since the last two recessions to do anything about increasing unemployed graduates and retrenched workers except in talking about generalities and statistical numbers which did not show where the problems lie.<br><br>The government definitely can do much better if there are competent and caring leaders who do not keep talking about past achievements but who will apply new solutions with creativity or entrepreneurship to deliver to people's needs and expectations. The wrongs or mistakes as posted in PGPB 1-29 will always be wrongs and mistakes and will not go away or be camouflaged until problems are admitted openly and solved one way or another.<br><br>After all since the government has without people's endorsement increased their own salaries many four folds since the 1970s and being the highest paid government ministers or world's best surely they will not try to compare their performance with the worse performers. Have they tried to recognize that smaller countries like Finland or Denmark have consistently delivered higher standards of living for their citizens with broad-based education and pro-people policies.<br><br>There is no reason why being the best paid ministers they should continue to sing their own praise or try to compare their performance selectively with worse performing countries. In my view, the ministers should not be excused from solving the GPPB 1-29 problems.</div>
