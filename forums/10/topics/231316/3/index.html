It is a norm now that those who are employed will face job security problem when we reach 40, those in countries without FT policies also face the same problem, blame it on globalization, the profit driven MNC.....as for me, I already gave up loyalty for any company, I work to stay employed until I find my way for making a living in the long term.<br><br>As for girls like that Wee (something), I wouldn't be bothered much. There are many parents who could only produce but are unable to give proper upbringing to their children. There are many girls out there, and I don't need my sons to marry "elites".<br><br></div></blockquote>It is a norm only if you accept it as that.<br><br>All countries have FT-like policies but they don't call it FT - they call it skilled. Their people still sit on top of the foreigners . Globalisation is there but overused as an excuse to invite foreigners . I see other countries doing well with their own sitting on top of foreigners.<br><br>The minister is paid a million to come up with the great policy of inviting foreigners with this merry go round the bush rationale . First they said that Singaporeans don't have enough global experience. When you have people who have enough global experience, Singaporeans are suddenly not willing to accept lower wages. When you have Singaporeans who are not willing to accept lower wages , FINALLY ACCEPTING LOWER WAGES , they say Singaporeans are not willing to reskill . When you have Singaporeans who reskill , they say that Singaporeans are not willing to accept lower wages.<br><br>But never mind ....they just invite foreigners to sit on top and pay them better plus call them foreign talents . Then when you point out that part - you get diversion therapy again - suddenly the foreign talent is this guy who accepts lower wages and willing to do a dirty job which no Singaporean want to do.<br><br>Good right? Diversional Therapy. That is what Singapore pays the ministers for. Good old Diversional Therapy .....when psychologists are charging so cheaply for compared to the amount Singaporeans have to pay.<br><br></div>

Since when foreigners are loyal. They take our jobs then once they gain experience,then they move ahead to european countries or USA for a better future. Singapore has silly rules and very high standard of living whreas in Europe or US, houses,cars and other stuff are affordable. Singapore is only a temporary home.</div>
