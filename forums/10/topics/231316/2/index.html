You respect them as they respect you.<br><br>I don't think dual citizenship has an impact on changing your life though. I know of one indigenous australian holding UK citizenship and a few australian born citizens who hold european passports.<br><br>To be brutally honest here, I rather have dual citizenship policy in place.<br>It is not about giving foreign talents an advantage especially if you can put a time lag on how fast they can apply for citizenship like 2 years continous stay in a country etc and additional requirements like english test etc.<br><br>Alternatively , put in a rule that states only Singaporean born can have dual citizenship. Americans put it the other way around ...only american born citizens cannot have dual citizenship.<br><br>It is about giving Singaporeans the advantage of going two ways like the foreign talents. That way the government can no longer say that it needs people with global experience when you have Singaporeans coming to and fro. Singapore is a land with human resource - with resources - you have import and export. Right now we got exports going ...the imports are all foreigners . The exports won't come back because the imports are going to challenge them not in terms of skill and experience but rather that of price.<br><br>Open the market . Let it flow 2 ways. That way you also have employers trying to keep the real talented Singaporeans in Singapore by offering them competitive salaries and the government will have to bring in incentives to retain Singaporeans to work in Singapore or else employers will go somewhere else for business.<br><br></div>

Singapore pays 1 million to ministers and the best policy they come up with is FT ....<br><br>There are ways to undo the damage but it will take a few years to rebuild up Singapore  as a place for Singaporeans since FTs are entrenched in the system now.<br><br>Australia invites FTs to come over because their talented Australians are being drained from their system into the US or Europe. However they keep their australians up on the top on and FTs below.<br><br>Singapore invites FT to come to sit on the top. And when you complain about FT taking jobs away - the distraction is directed at lower positioned FTs with the reason that they lower costs to make it competitive. So you cannot win the argument against FT policies unless you know what is truly going on. With the case of Singapore, highly doubt that .

It is harder for people to support that kind of price of a 5 room flat this days. Why? Because the price of the house increased until a level where by typical salary can be hardly to subtain it.</div>

Anyway, no venture no gain, I wish you and all like you all the best when you leave.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Singapore, with its limited land size (nothing we can do about), will have to change. Many already complained changes are too much too fast, but there are still people like you thinking the changes are too slow. I guess its a matter of who benefit from the changes. Finally all singaporean should benefit from all the changes, sooner or later, one way or another. There will always be those who can't wait, won't wait, don't want to wait.....but will the number grow every year? will it be significant to force some changes? I don't think so.</div>
