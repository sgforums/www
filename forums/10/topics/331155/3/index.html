              <p><br>bailing out will only help the rich get richer and irresponsible, average people got not much to loose except perhap got to look for another job, but for the rich to lost a job and asset, it will teach them a lesson. As a top rich man, you make a mistake and expect a bailout of 700bn to help you go thru safely, whereby the 700bn are taxpayers money or will be tax higher later on average people to compensate the lost in Fed reserve,  so in the end, the rich will never get into trouble, when times are good, they get the cash from the poors, and when time are bad, they also get money from the poors thru another channel, ie the govt</p>

              <p>...The governments paid for it in various ways: by taxation, by fiat
              money, by borrowing from banks (which created credit for the pur­pose),
              and by borrowing from the people by selling war bonds to them. Each of
              these methods of raising money had a different effect upon the two
              chief financial consequences of the war. These were inflation and
              public debt. The effects of the four ways of raising money upon these
              two can be seen from the following table:</p>
              <ol type="a">
              <li> Taxation gives no inflation and no debt. </li>
              <li> Fiat money gives inflation and no debt. </li>
              <li> Bank credit gives inflation and debt. </li>
              <li> Sales of bonds give no inflation but give debt. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>It would appear from this table that the best way to pay for
              the war would be by taxation, and the worst way would be by bank
              credit. How­ever, taxation sufficient to pay for a major war would have
              such a severe deflationary effect upon prices that economic production
              would not in­crease enough or fast enough. Any rapid increase in
              production is spurred by a small amount of inflation which provides the
              impetus of unusual profits to the economic system. Increase in public
              debt, on the other hand, contributes little of value to the effort
              toward economic mobilization.</p>
              <p>From this point of view, it is not easy to say what method of
              financing a war is best. Probably the best is a combination of the four
              methods mixed in such a way that at the end there is a minimum of debt
              and no more inflation than was necessary to obtain complete and rapid
              economic mobilization. This would probably involve a combination of
              fiat money
              and taxation with considerable sales of bonds to individuals, the
              com­bination varying at different stages in the mobilization effort...</p>

              <p>Now the problem is each institution is refusing to lend each other money, cos there is no trust, it is the time for the market to reshape itself by letting the stronger fish eats the weaker fish, If bank A cannot get money from the rich Bank B, let Bank B swallow some of bank A asset and business, become partner with bank B as the bigger shareholder, with that Bank B will certain help Bank A.</p>

              <p>how the american is going to finance the bailout bill of 700bn is by printing more money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>although i suppport no bailout but the consequences of it is quite clear. long and painful recession for USA and europe and probably some part of ASIA( especially so for Japan, Korea, Singapore).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a better way to pacify the mainstreet is probably to prosecuted a few of the guilty CEO and executive, so that the senator who oppose it can better sell the bailout plan to the ppl in their state.</p>

              <p><br>Once the financial institutions merged, there will be less finanical institutions as over the years, small and big financial insitutions had popped up here and there to grab short term profit will all be gone, mortages are guarantee by Insurance company, since insurance cannot paid the bank, the bank will eat up the insurance company and its assets then write off all the mortages slowly. </p>
