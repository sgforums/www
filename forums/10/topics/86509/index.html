            <div class='col-md body'>i agree some of the point. however, we are too small for big player to understand our position. about china policy, it a matter who need who more. of course china need our technology know how and we need their market for both benefits. but china can survive without our investment and recover by another country investment. but we will lose more if we lose china market.<br><br>american case is even more lopsided. basically we depend on them for market and investment. for american they are basically our customer and supplier, what position can we have against them for unfair foreign policy?  we are basically at their mercy for relocation. imagine if HP pull out of singapore operation and shifted to low cost production country with high skill labout such as Thailand. how many singapore company will be affected.<br><br>if we can he humble towards america, why not towards china? afterall we are yellow skin, we shouldnt discriminate against our own color ppl.<br>not asking for beg towards china, just fair treatment we show to american and china.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with that totally.We are in this state because we have an establishment that is fearful of change and prefers to remain in the comfort zone that change becomes absolutely vital.Forecasting trends should be made a top priority.And mass participation instead of a pool of talent found in one place alone will turn around our current malaise and inertia.<br></div>

Every country have nice and not so nice people. I  myself have some good friends and colleagues from China. They are the nice people I know.<br><br>As our Premier to be, he has to put the country's interest, be it political or economical, first priority. He has nothing to gain if he gain the support of Taiwan and lost his status and support of his own country and the region leaders. I could just prayed that the politics leaders of China to put themselves in the shoes of Singpore leaders being a country surrounded by Muslim states, big economic powers (China, US, Japan). Mr. Lee and his predecessors (Mr. Goh &amp; Snr. Mr. Lee) has tried very much effort to maintain the country's political peace (being neutral yet firm on certain national &amp; internatonal issues).<br><br>I hold no grudges with Chinese nationals here in Singapore, but iwth so much negative views on Xinghuanet. I hope that they will look at the situation at a much higher view than just making negative comments.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well said, sbs1zc.<br><br>Singapore perhaps needs to harken back to the model upon which it first built itself -- a non-aligned SE Asian model of Switzerland...neutral, going about its business quietly, and dealing equally with everyone while being armed sufficiently to detere any hostility.<br><br>It seems in the last 10 years or more that it has moved away from that stance and decided to play an active leadership role in the region wherever it believes it can influence and guide for its own agenda...that is making it enemies, a target, a magnet for criticism, and a pawn to be used any side when it suits them to do so.<br><br>I don't see any Swiss soldiers in Iraq doing reconstruction work, nor do you see them negotiating peace agreements between combatants...yet they manage a strong and vibrant economy, and no one considers them a threat.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Stevenson101:</div><div class="quote_body">China can in 30 years:<br><br>China has always enjoyed good relationship with Singapore, the problem now lies in that of economical profits but not hatred. I believe the problem should solve it self rather quick and hope our new Prime Minister would clean up his own behind. If not, some poor soul would have to clean it up for him.<br><br>If China starts to develop its rivers and forgo the need to use the Malacca Straits, what would happen to Singapore? What would we become?<br><br>We have to give respect to America, and still give face to China. We cannot offend the Jews, nor can we ignore the Muslims. Who is capable of really dealing with all of these problems ? Lee?<br></div></blockquote>I think for developing their rivers, the most important raw material among all their commodities is their oil. Having said that they will never rely 100% on a pipeline in thailand, reasoning is simple, thailand is quite big fan of the americans, the americans have a huge secret airbase somewhere in thailand and very often they conduct huge military exercises together. In a war between China and Taiwan would oil in thailand's pipeline still contniue to flow towards china?<br><br>The pipeline in myanmmar is more feasible as myanmmar is currently mostly embargoed by most of the western world including americans hence no western influence there, but still very friendly towards china. This could give myanmmar a new lease of life to it's economy in supporting their huge standing army, geographically their lands are also very close to China which would be easy to reinforce overland in the event of any conflict which threatens the pipeline. They also have an indifferent posture towards thailand(fans of americans) which makes them excellent candidates for guarding the pipeline.<br><br>This would in a little way benefit some of us. We could offer our expertise in say a joint venture to build and operate a refinery with the burmese government, help them develop some primary industries in oil and port management which complement our own higher industries?<br><br>Survival wise if you think abt it, if thailand builds a refinery all the industries related to it will move there because of easier access to oil, cheap labor, low cost and what not, malaysia not wanting to lose out will they jump the gun and build their own pipeline across their mainland? If everybody does that we will lose out big time! This way at least we still able to manage something from as far away as myanmmar. Maybe our citizens being more experienced, educated and already welcome there could enjoy a rich expatriate life?<br><br>But all this is still in on the drawing board. In the near future our waterway is still very much important to china current health and wealth much more so in a war with taiwan. Could be why they suddenly adopting this current attitude.<br><br>Maybe as a small gesture of neighbourliness and some "concrete measures" we could offer some limited access of our naval resupply facilities to them?</div>
