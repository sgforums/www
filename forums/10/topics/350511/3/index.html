              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">By Eugene Tang and Tian Ying</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">March 13 (Bloomberg) -- China, the U.S. government’s largest creditor, is “worried” about its holdings of Treasuries and wants assurances that the investment is safe, Premier <a style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; color: #006b99;" href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Wen+Jiabao&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Wen Jiabao</a>said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">“We have lent a huge amount of money to the United States,” Wen said at a press briefing in Beijing today after the annual meeting of the legislature. “Of course we are concerned about the safety of our assets. To be honest, I am a little bit worried. I request the U.S. to maintain its good credit, to honor its promises and to guarantee the safety of China’s assets.”</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">China should seek to “fend off risks” as it diversifies its $1.95 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves and will safeguard its own interests, Wen said. Chinese investors held $696 billion of U.S. <a style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; color: #006b99;" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=HOLDCH%3AIND">Treasuries</a> as of Dec. 31, an increase of 46 percent from the prior year.</p>

              <p><span>SOMETHING extraordinary is happening in Zimbabwe. Supermarket shelves that were empty three months ago are once more stacked with produce.</span></p>
              <p>Prices, practically doubling daily at one stage, have been going down.</p>
              <p>The simple explanation for this apparent miracle in Zimbabwe’s broken-down economy is that everything is now priced in US dollars or rands.</p>
              <p>Zimbabwe’s dollar, shrinking at a dizzying rate despite repeated efforts to relaunch it, has disappeared into nothingness, devoid of value except as a souvenir.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In late January, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe gave up trying to stem dollarisation of the economy, and let all companies and individuals conduct transactions in foreign currencies.</p>
              <p>Until then, only authorised businesses were allowed to do so. But retailers and service providers were increasingly demanding payment in US dollars or dollar-based fuel coupons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then, in a bid to keep the country’s currency alive, the bank announced further redenomination of Zimbabwe’s dollar: <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">one new unit for every trillion old units.</span></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In zimbabwe, if you were a trillionaire last year, this year it is only worth $1. being able to print money freely is so fun!</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">That is because the whole world is still dependent on the USA. You kill the US$, you kill the goose and you kill the goose, you kill yourself.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If the chart changes trend I will be willing to change my position. This is not like the stock market which is rather easy to predict. Exchange rates involves not just the exchange rates of the two countries but cross rates as well!</span></p>

              <p>I dont see how the USD would collapse as perceived by many of you guys. To me, as long as :-</p>
              <p>- Oil is priced in USD,</p>
              <p>- Commodities like gold and precious metals are priced in USD,</p>
              <p>- the USD is the world's reserve currency (ie, all other currencies use the USD as a intital cross rate)</p>
              <p>- many major world currencies are directly pegged to the USD, ie HKD, RMB etc.</p>
              <p>the USD won't collapse. I understand the dollar is running a massive deficit, but is that the sole reason for its 'imminent' collapse ?</p>
              <p>I may be short-sighted, and would like to hear a different side of the coin. Can someone educate me?</p>

              <p>Commodities, Gold, global Currencies are not priced Japanese Yen.  But then, why is the Japanese Yen being strengthening against the US dollar since it was free floated?</p>
              <p>This proved that it does not matter whether the whole world is priced in US dollar.  The global system somehow requires a depreciating US dollar.  Analysts provided reasons for this trend.  whatever.</p>
              <p>As USA is a net debtor superpower country, a depreciating US dollar is to their advantage.  They could print a lot of money because they are a super power.  as they print, they get a weaker US dollar which also means the creditors lose in terms of currency.  till now, creditors have financed the US by buying the US debts because etc etc...long list of reasons.  </p>
              <p>thats why, the US central bank knew that creditors might not finance the USA indefinitely just as what China is saying now.  So the US central bank said they (US central bank) would buy the US Treasuries themselves.  The big question is, when such thing happens, where would the US dollar go, up or down?</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">There are many things that the US government can do that China cannot. There are many things that the Japanese government can do that China cannot. USA and Japanese government will do it whatever it takes even if in the short term it hurts their economy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Example, Japan revalued its currency and their export industries took a massive hit.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Is that the way to go? To revalue your currency and take a massive hit?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">That is a moot question for Singapore and China. Their "solution" is to "ensure jobs are not lost". So which is the better "solution"?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Again, that is a moot question. Even if it is a better "solution" it is not open to Singapore and China. Singapore and Chinese governments are run by despots. They will take the "solution" that ensures they retain power.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Japan and the USA will take the solution that is "good" for the country even if in the short term it is "bad" for the people. If the people vote them out because short term it is painful, so be it. The leaders will honorably step down. They are not despots.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">China overtakes the US and the west in science and technology? That is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Science and technology, in order for it to flourish requires freedom in thought and freedom in the exchange of knowledge.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Once governments decide what "knowledge should be "free" and what knowledge is "damaging"; once governments  decide what information should flow and what information should be restricted; you restrict the progress of thought, science and technology.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The countries with the freest information flow and the freest collaboration in thought will do the best science and technology and progress furthest in thought.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sure, you are afraid that the freedom will lead to disaster like a man made virus run wild, so you put in some restrictions. But the countries with the least restrictions will produce the best science and technology.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">So you might ask, what has the freedom of pornographic information flow got to go with freedom in thought and freedom in the information flow of science and technology? It will take too long to explain this.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Whether or not you understand any of what I am trying to say, to say that China will overtake the West, with the freedoms the Westerners enjoy, in science and techonology is one of the stupidest things I ever heard.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Otherwise, it is not going to happen.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You do not use the US $ then what do you use? The Chinese Renminbi? hahahahaha dont make my toes laugh.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The USA is an open society. Whatever the US government does, it is open for the whole world to see, including their money printing activities.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">For all you know, the despots in China are also printing money like nobody's business but everyone is in the dark about it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Just the thought that the Chinese goevrnment can secretely print money like nobody's business will ensure that no one outside of China will ever trust the Chinese Renminbi.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">As long as the US$ is used for "everything" and "everything" is priced in US$, the USA can print US$ and get away with it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Again, it takes too long to explain all these to you</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">But to say that the Chinese Renminbi will replace the US$ (unless China can </span>successfully <span style="color: #ff0000;">get rid of the despots and transform itself) is just pure stupidity.</span></span></p>

              <p>it does not matter whether USSR exist today or not.  Based on your argument, communist regimes could not lead in science and technology.  Well you are wrong because it happened before in 1957.  </p>
              <p>dont try to change topic.  you are wrong and hence a big fool in my opinion.</p>
              <p>Again, you dont have the answer whether the US dollar would be UP or DOWN when the US central bank starts to print money to buy their own US government bonds.  Another evidence that you are an empty vase.</p>
