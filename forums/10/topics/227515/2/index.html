            <div class='col-md body'>A matter of fact, Singapore is under the hands of the lee family which is in power for 40 years. Be it LKY or Lee Hsien Loong. Even Temasek holdings and other semi-government firms are in the hands of the lee family. Aren't we under the hands of the communist society? Are we communist? Why are there cover-ups and other undertable lobangs in singapore government? Why can't we choose? Why can't we speak up? Its because singaporeans are scared. Cowardly society led the politicians to climb on top of our head. What is national service for? What is national service for the white horses? We are being treated unfairly.</div>

The chance to do good now vs the chance to do something when they win in forever?<br><br>Yes they do. But the scope is way larger for ministers.  It's easy to push a boulder half your size.  But the larger the boulder, the more effort it requires exponentially to move it the same distance.  Not to mention *bureacacy* is like the worst friction you get.  You cant just sack anyone in the civil service but you can in the private world.</div>
