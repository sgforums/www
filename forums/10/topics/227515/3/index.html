This is not the case since there are complaints of transparency issues by forumners .<br><br>If I am looking to invest in a company and I come across a company that does not give a clear financial expenditure and profits in their annual report budget , I will say it is dodgy and avoid investing.<br><br>However with a country , no citizen can say that's dodgy and not pay taxes. So there has to be a check and balance going on with paper trails from Ministries to the Treasury and Finance section  to account to taxpayers who actually funds the running of the government.<br><br>That system can only be waived if Singapore is a privately owned business with a few owners who have a stake in profitability .Don't tell me taxpayers  want a country to be runned like a privately owned business ?  It is a joke.<br><br>In Australia , I can access the budget expenditure and the federal government's guidelines for spending and procuring items easily (200+pages or so) , the financial laws that govern the Australian Commonwealth Departments ( 10-20 pages and quoted and requoted in each departmental budget books)  when I came across them for the first time in the University Library to answer a question on healthcare expenditure. Those puppies are like 300 to 600 pages altogether for each department (Defence, Health , Community etc)  answering for their spending and detailing what programs and policies have been spent on. The reason for their spending on a certain program/policy initiative , an overview of what they are doing, the extras they received, the spending they received their deficits and their surpluses and what has not been spent and what has been rolled over a 3 year financial period as well as on each singular policy and program they have placed out under each category they have to account for.<br><br>I  found out that I could access Parlimentary Senate Estimates where senators ask questions about everything for a particular department in a private session and the transcript is published in the open in that library.<br><br>I can track the budgets and spending for the states and territories as well.  Those are like 200-400 pages long.<br><br>Yes there are some classified under defence but still you know the amount went out for defence, just not the details of what has been bought.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Media Release: Singaporeans suffer under the foreign talent policy<br>16 Jan 07<br><br>The recent report showing that 70 percent of jobs created in 2006 went to foreigners is not a revelation.<br><br>In 2003, a group of professors from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) reported that three out of four jobs created in the past five years went to foreigners.<br><br>Then, the Ministry of Manpower immediately issued a statement to denounce the NTU's findings and produced its own figures: That nine out of ten newly created jobs went to the locals.<br><br>The professors quickly withdrew their report, citing computational errors.<br><br>The SDP had, at that time, asked the Government to hold an inquiry to ascertain the truthfulness of the economists' report and not merely bully them into silence.<br><br>Four years have passed and it is clear that the professors were right. Worse, Singaporeans have had to continue to suffer in silence under the PAP Government's ill-conceived policy even though it is reported that a majority of people want a more judicious application of the foreign talent (Sunday Times, 14 Jan 07).<br><br>The Singapore Democrats repeat our stand: The foreign talent policy must be re-examined so that only foreigners with the requisite skills are allowed to work in Singapore.<br><br>We proposed the Singaporeans First Policy back in 2001 where we wanted foreigners to get the jobs only when we cannot find Singaporeans with the necessary skills to do them.<br><br>The PAP Government is desperately trying to make-up for the stunted population growth that resulted from its cruel and myopic Stop-at-Two family planning policy by flooding the society with foreign nationals.<br><br>The resultant economic and social consequences from such an unthinking move will yet manifest themselves in horrendous ways, if they have not already.<br><br>In addition, the Government refuses to acknowledge that the slow birthrate in Singapore is primarily due to the high cost of living and stressful lifestyle in our society which deters couples from wanting more children.<br><br>It also ignores the fact that the exodus of Singaporeans, most of whom possess talent and skills our country needs, to other countries is a result of the suffocating system created by the PAP.<br><br>It is clear that the Government not only has no intention of owning up to these problems it created, but now seeks to plaster over them by encouraging the indiscriminate influx of foreign workers.<br><br>Its main objective, of course, is to suppress the wages of working Singaporeans so that we can claim to be a Â“competitiveÂ” economy.<br><br>This race to the bottom is doomed to failure. It merely exploits the vulnerable to make the vulnerable even more vulnerable. It also ensures that while the rich get richer, the poor are consigned to an even bleaker future.<br><br>It escapes no one that the ministers continue to peg their salaries to the richest of the rich in Singapore, and ignore the plight of ordinary Singaporeans. The Government is able to do this only because the people have had their voices taken away.<br><br>The only remedy to this, and other problems that citizens face, is for the people to regain their political rights to free speech and peaceful assembly. Only when citizens are able to physically congregate en masse and speak freely will the Government sit-up and pay attention.<br><br>Chee Soon Juan<br>Secretary-General<br>Singapore Democratic Party</div>

Therefore those who are really wise and talented refused to be under him. There's a saying "<strong>Those who are too smart to engage in politics are punished by being governed by those who are dumber</strong>."<br><br>Currently those who are willing to be under him may have attracted by the sum of salaries and bonuses that had sky rocked over the recent years or for other reasons, many are still doubting thier capability to be ministers and paliament members.<br><br>When real wise and talented people are not taking the highest place, people will be suffering or compromising Singapore's future. <strong>The punishment which the wise suffer, who refuse to take part in government, is to live under the government of worse men</strong>.<br><br>If we have a prime minister who is really outstanding and wise, i believe true wise men and talented will be keen to take part in politic.<br><br></div>
