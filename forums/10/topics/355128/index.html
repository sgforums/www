              <p><br>I really find it annoying when people like to refer themselves to farmers and peasants like they were some sort of lower class.</p>
              <p>We live in a urban city. The raw materials for everything we use is being made by someone on minimum wages . Minimum, because we want our stuff cheap and to hell to those in the 3rd World country who wants more wages, we'd just buy our stuff from another supplier who is willing to depress the wages of their employees more.</p>
              <p>Sounds familar?</p>
              <p>We whin about our wages being depressed so we can be more competitive when we would just as happily do it to a 3rd World Country as long as we can't see it.</p>
              <p>Farmers and peasants worked the whole day to provide us with what the human race <strong>needs. </strong>Our workload is nothing like them, we are abused nowhere close to them.</p>
              <p>So don't insult their labour like it's some degenerate chore below us to do. You eat the fruits of their labour for every meal.</p>

              <p>Can Lim Swee Say be a "Military Elite" - equal in brilliance to the 'star recruits' such as Lui Tuck Yew, Teo Chee Hean, George Yeo and Lee Hsien Loong ?</p>
              <p>God help the SAF if he should go beyond a single bar.</p>
              <p>Lim Hng Kiang was said to have no more than crabs on his shoulders and did not come near to being a star.</p>
              <p>The present dependence in drawing recruits from the SAF leadership into politics is a screwed up view of LKY - in believing that military leadership has the experience of "managing under pressure" and equal to the task of managing the Singapore political environment in the real world.</p>
              <p>LKY had said that US Space Agency placed their astronauts into years of rigorous training in various simulated conditions and have successfully managed their space programs under such "laboratory conditions". </p>
              <p>By extrapolating from NASA success, LKY believed that the Singapore Government can take a leaf out of NASA's methods to find political talents from various scholars put through the paces in the "leadership laboratory environment" in the SAF.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately - with the exception of Teo Chee Hean and George Yeo - those recruited from the SAF have shown dismal performance without the convictions, or visions, or forceful personalities of those from the "Civilian World" in the likes of Dr Goh Keng Swee, Lim Kim San, Hon Sui Sen, Richard Hu, Tony Tan, and the late Ong Teng Cheong.</p>
              <p>The list of SAF Leadership being recruited into politics seems to be drawn only from those with ONE-Star rank, while those with Two- and Three Stars are fit only to be Presidents and Vice-Presidents of Government Linked and Owned Companies.</p>
              <p>It must be too embarrassing for the PM to be a BG having to listen to a Minister with the rank of LG or MG.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Can Lim Swee Say be a "Military Elite" - equal in brilliance to the 'star recruits' such as Lui Tuck Yew, Teo Chee Hean, George Yeo and Lee Hsien Loong ?</p>
              <p>God help the SAF if he should go beyond a single bar.</p>
              <p>Lim Hng Kiang was said to have no more than crabs on his shoulders and did not come near to being a star.</p>
              <p>The present dependence in drawing recruits from the SAF leadership into politics is a screwed up view of LKY - in believing that military leadership has the experience of "managing under pressure" and equal to the task of managing the Singapore political environment in the real world.</p>
              <p>LKY had said that US Space Agency placed their astronauts into years of rigorous training in various simulated conditions and have successfully managed their space programs under such "laboratory conditions". </p>
              <p>By extrapolating from NASA success, LKY believed that the Singapore Government can take a leaf out of NASA's methods to find political talents from various scholars put through the paces in the "leadership laboratory environment" in the SAF.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately - with the exception of Teo Chee Hean and George Yeo - those recruited from the SAF have shown dismal performance without the convictions, or visions, or forceful personalities of those from the "Civilian World" in the likes of Dr Goh Keng Swee, Lim Kim San, Hon Sui Sen, Richard Hu, Tony Tan, and the late Ong Teng Cheong.</p>
              <p>The list of SAF Leadership being recruited into politics seems to be drawn only from those with ONE-Star rank, while those with Two- and Three Stars are fit only to be Presidents and Vice-Presidents of Government Linked and Owned Companies.</p>
              <p>It must be too embarrassing for the PM to be a BG having to listen to a Minister with the rank of LG or MG.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why bring Alan Ooi's sad affair into this Thread ?</p>
