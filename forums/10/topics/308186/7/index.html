              <p>Back in year 2003 I remember reading an article saying that the year China host the olympic, which is 2008, the global economy will experience a major slowdown or recession.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There was another article I read saying that whenever a country broke the record for the tallest building, there will be a recession. This was back in 2001 and Dubai has just broken the record last year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jim Rogers, who predicted the subprime crisis back in 2006 and in 1999 is also predicted a commodities rally. However the difference is that, he is sure about what he is talking and he made billion$ out of his prediction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AFAICR, subprime problem first appear in end 2006 and news of crisis eventually starts to build up months after that and the stock market first experience its major correction in Jun 07, 1 month before your "prediction", and the market take a 2nd beating in Jul 07.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence Andrew, may I ask you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How do you classified what you said as prediction when there was already news about stock market crash back in Jun07, and people like Jim Rogers first talk about it in 2006 and made billions out of it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You claim that you predicted the stock market crash back in July07. It would be nice if you could provide me a link for reference as I am really interested to find out if you are indeed a real deal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Nov07, I noticed you started a thread to talk about your prediction here.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nov07 <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/290788">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/290788</a> and</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>And then in Jan08, you started talking about getting into stock market again. And somehow, the thread have gone into hibernation mode. I guess you are still waiting for the right time to claim your prediction again right?</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Jan 08 </strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/2092/topics/305953"><strong>http://www.sgforums.com/forums/2092/topics/305953</strong></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As we all know that when the market crashed, the next possible movement will be for it to go up. Hence dont you think that it is quite meaningless to say that you can predict this and that when there is only 1 outcome of that event?</p>

              <p>Not enter and exit any time we wish? Then? Lock in forever? Have to seek Merrill Lynch's management approval to sell? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>A takeover is different from buying a 10% stake in the company, for takeovers you need to seek approval from the relevant authorities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) You mean if I have assets in the UK, but I denominate my assets in US$ instead of GBP. Not possible? Even if I have US$ assets,</p>
              <p>I forsee a depreciation in the US$ but not an appreciation of my investment, I will behave like you and not switch investment to another country.</p>
              <p>Sit there, wait for the US$ to depreciate and watch my investment go down the drain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) If you have investment analyst relying on another investment analyst's report on the newspaper about the US$, the company will surely make losses.</p>
              <p>Moreover, the likelihood of US$ hitting a low of SG$1.30 to SG$1.25 by end of the year is not unlikely.</p>
              <p>The US dollar might even crash as people lose confidence in using it as a medium for international trade, people are all diverting their assets from US$</p>
              <p>to Gold and Oil futures and options. That's why you see gold and oil skyrocketing, if nothing is done to correct the US$ drop, I won't be surprise if oil hits</p>
              <p>a high of US$150 to US$200 per barrel by year end.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Maurizio, SWF do not and CANNOT operate like any private investors in such high profile investment because of political and strategic reasons. I am not sure if you have been following the news of recent GIC and Temasek investments. When big companies like ML, UBS or Citi decided to arrange a marriage deal by issuing new shares or convertible bonds, they will have to seek shareholders approval because such transaction will dilute existing shareholders value and it could potentially create political implication. Remember this is SWF we are talking about, not Maurizio Investment Bank.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like it or not, the US$ is still the biggest trading currency in the world and there is no currency right now, not even the EURO, that is in position to replace it, unless if all oil producing countries decide to stop pricing their oil in US$.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) The world central banks are not as stupid as you think, and please dont assume they they are not aware of the falling US$ and it is in their interest to dump US$ for other currencies</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For example, the central bank of China, which is holding on to about US$1.3 trillions world of US$ asset, hasnt dump the US$. Furthermore their YUAN is still significantly under value against the falling US$.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the Middle East, most GCC countries currencies are still peg to the US$ despite the fact that inflation is hitting double digits and the US$ is falling. And till now, they are still holding on to their trillions of US$ assets. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>What is your opinion on that? (Would appreciate if you could answer my question)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) The purpose of highlighting DBS analyst and not UOB, Citi, or HSBC, is because DBS is a GLC, and that contradict what you say about MAS and our government is not aware of the depreciating US$.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You mention US$ hitting 1.25? May I know on what basis are you making the claim? Or are you simply guessing?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) The currencies of China, Vietnam, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain are all closely pegged to the US$ and the level of inflation they are facing is probably twice as much as what we have here in Singapore. What is your explanation on that? They are not pro citizen?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A weaker S$ is a double edge sword, one on hand it will speed up inflation which will have great implication on the lower income Singaporeans. However a weaker S$ will help promote Singapore exports, especially to USA and countries like China and Middle East, where their currencies are closely pegged to the dollar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>George Soros attacking Singapore financial system? Are you making baseless assumption that he has the financial muscle to do what he was being accused of doing to Malaysia? We are Singapore you know? Not some developing countries with screwed up banking system.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fool or no fool, I am sure forumers here can decide.</p>

              <p>Firstly <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">did not also say I and him doesn't think alike. Neither did I say both Andrew and me think alike.</span></span> It was all in your mind. You can claim initially that I said both Andrew and I think alike, then you claim again that I said both Andrew and I think differently (when I merely raised it as an example with the word 'if'). Seriously, something is wrong with you. Fact is, you like to put words into people's mouth. It has happened many times in this thread. The number of posts you did this spans over 3 pages. I can't comprehend how thick skinned you can be in continuously putting words in others mouth and then asking them why they said it. It hasn't happen just once; definitely not a coincidence or a moment of misunderstanding of sentences.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I have already answered your question (although the question was already wrong) at least 4 times. You are just blatantly whining that it has not been answered when the answer has been presented straight in your face. You have even quoted the answer to your own question yourself, as shown in my earlier post. Do you call this dumb?</p>
              <p>Thirdly, I agree. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">My compliment for you was PURE meaningless RUBBISH</span>. Your logical processing capability is virtually non-existent; any compliment on such a person like you is PURE meaningless RUBBISH in your words. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Since you want to force this fact upon all of us that a compliment on your thinking capability is meaningless rubbish</span></span>, we will gladly accept it. And I believe I do not need to point out the rubbish you have already posted in this forum; you know it yourself.</p>
              <p>Fourthly, my question, already earlier than yours, was even simpler. It is just a yes/no question on whether you admit to having put words into my mouth. Is it because the answer to my question is too obvious a yes that you can't be bothered to answer? If so, I will apologize for not understanding your unspoken intentions.</p>
              <p>Finally, isn't it obvious? Initially you try to argue for your wrong statement. Next, when you discovered you are totally cornered, you attempt to call it meaningless. I'm very sure all you want to do is to win, even at the expense of you being labelled a fool. So yup, you win!</p>

              <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - <strong>Stocks fell on Wednesday as plunging gold and oil prices drove energy and mining shares lower, and speculation that Merrill Lynch &amp; Co may need to take more write-downs deflated growing optimism that the credit crisis was abating.</strong></p>
              <p>The drop of more than 2 percent in all three major stock indexes came a day after the S&amp;P 500 rang up its biggest one-day jump in more than five years following stronger-than- expected earnings from investment banks and the Federal Reserve's deep cut in official interest rates.</p>
              <p>Gold prices slid in their biggest one-day drop in nearly two years and oil posted its worst slide in seven months, weighed down by persistent worries about the U.S. economy's health. The Standard &amp; Poor's index of materials stocks dropped 6.3 percent.</p>
              <p><strong>A lawsuit filed by Merrill Lynch (MER.N: </strong><a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/quote?symbol=MER.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Quote</strong></span></a><strong>, </strong><a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=MER.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Profile</strong></span></a><strong>, </strong><a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/researchReports?symbol=MER.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Research</strong></span></a><strong>) against a bond insurer fanned speculation the big broker and investment bank may not have enough protection against losses from its exposure to securities at the heart of the credit crisis. That may lead to more write-downs.</strong></p>
              <p>"Commodities are also getting tanked here. That's a positive for the market, but it also hurts energy and other stocks," said Todd Leone, head of listed trading at Cowen &amp; Co. in New York. "We had a great rally yesterday and probably came too far. There are rumors about Merrill. All brokerage stocks are down."</p>
              <p>The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI sank 293.00 points, or 2.36 percent, to 12,099.66. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index .SPX dropped 32.32 points, or 2.43 percent, to 1,298.42. The Nasdaq Composite Index <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=us%21comp"><span style="color: #0000ff;">.IXIC</span></a> shed 58.30 points, or 2.57 percent, to 2,209.96.</p>
              <p>Shares of Merrill Lynch fell 11.1 percent to $41.45, a drop that Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading, attributed to rumors about further write-downs.</p>
              <p>"Either way something stinks over there and the way the market has been lately ... people shoot first and ask questions later. Nothing has been verified by anybody," Saluzzi said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FEAR FACTOR</p>
              <p>Energy shares were among the biggest drags on the market as the price of oil slid nearly $5 a barrel after worries about the economy overshadowed bullish weekly data.</p>
              <p>An index of energy shares fell 5.4 percent -- its biggest one-day percentage drop since October.</p>
              <p>Exxon Mobil shares were the S&amp;P's biggest laggard, falling 4.6 percent to $84.43, while ConocoPhillips (COP.N: <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/quote?symbol=COP.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Quote</span></a>, <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=COP.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Profile</span></a>, <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/researchReports?symbol=COP.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Research</span></a>) slid 6 percent to $73.61 and Chevron (CVX.N: <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/quote?symbol=CVX.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Quote</span></a>, <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=CVX.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Profile</span></a>, <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/researchReports?symbol=CVX.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Research</span></a>) fell 4.9 percent to $81.89.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange Volatility Index .VIX -- Wall Street's favorite fear gauge -- jumped 15.7 percent a day after its fourth-biggest daily drop in 14 years.</p>
              <p>Shares of Alcoa Inc (AA.N: <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/quote?symbol=AA.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Quote</span></a>, <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=AA.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Profile</span></a>, <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/researchReports?symbol=AA.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Research</span></a>) fell 7.7 percent to $35.62 and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N: <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/quote?symbol=CAT.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Quote</span></a>, <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=CAT.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Profile</span></a>, <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/researchReports?symbol=CAT.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Research</span></a>) dropped 4.1 percent to $73.73.</p>
              <p>A bright spot, though, was provided by the housing sector. Shares of Fannie Mae (FNM.N: <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/quote?symbol=FNM.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Quote</span></a>, <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=FNM.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Profile</span></a>, <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/researchReports?symbol=FNM.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Research</span></a>) climbed 8.8 percent to $30.71, while Freddie Mac (FRE.N: <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/quote?symbol=FRE.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Quote</span></a>, <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=FRE.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Profile</span></a>, <a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/stocks/researchReports?symbol=FRE.N"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Research</span></a>) shot up 14.9 percent to $29.90 after they won approval to pump $200 billion into the distressed U.S. housing market.</p>
              <p>Trading was heavy on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.97 billion shares changing hands, above last year's estimated daily average of roughly 1.90 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.32 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.17 billion.</p>
              <p>Declining stocks outnumbered advancers by a ratio of more than 2 to 1 on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq.</p>
