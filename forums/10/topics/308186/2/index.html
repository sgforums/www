              <p>maurizio13, you seems to have a very negative view on GIC and Temasek's investment in the few bluechip banks. I am just wondering if you dare to put your money and bet against GIC and Temasek ability to make a profit from these investment in let say 12 to 18 months? </p>

              <p>I guess in the longer term, Temasek will do fairly well. But not great.</p>
              <p>Nobody can predict the future. Short term losses are inevitable. Moreover, Merril Lynch is not a company that goes bust easily looking at its financial statements.</p>
              <p>However, i dont think Temasek is buying at a price with enough margin of safety. The management is making impatient decisions. <strong>When you have lots of cash at hand, you always feel like doing something, which may be a mistake.</strong> In the longer term, i dont think they will incur losses, but their gains also will not be fantastic. I do not blame them because Temasek is not like Warren Buffett. If they dont beat the market in the long term what can we do? Suck thumb only, let them play with the country's money. They should report their annual returns using the STI and S&amp;P as yardstick to compare performance. GIC also!</p>
              <p>I'm not happy as they didn't disclose their returns. What kind of transparency is the garmen talking about? LOL</p>

              <p>I am already betting that these are good investment and it will yield reasonably good returns in 12 to 18 months considering the limited investment opportunities available right now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am just responding to what some forumers (might include you) are saying that they can make better returns from putting money in Australia fixed deposit than CPF 3.5%. So I am asking why didnt the australia pension fund deposit their money in fixed deposit? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are confident about Temasek and GIC making wrong decision on ML, Citi, and UBS, are you willing to bet against this investments?</p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p>Place you bet here and we revisit this thread in 12 months time?</p>

              <p>Most definitely better than what Temasek paid for US$48 per share.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If Temasek hadn't provided a capital injection to Merrill Lynch,</p>
              <p>the share price would have gone much lower.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If they had adopted that strategy of not providing funds to Merrill Lynch,</p>
              <p>Merrill Lynch fails to get funds from other sources, the price could</p>
              <p>possibly be US$40 now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think there is another 2-3 quarters of reporting for the sub-prime</p>
              <p>debacle to unravel itself. More foreclosures, more unsold houses,</p>
              <p>fall in property price, loss in equity value of properties, more losses</p>
              <p>in the mortgage funds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Funny how the Fed manages a credit crunch, it lowers Fed Fund Rate</p>
              <p>to increase borrowing, which in reality should be increase Fed Fund Rate</p>
              <p>to decrease borrowing to rein in the credit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think the lowering of Fed Fund Rate is to increase borrowing and increase</p>
              <p>spending because they forecast a recessionary economy this year.</p>

              <p>Can we see it as 'buying' the 'goodwill' of the financial sector? Financial sector is one of the pillars of Singapore economy. Some tangible benefits might be lost, but the intangible benefits are definitely still there. Eg, while Citigroup is retrenching people in the US, they are still employing fresh graduates this year (4 were employed this year, 3 from SMU and 1 (my friend) from NUS )</p>
              <p>But then, to counter my own argument, the buying of the telecomms in Thailand is a total flop.</p>

              <p>Today Merrill Lynch's share price drop to a daily low of US$42.58 per share as</p>
              <p>compared to the discounted purchase price of US$48 per share Temasek took.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> In a span of 3 months, the initial amount of US$4.4 billion invested by Temasek</p>
              <p>has shrunk to US$3.9 billions, a loss of US$500 million for Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The investment is denominated in US Dollars, with the depreciation of the US dollar</p>
              <p>with respect to other currencies and the Singapore dollar, by the time we can cash</p>
              <p>out our investment, the exchange rate would most probably be (US$1 = SG$1.25 or SG$1.30).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if we managed to breakeven with US$4.4 billion (exchange rate of US$1 = SG$1.42),</p>
              <p>we would have loss during the conversion to Singapore dollars.</p>
              <p>We paid approximately SG$6.248 billions (US$1 = SG$1.42) for it in Dec 2007, but we will be getting back SG$5.50 billions (US$1 = SG$1.25).</p>
              <p>A breakeven investment but a resultant SG$748 million loss in capital during foreign exchange conversion.</p>
              <p>I guess it should be alright for the government, afterall what's another few percentage point increase in GST to recover the loss.</p>
              <p>Maybe increases in MRT fares, phone charges, postal charges, electricity, water, bus, etc</p>
