              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">If it takes 50 years, using the money to get interests will probably give you better returns if you compund the interests.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">er... what if Temasek becomes another Lehman? How will your views change? Maybe another AIG would be a better analogy because this present regime will tax the people rather than let Temasek go the way of Lehman.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Even when letting Temasek be broken up into million pieces is wiser, more honorable and better for the country, the dishonorable bunch of despots lording over Singapore will not.</span></span></p>

              <p>I beg to differ... Some ppl take risks... But for people like me who have more patience, will NOT take the risk during a crisis, i rather wait for the rain to stop and squeeze with some people than risking outiside alone. After all, we will all get to out destination, ur risk takes u there faster, but is it worth the risk?</p>

              <p>if you wait till the rain stops, market has already jumped quite a bit and you might end up buying high and then selling low after you realised that another rain is here.</p>
              <p>so buy during market crash and then average down on further crashes, like now.  however, make suer that you can stomach the risk and able to take the paper loss.  a time proven strategy is to identify good out-performing blue chip to average down with.  good luck.</p>

              <p>There is a difference between risk and pure stupidity. It's especially hard for the purely stupid to distinguish between the two. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you track back to the first few pages of this thread, from the onset when Temasek made an unrealized gain from the purchase of Merrill Lynch shares with a lock-in of 1 year (Temasek paid US$48 when ML was trading at US$52), I already said it was a bad investment choice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But some folks here oblivious to the impending financial disaster chose to brandish the illusory hallucination that Temasek made money from the purchase of Merrill Lynch. Do you need stronger alkaloids or have you awoken from your slumber?</p>

              <p>if the credit woes worsen in US and the fed no longer have fund to bailout banks.. ML will be allow to fail since its not a deposit holding company... all our CPF monies will be down into the drain and some ppl here who start to feel the pinch..</p>
              <p>NO banks is too big to fail... if you look back to the great depression 1837 caused by credit crisis and bubbling asset bubble, 343 banks failed and US went into a long depression..</p>
              <p>this time round, the power of deleveraging as well as global asset bubble... this crisis is going to be the worst in human history.. many banks in US, UK, Japan etc will fail... insurers will fail too.. ML is not spared since its jus an investment bank cum brokerage..</p>

              <p>well i did not even mention about investing in shares till in recent days.</p>
              <p>however, my honest opinions remain to be invest in shares during crises within your means.  an indicator would be newspapers reporting like crazy how serious the crisis is.</p>
              <p>of course the choice is yours and why should you get so agitated, i wonder.</p>

              <p>Why are you talking to my Uncle Andrew from IMH like that, do you know that he is suffering from agitation syndrome??, everything to him is ass and silly stuff, only Dr Chee can cure him, unfortuntely Dr Chee had since resigned from IMH to seek better pasture.</p>
              <p>Since Dr Chee left, i hv been mixing and trying to find the right medical solution for him. Actually, the melamine milk can cool him now, but damn, it's now banned.</p>
