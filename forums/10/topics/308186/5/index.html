              <p>Firstly<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">did not also say I and him doesn't think alike. Neither did I say both Andrew and me think alike.</span></span> It was all in your mind. You can claim initially that I said both Andrew and I think alike, then you claim again that I said both Andrew and I think differently (when I merely raised it as an example with the word 'if'). Seriously, something is wrong with you. Fact is, you like to put words into people's mouth. It has happened many times in this thread. The number of posts you did this spans over 3 pages. I can't comprehend how thick skinned you can be in continuously putting words in others mouth and then asking them why they said it. It hasn't happen just once; definitely not a coincidence or a moment of misunderstanding of sentences.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I have already answered your question (although the question was already wrong) at least 4 times. You are just blatantly whining that it has not been answered when the answer has been presented straight in your face. You have even quoted the answer to your own question yourself, as shown in my earlier post. Do you call this dumb?</p>
              <p>Thirdly, I agree. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">My compliment for you was PURE meaningless RUBBISH</span>. Your logical processing capability is virtually non-existent; any compliment on such a person like you is PURE meaningless RUBBISH in your words. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Since you want to force this fact upon all of us that a compliment on your thinking capability is meaningless rubbish</span></span>, we will gladly accept it. And I believe I do not need to point out the rubbish you have already posted in this forum; you know it yourself.</p>
              <p>Fourthly, my question, already earlier than yours, was even simpler. It is just a yes/no question on whether you admit to having put words into my mouth. Is it because the answer to my question is too obvious a yes that you can't be bothered to answer? If so, I will apologize for not understanding your unspoken intentions.</p>
              <p>Finally, isn't it obvious? Initially you try to argue for your wrong statement. Next, when you discovered you are totally cornered, you attempt to call it meaningless. I'm very sure all you want to do is to win, even at the expense of you being labelled a fool. So yup, you win!</p>

              <p>Back to the topic... I warned in July 2007 to get out of the stock market and announced to everyone that I personally had done so. Yet the dishonorable despot with Singaporeans hard earned money bought more Barclays bank shares then and the shares are now almost off by 50% from July 2007. Just think how much they have lost. They could have saved almost 50% of a billion (?, 10 billion?) or double the number of shares they own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They should just pay Singaporeans a decent and fair interest on Singaporeans CPF which is money they forceably take instead of behaving like the dishonorable despots and jinx that they are, losing Singaporeans sweat money to foreigners.</p>

              <p>maurizio, buying a huge equity stake in a bluechip company such as ML is not like trading shares in the stock market, where you can enter and exit anytime you like.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you talk about forex loses, are you aware that,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Most of Singapore reserves are still in US$ denomination,, hence it will not make a difference if they buy ML at 1.38 or 1.45</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) In 2007, analyst at DBS; which is a GLC, has already forecasted that US$ will hit as low as 1.38 in 2008, way before Temasek acquire ML. You mean those guys at Temasek and GIC dont read newspaper?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Suppose if Temasek and GIC are so concern about FOREX loses, I am sure it will not be difficult for them to get MAS to devalue the S$ just to make their investment look pretty isnt it? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What seperate a good investor from an average one is his/her ability to identify opportunities when everyone else are running for cover.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Not enter and exit any time we wish? Then? Lock in forever? Have to seek Merrill Lynch's management approval to sell? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>A takeover is different from buying a 10% stake in the company, for takeovers you need to seek approval from the relevant authorities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) You mean if I have assets in the UK, but I denominate my assets in US$ instead of GBP. Not possible? Even if I have US$ assets,</p>
              <p>I forsee a depreciation in the US$ but not an appreciation of my investment, I will behave like you and not switch investment to another country.</p>
              <p>Sit there, wait for the US$ to depreciate and watch my investment go down the drain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) If you have investment analyst relying on another investment analyst's report on the newspaper about the US$, the company will surely make losses.</p>
              <p>Moreover, the likelihood of US$ hitting a low of SG$1.30 to SG$1.25 by end of the year is not unlikely.</p>
              <p>The US dollar might even crash as people lose confidence in using it as a medium for international trade, people are all diverting their assets from US$</p>
              <p>to Gold and Oil futures and options. That's why you see gold and oil skyrocketing, if nothing is done to correct the US$ drop, I won't be surprise if oil hits</p>
              <p>a high of US$150 to US$200 per barrel by year end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Having a dirty float and manipulating it is counter productive. Why? You are directly promoting inflation in Singapore and speculative attacks from</p>
              <p>currency traders like George Soros.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your explanation is equivalent to, <strong>fools rush in where angels fear to tread</strong>.</p>
              <p>Whether they have made good overseas investments, you can look up the historical purchases of overseas companies.</p>
              <p>Extremely good examples would be Global Crossing, Optus, Shin Corp and Suzhou Industrial Project.</p>
              <p>The only companies giving good profits are those Singapore companies who have monopoly power.</p>

              <p>Not enter and exit any time we wish? Then? Lock in forever? Have to seek Merrill Lynch's management approval to sell? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>A takeover is different from buying a 10% stake in the company, for takeovers you need to seek approval from the relevant authorities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) You mean if I have assets in the UK, but I denominate my assets in US$ instead of GBP. Not possible? Even if I have US$ assets,</p>
              <p>I forsee a depreciation in the US$ but not an appreciation of my investment, I will behave like you and not switch investment to another country.</p>
              <p>Sit there, wait for the US$ to depreciate and watch my investment go down the drain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) If you have investment analyst relying on another investment analyst's report on the newspaper about the US$, the company will surely make losses.</p>
              <p>Moreover, the likelihood of US$ hitting a low of SG$1.30 to SG$1.25 by end of the year is not unlikely.</p>
              <p>The US dollar might even crash as people lose confidence in using it as a medium for international trade, people are all diverting their assets from US$</p>
              <p>to Gold and Oil futures and options. That's why you see gold and oil skyrocketing, if nothing is done to correct the US$ drop, I won't be surprise if oil hits</p>
              <p>a high of US$150 to US$200 per barrel by year end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Having a dirty float and manipulating it is counter productive. Why? You are directly promoting inflation in Singapore and speculative attacks from</p>
              <p>currency traders like George Soros.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your explanation is equivalent to, <strong>fools rush in where angels fear to tread</strong>.</p>
              <p>Whether they have made good overseas investments, you can look up the historical purchases of overseas companies.</p>
              <p>Extremely good examples would be Global Crossing, Optus, Shin Corp and Suzhou Industrial Project.</p>
              <p>The only companies giving good profits are those Singapore companies who have monopoly power.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am retiring from explaining issues to you, you can continue blabbing all you want,</p>
              <p>you only have a one track mind, to promote and glorify the P4P regime, you are</p>
              <p>not adhering to logic and common sense. You will continue side stepping issues</p>
              <p>after I have given you an explanation, bring up new topics to win at all cost.</p>

              <p>Back to the topic... I warned in July 2007 to get out of the stock market and announced to everyone that I personally had done so. Yet the dishonorable despot with Singaporeans hard earned money bought more Barclays bank shares then and the shares are now almost off by 50% from July 2007. Just think how much they have lost. They could have saved almost 50% of a billion (?, 10 billion?) or double the number of shares they own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They should just pay Singaporeans a decent and fair interest on Singaporeans CPF which is money they forceably take instead of behaving like the dishonorable despots and jinx that they are, losing Singaporeans sweat money to foreigners.</p>

              <p><br>Back in year 2003 I remember reading an article saying that the year China host the olympic, which is 2008, the global economy will experience a major slowdown or recession.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There was another article I read saying that whenever a country broke the record for the tallest building, there will be a recession. This was back in 2001 and Dubai has just broken the record last year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jim Rogers, who predicted the subprime crisis back in 2006 and in 1999 is also predicted a commodities rally. However the difference is that, he is sure about what he is talking and he made billion$ out of his prediction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AFAICR, subprime problem first appear in end 2006 and news of crisis eventually starts to build up months after that and the stock market first experience its major correction in Jun 07, 1 month before your "prediction", and the market take a 2nd beating in Jul 07.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence Andrew, may I ask you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How do you classified what you said as prediction when there was already news about stock market crash back in Jun07, and people like Jim Rogers first talk about it in 2006 and made billions out of it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You claim that you predicted the stock market crash back in July07. It would be nice if you could provide me a link for reference as I am really interested to find out if you are indeed a real deal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Nov07, I noticed you started a thread to talk about your prediction here.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nov07 <a href="/forums/10/topics/290788">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/290788</a> and</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And then in Jan08, you started talking about getting into stock market again. And somehow, the thread have gone into hibernation mode. I guess you are still waiting for the right time to claim your prediction again right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jan 08 <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/2092/topics/305953">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/2092/topics/305953</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As we all know that when the market crashed, the next possible movement will be for it to go up. Hence dont you think that it is quite meaningless to say that you can predict this and that when there is only 1 outcome of that event?</p>
