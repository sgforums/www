              <p>Eagle :</p>
              <p>You think different from <strong>us </strong>is not the same as we think alike.<br>It is just like a I'm a circle, Andrew is a square and you are a triangle. You are different from us, but it does not mean we are alike in any way.</p>

              <p>I'm complimenting you (already mentioned earlier).</p>
              <p>Next I will foresee you will want to ask how is it a compliment. Thinking differently means you can see things in different and interesting perspectives, something that both of us might not be able to see, even though our perspectives may already be different.

                      both ideas A and B, but with you thinking differently, all of us share ideas A, B
                      and C; we have more opinions.</p>

              <p>Question: Mind explaining to us what is the underlying purpose
                          of saying what you said? </p>
              <p>Proof2:<br> <img src="http://www.geocities.com/gh123_1999/proof2.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>So mind explaining to everyone why you are continuously
                          demanding an answer to a question already answered (and you have
                          already quoted)?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I believe you cannot read well, so I shall requote for you. No point avoiding this post. Are you trying to stroke your ego or? Isn't the answer blatantly staring at you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And TCH, it is your habit to twist challenges away when you cannot prove it. You made a claim, I challenge it. So why no reply to it? <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Have you silently admitted </strong><strong>that you put words into my mouth</strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>?</strong></span></span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I wish to remind you again that I am fully aware of your
                                              old habits of using questions to avoid question.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Please also explain why you have continuously avoided answering whether you admit putting words into my mouth by asking another question like what is the purpose of my sentence. If you did not even understand the purpose originally, why state your claim? Why even make your post in page 3?</p>
