              <p>I suppose the reason why you talk about gold investment is to highlight that you are an expert in this area and you are a better investor than Temasek and GIC??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually I also bought 1 kg in Q4 last year and it is now trading at around US$970 an ounce. Do you think there is still some upside to gold? And why?</p>

              <p>Like any commercial decision, he will have the right to question the decision if his shares of the companies give him the right to be represented in the BOD. How much tax is maurizio paying? owning one lot of OCBC doesn't give him the right to question Mr. Wee.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Simple logical explanation, if you think that Temasick (Singapore Government) did factor in the depreciation of the US Dollar in Dec 2007.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Would it be cheaper to pay approximately SG$6.248 billions (US$1 = SG$1.42) for Merrill Lynch in Dec 2007,  or pay SG$6.072 billions (US$1 = SG$1.38)</p>
              <p>for it now? At the end of the year, if the US Dollar falls to US$1 = SG$1.30, would it be cheaper to pay for it using SG$5.72 billions?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are ONLY factoring in the depreciation of the US Dollar, you haven't even factor in the likely losses from the sub prime debacle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the wide exposure of Merrill Lynch to sub prime mortgages.</p>
              <p>Do you think that it was a worthwhile investment if Merrill Lynch gave you an approximately US$5 discount from it's share price from it's</p>
              <p>share price of around US$53 in Dec 2007.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did they even factor in the imminent recession facing USA in 2008?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then again, Temasick is not directly using CPF funds, so directly it's not the money of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BUT indirectly, MAS makes a loan of close to $100 billions to Temasick, CPF makes a loan of $100 billons to MAS.</p>

              <p>maurizio, buying a huge equity stake in a bluechip company such as ML is not like trading shares in the stock market, where you can enter and exit anytime you like.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you talk about forex loses, are you aware that,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Most of Singapore reserves are still in US$ denomination,, hence it will not make a difference if they buy ML at 1.38 or 1.45</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) In 2007, analyst at DBS; which is a GLC, has already forecasted that US$ will hit as low as 1.38 in 2008, way before Temasek acquire ML. You mean those guys at Temasek and GIC dont read newspaper?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Suppose if Temasek and GIC are so concern about FOREX loses, I am sure it will not be difficult for them to get MAS to devalue the S$ just to make their investment look pretty isnt it? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What seperate a good investor from an average one is his/her ability to identify opportunities when everyone else are running for cover.</p>

And I will be surprise that, suppose in 6 months time, when the market start to recover, you wont be telling us that back in Jan08, you have already "predicted" a market recovery.</p>

              <p>Somehow he also put words into my mouth in other threads.</p>
              <p>But to be fair, it may be because he thinks in a different way from <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">us</span></strong>, which is btw, a compliment.</p>

              <p>You are supposed to understand english and set theory (maths).</p>
              <p>You think different from us is not the same as we think alike.<br>It is just like a I'm a circle, Andrew is a square and you are a triangle. You are different from us, but it does not mean we are alike in any way.</p>
              <p>Gosh, simple elementary comprehension you also cannot understand. Guess I have to go down to the way I talk to kids when I talk to you for you to understand</p>

              <p>Oh, another case of putting words into my mouth.</p>
              <p>But it's ok that you don't understand simple logic. You have demonstrated that fact many times.</p>
              <p><br>Add on: I see that you have somewhat gotten the point:</p>
              <p>You mentioned:<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A triangle think differently from a circle and square</strong> when circle and
                      square doesnt even think alike. </span><br><br>So, I have mentioned you think differently from us. Have I even minutely mentioned both me and Andrew think alike? If I haven't, wouldn't that be you putting words into my mouth?</p>
