            <div class='col-md body'>To reply you,<br><br><strong>Thanks for the clarifications at least it is the US Citizens - affected by the 9-11 incident, and not the USA as a Nation Â– suing the SaudiÂ’s. This is an insignificant event, and is part of life in the USA, where one will litigate for the slightest of reasons. </strong><br><br>And one that is insignificant to you may be significant to others. Who is to say that USA is not dangling the carrot and brandishing the stick in the 9-11 affair to silence the Saudis.<br><br><strong>Good for Malaysia in being involve in all the Third World Organizations, so that they can assert their level of superiority and lord over those who are slightly or far behind them. </strong><br><br>Now now, no need to be so nasty .. since when did they do that?<br><br><strong>Measure oneself with the Best of the Best, and help those who cannot measure up to oneself or measure oneself with the worst, and assume leadership of the backward, and holler against the Best. When you cannot compete with the Best, and unable to gain acceptance by the Â“BestÂ” - for the skewered Â“pariahÂ” views of the World, you will then wallow with those who empathize with your position. </strong><br><br>No need for sour grapes here. Just because we don't do the things they do, we don't have to put them down or call them names.<br><br><strong>Is this not the common views that Politicians are idiots Â– to put it mildly? Others would judge them in a worst light, by calling them snakes. You are too generous to put Thabo Mbeki alongside great luminaries such as LKY, Deng, and Clinton(?). </strong><br><br>And what did Thabo do wrong? After all, he is inheriting a nation that has great social, racial and economic divide. He is as great (or even greater) than GCT.<br><br><strong>In politics, viciousness knows no bounds; oneÂ’s private preferences in life should be oneÂ’s private business Â– that even applies to Clinton. The Malaysian Chinese cheering of AnwarÂ’s downfall was largely due to his policies and views taken as a Finance Minister, who listened too much to IMF and Foreign Financial Advisors, and implemented policies to combat the Financial Crisis in 1997, without being too circumspect to the effects that those policies will cause to the Malaysian Economy. </strong><br><br>Why would the Chinese only cheer this? Won't the Malays also be affected? The chinese cheered because they know Dr M is tolerant than Anwar.<br><br><strong>With Anwar's ambition to be the next Malaysian PM, it will be suicidal for his ambitious plans if he had continued with his "anti-Chinese" attitude which he espoused during his early day in politics as a youth. </strong><br><br>Of course he will have changed his stripes, until he becomes the PM, then, the truth will be known.<br><br><strong>The emphasis was on Â“PERSONALÂ” benefits. </strong><br><br>YES .. I agree with you .. Its always about KICKBACKS. But then again, politics all around the world is like that. Guess that we should buy Haliburton Shares now. After Iraq is taken over, their stock will soar.<br><br><strong>If by Â“peonsÂ”, you mean those high sounding Â“titledÂ” personalities, it would be far more accurate a description in the Malaysian Â“PatronageÂ” system. </strong><br><br>Nah ... the datuks and wellheeled still need food, homes, servants, mistresses and consumer items. The money will trickle all the way down to the bottom layer.<br><br><strong>At least, Li Kah Shing started off by being entrepreneurial, borrowing his start-up capital, and through his own ingenuity, foresight, and industry, he is where he is today. </strong><br><br>And 90% of the Malaysian Chinese business are like that as well. So what's your point?<br><br><strong>Did he have a Prime Minister for a father, to help him get a head start in having his own multi-million dollar PRIVATE corporations formed for him ? </strong><br><br>Are you talking about Malaysia? I thought you were talking about Singtel.<br><br><strong>It is unfortunate that on both sides, the funds from both countries have been wasted in some over ambitious overseas investments Â– but for each country, the political objective behind such investments are quite different.  SingaporeÂ’s funds utilized in overseas investment is largely with the CountryÂ’s national reserves, managed by the G.I.C or companies formed to manage such investments. </strong><br><br>Which is worse as that meas that MY TAX DOLLARS are being used. Which there is no accountability, and NO share of the dividends if there is any profit.<br><br><strong>In MalaysiaÂ’s case, much of the funds are from Oil Revenue, and the large amount of cash that is generated internally, by inflated contracts awarded to companies operated by cronies, that represent the interests of some in the leadership. </strong><br><br>But the point is that the money will benefit the third world countries in which it is badly needed FDI as well as Malaysians who manufacture goods for export.<br><br><strong>Would this not tell you that those dubious Malaysian investments in the list of Third World Countries Â– that stretch from the poorest in Africa to North Korea Â– should have raised eyebrows more, and that those investments are not actually altruistic in nature? </strong><br><br>No .. my statement tells me that the Malaysian government is doing what it thinks is best to benefit its citizens, by creating opportunities in new markets.<br><br><strong>Countries without natural resources will have to depend on human resourcefulness, and in the course of it, large reserves are formed. </strong><br><br>Of course, I agree with you here.<br><br><strong>Countries such as Australia, Brunei, and the other oil-rich Arab states, with abundant natural resources, have relatively healthy reserves. While the other well endowed countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, some South American states, and Russia have abundant natural resources and DO NOT have any large reserves largely due to mismanagement, corruption, and failed economic, social and political policies. </strong><br><br>Here is some data I compiled from the Economist magazine<br><br>Czech Republic 24.4<br>Hungary 13.0<br>Poland 30.7<br>Isreal 23.4<br>Mexico 51.5<br>Thailand 38.9<br>Philippines 13.1<br>Indonesia 31.1<br>Brazil 38.6<br>Malaysia 34.5<br>Chile 16.5<br><br>It is interesting to note that as a developing country, Malaysia ranks quite nicely when it comes to Foreign Reserves. Indeed, EU candidate countries (Czech, Poland, HUngary) seem to have less reserves than Malaysia. Not to mention the best performing South American (Chile) country has half the FR as Malaysia. This goes to prove that FR does not equate to economic success.<br><br>Of course, all the NICs (S Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and HK) beat Malaysia, but among the developing countries, Malaysia is among the leaders. (and they have 17 more years to go before 2020)<br><br>Indeed, one will question why with FR of 83.6 billion, Singapore's unemployment rate is nearly 1% higher than Malaysia's?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To kenhor,<br>It is very interesting to note the trouble you have taken to research for your posts, and it certainly provide some new angles to be considered. My response and clarifications are as follows:<br><br><strong>"And one that is insignificant to you may be significant to others. Who is to say that USA is not dangling the carrot and brandishing the stick in the 9-11 affair to silence the Saudis</strong>.Â”<br><br>It is doubtful if the USA will ever carry the stick over the Saudis, there is too much antagonism towards the USA to risk having a major Arab ally being alienated. The US Citizens will be at liberty to pursue private litigation efforts against the Saudis or the Bin Laden Family, but it will be doubtful if the US Government will pursue a line of toughness with the Saudis.<br><br><strong>Â“Now now, no need to be so nasty .. since when did they do that?Â”</strong><br><br>They try to upstage even the ASEAN Secretariat, by attempting to form an independent Secretariat that reflects the agreed ASEAN+3 concept(?). It was only a result of the strong objections from Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand that this Malaysian idea was dropped.<br><br>PM MahatirÂ’s attempts to take the lead role is well known for his efforts to lead the Muslim World to withstand competition and degrading attitude from the First World.<br><br>His effort (and that of his FM Syed Hamid Albar) to out-do the Arabs is hardly disguised by forming a separate conference of Islamic Countries - to condemn USA in their efforts to attack Saddam or Iraq Â– within the NAM meeting in Kuala Lumpur in late 2002.<br><br>The protests from the Arabs put a stop to this matter, as the O.I.C Meeting was to be held ten days later in Doha, after NAM in Kuala Lumpur.<br><br><strong>Â“No need for sour grapes here. Just because we don't do the things they do, we don't have to put them down or call them names.Â”</strong><br><br>Unfortunately, it is Â“no skin off my noseÂ” if MalaysiaÂ’s PM Mahatir or the FM Syed Hamid Albar does what they intend to do to elevate the position of Malaysia.<br><br>In any case, why bother with sour grapes if Malaysia decides NOT to measure their system against the Best of the Best; but is quite satisfied with the levels which they envision for themselves.<br><br><strong>Â“And what did Thabo do wrong? After all, he is inheriting a nation that has great social, racial and economic divide. He is as great (or even greater) than GCT.Â”</strong><br><br>After inheriting the legacy from Nelson Mandela, Thabo had shown his idiocy by declaring that no Government Funds will be given to any hospitals who dare contradict his finding that Aids or HIV is not caused by Virus.<br><br>He certainly inherited a Nation, but while Nelson Mandela continued to move his South African Â“BumisÂ” to excel themselves, Thabo was more interested to create his own legacy after his term.<br><br>With violent crimes rising to the point of lawlessness, affecting almost every level of society, the place is no longer safe even in the up market neighborhood. Car jacking, rape, murder, daylight shooting, assaults, and what other violent crimes you can think of, all these are happening in South Africa under Thabo.<br><br>In your opinion, could he be doing better than GCT ?<br><br><strong>Â“Why would the Chinese only cheer this? Won't the Malays also be affected? The chinese cheered because they know Dr M is tolerant than Anwar.Â”</strong><br><br>While the Malays or Bumiputras had access to soft loans, based on Islamic Banking system, the other ethnic groups have only access to commercial loans based on commercial terms and conditions.<br><br>It was largely the Malays or Bumi that fought for Anwar, who as Finance Minister had Â“created and implementedÂ” the policies that benefited the Bumis. They did not applaud nor approve of the methods used; and were largely sceptical of their PM's effort to discredit his Deputry.<br><br>Certainly, It will be the Chinese and the other ethnic groups in Malaysia - that have no safety net from the Government during the cash crunch of 1997 - who will be applauding.<br><br><strong>Â“Of course he will have changed his stripes, until he becomes the PM, then, the truth will be known.Â”  </strong><br><br>Of course anything can happen for the future, but given the fine balance of racial harmony that exist in Malaysia, would a savvy politicians dare put his career at risks ?<br><br><strong>Â“YES .. I agree with you .. Its always about KICKBACKS. But then again, politics all around the world is like that. Guess that we should buy Haliburton Shares now. After Iraq is taken over, their stock will soar.Â”   </strong><br><br>DonÂ’t count on the stock market recovery after Iraq is taken over.<br><br>If the war can be successfully concluded in 90 days (from H-Hour of Day 1), it will require at least another 90 days of establishing a new Law and Order Structure, Civil Service, and continued mopping up operations for armed Â“dissidentsÂ” that refuse to accept defeat.<br><br>After 180 days, of continued stock decline, it will be surprising if the bottom of the stock exchange does not open up and drop its load.<br><br><strong>Â“And 90% of the Malaysian Chinese business are like that as well. So what's your point?Â”</strong><br><br>The original view from my post was:<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small">Â“How else do poor "kampung boys", with no historical connections to wealth and fame, can succeed in one generation to have their sons owning and operating corporations that are involved in mega-million dollar enterprises ?Â”</span></span><br><br>Lee Kah Shing built his own empire through ingenuity, foresight, and keen business sense.<br><br>How could the Malaysian Politicians - who are mainly kampung boys - manage to find their million dollar funds to form mega-corporations for their children to operate, and all in one generation, with the Â“dadsÂ” entering politics mostly coming from poor family background.<br><br><strong>Â“Are you talking about Malaysia? I thought you were talking about Singtel.Â”</strong><br><br>The well endowed First Family can hardly be seen as Kampung Boys.<br><br>In any case, SingTel is NOT a Private Company owned by Private Capital.<br><br>The effort in privatization by the SGP Government is only skin deep; as it try to disguise the GLCÂ’s into private companies by selling out to "approved" private public personalities that seems to be acting as "proxies in trust for the Government"(?).<br><br><strong>Â“Which is worse as that meas that MY TAX DOLLARS are being used. Which there is no accountability, and NO share of the dividends if there is any profit.Â”</strong><br><br>Have you forgotten the Singapore Shares ? At least Singaporeans get back something from the Government, despite the losses. What has the Malaysian politicians done with their National Reserves ?<br><br><strong>Â“But the point is that the money will benefit the third world countries in which it is badly needed FDI as well as Malaysians who manufacture goods for export.Â”</strong><br><br>They could not even pay for their military hardware purchase in Cash, and have to barter with their Palm Oil, nor do they allocate any funds to handle their problems with the Drug Addicts, and other social welfare, educational, and infrastructural problems; and yet they make a big thing about investing overseas - which serves as "conduits for leakages".<br><br>One would expect that at least they put their house in order, before attempting to play the Guardian Angel to help the Third World Countries.<br><br>Building homes in North Korea Â– would that be a North Korean State Funded Project, or will it be another Malaysian Politician's daylight robbery on their National Reserves ?<br><br>Altruism or foolishness ?<br><br><strong>Â“No .. my statement tells me that the Malaysian government is doing what it thinks is best to benefit its citizens, by creating opportunities in new markets.Â”</strong><br><br>It should read more accurately if you had written that Â“the Malaysian Government is doing what it thinks is best to benefit its Â“croniesÂ”, as the Citizens are hardly aware that such investments exist.<br><br>Whatever new opportunities from new emerging markets will benefit the crony operated corporations, and seldom the Malaysian citizens.<br><br><strong>"It is interesting to note that as a developing country, Malaysia ranks quite nicely when it comes to Foreign Reserves. Indeed, EU candidate countries (Czech, Poland, HUngary) seem to have less reserves than Malaysia. Not to mention the best performing South American (Chile) country has half the FR as Malaysia. This goes to prove that FR does not equate to economic success.Â”<br><br>Of course, all the NICs (S Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and HK) beat Malaysia, but among the developing countries, Malaysia is among the leaders. (and they have 17 more years to go before 2020) Â“</strong><br><br>Do not forget that Czech, Poland, Hungary had only until recently emerged from a Stalinist economy, with the collapse of the Soviet Union through Perestoika and Glasnost.<br><br>MalaysiaÂ’s exposure to the worldÂ’s free and open economy stretches back since it independence from Colonial Rule - a period of more then Forty Years.<br><br>Surely Malaysia could have done better if measured against those ex-Soviet style economy - instead of only a marginal difference.<br><br><strong>"Indeed, one will question why with FR of 83.6 billion, Singapore's unemployment rate is nearly 1% higher than Malaysia's?Â”</strong><br><br>SingaporeÂ’s economy has reached a level of maturity Â– much like that seen in Japan, and other First World economy.<br><br>With SingaporeÂ’s dependence on ever higher technology to be utilized, and which require lesser manpower, this can only result in a strong shake-up, restructuring exercises Â– leading to a higher rate of unemployment in times of crisis.<br><br>No economy can ever continue its relentless growth, and maintain continued full employment.<br><br>A dead end will be met sooner or later, unless new niche areas and leading technologies are continuously discovered and owned by Singapore Companies.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Gun,<br><br><strong>It is incorrect to relate employment figure with FR, as the former<br>is a measurement of short-term industrial activity while the later<br>provides a more strategic indicator of the country's overall<br>long-term potential. </strong><br><br>During the 1997 crisis, Malaysia declared 1 year tax free status. They are willing to suffer a short term shortfall of revenue rather than have high unemployment. By the same breath, our FR is MEANT for a rainy day. That day has come (by my opinion)<br><br><strong>In fact, a more direct measurement of FR is the country's<br>currency exchnge rate with USD which truely test the resilience of<br>its economy.</strong><br><br>That is not true. Most developing countries push their currency weak to be exporting goods. In fact, if the RM is floated today, it will definately appreciate. Do you think that RM3.80 to US$1.00 is not undervalued?<br><br><strong>The My gov then was so desperate that it imposed currency control until this very day. This may have help to protect itself from further attacks on the Ringgit, but it has nevethless suffered long term damage in its international reputation as an open economy.</strong><br><br>I don't know about you, but I see that their credit rating has since climb back higher than countries like Thailand who went for the IMF cure. So how can its INTERNATIONAL reputation be damaged long term?<br><br><strong>It is better to take some bitter medicine now when current global situations remains fluid than to wait for the next upswing in cycle of economy. This is precisely what Singapore is attempting to do now in which structural unemployment and businesses are going through dramatic revision. </strong><br><br>That is always the standard reply. Tough Love they call it. Well, only time will tell how it will work out. After all, the bitter medicine will probably do irrepairable damage to our workforce's morale and trust in the government.<br><br><strong>If the My gov truely "thinks" of what is best for its citizens then it<br>would not hv stubbornly implement policies which had resulted<br>in lagging behind Singapore in almost all aspects of economic and<br>social development since independence. </strong><br><br>Its much, much easier to manage a small tiny city 630 sq km than a country 1000 times bigger, 5 times more people. By your same same measure, Malaysia has done better than India, who has a civilization 1000 years older than malaysia, no war, 1 billion population and 100 times bigger than Malaysia. So if you want to compare, compare it apples to apples.<br><br><strong>Even with the coming end of Mahathir era, and its attempt to<br>jumpstart its drive towards *2020 vision* by turning to<br>industrialisation, the My gov still dogmatically carry on its<br>affirmative-pro-bumi policies which has already proven to handicup<br>this country potential.</strong><br><br>Indonesia remains as the best reason to have affirmative action programs. The chinese there may be rich, but they will forever have to worry about their riches causing problems<br><br><strong>this will only condemn Malaysia to always follow the footsteps behind its less-well endowned and yet resourceful Southern neighbour, as far as economic and strategic planning are concerned. </strong><br><br>We have lots to show Malaysia, however, it is not good to rest on our laurels or be complacent and arrogant. Have we not forgotten the saga of how PSA lost 2 shipping lines to PTP due to our arrogance?</div>

The so-called 1-yr tax free is<br>hardly a bitter medicine compared to what the Thais and S Koreans<br>had undertaken after the financial crisis as stipulated by the IMF.<br>On the contrary, to your interpretation that low-unemployment<br>means sound economic planning doesn't and frequently will not<br>guarantee long term benefit. In fact, what you've yet to inevitable<br>effect of Malaysia's high dependency on low-cost manufactoring<br>sector on which it now has to competet with countries from China<br>and Indo-China.

In fact, it is the wholistic approach in sound planning and<br>competent execution that will enhance and ensure stable<br>and consistent growth. What the My gov has done so far is a<br>mix bag of short term stitch up correction job and borrowed<br>economic plan which Singapore had used in the 70s to mid 90s<br>and is now in the process of restructuring such approach in the<br>new paradiagm.</span><br><br><blockquote>I don't know about you, but I see that their credit rating has since climb back higher than countries like Thailand who went for the IMF cure.

This  has cast doubts in<br>your  ability debate in any coherent nor effectively convincing<br>manner.<br><br>Here are my pointers to your last few feeble arguments:<br><br>1) Your simplistic measure of success by pointing out  that<br>"Malaysia has done better than India, who has a civilization 1000<br>years older than malaysia"...etc etc will definately not go well with<br>folks who knows the true potential of this sub-continent.<br>This fruit has a taste that you've fail to appreciate.<br><br>2) Majority of  Indonesia Chinese are NOT rich.

What has happened to the leaders of Islam who call for Jihad over everything under the sun?<br><br></div></blockquote>First of all we have to understand the situation in Palestine. Palestine was Â‘legally invadedÂ’ by the Jews. With the help of Britain and US they are now able to form their own country by force. The rights of the Palestinian have been denied.<br><br>If it happened to Singapore what will you do? Will you say ok and give up you land and properties? I donÂ’t think so. You will stand for your right. You have been living there for generations and suddenly a motion was passed by outsiders saying that your land and properties are now must be given to new owners, the Malays for example. Will you not give a fight?<br><br>The Palestinian consider this as an invasion and in Islam the act of protecting the country and oneÂ’s belonging is considered as jihad.<br><br>This is what stated in Quran:<br><br>The prohibited month for the prohibited month,- and so for all things prohibited,- there is the law of equality. <strong>If then any one transgresses the prohibition against you, Transgress ye likewise against him</strong>. But fear God, and know that God is with those who restrain themselves. (Al Baqarah:194)<br><br><strong>But if they cease</strong>, God is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. (2:192)<br><br>There are many groups in Palestine like that you have mentioned above is Hamas and another group call Brigade Al-Aqsa besides the Â‘officialÂ’ group led by Yasser Arafat. I would like to remind you that what they are trying to do are actually protecting or getting back the land of the Palestinians or they call it occupied territory. They feel that it is their responsibility to take back their own belongings.<br><br>Who is the invader here? The Palestinians or the Jews? Why must the Palestinians be called terrorist? It is their land that they are fighting for and they want it back. What is so wrong about fighting for your own rights? That is not an act of terrorist. That is jihad.<br><br>With regard to suicide bombing, it is clear in Islam that committing suicide is one of the biggest sins. There are many hadiths that provide such guideline one of them is:<br><br>Narrated Abu Huraira-:<br>The Prophet said, "He who commits suicide by throttling shall keep on throttling himself in the Hell Fire (forever) and he who commits suicide by stabbing himself shall keep on stabbing himself in the Hell-Fire." (Sahih Bukhari)<br><br>In Quran:<br><br>And spend of your substance in the cause of God, and make not your own hands contribute to (your) destruction; but do good; for God loveth those who do good. (Al Baqarah:195)<br><br>Suicide bombing by young mis-informed Muslim youths has been carried out almost routinely as a mean of revenge in the Middle East conflict. It is mainly done to avenge their oppression, occupation and loss of freedom they have been experiencing all their life.<br><br>It is carried out by the youth who lost all the hope to a peaceful settlement as they witnessed their families, loved ones, neighbors, and the innocent bystanders die or tortured at the hand of a merciless occupying force.<br><br>Despite these intolerable situations no permission can be found in Islam to avenge by suicide bombing or by targeting the innocent civilians.  These young desperate Muslim youth have been taught what is NOT in the Quran, and what was never promised by God in the Holy book. Innocent civilian must not be the victim in any condition whether it is a war or any struggle.<br><br>Why the Â‘moderateÂ’ keep quite? The term Â‘moderateÂ’ actually refers to the fundamental of Islam i.e. Muslims who follows the true teachings in Islam. There are many verses in Quran that says Muslims must be moderate i.e. not go beyond limits (extremist).<br><br>Fight in the cause of God those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; <strong>for God loveth not transgressors</strong>. (Al Baqarah:190)<br><br>He hath only forbidden you dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that on which any other name hath been invoked besides that of God. But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, <strong>nor transgressing due limits</strong>,- then is he guiltless. For God is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful. (Al Baqarah:173)<br><br>O ye who believe! the law of equality is prescribed to you in cases of murder: the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the woman for the woman. But if any remission is made by the brother of the slain, then grant any reasonable demand, and compensate him with handsome gratitude, this is a concession and a Mercy from your Lord. <strong>After this whoever exceeds the limits shall be in grave penalty</strong>. (Al Baqarah:178 )<br><br>But at the same time Muslims must follow His guidance:<br><br>And whatever ye spend in charity or devotion, be sure God knows it all. But the <strong>wrong-doers have no helpers</strong>. (Al Baqarah:270)<br><br>We said: "Get ye down all from here; and if, as is sure, there comes to you Guidance from me, <strong>whosoever follows My guidance, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve</strong>. (Al Baqarah:38 )<br><br>There are two important personalities in a true Islamic country. One is called Â‘ulamaÂ’ Â– the people who have true knowledge about Islam. Another one is Â‘umaraÂ’ Â– the leader. The function of the Â‘ulamaÂ’ is actually to be the advisor for the Â‘umaraÂ’ in his administration. But then, if the Â‘umaraÂ’ do not follow what has been advised by the Â‘ulamaÂ’, then he/she will be answerable to God in the Hereafter.<br><br>Therefore, it is very important to have or to select a true leader and not a dictator like Saddam. I donÂ’t think Saddam will listen to the Â‘ulamaÂ’ especially in the event of killing the fellow Muslims. The same goes to Bush when Pope John Paul sent Â‘peace appealsÂ’ to him. John Paul also told Blair that the Iraq crisis should be resolved in concert with the international community, and having recourse to international law. Did they listen?<br><br></div>
