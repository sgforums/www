            <div class='col-md body'>KUALA LUMPUR, March 24:  The Dewan Rakyat, led by Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad, unanimously passed a motion today condemning the unilateral military action by the United States and its allies against Iraq.<br><br>The Prime Minister, in tabling the motion, had proposed seven resolutions, including condemning the attack on Iraq and demanding an immediate end to the conflict.<br><br>Taking the cue from Dr Mahathir, who called on Malaysians to unite in protesting the senseless war, Members of Parliament, including those from Opposition parties, threw their support behind the motion.<br><br>It was the second time this month the lawmakers stood united on the Iraq issue, having supported a motion two weeks ago which lambasted threats by the US to take unilateral action against Iraq.<br><br>The House adjourned its proceeding under Standing Orders 27(3) to debate today's motion, which was telecast live by RTM.<br><br>Among those who spoke in support of the motion were Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik (MCA), Nasharuddin Mat Isa (Pas), Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar (PBB), S. Sothinathan (MIC), Dr Maximus Ongkili (PBS), Kerk Kim Hock (DAP) and Ramli Ibrahim (Parti Keadilan Nasional).<br><br>Dr Mahathir had proposed that the House adopt the following resolutions: l To condemn in the strongest terms possible the unilateral military action by the United States and its allies; l To urge the US and its allies to immediately end military action against Iraq; l To urge all related parties to strive to immediately return to the use of peaceful means in ensuring that Iraq adheres to Security Council resolutions in the event Iraq is found to possess weapons of mass destruction; l To demand that the US and its allies respect the human rights of the Iraqis and principles of international humanity, especially the "Geneva Convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war"; l Resolve that Malaysia co-operate with Non-Aligned Movement members and countries sharing similar views in defending international laws and the United Nations Charter in dealing with issues among nations; l To appeal to the international community to immediately extend emergency humanitarian assistance to the people of Iraq; and, l The House resolve to convey the resolutions to all legislative assemblies and parliaments, especially those of the US, Britain, Spain and Australia.<br><br>Describing the attack as a black spot in history, Dr Mahathir said a superpower, together with its allies, had chosen to attack a weaker nation which was incapable of defending itself.<br><br>"Casting aside international laws, humanity and justice, they attacked a country which no longer has the capability to defend itself, what more posing a threat to the superpowers.<br><br>"Claims that Iraq is dangerous and a threat to the world with its weapons of mass destruction are totally illogical and cannot be accepted as the reason for launching the attack." Dr Mahathir said the US-led attack, with massive bombing and employing sophisticated weapons, was directed against Iraq which had earlier been stripped of its defence by the UN.<br><br>"This is not war because the attackers are the world's superpowers and the one under attack is a defenceless country. Surely, victory will side with the attackers in a matter of time.<br><br>"But whether it will be a short or long war, the fact is that many Iraqis will be killed or injured." Malaysia, Dr Mahathir said, concurred with the views that weapons of mass destruction were a threat to the international community.<br><br>"The world does not need this kind of weapon. What needs to be done is to destroy these weapons without any country being given special treatment. "But we find that while prohibitions are imposed against Iraq, no such thing is being applied to its enemy, Israel." He said: "Can Israel, which is wantonly murdering the Palestinians, be trusted not to use weapons of mass destruction like nuclear bombs against its enemies?" The Prime Minister said the unilateral action by the US had farreaching consequences as it meant weak and small nations were no longer safe and the UN could no longer offer them any protection from major powers.<br><br>"The UN and international laws are now meaningless. We have returned to the Stone Age where might dictates right. "We can predict in the future of countries whose sovereignty will be trampled by the superpowers.<br><br>"Accusations can be levelled that certain countries are not democratic and they have failed to observe human rights and freedom of religion. "The accusers will interfere directly to change governments, effect a regime change, evict leaders from their countries and even order the assasination of those who they dislike.<br><br>"This is the world after the destruction of international laws and the UN by the US. There is no more Â‘the rule of law' because those who created this slogan have now violated it." Dr Mahathir called on the weak nations to unite.<br><br>Considering that the major powers had no qualms about dismissing the UN, they would face continuous threats and be re-colonised, he said.<br><br>"Whatever our differences are, I am confident nobody among us wants the country to be re-colonised." Dr Mahathir also called on nongovernmental organisations in the country to contact their counterparts in the US and Britain, urging them to convince their governments to stop the war.<br><br>"Only the Americans and British can stop their governments from attacking Iraq and return to the UN. If governments rejecting the role of the world body are rejected by their own people, perhaps the new governments will subscribe to the UN." The Prime Minister said the Government would like to see all mosques performing sembahyang hajat (special prayers) to pray for an immediate end to the war. He urged the followers of other religions to pray for an end to the war.<br><br>P/S: PROUD TO BE MALAYSIAN<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry to say this, but as Mahatir gets through each day that adds to his age, he is showing himself to be an IDIOT, as bad as the Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar.<br><br>During the Non-Aligned Movement meeting in Kuala Lumpur, he and his Foreign Minister tried to upstage the Arabs, by trying to organise a Muslim Forum to counter US and UK aggressive intentions towards Saddam Hussein (not Iraq).<br><br>Unfortunately, for Mahatir and Syed Hamid, both were denied the opportunity by the Arab member countries attending the NAM conference in Kuala Lumpur - resulting in this Muslim Forum being aborted.<br><br>To save face, the Malaysian Foreign Minister had to make a lame excuse that Malaysia was only making an effort on behalf of O.I.C<br><br>Just before Malaysia's PM Mahatir left for the Conference of the Organisation of Islamic Countries, he made a blustering speech that USA upcoming attack on IRAQ, is an <strong><span style="color: red;">ATTACK on ISLAM</span></strong>.<br><br>Surprisingly, on his return from the O.I.C. conference, he adopted a low profile, and the Malaysian Newspapers did not feature his attendance at the O.I.C conference.<br><br>More surprisingly, Mahatir now says that USA aggression towards Iraq is <strong><span style="color: blue;">NOT AGAINST </span></strong>Islam.<br><br></div>

He should follow the example of the Jordanian King Hussein - who led his famed Jordanian Lions into battle against Israel during the 6-Day War.<br><br>The Jordanian King Hussein was at the front line with his soldiers, battling the Israelis, unlike Saddam Hussein who has not been seen in public since the opening shot by the US-UK coalition force.<br><br>Where is the apology from PM Mahatir to USA, when the evidence was finally produced - of Osama Bin Laden involvement in the 9-11 incident in NYC - AFTER the US forces drove the Talebans and the AL-QAEDA out of Afghanistan ?<br><br>If the UN becomes paralyse due to the fact that no one is prepared to take down a tyrant, who is taking advantage of the process afforded by the UN, should the World sit tight and be paralyze ?<br><br>Perhaps, the Arab World (and the Muslim Community) can tolerate such a situation, and may argue forever to TRY and obtain common consensus, and remain stuck in the quagmire of lofty principles.<br><br>This probably is the reason for the vast difference in the standards of development in the social, economic, and political spheres between the Arab-Muslim and the other Communities in this World.<br><br>Progressive countries such as USA, UK, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Singapore, HongKong, Taiwan, and other countries that aspire First World Standards, will never tolerate the unending deliberation with no actions.<br><br><strong>Not when an impending threat exist.</strong><br><br></div>

I think the important parts are in bold.<br><br>Dr Mahathir kesal Singapura sokong perang terhadap Iraq<br>Oleh Kadir Dikoh<br><br><strong><br>KUALA LUMPUR: Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad kesal dengan tindakan negara jiran, Singapura, yang berpendirian menyokong peperangan diketuai Amerika Syarikat terhadap Iraq.<br><br>Â“Saya berpendapat ia agak malang sekali kerana jika anda (Singapura) menyokong perang sebagai jalan penyelesaian kepada masalah antara negara, maka anda juga harus menjangka perang terhadap negara anda sendiri,Â” kata Perdana Menteri.<br><br>Beliau berkata demikian pada sidang media selepas membentangkan usul membantah tindakan ketenteraan secara unilateral oleh Amerika Syarikat dan sekutunya ke atas Iraq di lobi Parlimen, semalam.<br><br>Dr Mahathir diminta mengulas mengenai tindakan Singapura yang turut menyediakan kemudahan kepada pasukan tentera Amerika Syarikat bagi kempen serangan terhadap Iraq dan kini meningkatkan kawalan keselamatan bagi menghalang kemungkinan serangan pengganas.<br><br>Sebelum ini, Menteri Pertahanan Singapura, Tony Tan, dipetik sebagai berkata bahawa risiko republik itu diserang pengganas semakin meningkat berikutan pencerobohan ke atas Iraq oleh Amerika Syarikat kerana Singapura menyokong tindakan itu.<br></strong><br>Perdana Menteri ketika ditanya sama ada kerajaan membenarkan rakyat mengadakan bantahan umum beramai-ramai sebagai bantahan terhadap perang, berkata apa yang membimbangkan ialah kadang-kadang demonstrasi seperti itu tidak dapat dikawal.<br><br>Â“Mungkin dalam perasaan marah, geram, tindakan yang tidak sepatutnya diambil, akan diambil,Â” katanya.<br><br>Perdana Menteri juga berkata, belum tiba masanya bagi rakyat Malaysia menimbangkan kemungkinan memulaukan barangan keluaran Amerika Syarikat dan Britain seperti saranan sesetengah pihak bagi menandakan bantahan.<br><br>Malaysia juga, katanya, tidak akan mengkaji semula hubungan diplomatik dengan Washington meskipun ada pihak mendesak supaya berbuat demikian.<br><br>Â“Ini kerana kita percaya bahawa tindakan diambil kerajaan Amerika itu tidak menggambarkan pemikiran kebanyakan rakyat Amerika,Â” katanya.<br><br>Mengenai kemungkinan kecaman kuatnya terhadap Amerika Syarikat memberi kesan jangka panjang kepada Malaysia, Dr Mahathir berkata: Â“Ia boleh berlaku tetapi jika kita menutup (mulut) sepenuhnya, maka kita tidak jujur kepada diri sendiri.Â”<br><br>Beliau berkata, Amerika Syarikat adalah negara yang paling berkuasa sehingga menakutkan banyak negara kerana ia berupaya untuk melakukan apa saja termasuk sekatan ekonomi, selain menyerang.<br><br>Â“Saya masih ingat ketika membuat satu kenyataan yang tidak disukai Amerika, mereka mula memberitahu orang Amerika supaya jangan melabur di Malaysia. Jadi kita terdedah, kita negara lemah.<br><br>Â“Kita tidak boleh melawan dalam perang, malah kita tidak berupaya untuk mempertahankan diri. Ini termasuk serangan ekonomi terhadap kita. Jadi sudah semestinya kita takut, ia boleh berlaku,Â” katanya.<br><br>Ditanya oleh seorang wartawan BBC mengenai mesej yang mampu dilakukannya untuk menghentikan perang di Iraq memandangkan beliau sebagai pemimpin berpengalaman dan suaranya dilihat mewakili negara Islam, Dr Mahathir berkata, beliau akan cuba menulis surat kepada Â‘kawan-kawanÂ’ di Amerika dan Britain.<br><br>Selain itu, badan bukan kerajaan (NGO) tempatan juga boleh menghubungi rakan sejawat mereka di negara terbabit untuk menyampaikan pandangan yang sama bagi membantah perang.<br><br>Â“Kita mengesyaki media di Amerika terutamanya tidak memberi gambaran sebenar mengenai pendapat dunia. Contohnya, apabila ada demonstrasi di seluruh dunia termasuk satu yang disertai sejuta orang di London, gambaran diberi kepada orang Amerika adalah demonstrasi di Baghdad.<br><br>Â“Sudah tentu ia tidak akan membantu tetapi kita akan cuba mempengaruhi pendapat umum di Amerika dan Britain supaya mereka berupaya untuk mempengaruhi kerajaan masing-masing,Â” katanya sambil menambah, Malaysia tidak melihat dari sudut faedah yang diperolehnya apabila membantah serangan ke atas Baghdad.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>To kenhor,<br>Thanks for your clarification on MalaysiaÂ’s statement of in condemning US for their aggression towards IRAQ.<br><br>Although Kya had previously explained that Malaysia was not condemning USA for DISARMING Iraq, but only for the US led AGGRESSION towards Iraq, I find it quite amusing that it is tolerable to see Iraq NOT disarming itself of WMD Â– despite numerous UN orders - but when FORCE is used to disarm, it is seen as an AGGRESSION.<br><br>My point in questioning Â“Why should Malaysian Â– a NON-Arab Country Â– take it on themselves to CONDEMN the US for their work to disarm Iraq?Â” - was that it has been part of PM MahatirsÂ’ knee jerk reactions towards USAÂ’s foreign policies (AND also the First World of the Caucasion).<br><br>This is a common feature even in his attitude towards Australia and UK Â– which basically reflects his attitude of <span style="color: green;"><strong>Us, Third World against Them - the Caucasian First World</strong></span>.<br><br>Perhaps in his retirement plans, he intends to remain active in Politics, but on a bigger World Stage.<br><br>As was mentioned in my earlier posts, it remains intriguing that not only Qatar (as you claimed is a fan of USA), but Egypt, Saudi Arabia and even Jordan were able to persuade the other general members of the O.I.C in NOT issuing a statement that CONDEMN the aggression by USA towards Iraq.<br><br>The Statement only requested (or demanded impotently) that the aggression towards Iraq be STOPPED Â– (no CONDEMNATION).<br><br>With regards to Zimbawe expulsion from the Commonwealth, it is only standard foreign policy of Malaysia in US against THEM.<br><br>If one claims to be so sensitive towards Human Rights violations, and the sanctity towards Human Lives, then that belief should be practiced first in Malaysia, by not locking up his Deputy PM Anwar on trumped up charges approved by a Kangaroo Court with a Judge that is kept under PM MahatirÂ’s thumbs.<br><br>If Malaysia claims the leadership position of the Third World, what has PM Mahatir done to alleviate the problems faced by the Third World that are caused by corrupt despots and tyrants that rule by terror, torture, rape and murder ?<br><br>As a declared Muslim, should PM Mahatir turned a blind eye towards such atrocities towards the helpless citizens in Zimbawe and Iraq Â– and some other Third World Countries (with almost an embarrassing third of them being Islamic governed).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Atobe, You said,<br><strong><br>As was mentioned in my earlier posts, it remains intriguing that not only Qatar (as you claimed is a fan of USA), but Egypt, Saudi Arabia and even Jordan were able to persuade the other general members of the O.I.C in NOT issuing a statement that CONDEMN the aggression by USA towards Iraq.<br></strong><br><br>Those members that you mention are definately those I expect that will support the USA .. Egypt is in deep recession, and the billions gained in supporting USA is welcome. Saudi is being sued in USa for its citizen's doing the 9-11 acts. Jordan is bordering Isreal. In terms of population, those 4 countries have economic, population, spiritual and economic clout to bamboozle the whole IOC and Arab League. The USA is smart to know who to pressure.<br><br>You said,<br><strong><br>With regards to Zimbawe expulsion from the Commonwealth, it is only standard foreign policy of Malaysia in US against THEM.<br></strong><br><br>The US in your statement above includes South Africa. The country that is bordering Zimbabwe and most to gain/lose in any action against them. If they decide to support Robert Mugabe, I think their opinion counts the most. I truly am appaled at what is happening in the murder and intimidation of the opposition in that country. However, expulsion of Zimbabwe from the Commenwealth does more harm than good.<br><br>Remember Myanmar. ASEAN has a policy of constructive engagement. Kicking them out is not the answer. Same as with Zimbabwe.<br><br><strong><br>If one claims to be so sensitive towards Human Rights violations, and the sanctity towards Human Lives, then that belief should be practiced first in Malaysia, by not locking up his Deputy PM Anwar on trumped up charges approved by a Kangaroo Court with a Judge that is kept under PM MahatirÂ’s thumbs.<br></strong><br><br>The same is in Singapore, with lawsuits applied to the opposition with the intent of bankrupting them. There was an instance where some PAS politician said that Dr M watches porno with his grandchildren. They resolved that issue with an appology. In this country, that politician who said that would have been bankrupt and his whole family destroyed.<br><br><strong><br>If Malaysia claims the leadership position of the Third World, what has PM Mahatir done to alleviate the problems faced by the Third World that are caused by corrupt despots and tyrants that rule by terror, torture, rape and murder ?<br></strong><br><br>Obviously you did not know what Malaysia has done. Read the Far East Economic Reveau and the Economist. You will find that.<br><br>a) Give palm oil credits to emerging markets. Of course this is peanuts to them, and also a smart way of making inroads to new markets, but those credits number into the 100s of Millions<br><br>b) Guess who is the number 2 investor in South Africa. No 1 is USA, no 2 is Malaysia.<br><br>c) Guess who lost 400 million in a failed telco bid in Ghana. Telekom Malaysia. Guess what the heck they are doing there? They are there because Dr M has send hundreds of business men all over africa on sales, investment and training trips.<br><br>d) Guess which Petroleum company is the largest investor in Sudan, South Africa and Iran.<br><br>e) Guess which companies are actually building houses in North Korea?<br><br>f) Guess which companies are building highways in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan? As well as housing projects there was well.<br><br>h) Guess which country is trying to be the islamic financial centre of the world?<br><br>i) Guess which country has FW from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Myanmar, Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines and China. And yes, those FW number over 2 million. How many do we have?<br><br>j) Which country actually sent troops to Somalia and Bosnia?<br><br>For all their influence, yes, they can't stop the despots. However, we don't do ANYTHING either. At least they invest in those countries and give FDI there.<br><br>If you want to say that those actions prop up dictatorship and torture, my dear own country sells military equipment to Myanmar.<br><br>Their actions may not be enough for your taste, I agree, but they have done more for third world countries than we have.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To kenhor,<br>Thanks for your carefully pieced effort in gathering the large treasures of Malaysian involvement Â“worldwideÂ”.<br><br>To begin with, is USA truly suing Saudi Arabia for the 9-11 incident committed mostly by Saudi nationals ?<br><br>This will open the door to future accountability for Nations whose citizens commit major crimes outside of their borders.<br><br>Surely this is made in jest ?<br><br>Concerning Malaysia being associated with South Africa in opposing ZimbabweÂ’s expulsion from the Commonwealth, I would not put too much status in such an association.<br><br>Not when you have an idiot as a President of South Africa, who claim that AIDS is not a result of Virus infection, and opposed all medical treatment in this direction to help those South Africans afflicted by AIDS or HIV.<br><br>Too bad, two idiots together does not make their efforts look any better.<br><br>Fortunately, in the Myanmar situation, it was the political consensus of all members of ASEAN to retain MyanmarÂ’s involvement, and not simply Singapore GovernmentÂ’s position alone.<br><br>The manner in which political threats are handled, do not differ too much between Singapore and Malaysia, with both depending on the Internal Security Act to clamp any opposition.<br><br>While the Singapore Government will be ruthless in maintaining the reputation of its politicians, can it be simple political generosity in not pursuing the same path in Malaysia? Or is it due to prudence for Malaysian Politicians in not pursuing relentlessly on libel issues, once deference has been made. Perhaps in Malaysian Politics there maybe more skeletons to be exposed in any confrontation.<br><br>Trade credit cuts both ways, and may not necessarily be done for altruistic reasons Â– but for the sake of National and <strong>PERSONAL </strong>benefits.<br><br>In the Malaysian way of politics and business, it will be surprising if the normal exercise of <strong>PATRONAGE </strong>do not carry benefit to all concerned.<br><br>How else do poor "kampung boys", with no historical connections to wealth and fame, can succeed in one generation to have their sons owning and operating corporations that are involved in mega-million dollar enterprises ?<br><br>Challenging one to make guesses as to the obvious leading outcome concerning Malaysian involvement in all the multiple enterprises is not so challenging.<br><br>It would have been more challenging to figure out how many of those projects that draw on the mega-million funds generated from PETRONAS is being wasted on all those money losing projects that stretch from Ghana to North Korea; and with all those losses of state funds not subject to questions and being unaccounted.<br><br>This probably explain for the stakes involved in Malaysian Politics, in which every component party in Barisan Nasional will try their utmost to maintain equilibrium and the status quo.<br><br>Everyone gets a finger in the pie, and everyone gets to taste the "stickiness" on the fingers.<br><br>Certainly, in doing so much for the Third World, they have done more for themselves; but what have they done for Malaysia with so much more natural resources than Singapore ?<br><br>Should they not have a burgeoning and over bloated national reserves that exceed that of Singapore a hundred times over, considering the extent of the land and sea area that Malaysia cover, compared to this "little red dot" ?<br></div>
