            <div class='col-md body'>okay, kyas.. the Palestinian issue is to be said and there was "invasion" and all that by the "Jews".  Take religion out of this for one moment.<br><br>There are a bunch of facts which punch lots of holes in this "Palestinian" issue.<br><br>Palestine was never a nation, ever... why after Israel comes into being, is there a clamouring for one.  This clamouring was political and it turned bloody and religious.<br><br>The Palestinians were allowed citizenship in Israel.  Something they were not allowed in places which persecuted them, like in Jordan and Syria.  This Israeli citizenship was total... that included voting rights, and full protection under Israeli law.<br><br>The "Occupied Territories" are actually not illegally "stolen" by Israel.  They are considered spoils of war.  A war started by the whole Arab World to wipe out Israel the moment it came to being.  This is a buffer should any Arab country decide to attack it again... currently, there is no peace.. an uneasy truce maybe.  An Arab leader made peace with Israel and was assassinated for it... Anwar Sadat was a brave man... and he paid with his life.<br><br>But I'll provide a list for reading... these show the tragedy written about the Palestinians..<br><br><strong>About the whole situation there and this article cuts right to the chase:</strong><br><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=15066" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=15066</a><br><br><strong>Absurd hatemongering site... but everything said there is true!</strong><br><a href="http://masada2000.org/arafat-plo.html" rel="nofollow">http://masada2000.org/arafat-plo.html</a><br><br><strong>The true history of Palestine:</strong><br><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Palestine" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Palestine</a><br><br>Perhaps the most damning of them all was PLO's own Zahir Muhsein who declared to the Dutch Newspaper that there was no such thing as a Palestine and that when they achieve such, they will immediately merge with Jordan.  This is explained in the 3rd link.<br><br>So, whatever the Palestinian problems the Arabs have been sprouting, I'm not sure where they got that from.<br><br>Religion never came into this.  It was all politics.. and sadly, I think the whole of the Islamic faithful have been taken for a murderous ride.... I think you would agree with me that yelling of "Allahu Akbar!" before a suicide bombing will probably not exonerate the murderer of his sins.  And neither would lying to the world and to their fellow Islamic Brethern about the situation.<br><br></div>

Jessica Lynch just<br>days ago in Iraq. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,83093,00.html" rel="nofollow">[b]<span style="text-decoration: underline;">FoxNews</span></a></span></strong> reports how a Muslim had help informed the US troops on Jessica's whereabout after witnessing the condition that she was in.<br><br>2) Another case closer to home, it was information provided by local<br>and foreign Muslims who had come forward to tip off the authority<br>after 9/11 that had saved Singapore from disasterous consequence of multiple terror  attacks.<br><br>Muslims may statistically form majority of  bottom rung of society,<br>but some them definately belongs to the higher echelon of moral<br>responsibility towards the rest of  humankind.<br><br>Be tackful next time when dealing with this issue.<br><br>[/size]<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Ok.. I am be wrong..  I apologise..<br><br>I am not saying that the muslim has no morals..<br><br>I am saying that something must be wrong like ? Take Malaysia for example.. Mahatir have to keep scolding the Malays to get them to be more industrious.. The chinese are doign well inspite of all the obstacles to protect the native malays. not just here but in Indonesia, Philippines.. In Sinagpore, special places in the Uni is reserved for Malays.. I am not against this as the govt wants to help them too.. It is good  that they come up higher to be a blessing to society.<br><br>But end of the days, they must be able to wake up and see where their religion and belief is leading them..<br><br>At the moment, most are devoid of any good sense. As long as a muslim country is attacked, most will voice their support for that country regardless of whose right or wrong.<br><br>I tell you the war is Iraq is not just about WMD. it is about state sponsoring terrorism. after Iraq, a lot more Muslim countries will also get it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Atobe,<br><br>I am actually not meaning for this discussion to turn into a Malaysia vs Singapore thing. I was just responding to the thread to answer why Malaysians and their government feel that they are against the war. But sadly, it has taken a different turn. But, never mind, its my opinion anyway that will be forthcoming, not whatever they want to do up north.<br><br><strong>It is doubtful if the USA will ever carry the stick over the Saudis, there is too much antagonism towards the USA to risk having a major Arab ally being alienated. The US Citizens will be at liberty to pursue private litigation efforts against the Saudis or the Bin Laden Family, but it will be doubtful if the US Government will pursue a line of toughness with the Saudis. </strong><br><br>While the Saudis prove useful to the Americans, of course they will hold back the stick (but it is like the sword of Damocles .. its still there over the heads of the Saudis, Jordanians, Egyptians and Turkish) The fact that they are unhappy with the current level of support shown by the above said governments (as reported in The Economis magazine) shows that they will use the stick and carrot routine to get what they (the Americans) want<br><br><strong>They try to upstage even the ASEAN Secretariat, by attempting to form an independent Secretariat that reflects the agreed ASEAN+3 concept(?). It was only a result of the strong objections from Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand that this Malaysian idea was dropped. </strong><br><br>And what about EAEC? They tried to get consensus from all the members but it was continually shot down by us?<br><br><strong>PM MahatirÂ’s attempts to take the lead role is well known for his efforts to lead the Muslim World to withstand competition and degrading attitude from the First World. </strong><br><br>The OPEC members did that way back in the 1970s .. they brought the world to its knees. So Dr M is merely taking a page in the book that shows that to deal with capatilistic societies, you have to band together and force the first world to listen to you. Otherwise, the division will always be there to kill you.<br><br><strong>His effort (and that of his FM Syed Hamid Albar) to out-do the Arabs is hardly disguised by forming a separate conference of Islamic Countries - to condemn USA in their efforts to attack Saddam or Iraq Â– within the NAM meeting in Kuala Lumpur in late 2002. The protests from the Arabs put a stop to this matter, as the O.I.C Meeting was to be held ten days later in Doha, after NAM in Kuala Lumpur. </strong><br><br>Of course, the current head of OIC, Qatar, put a stop to it as it stands to gain the most from the war.<br><br><strong>In any case, why bother with sour grapes if Malaysia decides NOT to measure their system against the Best of the Best; but is quite satisfied with the levels which they envision for themselves. </strong><br><br>Well they should be satisfied. Of course the should not rest on their laurels, but it is indeed satisfying what Dr M has done in his tenure compared to what the previous 3 PMs did.<br><br><strong>After inheriting the legacy from Nelson Mandela, Thabo had shown his idiocy by declaring that no Government Funds will be given to any hospitals who dare contradict his finding that Aids or HIV is not caused by Virus. </strong><br><br>If you will just ignore the issue with AIDS, you will see that he is as capable as any other foreign leader. Just as I take the same stance with GCT. If you just look at the idiotic stance that the PAP has with FW/FT and focus on that, you will not see how Singapore has progressed. Each man has his blind spots and failures.<br><br><strong>With violent crimes rising to the point of lawlessness, affecting almost every level of society, the place is no longer safe even in the up market neighborhood. Car jacking, rape, murder, daylight shooting, assaults, and what other violent crimes you can think of, all these are happening in South Africa under Thabo. </strong><br><br>Violent crime is bad in SA even BEFORE Mandela's time. His wife (winnie) was even convicted of murdering opposition supporters. There was hate crime, death squads, ghettos and whatnot. The only way you solve this problmes is to improve the economic situation and halt inflation. Hence I am sure that Thabo is doing a better job. Its like saying that because there are still drug pushers in Singapore, LKY and GCT did not do a good job (there are still drug pushers in Singapore .. remember about that abandoned boy in JB? His parents are convicted drug pushers)<br><br><strong>In your opinion, could he be doing better than GCT ? </strong><br><br>Yes, of course its my opinion, you have to ask the SA's to see if they agree.<br><br><strong>While the Malays or Bumiputras had access to soft loans, based on Islamic Banking system, the other ethnic groups have only access to commercial loans based on commercial terms and conditions. </strong><br><br>Common misconceptions. Soft loans / Handouts are available to people of all races. Its just that it is more discrete. I can share 2 cases that is well known.<br><br>a) Samy Veloo of MIC has borrowed millions from Malaysian banks. When asked to pay (after 4-5 years), he will just pay the principal, not the interest. Indeed, ALL political parties have the same benefits, hence their banking sector was in such a mess a few years ago. So if they want a bank loan, they just join a political party, drop some names and the money will be theirs. Totally unsecured.<br><br>b) The reason why there is so much turmoil in MCA right now is because Dr Ling has overstayed his tenure. He was supposed to retire in 1994. He now says he is going by 2005. Why the delay? He needs a successor in place to safeguard his family. His son, has a finger in every pie and has been burnt heavily. If not for the father's position, the son will be killed (whereabouts currently unknown)<br><br>So its the whole political regime (Malay, Indian, Chinese) who are corrupted over there.<br><br><strong>Of course anything can happen for the future, but given the fine balance of racial harmony that exist in Malaysia, would a savvy politicians dare put his career at risks ? </strong><br><br>Of course. If the politician can't do one thing and say another, they won't be politicians.<br><br><strong>DonÂ’t count on the stock market recovery after Iraq is taken over. </strong><br><br>I was talking about how USA will be rewarding its allies (and the republican party supporters) with plum jobs and pork barrel projects. Its true for all political parties in the world.<br><br><strong>Â“How else do poor "kampung boys", with no historical connections to wealth and fame, can succeed in one generation to have their sons owning and operating corporations that are involved in mega-million dollar enterprises ?Â”<br><br>Lee Kah Shing built his own empire through ingenuity, foresight, and keen business sense.<br><br>How could the Malaysian Politicians - who are mainly kampung boys - manage to find their million dollar funds to form mega-corporations for their children to operate, and all in one generation, with the Â“dadsÂ” entering politics mostly coming from poor family background. "<br><br>Ah .. but the Malaysian politicians whose sons are in business are the minority. Most of the cronies companies are actually run by the sons of the BUSINESSMEN. Examples are like Sime Darby, Maybank, Maxis, Genting, YTL .. all do not have sons of politicians at the helm. Their father may have built the empire that the son is running now, but its definately scions of the family, not political apointees.<br><br>[b]In any case, SingTel is NOT a Private Company owned by Private Capital. The effort in privatization by the SGP Government is only skin deep; as it try to disguise the GLCÂ’s into private companies by selling out to "approved" private public personalities that seems to be acting as "proxies in trust for the Government"(?). </strong><br><br>So are you saying that it is misleading the public that those are private companies (that can be invested on) while its actually just a government body? (that the final authority is the government)<br><br><strong>Have you forgotten the Singapore Shares ? At least Singaporeans get back something from the Government, despite the losses. What has the Malaysian politicians done with their National Reserves ? </strong><br><br>The NSS is a bribe to quiet the people during the last election. (Thats my opinion) The Malaysian people got 1 tax free year. Same thing ..<br><br><strong>They could not even pay for their military hardware purchase in Cash, and have to barter with their Palm Oil,</strong><br><br>The fact that some country is willing to accept the palm oll at an agreed upon value will bring less burden to the Malaysians, unlike us who buy state of the art toys with precious foreign reserves.<br><br><strong>nor do they allocate any funds to handle their problems with the Drug Addicts,</strong><br><br>ANY FUNDS? Are you for sure that the Malaysians give RM0.00 to handle their crime and drug problems? Its like saying Singapore allocates ZERO for sports development for locals.<br><br><strong> and other social welfare, educational, and infrastructural problems; and yet they make a big thing about investing overseas - which serves as "conduits for leakages". </strong><br><br>Malaysia invests more in sports development for their locals than Singapore does. Have you forgotten how our girls lost the netball final to Malaysia in the last sea games despite being the favourite? And the recent tiger cup where we lost to their under23 team? This is development of their youth.<br><br><strong>One would expect that at least they put their house in order, before attempting to play the Guardian Angel to help the Third World Countries. </strong><br><br>Funny, I was about to say the same thing about Singapore, how we should first learn about true competition in the domestic Singapore market before teaching the likes of China, ASEAN about it.<br><br><strong>Building homes in North Korea Â– would that be a North Korean State Funded Project, or will it be another Malaysian Politician's daylight robbery on their National Reserves ? Altruism or foolishness ? </strong><br><br>Your guess is as good as mine. Guess we have to find out by reading the FEER or Economist more.<br><br><strong>It should read more accurately if you had written that Â“the Malaysian Government is doing what it thinks is best to benefit its Â“croniesÂ”, as the Citizens are hardly aware that such investments exist. </strong><br><br>I agree with you<br><br><strong>Whatever new opportunities from new emerging markets will benefit the crony operated corporations, and seldom the Malaysian citizens. </strong><br><br>Same for Singapore. Benefits to the GLCs will not directly translate to better conditions for most of us ordinary Singaporeans. Buying Optus did not translate to lower phone calls to Australia.<br><br><strong>Do not forget that Czech, Poland, Hungary had only until recently emerged from a Stalinist economy, with the collapse of the Soviet Union through Perestoika and Glasnost. MalaysiaÂ’s exposure to the worldÂ’s free and open economy stretches back since it independence from Colonial Rule - a period of more then Forty Years. [b]<br><br>Malaysia was a primary commodity producer even in the 70s. They have only started manufacturing in late 70s and early 80s.

So do you hv a better formular for those policians ? Cut their pay ? Maybe, but how will it improve Singapore's economy in any significant manner other than gaining dividends in the popular front and winning over the disgrunted folks like you ? </strong><br><br>My point is that we have those statistics above and we pay millions to the ministers. If we pay peanuts, we get monkeys. Yet the monkeys are able to achieve whatever they are doing, without need for FT, million dollar salaries and NS. It makes you think of the sacrifices that have to be made in order to get that small extra singapore has (compared to Malaysia)<br><br><strong>In short by highlighting those cabinet minister pay will not serve your argument well considering the fact that MY gov has itself in comparision is muddled in corrupt and self-righteous race-driven enrichment that drove so many of its non-bumi oversea in seeking better opportunities. You've already set your agenda clear here in that A-J list of complains and dissatisfaction towards the current SG gov. By all means present your dissent, eventhough it is driven by emotion, but avoid the pitfalls of erroneous facts that you have presented earlier. Chee had done that and pay a heavy price for his polictial future. </strong><br><br>No doubt the Malaysians are corrupt. But even with corruption, they managed to provide democracy, youth development, economic progress and claw their way out of the middle ages. I have nothing against them. I think they done a wonderful job. Its only people who think that "THEY CAN DO BETTER" that I am posting the above to reason with them. They do things their way, we do things our way. If I want to achieve economic statistics, I live in Singapore. If I want the 5Cs by 40, I live in Malaysia. Its a choice we all make.<br><br><strong>Are you prepared for that , or just doing you "bit" as nay-saying Singaporean ? </strong><br><br>We do our NS because we feel that National Security is something worth sacrificing for. However, there are also those amongst us who feel that democracy is a noble idea and also worth sacrificing for. A democratic way of life is what seperates North and South Korea, the West and USSR, Isreal and the ARABs (this one is at least what the zionist backers want the USA public to think, that USA supports Isreal because they are the only true democracy in the region)<br><br>There are 2 types of Nay Sayers .. one who just want to say it, others who put constructive criticism as a way to improve the life here. I do consider myself to be the latter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The only way to solve the Israel situation is if 1 side destroys the other side completely. Which should not be too difficult for the Jews cos the Jews have penetrated into USA administration, US backing for Israel will eventually kill the rag heads in palestine sooner or later. Just wait.<br><br>As for Malaysia being against the war, if they make too much noise, be careful for they may be next, along with other muslim countries that support terrorism, i am not saying Malaysia supports T. Malaysia can do nothing about the war in Iraq, they are not strong enough to take on the white allies.<br><br>I fear that with Iraq defeated now, colonialism may come back in the form of America controlling Iraq's oil now. So we will wait and see.<br><br>I'll bet Georgey Bush$#&amp;@ will blame SARS on Saddam sooner or later. Interesting is it not? SARS came out during the attacks on Iraq, and Saddam is supposed to have Weapons of Mass Destruction, I would not be surprised if SARS is a weapon, as it definately appears so, it can kill people slowly and decisively, plus it has a good guise of a common pneumonia. I'll bet it was purposely set of in China to distable USA and China relations, since they don't like each other much.<br><br>I wonder if Muslims all around the world will see the attack on Iraq as a new modern day crusade? G.Bush himself said it was a crusade against terror, i'll also bet that most white american christians are ultra Anti-Muslim now.</div>

(so 27.9/20.3 = 1.37) that is 37% more tax. Singapore workers = 2.19/4.4 = 49% of population. Malaysia's is 9.9/22.6 = 43% .. so Singapore has (49%/43%) = 14% more per cap workers.<br><br>And tax / work pop = 27.9b/2.19 = 12,739 (Singapore) and 20.3/9.9 = 2050 (Malaysia) ..<br>Tax / PPP = 12739 / 24700 = 51.5%(Singapore) and 2050 / 9000 = 22.8% (Malaysia)<br><br>So very simply on a per cap worker calculation, 14% more workers in Singapore generate 37% more tax .. , and also SIngapore workers are taxed (either directly or indirectly) at 2.25 times more than Malaysian workers.<br><br><strong><br>What are those population figures for ? If not PERSONAL INCOME TAX is included in this revenue, then where else does ANY gov gets its pay cheque ? cooperate ? bonds ?
