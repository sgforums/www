            <div class='col-md body'>Let's say if Dr. M is slandering SM and his speech was directly translated in a way that SM is able to direct and plan for PM for certain issue, for this case, the bridge. Wouldn't it be slanderous and misleading to say that SM is now acting more than an advisory roles who had direct involvment with the state duties and negotiation and can predict and decide when the bridge project could possibly be carried out upon expiry of PM term?<br><br>Judging from past record and public media, the statemen had little patience over defamatory and slanderous act against them and were quick to put up legal offensive against such person. In this instance, legal suite could be thrown in on a personal capacity but there was none seen so far, unless it meets more than the eyes. Think about it both ways, don't constrainst yourself to one sided arguement, it will be more fruitful this way.<br><br>That's why this is called forum, open discussion<br></div>

Sure we could sue Dr. M's butt off, but knowing how malaysians would react, and their basic respect for any kind of law that makes them uncomfortable, it rapidly becomes apparent why ligitation is not the way of skinning the Dr. M cat...

            <div class='col-md body'>Whatever the politicos say, building a stupid bridge will not ease any congestion... it'll only make the congestion more difficult to be in due to the slope of the stupid bridge.<br><br>Here's why:<br><br>If you notice, any traveller through the JB checkpoints will have seen that the bottlenecks are at the Singapore and Malaysian checkpoints, NOT the causeway itself.<br><br>If the Singapore side is slower than the Malaysian side for vehicles exiting Malaysia and coming into Singapore, then there will be congestion no matter what bridge or causeway or pontoons are there.<br><br>If the Malaysian side is slower than the Singapore side for vehicles exiting Singapore and entering Malaysia, then again, there will be congestion.<br><br>It is simple queuing theory.  Look to improve the slowest parts of the links which are the checkpoints.  If the checkpoints are very very fast, the current causeway is more than sufficient to handle the traffic.<br><br>Maybe that's why the Singapore side (being very practical with money.. hey! it's the PAP after all!) cannot see the point of throwing a huge amount of money for something impractical.<br><br>Or maybe Dr.M is pushing this because it's his last chance at graft?
