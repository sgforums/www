            <div class='col-md body'>Oh dear!! SGH's reputation is already very bad (stinks!), and now this happen!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>well, this reminds me of one of my old neighbours worked there and encountered sexual harassment from the doctors.  One of the senior doctors was staring  at her bosom with smile and lust.  This sickening doctor one day actually tried to get fresh with her but she quickly moved away.  This of course offended the doctor and he really created hell for her.  Mind you this old neighbour is conservative and decently dressed for work.   The other encounter was a doctor was breathing very loudly when he stood very close to her.  So yucks!!!!<br><br>Oops, it is so sickening to come across doctors like that!!!  I was ever molested by GPs for a couple of times, too!!  REally, I do not how and where to seek help when this happen again!!</div>
