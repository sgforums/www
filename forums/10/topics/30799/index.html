            <div class='col-md body'>Read a book written by defected bioweapons scientist.<br><br>According to him ever since Jimmy Carter declared small pox eradicated from the world and stopped producing vaccinations for the masses, the russians began increase production of smallpox agents.<br><br>According to him smallpox is the easiest to manufacturer, more resistant to environment tempreature, and any body can do it with the simplest unbelievable rudimentry farm/kitchen tools.<br><br>Because of so many f#$king islamic symphatiser millitant wannabe I won't list book title or methods here.<br><br>To date they only maintain abt 2million vaccinations in the world at all times for scientific purpose/health/military personnel.<br><br>Imagine a smallpox attack here with horrific results and we are helpless even medical workers will be at risk.<br><br>No wonder the US is putting everyone under the needle.
