              <blockquote><span class="title">MHA clarifies its stance on Myanmar work permit rejections </span>
              <div id="articleBody" class="artText"><span> <br>ESTHER NG
              <br>estherng@mediacorp.com.sg
              <div> </div>
              THE message has been made clear: Foreign nationals who want to work or
              live here are expected to respect the law and local sensitivities, just
              as Singaporeans do.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              And with eight of their fellow
              countrymen failing to get their immigration passes renewed by the
              authorities after taking part in a gathering on Orchard Road during the
              Asean Summit last November, some Myanmar nationals here have taken the
              message to heart.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Ms Pan Thinzar, 26, a student
              who took part in the Orchard Road protest, has sworn off all protests.
              “If another violent crackdown happens (in Myanmar), I’ll channel my
              emotions through meditation, or through online petitions,” she told
              Today.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Research fellow Mr Zeyar Aung,
              34, who has yet to take part in any demonstration here, has no plans to
              do so unless it is legal and approved by the authorities.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              But taking a different line,
              Mr J J Edward Su, an executive committee member of the Overseas Burmese
              Patriots (OBP), said the latest developments will not deter its members
              from demonstrating their political beliefs.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              On Friday, the group held its
              second press conference in a month, asking for the reasons why the
              passes of the eight were not renewed. “We will still continue with our
              social and political activities,” said Mr Su. But when pressed, he
              declined to say what activities the group had planned.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              In response to queries, the
              Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said that the police and the Immigration
              and Checkpoints Authority have <span style="color: #ff0000;">“no objection to members of the
              Myanmarese community in Singapore pursuing their political activities
              so long as they abide by our laws. Indeed, the Police has approved and
              facilitated many such activities conducted through lawful means”. </span>
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              However, it said that, unlike
              other groups which have conducted theiractivities in a lawful manner,
              the “OBP has chosen to do so in open and persistent defiance of our
              laws. OBP members were investigated by the police for staging a number
              of illegal protests. The authorities have chosen to issue several of
              them with a warning for their offences instead of prosecution, so as to
              give them a second chance.”
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              The police had summoned
              around 40 people who had taken part in a street protest last November to
              a police station to help with investigations, and later let them off
              with a warning.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “Regrettably, this leniency is
              not appreciated. Some of the individuals concerned in the OBP continue
              to maintain a position that suggests they see themselves being above
              the law which Singaporeans observe.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “The OBP members have ignored
              repeated advice from the Police to act within our laws, a<span style="color: #ff0000;">nd also
              ignored requests by Government officials to meet to discuss the group’s
              conduct.</span>”
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              The MHA spokesperson also
              noted: “The right of a foreign national to work or stay in Singapore is
              not a matter of entitlement or a right to be secured by political
              demand and public pressure.”
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Of the eight Myanmar nationals
              who did not have their immigration passes renewed, six have left
              Singapore and are living in countries including Malaysia, Cambodia and
              Thailand. The other two,Ms Ngwe Zin Soe and Mr Wunna Saw Thein, both
              Permanent Residents, are still waiting for their re-entry permits to be
              renewed. </span></div>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">A few days ago, I wrote about the
                                  way our immigration department was effectively deporting Burmese
                                  who had been active organising against the military junta. See
                                  the article <a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2008/yax-925.htm"> Singapore shows Burmese dissidents the door</a>, which followed a press conference the Burmese
                                  held to highlight the matter.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">In my article, I  mentioned
                                  the case of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thu Yein Win </span>who was on an S-pass and whose
                                  interview for Permanent Residency took a strange turn. It didn't
                                  look hopeful. He might have to leave too when his S-pass
                                  expired.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Today, an email came informing me
                                  that his S-pass has been renewed, which means he can stay for 2
                                  more years.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">There was also the case of<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ngwe
                                  Zin Soe</span>, a Permanent Resident. She had applied for an extension
                                  to her re-entry permit so that she could travel. Her request was
                                  denied – a most unusual decision, when it is normally approved
                                  within 30 minutes. She too thought it was a harbinger of worse
                                  things to come.</span></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">But she has just received a
                                  letter reversing that decision, now saying it has been extended for one more year.</span></span></p>
