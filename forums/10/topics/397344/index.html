Foreigners joining in,  stand a better chance of getting citizenship, provide more voices for their interest and of course enjoy retreat trip and free lunch with local once  awhile.  </p></div>

              <p><br>I can tell you that you are a sick man who cannot appreciate the truth. Not all grassroots leaders are self-serving like the PAP smear gang. The alternative media is just out to damage Singapore's image and not help the common people of Singapore. Who knows about the grassroots leader in Tiong Bahru who helps out the poorer shopkeepers in the market out of his own pocket for 30 years? Many of the shopkeepers still owes him the money loaned yet he is dead for nearly a decade. Neither the PAP smear gang nor the alternative parties could get his loyalty for he only serves the common people. Who knows about the young man in the east who coaches poor students in their studies for free till the wee hours of the morning? He keeps organising events for donations to his poor charges via RC activities.</p>

              <p>How many grassroot members out there are as noble as the 2 guys you mentioned? Well, let me share with you what are the things I observed about these people.</p>
              <p>Whenever an MP is coming, these people will walk around informing everybody about the arrival of the VIPs. Many residents are not willing to join this PLP activity. These grassroot members will then drag them along telling them that there'll be free food, entertainment etc. The obvious intention is that they need to boost the numbers so that the MP will feel welcomed.</p>
              <p>When the MP arrives, this grassroot leader will follow the MP around like a dog. Along the way they will say a lot of stuffs to bootlick the MP. What's their reason for doing that? Trying to lure the mp into thinking that the ppl are leading a good life so that he/she can have a peace of mind?</p>
              <p>Not only that. In times of election these ppl would go around broadcasting for the ruling party. The facilities would be fully utilised for political reason. You think this is done for the interest of the ppl?</p>
              <p>Remember, you claimed tat your idol is the common ppl and you dun support any action by any political groups in their power struggle.. </p>

              <p>Still plenty more where these two came from. Sorry to disappoint you. Those who PLP the PAP smear gang or the alternative gangs should never be called grassroots leaders as they are there to å¤ºæ�ƒ.</p>
