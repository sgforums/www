              <p>Sunday, 30 August 2009, 7:45 pm | 3,170 views</p>
              </div>
              <p><strong><strong></strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><strong>Leong Sze Hian</strong></strong></p>
              <p>When the question was last asked in parliament as to the rejection rate for applications for the Public Assistance  scheme, the answer was that about 50 per cent  were  rejected.</p>
              <p>As there are only about 3,000 Singaporeans receiving public assistance, the question that needs to be raised is whether the criteria to qualify is too strict?</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports’ (MCYS) <a href="http://www.mcys.gov.sg/web/serv_E_PA.html"><span style="color: #990000;">website </span></a>says:</p>
              <p>“If you are unable to work owing to old age, illness or disability and have no means of subsistence and have little or no family support you may seek help under the PA scheme”.</p>
              <p>The tens of thousands of elderly toilet cleaners, food court cleaners, used drink cans and used cardboard collectors, etc, I believe may also fail to meet the PA scheme criteria.</p>
              <p>If the elderly lady earns more than $12 a day, she may be actually better of being a rubbish scavenger, as recepients of the PA scheme are not allowed to work.</p>
              <p>I also understand that if you own a flat, or have working children, it is also very difficult to qualify. Would you prefer to stay in your own home – instead of having to sell it and use up the proceeds, in order to get $360?</p>
              <p>Medifund I understand cannot be used for polyclinic out-patient treatment. I spoke to a 81 year-old toilet cleaner who earns just $600 a month, and she told me that her biggest worry is that everytime she goes to a polyclinic about every three months, she has to pay about $98 for her three-months medicine and consultation.</p>
              <p>As I understand it, the criteria to qualify for Medifund is confidential. As far as I am able to find out, the patient and family members must all have nothing in their Medisave, very little in their bank accounts, hardly any extra monthly disposable income, in order to get Medifund subsidy. Also, getting Medifund does not mean free, it may just be a subsidy for part of the medical cost.</p>
              <p>I also understand that about 20 per cent of Medifund applications are rejected.</p>
              <p>Members of parliament should know what are the rejection rates for Public Assistance, Financial Assistance and Medifund in their own constituencies. I suggest that these statistics be made public.</p>
              <p>Compare Singapore to any developed country, and the number of only 3,000 public assistance recipients against the total citizen population, may be the lowest “welfare per capita” in the world.</p>
              <p>To get the whole picture, perhaps what we need are the statistics. For example, according to the latest Department of Statistics data available, the bottom ten percentile of employed households have a  per capita monthly income of only $360.  What about unemployed households and retiree households?  How many of the 116,600 unemployed as at June 2009 have zero or very low per capita income?</p>
              <p>How many Singaporeans  earn less than $800?  The latest data say that 292,800 residents (Singaporeans and PRs) earn less than $1,200,  and about  126,800 work part-time for a median income of $600 which has remain unchanged from 1999 to 2008.</p>

              <p>Today elderly folks are yesterday ah lian and ah beng, they are less educated and therefore most failed to plan their financial porfolio well for retirement, indeed, we do sympathise them, but these group of old poeples will diminish as time goes by, the next batch will be better educated, faster to adapt and cheaper to maintain as they had planned well with good saving and investment.</p>
              <p>Therefore i see a elderly folks of Singapore problem is only a temporary problem. As much as we wanted to help them, they have to help themselves by knowing themselves and status they are in. Live by their means and be happy that they are living in Singapore with so much avenues in Govt initiatives to help them.</p>
              <p>The Govt should therefore focus on the younger generation is will emerge soon as the the elderly of Singapore, and I am happy that they are doing it, in teaching people about financial planing and investment, education, health and saving. If the Govt knows how to sow the young now, it will reap in their old age, and thereby giving no more problem to the govt and the society as a whole.</p>

              <p><br>And people who actually knows you in person, tells me what a person you really are.</p>
              <p>I leave up to the forumers to decide, that is reading posts or really finding out a person and realising that the outbursts on the forums is the extension of their real personality is really a way to know a person for what they are.</p>
              <p>There are those that believes that they could lie and ruin other people by means of forum bullying and pretending to be otherwise.</p>
              <p>And I am sure there are those that are only comfortable of hiding behind their pc screen and believe they can lie and be not what they think they are.</p>
              <p>And there are those,  try to 'mai nong' their 'soo called goodness' because they are insecure about who they really are.</p>
              <p>I am sure, your grandparents must be real proud of you defending them to be labeled as ah bengs or ah lians.  But I can be doubly sure, they will so proud of you because you were pretending to be so fillal and respectful on the forums, when actually you were so not that in real life.</p>
              <p>What makes a difference to a person?  One that actually practises what he/she preaches....or one that only mouth off the theories?</p>

              <p>Actually i was referring to a group of them only, oh yes, old peoples are good to chit chat with, I use to visit Bedok Zion old folk home for women, my Dad use to contribute alot to them, they like to dance and also good at joke. It is good that singapore still have homes to shelter old folks with contributors and sponsorship from people, just across the strait of both side only, you can see old people crawling on floor beggin for money.</p>
