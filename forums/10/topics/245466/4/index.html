Of course there will be doubts but the promises of having a common economy will be there, but at the time of the Referendum, is based on a loosely,federal, autonomous position for Singapore.

No body will arrest them.<br><br>If there are an option to vote no for Referendum, Wont Singapore fall into the ranks of the Communists?
