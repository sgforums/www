            <div class='col-md body'>Don't forget that it was the referendum that revealed  the majority's wish of Singaporeans to join the union. Even LKY thought that was the best prospect for Singapore. The Barisan Socialis was a firm opponent of the union. So was Brunei. Subsequent problems emerged during the union. I wouldn't go that far to be arrogant and say that it's Malaysia's loss. Singaporeans would have gained a lot too to be part of Malaysia.</div>

Brunei had a genuine reason not to join because of its oil wealth. We had none. In fact, it was fears from neighbours like Indonesia and Philippines concerning the merger of a greater Malaysia that resulted in the confrontation. We tend to see from today's perspective that it was wrong for Singapore to join Malaysia. In fact, we can categorize ourselves as a reluctant nation. We should pay heed to that, and not get too preachy and arrogant about our so called superiority.<br><br></div>

There was a sickly durian tree behind our house, but the small durians were delicious. The neighbours were fantastic, different ethnic groups and all living together in harmony. We could take short-cuts through their houses. In through the back door, out the front door, no problemo, only carry your slippers. Ah... what a loss.<br>But I am thankful I am not in Malaysia, because I am not a bumiputra.<br><br></div></blockquote>wa lao, ah pei, how old are you now, was already around in those days? I can still get that kind of life in the small town in Johore, right now, but there people turn on to channel 8 for the Zhao An Nin Hao, and not many young people stay around there anymore, all studying or migrated to KL, Singapore or Perth....sigh.....<br><br>If Singapore remains an undeveloped island, made up of small towns and kampongs, I guess many of us would be in Australia, UK or Taiwan.</div>

Brunei had a genuine reason not to join because of its oil wealth. We had none. In fact, it was fears from neighbours like Indonesia and Philippines concerning the merger of a greater Malaysia that resulted in the confrontation. We tend to see from today's perspective that it was wrong for Singapore to join Malaysia. In fact, we can categorize ourselves as a reluctant nation. We should pay heed to that, and not get too preachy and arrogant about our so called superiority.<br></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">How did you arrive at the conclusion that <span style="font-style: italic;">"public opinion was'nt exactly againste the merger"</span> - when there were no option for anyone in 1962 to place a 'NO' for Merger ?<br><br>The three options in which all adult Singaporean had to participate by law in this Referendum was only for MERGER with Malaysia - each under a different sets of conditions :</span><br><br><span style="color: green;"><blockquote><a href="http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/1962_Merger_Referendum_of_Singapore" rel="nofollow">Merger Referendum of 1962</a><span style="font-style: italic;"><br><br>One could note that there was no option to vote against the merger amongst three options presented to the people:<br><br><strong>Option A</strong>: All Singapore citizens would automatically become citizens of Malaysia, and Singapore would retain a degree of autonomy and state power, such as over labour and education. Singapore would also get to keep its language policies, such as to retain using all four major languages, English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil.<br><br><strong>Option B</strong>: Singapore would become a federal state like that of the other eleven states, with no more autonomy than the other states would, thus ceding control over issues such as labour and education policies to the Central Government in Kuala Lumpur. This also meant that there would be less multilingualism - only English and Malay would be used for official purposes, and possibly education. Only those born in Singapore or descended from the Singapore-born would become citizens of Malaysia. There would also be proportionate representation in Parliament from Singapore.<br><br><strong>Option C</strong>: Singapore would enter on terms no less favourable than the Borneo territories, Sabah and Sarawak, both whom were also discussing merger with Malaysia. This was to ensure that Malaysia would not discriminate along racial lines, as that would mean discriminating against Sabah and Sarawak, which were predominantly Bumiputra as well. </span></blockquote></span><br><span style="color: darkred;"><br>There were <a href="http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/1962_Merger_Referendum_of_Singapore" rel="nofollow">624,000 adult Singaporeans being eligible</a> for this Referendum, which was made compulsory by Law, resulting in a voter turnout of 561,000 - which was approximately 90 percent turnout.<br><br>Considering that the <a href="http://www.populstat.info/Asia/singapoc.htm" rel="nofollow">1962 Singapore Population of 1,750,000</a>, this was a remarkable achievement in political conciousness of Singaporeans in the early Political History of Singapore - compared to the participation of Singaporeans in 2006 Elections, when our population is 4.5 Million.<br><br>Without any option to reject Merger, the entire exercise of Merger seems to be a foregone conclusion, with the choice merely that to select the Terms and Conditions of Merger - with Option A being the OBVIOUS CHOICE.<br><br>Was it oil alone that allowed Brunei to stay out of the merger, or was it the political implication of the Brunei Sultan losing his own Royal autonomy in deference to the 11 Royalties in the then Federation of Malaya ?<br><br>As much as Brunei was subjected to the threats of larger neighbors - (which actually reared its ugly head when Brunei's indigeneous Malay Political Party was instigated and funded by Indonesia to topple the Brunei Sultan) - it remained steadfast in its decision not to merge, but to live with British protection.<br><br>Why did Singapore not consider the same option then, when since its founding in 1819, Singapore was seen and planned - by Sir Stamford Raffles -  to be the regional center of economic and entrepot trade ?<br><br>Could the reason for the insistence by LKY to merge with Malaysia due to his lack in confidence for Singapore to go it alone, which will be quite revealing to his ability that he did not have the same political calculation and economic vision as that of Sir Stamford Raffles ?
