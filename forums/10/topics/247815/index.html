Subordinates have no control over whether a CEO want to take holiday, or how he wants to travel. Sub has to ren qi tun shen.<br><br>U know the CEO very kind and generous leh he increase his pay for a good cause not because he greedy for money. He increase his pay to donate to charity leh how many CEO will do that!!!. Though i think the stakeholders not happy sia. They prefer the CEO to donate using company's name. At least like that can run tax.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>he oredi know that does not affect him, because his salary is more than enough to let him enjoy luxury and comfortable life. Furthermore, he don't have to support his father at all. His father got more money than him. After he died, his fortune also go to him and his family.<br>he say by not increasing pay, the so called talent will drift away after few years. I think I would rather let them drift away because I do not want to use my hard earned money to feed these bloody mosquito who will suck your blood bit by bit and year by year.<br><br>They should take the effort to recruit talented people that truly wanted to serve the country and the people and to improve their life. And not recruit a person just because he is talented, and threaten to leave if their salaries is not rise. this type of greedy person will never satisfied with his salaries, in the end he will ask for billion or zillion. This is not a commercial company. Their salaries are million dollar per year, enough to let them stay in "Gold" ward if they fall sick through rest of their life but average Singaporean can only stay in "c" ward if fall sick.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At 11.30 pm, tonight, he has basically repeated what Minister Teo Chee Hean has said in parliament- it is necessary to increase the ministers' salaries now because it is good time to do so in order to retain talents. He added that because he has built up a team of ministers and MPs based on benchmarking their salaries to tbe best he has brought in a good team who has taken Singapore higher.<br><br>But although he had obliguely touched on the fact that many Singaporeans are still not doing too well in their jobs or business, he could not and did not explain why these people cannot do well.<br><br>If what he wanted to show is that he and his new team has been successful then he should be able to explain why majority or 80% of the citizens are still not doing well in their jobs or businesses. He obviously is still using the GDP to push for salary increases knowing full well that what have recovered are not the domestic sector but only some MNCs and GLCs. If this is the case then he could not certainly claim that he or his team of ministers has done a good job and have their pay increased based on the benchmarking to the best or few lucky ones in the private sector.<br><br>If he or his team has done well to deserve the million-dollar pay rise after already getting the world's highest bill collector and policing salaries then he should not see so many citizens struggling to make ends meet for which he was forced to introduce the assistance workfare scheme of late.<br><br>So tonight he had not really addressed the most perplexing issues - whether his team of ministers has succeeded in improving the jobs and businesses of the lower or middle income earners to this date and whether the benchmarking to the selective few lucky ones in the private sector is the correct thing to do which is only comparing with the lucky few.<br><br>On both counts - economic performance and objectivity of his benchmarking of ministers' salaries to the few lucky lottery winners in the private sector he has again failed to convince people or me that he is correct.</div>
