Thus a collective management has not been attained to motivate all to excel in carrying out policies and decisions.<br><br>That is why all the assumptions continue to affect efficiency and change to meet new environments and circumstances. While other Asian tigers have leapt ahead like Korea and China, we still practised old management theories like tripartism which does not work any more, meritocracy being too steeped in promoting self-importance and grades at the expense of entrepreneurial and broad-based education, non-welfarism leading to extreme of government overcharging for every service to produce surpluses that deprive the economic growth, SIA and PSA keeping to its value pricing policies until challenged by external forces, or MOE failing to make changes to all the meritocratic assumptions about education etc.<br><br>Problems are caused to every level to delay change because no one is powerful enough to change all the sacred cow assumptions no matter how irrelevant.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

He may be adopting a consultative approach to let the people decide what they want, and he as the helmsman, would do his best to steer the country in that direction.<br><br>The million-dollar question, however, is: Are the people of Singapore <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> given the power to decide the kind of Singapore they want?<br><br>In a way, yes. The people of Singapore are given the power to decide what they want, but only by voting in the people they want for the government. The problem is once the government has been elected, the people of Singapore would have to suffer the decisions, for better or for worse, made by such government "on behalf of the people" in "the people's best interests".</div>
