              <p><br> Excuse me... either you are too stuck on the beach for your own
                  good, or you simply got your brains fried with the care free
                  life under the sun.</p>
              <p>What makes you think that a successful father will dump his
                  first family for the sake of the second ?</p>
              <p>It looks like you do not understand the intricacies of life in a
                  large family that those in your father's generation - and before
                  him - had the good fortune to enjoy.</p>
              <p>A large family had the benefit of division of labor, and with
                  the wealth generating techniques largely kept within the
                  family.</p>
              <p>MM LKY had seen the positive side of those days, as he had lived
                  through the 1940s and 50s - when capable and successful
                  men had taken more responsibilities by accepting more then one
                  woman as a wife, and enlarge his family.</p>
              <p>His observation was due to the large number of single
                  Singaporean women, who are intelligent and highly educated but
                  remain single. </p>
              <p>According to LKY's thinking on eugenics, these Singaporean
                  women could have received the intelligent and resourceful genes of
                  the successful men, and would have produced the next intelligent
                  generation to replace themselves.</p>
              <p>However, LKY lamented in his National Day Rally speech that it
                  was unfortunate that the Women's Charter prevented the Singapore
                  men from ''putting the available resources to better use'',</p>
              <p>Either you are too young and undeveloped to appreciate MM LKY's
                  wisdom and deep insight, or you are incapable
                  of positively reacting to MM LKY's thoughts.</p>

              <p>LOL. you're kidding right ?</p>
              <p>Yes very wise words indeed.</p>
              <p>So you think by getting rid of the Women's Charter , intelligent women will be willing to marry a married man ? Smart move.</p>
              <p>So instead of seeing more unmarried intelligent women, he'd rather see more unmarried stupid men. Kudos, smart man he is !!!</p>
              <p>Actually is lau ti ko !</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">"<em>The practice of medicine has its limits. It takes wisdom to know these limits and the true needs of the dying. Heedless pursuit of 'pure' medicine to prolong life, without regard to cost or the wishes of the patients, cannot be sustained in the long term, not even in the wealthiest countries</em>," he said.<br><br>Hence, he said, in Singapore, "<em>while we will invest more in healthcare, it is more important to get the economics of healthcare right". "The reality is that demand for healthcare is unlimited and has to be rationed</em>," he said.<br>.<br>"<em>Problems are compounded as populations age and vast amounts of high-tech resources are marshalled to manage the last few weeks of the terminally ill, delivering poor quality of life to the patients at very high cost to society</em>," he added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I must have missed this speech from PM LHL, and I am surprised that he has spoken in such pragmatic tone concerning the economics in sustaining Life for those seen as terminally ill.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">It will be interesting to see how pragmatic PM LHL will be to <em>''invest more in healthcare and get the economics of healthcare right''</em> - to <em>''fix''</em> his mother's present critical condition.</span></p>
              <p>PM Lee's suggestion takes the view that only those who can afford to pay for healthcare for their terminally illness, will be prolonged regardless of cost; while ordinary Singaporeans who burden Singapore Society with a high health cost should prepare themselves to take the terminal route</p>
              <p>If Singaporeans are expected to discuss the issue of death, let us begin by discussing the High Cost of the Government Policies that the Singaporean Society must bear from cradle to grave.</p>
              <p>The Academy of Medicine should rescind the Honorary Fellowship title awarded to PM LHL - as he had violated the Hippocratic Oath sworn to be upheld by every medical practitioner.</p>

              <p>That is what happened to my mum when she was admitted to tan tock seng.  The dr knew she was suffering from stroke in the brain refused to transfer her to neuro ward siting reason that the neuro dr will not want to take her in, thus she remained in the geriatric ward waited for death.  finallly, without any neuro dr to take care of my mum she passed away sooner than expected.   That is how PAP is in control in public hospital - I am referring to the article above which I posted on what the cold blooded hopeless, no PM quality lee hsien loong said about prolonging life.  </p>
              <p>lee hsien loong the most hopeless PM in the history of Singapore owes Singaporeans explanation whether doctors should prolong the life of his mum.   I have nothing against the old lady, really, it is lee hsien loong who has brought upon such issue.</p>

              <p>thanks, snowfoxx.  read what he said in his posts in the thread "Lee kuan yew when are you going to die".  He the redDUST has finally admitted he is a PAP's running dog.   He is here to b.i.t.c.h around because he can't hv sex from his wife and his kids are all sleeping, so out of frustration he came here to find fault.   Truly, he is one of the most  b.i.t.c.h.y  man I come across.</p>

              <p><br>the most hopeless PM in singapore history, lee hsien loong is desperate to attract foreigners so he generalised the requirements.    he still owe the people of singapore the reasons as to whether he should allow his mum's life to be prolonged or not, I say this in relation to the article I posted earlier.  I have nothing against the mum, it is lhl that is the issue.   Singapore definitely does not need a cold blooded, self centred, stupid PM called leehsien loong to lead the nation.</p>

              <p>Your smugness is typical of the Singaporean nerd, who believe you possess a 2-Dimensional vision in assessing a 3-Dimension World, but unfortunately unaware that you are stuck at the 1-Dimension level in digesting and processing the details from the real world.</p>
              <p>Do you think that everything will fall into place like clock work - just by removing the Women's Charter - and with the single women jumping into your arms ?</p>

              <p>PM Lee's suggestion takes the view that only those who can afford to pay for healthcare for their terminally illness, will be prolonged regardless of cost; while ordinary Singaporeans who burden Singapore Society with a high health cost should prepare themselves to take the terminal route</p>

              <p>The text of PM LHL's statement that you have so diligently repeated from my post, carried the message for Singaporeans to consider allowing the terminally ill to slip away quietly - if they cannot afford the costly medical care - so as not to be a burden to society by prolonging costly medical treatment when there is simply no further hope in sight.</p>
              <p>Is medical care then only available to the terminally ill who can afford to buy time for themselves ?</p>
              <p>Your 'in-Law' has the good fortune of having children with obliging and fillial spouses - all chipping in to help bear the burden of the medical cost.</p>

              <p>Project this present situation into the future - in which you are in the same shoes as your in-Law today requiring stent treatment. What if you should marry late, and limit your family size to a single or two-child family, and your children are either too young to be married, or simply prefer to marry late - what options do you have, if you or your children or their spouses cannot afford to muster enough to pay for your medical bills ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>MM LKY had seen the positive side of those days, as he had lived
                                          through the 1940s and 50s - when capable and successful
                                          men had taken more responsibilities by accepting more then one
                                          woman as a wife, and enlarge his family.</p>
              <p>His observation was due to the large number of single
                                          Singaporean women, who are intelligent and highly educated but
                                          remain single. </p>
              <p>According to LKY's thinking on eugenics, these Singaporean
                                          women could have received the intelligent and resourceful genes of
                                          the successful men, and would have produced the next intelligent
                                          generation to replace themselves.</p>
              <p>However, LKY lamented in his National Day Rally speech that it
                                          was unfortunate that the Women's Charter prevented the Singapore
                                          men from ''putting the available resources to better use'',</p>
              <p>Either you are too young and undeveloped to appreciate MM LKY's
                                          wisdom and deep insight, or you are incapable
                                          of positively reacting to MM LKY's thoughts.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Atobe, your postings are normally very logical and wise... But on the topics of"woman's charter" I am afraid, I cant understand ur logic... I have a few questions...</p>
              <p>1. Do you think a man should have more than one wife?</p>
              <p>2. Do you buy into LKY's logic of Eugenics, ie women recieve genes from superior parents and would produce intelligent offspring? </p>
              <p>It is a fact that in genetic terms, both man and woman have equal footings on contribution of genes to their offsprings, so should not man and woman be equal footings? Why is there a masculine bias, is the bias not based on outdated ideologies.</p>
              <p>Or perhaps I have missed the point of your postings....</p>

              <p>I'm very confused, one moment you tell me how great MM Lee's insight is.</p>
              <p>And next moment, you're telling me it ain't work that way.</p>
              <p>What are you after really ?</p>
              <p>Girls in their 30s getting hung up on married men ? LOL.. in your fantasies perhaps !</p>
              <p>And nope, the last time I checked.. I don't have a prick down there.</p>
              <p>Yes we all know men likes to spread their genes.. not just the rich and powerful mind ya.</p>
              <p>I don't know about ya, but I ain't one that'll be interested in his genes. Look at LHL and you'd know what I mean, LOL !!!!</p>

              <p>I am getting more surprised at your reading ability - which part of my post have I told you 'how great MM LKY's insight is' ?</p>
              <p>As I did mention, you are stuck in a ONE-Dimension thinking with your displayed reading ability in attempting to dissect a 3-Dimensional World - is this quantum physics ? Surely you are not hung up on your make-believe 2-Dimension ability ?</p>
              <p>If you are unable to locate the prick where it exist, how will you know how the successfully established married guys are able to attract the single girls in their 30s ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, either you are not yet in your 30s, or if you are - you have not been in circulation - {for whatever reasons best known to yourself} - to appreciate where the action has been.</p>
