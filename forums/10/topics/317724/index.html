              <p><strong>Mrs Lee Kuan Yew in serious condition after brain haemorrhage</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The wife of Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew was
                  admitted to the neuro-intensive care unit (NCU) at Tan Tock Seng
                  Hospital this week.
                  <br> <br>A statement from the Minister Mentor's Office said Mrs Lee, 87,
                  suffered sudden weakness on her left side and slurring of speech around
                  noon on Monday.
                  <br> <br>She was then taken to the National Neuroscience Institute for an
                  urgent brain scan. The results revealed massive right intra-cerebral
                  haemorrhage, and Mrs Lee was subsequently admitted to the NCU.
                  <br> <br>The haemorrhage stabilised after two days of close monitoring and
                  treatment. She was then transferred to the general ward on Wednesday.
                  <br> <br> Mrs Lee currently remains in serious condition although she is able to recognise immediate family members.     - CNA/ac</span></p>

              <p>People, read what did the son of Mrs Lee K Y said about prolonging life.  I have no issue whether guek choo the mrs lky is alive or dead, but just look at the "dear" lee hsien loong and read what he said about prolonging life makes me lose more respect for him.</p>

Alas, fixing it is politically difficult. We must not get into such a situation."<br>.<br>While different countries have taken different approaches to healthcare, "their experience shows that more resources do not necessarily improve healthcare outcomes", said Mr Lee, who received an honorary fellowship from the Academy of Medicine last night.<br>.<br>Hence, he said, in Singapore, "while we will invest more in healthcare, it is more important to get the economics of healthcare right". "The reality is that demand for healthcare is unlimited and has to be rationed," he said.<br>.<br><span style="color: #3366ff;">"Problems are compounded as populations age and vast amounts of high-tech resources are marshalled to manage the last few weeks of the terminally ill, delivering poor quality of life to the patients at very high cost to society," he added.<br></span>.<br>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan first talked about the need for a national conversation on the dying process last October.<br>.<br>Then, he said he would look into the legislation governing the Advance Medical Directive, which allows adults to refuse extraordinary life-sustaining treatment for a terminal illness, as part of his ministry's five-year plan.<br>.<br>Other healthcare priorities include the management of chronic diseases, which Mr Lee also mentioned last night as part of the "new and creative approa-ches" Singapore should explore to improve its market-based system of pricing and co-payment.<br>.<br>Maximising the benefits of IT is one such approach. For example, the National Healthcare Group has introduced tele- radiology at its polyclinics, where X-ray images are sent to Bangalore to be read.<br>.<br>This has reduced prices and cut turnaround times "dramatically from two to three days previously to an hour or less", said Mr Lee, who stressed: "We must press on with such initiatives."<br>.<br>He identified tele-pathology, which allows doctors who study disease processes and their causes to use telecommunications to transmit data and images, as one possibility.<br>.<br>The challenge is in training and recruiting people for the healthcare system. The Health Ministry projects that Singapore will need over 2,000 more doctors by 2015. Currently, Singapore produces about 230 doctors each year. In 2012, this number will be 300. But it will not be enough.<br>.<br>"Given our small local talent pool and competing needs from other sectors in the economy, there are limits to how far we can expand the local supply," said Mr Lee.<br>.<br>"Increasingly, we will have to recruit medical talent from abroad. We must be open minded in accepting such imported talent, while maintaining medical standards and helping foreign trained doctors to adapt to conditions in Singapore."<br><br>Blindly prolonging life is not the solution: PM<br><br>Derrick A Paulo<br>derrick@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>His health minister broke the silence last year, and now Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is taking the dialogue forward.<br>.<br>In a speech to medical professionals from Singapore and abroad, Mr Lee identified end-of-life care and how people are medically treated in their final stages as key factors in determining how well the health system works.<br>.<br>In this regard, Singapore will avoid taking the same route as some other countries, such as the United States, in the management of issues of death.<br>.<br>"The practice of medicine has its limits.

For example, the National Healthcare Group has introduced tele- radiology at its polyclinics, where X-ray images are sent to Bangalore to be read.<br>.<br>This has reduced prices and cut turnaround times "dramatically from two to three days previously to an hour or less", said Mr Lee, who stressed: "We must press on with such initiatives."<br>.<br>He identified tele-pathology, which allows doctors who study disease processes and their causes to use telecommunications to transmit data and images, as one possibility.<br>.<br>The challenge is in training and recruiting people for the healthcare system. The Health Ministry projects that Singapore will need over 2,000 more doctors by 2015. Currently, Singapore produces about 230 doctors each year. In 2012, this number will be 300. But it will not be enough.<br>.<br>"Given our small local talent pool and competing needs from other sectors in the economy, there are limits to how far we can expand the local supply," said Mr Lee.<br>.<br>"Increasingly, we will have to recruit medical talent from abroad. We must be open minded in accepting such imported talent, while maintaining medical standards and helping foreign trained doctors to adapt to conditions in Singapore."<br><br>Blindly prolonging life is not the solution: PM<br><br>Derrick A Paulo<br>derrick@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>His health minister broke the silence last year, and now Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is taking the dialogue forward.<br>.<br>In a speech to medical professionals from Singapore and abroad, Mr Lee identified end-of-life care and how people are medically treated in their final stages as key factors in determining how well the health system works.<br>.<br>In this regard, Singapore will avoid taking the same route as some other countries, such as the United States, in the management of issues of death.<br>.<br>"The practice of medicine has its limits.
