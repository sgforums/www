              <p><br> Now you are being agitated unnecessarily and planting
                  unsaid words that never existed in clearly made
                  statements.</p>
              <p>When you hit 30 something and continue to miss your boat -
                  perhaps you may toy around with the idea of feeling the warmth that
                  a successful, mature, intelligent married man that another
                  woman had the benefit of enjoying.</p>
              <p>Not to worry, as no one will know if you have harbored that
                  thought even now, seeing your girl friend enjoying the company of
                  someone whom you think you deserve more.</p>
              <p>Wakey, wakey, it looks like either you are
                  sexually amoebic, or you are still struggling to find that
                  non-existent tiny piece of sensitive meat somewhere hidden
                  behind closed lips in the lower hairier half of your
                  body.</p>
              <p>Good luck if you can satisfy yourself at the age of 30
                  something, if you can get through your ''twenteens'' without
                  looking battle-worn.</p>
              <p>Mid-life crisis ? With so many to choose, who is having any
                  crisis ?</p>

              <p>Tsk tsk. Still living in that polygamist cult dream ?</p>
              <p>I'm so sorry your wife couldn't satisfy your sexual needs. My most sincerest condolences. Perhaps you may wanna try honing your foreplay skills ?</p>
              <p>A very sexually deprived man you are. Please go to the bar forum.</p>

              <p>According to the latest news from CNA, she had just undergone surgery yesterday, and is still in serious conditions.... Hope she can be better, undergoing surgery at this age might be very very risky, infact I would say most doctors would not recommend a surgery at this age... .</p>

              <p>qlqq9, i took a concilliatory tone to message you after i read about your mother's demise in another thread. i realized i could have been a little harsh given what happened to you recently. i have taken off my redDUST mask to address you person to person, instead of the redDUST vs. qlqq9 persona.</p>
              <p>i started with a condolence message to you. obviously, you choose to selectively published what is a private message to you to concoct a different story that is outright misleading and malicious. it clearly shows your inability to separate what is real life and what is a web identity all of us, you and me included, have assumed in this forum. for that, i symphatize with you.</p>

              <p>how can you be sincere when you slap someone and later tell that someone you don't mean any harm or bear any grudge.  fuck off lah.    You just use the condolence msg as a mask to get your evil message across and to cover your ass so as to ease your conscience.   I don't accept any "sincere" messages from an evil, condescending person like you.</p>

              <p>aiyo, so heartless or is he trying to cover his weakness as a guniang.   any way, I have no surprise if he smile as I come across family members still joke and chat happily with others when own mum was critically ill and on the verge of death.</p>
              <p>this hsien loong is cold blooded, if he is not he will not talk about prolonging life and all that crap.   Just very curious to know the way he will pass on in future, interesting to know.</p>
