              <p>As I did mention, you are stuck in a ONE-Dimension thinking with
              your displayed reading ability in attempting to dissect a
              3-Dimensional World - is this quantum physics ? Surely you are not
              hung up on your make-believe 2-Dimension ability ?</p>
              <p>If you are unable to locate the prick where it exist,
              how will you know how the successfully established
              married guys are able to attract the single girls in their 30s
              ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, either you are not yet in your 30s, or if you are -
              you have not been in circulation - {for whatever reasons
              best known to yourself} - to appreciate where the action has

              <p>Single girls in her 30s who are <strong>desperate</strong> enough will be attracted to any prick, not just married ones.</p>
              <p>Independent , successful and intelligent girls are more interested in strong young men , FYI. So please, old lame ones like LKY. NO THANKS !!</p>

              <p>Atobe, your postings are normally very logical and wise... But on the topics of"woman's charter" I am afraid, I cant understand ur logic... I have a few questions...</p>
              <p>1. Do you think a man should have more than one wife?</p>
              <p>2. Do you buy into LKY's logic of Eugenics, ie women recieve genes from superior parents and would produce intelligent offspring? </p>
              <p>It is a fact that in genetic terms, both man and woman have equal footings on contribution of genes to their offsprings, so should not man and woman be equal footings? Why is there a masculine bias, is the bias not based on outdated ideologies.</p>

              <p>As stated in my post, the ''Thoughts'' are that of LKY during the last few National Day Rally before he stepped down as PM.</p>
              <p>If you have enough love to give away, and make more then one person happy, and able to keep the peace under the sky, why should you not take on more responsibilities when you can ?</p>
              <p>Eugenics ?</p>

              <p>your words imply that it is not a valid concern.</p>
              <p>imo, this is a natural human instinct. in sickness, we all err on the side of being `overly cautious', especially when it comes to our loved ones. cursory examples of numbers of cases registering in A&amp;E that are not real A&amp;E cases as reported here indeed tells us that this is happening.</p>

              <p>imo, this is a natural human instinct. in sickness, we all err on the side of being `overly cautious', especially when it comes to our loved ones. cursory examples of numbers of cases in A&amp;E are not real A&amp;E cases as reported indeed tells us that this is happening.</p>

              <p>Even a transvertite has a piece of meat, and most woman has one shrunken lump of nail size expandable meat that is normally known as a ''Clit'' - if you cannot see it, try feeling for it and you know you have found it when you suddenly shudder with some pleasurable sensation.</p>

              <p>Why should they be desparate when it is their choice not to choose any Tom, Dick or Harry during their immature premium years, and get stuck with housewife chores and child rearing ?</p>
              <p>It is in their 30s that the single women are mature enough to know what is the right choice in a mature man, that is already self-made in his career, stable emotionally with a family, and has the means to support the measuredly modest life-style of a single 30-ish woman.</p>
              <p>Comparatively, a girl in the ''twenteens'' are still stuck in their wishy-washy world of childish experimentation - struggling inside the developing body of a teen and a woman.- still google eyed looking for the dream young stallion irregardless if he will still depend on papa for petrol money to fill papa's car borrowed for the night out.</p>

              <p><br>Statistically married couples live longer, perhaps they provide emotional and physical support for each other. Therefore as one spouse dies, the other will tend to follow suit because the spouse is reliant on the emotional and physical support.</p>

The odds are higher that a spouse will live to a ripe old age than a single person will. Take a couple who are both 60: The probability that at least one spouse will reach 95 is 45%. For a single man, the odds of reaching that age are 22%; for a single woman, 30%. </a></em></p>

Anticipating a long life can instigate conversations about how a couple will take care of themselves, what each spouse expects of the other, and what needs to be done to make sure that the surviving spouse will be financially secure.</a> </em></p>
