For example, the National Healthcare Group has introduced tele- radiology at its polyclinics, where X-ray images are sent to Bangalore to be read.<br>.<br>This has reduced prices and cut turnaround times "dramatically from two to three days previously to an hour or less", said Mr Lee, who stressed: "We must press on with such initiatives."<br>.<br>He identified tele-pathology, which allows doctors who study disease processes and their causes to use telecommunications to transmit data and images, as one possibility.<br>.<br>The challenge is in training and recruiting people for the healthcare system. The Health Ministry projects that Singapore will need over 2,000 more doctors by 2015. Currently, Singapore produces about 230 doctors each year. In 2012, this number will be 300. But it will not be enough.<br>.<br>"Given our small local talent pool and competing needs from other sectors in the economy, there are limits to how far we can expand the local supply," said Mr Lee.<br>.<br>"Increasingly, we will have to recruit medical talent from abroad. We must be open minded in accepting such imported talent, while maintaining medical standards and helping foreign trained doctors to adapt to conditions in Singapore."<br><br>Blindly prolonging life is not the solution: PM<br><br>Derrick A Paulo<br>derrick@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>His health minister broke the silence last year, and now Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is taking the dialogue forward.<br>.<br>In a speech to medical professionals from Singapore and abroad, Mr Lee identified end-of-life care and how people are medically treated in their final stages as key factors in determining how well the health system works.<br>.<br>In this regard, Singapore will avoid taking the same route as some other countries, such as the United States, in the management of issues of death.<br>.<br>"The practice of medicine has its limits. It takes wisdom to know these limits and the true needs of the dying.

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I must have missed this speech from PM LHL, and I am surprised that he has spoken in such pragmatic tone concerning the economics in sustaining Life for those seen as terminally ill.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">It will be interesting to see how pragmatic PM LHL will be to <em>''invest more in healthcare and get the economics of healthcare right''</em> - to <em>''fix''</em> his mother's present critical condition.</span></p>
              <p>PM Lee's suggestion takes the view that only those who can afford to pay for healthcare for their terminally illness, will be prolonged regardless of cost; while ordinary Singaporeans who burden Singapore Society with a high health cost should prepare themselves to take the terminal route</p>
              <p>If Singaporeans are expected to discuss the issue of death, let us begin by discussing the High Cost of the Government Policies that the Singaporean Society must bear from cradle to grave.</p>
              <p>The Academy of Medicine should rescind the Honorary Fellowship title awarded to PM LHL - as he had violated the Hippocratic Oath sworn to be upheld by every medical practitioner.</p>

              <p>She surely must have a higher IQ, as she is older then him by a year or two; and it is an open secret that it was her challenging his thinking most of the time and helped provide the legal framework for all his thoughts.</p>
              <p>She was practically his legal counsel 24/7.</p>
              <p>MM LKY had actually said at a National Day Rally - at the old Kallang Theatre - that he regretted pushing through the Women's Charter, as it made it more difficult for any successful man to take on additional responsibility with a second or third family.</p>
              <p>This resulted in many capable and intelligent women being left on the shelf, waiting for the Right Man to come along.</p>
              <p>This was not the situation before the Women's Charter was passed, as many successful Singaporean men had at least a second family - and there was no problems about population replacement.</p>
              <p>Did the Women's Charter helped the interest of the Women ?</p>
              <p>Sadly, in the opening statement of the Women's Charter it had to start with the most degrading place of work for any women - the Brothel.</p>

              <p>Excwees me ? You think you didn't benefit from the women charter too ?</p>
              <p>If your successful father can anyhow dump his prior families without the so called " Liabilities" , you'd probably be the child of your  father's third wife @!!!!@ And perhaps have 10 half siblings along the way.</p>

              <p><br>Excuse me... either you are too stuck on the beach for your own good, or you simply got your brains fried with the care free life under the sun.</p>
              <p>What makes you think that a successful father will dump his first family for the sake of the second ?</p>
              <p>It looks like you do not understand the intricacies of life in a large family that those in your father's generation - and before him - had the good fortune to enjoy.</p>
              <p>A large family had the benefit of division of labor, and with the wealth generating techniques largely kept within the family.</p>
              <p>MM LKY had seen the positive side of those days, as he had lived through the 1940s and 50s - when capable and successful men had taken more responsibilities by accepting more then one woman as a wife, and enlarge his family.</p>
              <p>His observation was due to the large number of single Singaporean women, who are intelligent and highly educated but remain single. </p>
              <p>According to LKY's thinking on eugenics, these Singaporean women could have received the intelligent and resourceful genes of the successful men, and would have produced the next intelligent generation to replace themselves.</p>
              <p>However, LKY lamented in his National Day Rally speech that it was unfortunate that the Women's Charter prevented the Singapore men from ''putting the available resources to better use'',</p>
              <p>Either you are too young and undeveloped to appreciate MM LKY's wisdom and deep insight, or you are incapable of positively reacting to MM LKY's thoughts.</p>
