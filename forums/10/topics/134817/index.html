            <div class='col-md body'>China claims HK reporter a spy<br><br>Tuesday, May 31, 2005 Posted: 0545 GMT (1345 HKT)<br><br>BEIJING, China (Reuters) -- China has accused a Hong Kong-based reporter for Singapore's The Straits Times newspaper of spying for foreign agencies, but his wife said it was a set-up.<br><br><span style="color: red;">If charged and convicted, Ching Cheong, 55, a Hong Kong citizen and permanent resident of Singapore, could face the death penalty. He was detained by agents of the state security apparatus in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on April 22.</span><br><br>"Ching admitted that in recent years he engaged in intelligence gathering activities on the mainland on instructions from foreign intelligence agencies and accepted huge amounts of spying fees," the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.<br><br>"Currently, relevant departments are investigating his spying activities," the statement said without elaborating on which country or countries were alleged to be his paymaster.<br><br>Ching is the second employee of a foreign news organization taken into custody by President Hu Jintao's government in a year.<br><br>New York Times researcher Zhao Yan was formally arrested last October for revealing state secrets -- believed to be news that then military chief Jiang Zemin was retiring from politics. Zhao has yet to go on trial.<br><br>Ching's wife was adamant he was innocent.<br><br>"He was wrongly accused," Mary Lau told Reuters by telephone.<br><br>"I don't understand. He was in Beijing all of March (to cover the annual session of parliament), but they didn't arrest him then."<br><br>Lau said on Monday her husband had been accused of stealing state secrets -- obtaining unpublished interviews with late Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, who was purged for opposing the 1989 Tiananmen massacre in which hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pro-democracy protesters were killed.<br><br>Zhao Ziyang died in Beijing in January but his political ghost still haunts the party's leaders.<br><br>A source close to Zhao's family said the authorities were determined to prevent publication of books that would contain the interviews -- conducted secretly by close associate Zong Fengming over 15 years while Zhao lived under house arrest -- because the interviews could be seen to undermine the legitimacy of the current leadership.<br><br>"It was a set-up. When they handed him the books, they arrested him immediately. They arranged to meet him to pass him the books," Lau said, referring to purported draft copies.<br><br>The Straits Times' publisher, Singapore Press Holdings Ltd., said Ching was assisting security authorities in Beijing with an investigation into a matter not related to the newspaper, which is indirectly linked to the Singapore government.<br><br>China-born Ching has been working for The Straits Times since 1996 and is the paper's chief China correspondent.<br><br>He quit as Beijing bureau chief of Hong Kong's leftist Wen Wei Po newspaper in 1989 in protest against the army crushing the student-led demonstrations in and around Tiananmen Square.<br><br>The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said recently China had the most journalists in prison of any country.<br><br>Hong Kong, a former British colony, reverted to Chinese rule in 1997 but was promised a high degree of autonomy, including freedom of the press. Nevertheless, Hong Kong journalist Xi Yang was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1994 for stealing secrets. He was paroled three years later.</div>
