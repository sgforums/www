With more living older, more ex-offenders remain in singapre, cumulated. Also incapable of leaving are those who do not have the adaptation ability to live overseas. Those who have no marketable values. Those who are ill, sick, disabled, married and cannot bear to leave friends and family. Those who think and believe that a person born in place A has to only live in place A for whole life.  Those who do not believe in Migration.<br><br>So, will the racial fabric change color?<br><br>Some from the internet squad also encourage those forummers who gave dissentign voices to leave.

They are tasked to counter and 'explain' and persuade these to think in the same way as they do. The feel Dr Feel Good kind of way.  To these ghosts, everyone should act, think, believe the same.

            <div class='col-md body'>are these FT going to stay, are they integrating and growing with the society they have adopted or bringing their previous habits from their countries. Are these people providing and contributing to this "new home" or stripping the country bare like locust? If Bill Gates, Zhu Rong Ji, or quality foreigners come to singapore to grow with us and contribute, no local will make issue. However, what I guess the local feel is that more often we are getting a locusts invasion...</div>
