But as a PR here, or just a Employment pass holder, they still pay income tax, they spend money here with GST, just like everyone else. They take and they give. They earns the benefits as a PR, they also contribute to the society as a PR. Not like Singapore Govt give them free lunch and dont give singaporean free lunch.<br><br>To use your way of putting it:<br>As a kid(citizen) of your parent(Singapore), are you better than the neighbbour's kids(FT)? Do you contribute to your parent more than them? Beside the fact that you are your parents's kid(born in Singapore citizen), what other factors you think your parents should care about you only, and shut the door not letting any other kids in?<br><br>perhaps you misunderstood me, china and HK maybe brothers like you siad. But what i said is indians and ang mos in HK. They go there start business(fight with local HKer) work as top management or professionals(also fight with local HKer for job pos). HK govt didnot give them any advantage, also did not give HKer any advantage in the fight of business/job pos. It's a fair fight.<br><br>So how about singapore? Did sg govt offer advantage to FT that makes it not a fair fight?<br><br></div>

If you have been to China than you can understand why Singaporean will feel uneasy with them. They are too aggressive and they don't give a damn about you. We in Singapore have been brought up in a more genteel setting, pampered by our parents, fattened by the comforts of a stable home &amp; school environment. But the world have changed and we have been "invaded" by the world and it is very difficult to adjust.<br><br>I also wish we can stay the "old" Singapore but we can't so we need to accept that the floodgates ahs been opened and how to preserve our Singapore identity and sanity.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> </strong>[/b]</blockquote>Just don't allow them to bully you.  BTW, the lee hsien loong wants us to help them settle down here.  What does he know of the problems the commoners face from the PRCs.  Talk crap!

Now they are being wanted. They are in demand here. They are welcomed. They are greeted with open arms and legs and mouth (smile) to join as permanent member. Too early to tell. PRs also get same salary as citizen liao. My employment agents tell me confirmed. FTs are not cheaper by a bit. They are as cheap as you only. Just kidding lah.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  u get what i mean right.  I mean same same price lah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>2. Duties of citizen. Have they tried it? Not siong some say right? But its not so much siong or not siong but the dedication required. Dedication for 2 years. Can they afford this dedication? this is serious and real thing. Are they prepared for this that they never done before? Overseas , students 2 years ahead. Are they prepared to sacrifice like this?<br><br>3. Cost of Living. Its just the tip of the iceberg. Currently, our costs are ranked very high in the world liao. Future trend. What do you think?! Are they ready for this?  Medical, child education (competition will be stiff like dunno what), job security issue (FT vs local compete for same rice bowl in a small job market and business market), home ownership cost. High retirement age, min sum.<br><br>4. Nothing is Guaranteed. Prosperity depends a lot on USA. How glorious can USA continue to be? China and India keeps on growing despite recent asian stock tumble. No man lasts for eternity. Things will change in near future.<br>Are they ready for this? Sure?<br><br>5. So many locals kbkb about FT competition. Once they are member, are they ready for the same competition? Their children? What if their children got learning difficulty? physical difficulty? Who will take care of them in old age?<br><br>so many things to consider before cancelling their  motherland cert membership. Think hard hor.<br><br>just my points to help them consider before jumping onto the bandwagon.<br><br>so as not to be misunderstood I anti FT, I say this , I love all FT and welcome them with all limps open.<br><br>come baby come.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
