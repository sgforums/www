            <div class='col-md body'>MOE does not recognise son's O levels from NZ<br><br>Today<br>March 7, 2005<br><br>Letter from Craig Mcleod<br><br>The current dialogue on setbacks for Singaporeans in their own country ("The fading hope for a brother's return", March 2 and "Not wanted in Singapore", March 5-6) prompts me to respond with my own experience .<br><br>I am a New Zealander who has lived here for almost 25 years. My wife is Singaporean and we have four sons Â— all Singaporeans, with the option to choose New Zealand citizenship should they so desire.<br><br>My oldest child is almost 18 and is eligible for National Service (NS). For the past two years, he has studied for his O and A levels in New Zealand. I felt it was beneficial for him to gain some international experience and contacts. It was a tremendous boost to his self-esteem and independence.<br><br>However, I was told by the Ministry of Education (MOE) that in order for him to continue to study there, I would have to pay a $75,000 cash bond to the Government. As I have four sons, this would add up to a tidy sum over the next few years.<br><br>At a recent walk-about in Boon Lay, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made a stirring speech in which he encouraged foreign professionals to put down roots here, marry citizens, contribute to society and have children. He even mentioned NS.<br><br>As the only ang moh in the hall Â— and as I was standing up, filming the event for the People's Action Party Â— I felt as if he was addressing his comments to me directly and I was moved and encouraged by them.<br><br>I applied to the Speaker of the House and even wrote to Mr Lee directly to have the bond requirement waived, but all I received in response was a regurgitation of the law.<br><br>In my case, I cannot see the benefit of this law.<br><br>My sons have the option of leaving Singapore forever Â— which is in nobody's interest Â— or plunging their father further into debt to fund their studies overseas.<br><br>So my 18-year-old decided to return to Singapore and give up the New Zealand side of his education.<br><br>I was further advised by the ministry that his years in New Zealand do not count in Singapore and that he would have to begin his O levels again should he wish to continue his education here.<br><br>The message this policy sends out to me, and to many others like me with children of dual nationality, appears to contradict Mr Lee's message.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My question is that why don't S'pore recognize an O level cert frm a fellow British commonwealth member? If that's the rule how about those S'poreans who were born in the UK? If they move back here, will their O Levels cert not be recognized by the MOE as well?<br><br>Such rules are absolutely unbelievable.<br><br>I think the son and the father were absolutely naive to believe the PAP will honour their words. As Singaporeans, we all know the PAP like to practise hypocrisy all the time. Don't even start talking to me about our 'world class' civil servants.</div>

So it really puzzled me on why he wanted his son to do NS. Most angmohs who have S'porean wives wudn't do it even for a million bucks.
