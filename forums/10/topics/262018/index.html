Overall, average monthly incomes have risen: from $3,076 in 1990 to $4,943 in 2000. But incomes at the top rose, while incomes at the bottom declined. In 2000, incomes for the top 10 per cent of resident households grew 8.8 per cent, while incomes for the bottom 10 per cent of wage-earning households shrank 13.6 per cent. This shrinkage would have been even greater - 54.1 per cent - if households with no wage earners had been included. The Gini coefficient - which measures income disparity in a society - hovered around 0.44 in the 1990s, but expanded to 0.481 in 2000, showing a rising income gap."<br>- Chua Mui Hoong, political columnist, Straits Times, Aug 4, 2003<br><br>"If we want to have successful entrepreneurs, Singaporeans have to accept a greater income disparity between the successful and the not so successful."<br>- SM Lee Kuan Yew, Ho Rih Hwa public lecture, Feb 5, 2002<br><br>Choose PAP and Singapore still weaker 11 Dec 05<br><br>During elections:<br><br>"Choose wrongly, and Singapore will be weaker. People will start writing new reports about us, about how, after all, we are just a flash in the pan."<br>- DPM Lee Hsien Loong, Straits Times, Oct 22, 2001<br><br>After elections:<br><br>"Singapore is Asia's weakest economy: Barclays." - AFP, Jun 18, 2002<br>"Singapore among Asia's laggards as recession deepens." - Bloomberg, Jan 2 ,2002<br>"Glory of Singapore fades into the past." - Age, Melbourne, Jan 24 ,2002<br>"Singapore is trying to halt slippage." - New York Times, Apr 30, 2002<br>"In Singapore: Government squanders savings." - New Zealand Herald, May 18, 2002<br>"Economic doubts dog Singapore." - Financial Times, Aug 27, 2002<br>"Singapore faces jobless surge." - BBC, Sept 13, 2002<br>"Singapore concedes economy weakening, delays pension repairs." - AFP, Nov 17, 2002<br>"Whither Singapore Inc?" - Economist, Nov 28, 2002<br>"Singapore economy to remain sluggish" - Financial Times, Jan 3, 2003<br>"Singapore economy stagnates, recession risks loom." - Reuters, Apr 10, 2003<br>"Bad debts up as Singapore falters." - Reuters, Jul 31, 2003<br><br>First we lead, then we follow 8 Nov 05<br><br>During elections:<br><br>"You look at all the countries around us...Currencies collapsed, property prices ces collapsed, unemployment, economies slowing down, riots, clashes between people. Singapore did not go through that mangle. Why? Because in Singapore, we had a competent government in charge, anticipating events."<br>- SM Lee Kuan Yew on the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, Straits Times, Nov 1 2003<br><br>After elections:<br><br>"In a global economy, we are not trendsetters. We follow what others do."<br>- Minister and labour chief Lim Boon Heng, Straits Times, Jul 2003<br><br>"Data released by the Ministry of Manpower last week was by far the bleakest to date. Eight straight quarters of job losses and a staggering 24,800 jobs wiped out over the April to June period - more in a single quarter than in all of 1998, the peak of Asia's infamous financial crisis."<br>- The Edge, Aug 4, 2003<br><br>"Singaporeans are also the most pessimistic about their future income. In the Asia-Pacific region, only the Japanese are less confident than Singaporeans about the outlook for regular income. These are among the findings of MasterCard International's latest biannual survey of consumer confidence in 13 markets around the region."<br>- The Edge, Aug 4, 2003<br><br>Unite behind PAP for a secure future and a better life? Yeah right...<br>17 Oct 05<br><br>During elections:<br><br>"A people united - Secure Future, Better Life."<br>- PAP election manifesto<br><br>"Vote for my PAP team. a people united behind a good government is your best guarantee of a secure future and a better life."<br>- PM Goh Chok Tong, Straits Times, Oct 28, 2001<br><br>After elections:<br><br>"Bankruptcy cases at 17 year high."<br>- Straits Times, Jan 8, 2003<br><br>"Family violence on the rise, and counselors attribute it to the stress of job losses due to the economic downturn."<br>- Straits Times, Jan 28, 2002<br><br>"During the Asian Financial Crisis, 27,000 jobs were lost. That year the number of marital splits jumped by 16 per cent to 5,651. Last year a record number of 5,825 marriages ended in divorces and annulments - up sharply from 2,111 cases in 1982."<br>- Straits Times, Jun 8, 2003<br><br>"Hit by slowdown, young working adults are vulnerable to suicidal thoughts. More are calling SOS hotline for help...there were 361 suicides last year, nearly 17% more than 1999."<br>- Straits Times, June 15, 2003<br><br>Goh shows more understanding our concerns 27 Sep 05<br><br>During elections:<br><br>"Will you keep your job? Can your families cope with school expenses, medical bills, rent and utilities charges? I understand your worries."<br>- PM Goh Chok Tong, Straits Times, Oct 28, 2001 (A week earlier, Goh had said he understood our Â“concerns.Â” See posting on 19 Jul 2005 below. Concerns and worries come thick and fast before elections to the PAP; what happens after elections is another matter.)<br><br>After elections:<br><br>"A growing number of Singapore children are not being sent to school because their cash-strapped parents claim they cannot afford to pay for education. Ministry figures show 1921 children did not register for Primary 1 classes in 1999, up 244 on 1997 figures. "<br>- Reuters, Mar 3, 2002<br><br>"More parents seeking help to pay school fees."<br>- Straits Times Jun 17, 2002<br><br>"About 10,000 students received financial help from the Ministry of Education in the first six months of this year, almost three times that for the whole of 1999. The Starits Times School Pocket Money Fund, which gives students $30 or $50 a month, is also helping 2,000 more students this year, nearly 40 per cent more than last year's 5,500."<br>- Straits Times, Aug 11, 2003<br><br>"Thousands can't pay utility bills, many face power cut."<br>- Straits Times, Apr 12, 2003<br><br>"Desperation is forcing some people to ask for personal loans on the internet ... they are asking strangers for anything between $500 and $30,000."<br>- Straits Times, Apr 14, 2002<br><br>Jobs, Jobs, Jobs? 23 Aug 05<br><br>During elections:<br><br>"SDP's plan 'causes higher unemployment.'"<br>- George Yeo in Straits Times, Oct 29, 2001<br><br>"Top task for PM - to save and create jobs.

If you don't want a Pay and Pay government, better don't vote for the opposition. Vote for the PAP."<br>- DPM Lee Hsien Loong rebutting opposition's economic proposals, Straits Times, Oct 29 2001<br><br>After elections:<br>"This is the medicine, take it."<br>- DPM Lee Hsien Loong on the GST hike, CNA, May 15, 2002<br><br>Goh wanted alternatives? 26 Jun 05<br><br>During elections:<br>Â“I would want to form an alternative policies group in Parliament, comprising 20 PAP MPs. These 20 PAP MPs will be free to vote in accordance with what they think of a particular policy. In other words, the whip for them will be lifted. This is not playing politics, this is something which I think is worthwhile doing."<br>- PM Goh Chok Tong, Straits Times, Nov 3, 2001<br><br>After elections:<br>"If you sing Jailhouse Rock with your electric guitar when others are playing Beethoven, you are out of order. The whip must be used on you."<br>- PM Goh Chok Tong in report "Not in people's interest to lift whip", Straits Times, Apr 6, 2002<br></div>

In this respect, Singapore scores very highly because of the way our govt websites are designed.<br><br>Take for example the CPF website, it educates the citizen on how to plan for retirement. Very user friendly.<br><br>However, what percentage of the population is really tech savvy? How about the electrical appliances delivery man? Or the uncle who makes kopi in the coffeeshop? Bus drivers? Factory workers?<br><br>The report mentions that 79% of Singaporeans agree that customer service in civil service has improved over the past 3 years?<br><br>What's the sample size? (no. of people interviewed)<br>Profile of these people in general?<br><br>Have they also gauged the telephone etiquette of these stat boards? Beuracracy in government organisations factored in?<br><br>I see none of the above just mentioned.<br><br>I give this report a 5.5/10. Overall a flawed report that began with flawed criteria.</div>
