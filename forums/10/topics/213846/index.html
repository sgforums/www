The magazine also quoted Chee attacking the Lees.<br><br>Restall said Chee never said he thought any particular member of the Singaporean government was corrupt.<br><br>"He never said that and I certainly didn't write that, and I don't believe that," Restall said. "I think it's just ridiculous to read the article in that way. It's preposterous."<br><br>TOUGH STANCE<br><br>Singapore has for decades taken a tough stance on foreign media when they report on local politics. International media organisations have been banned, slapped with defamation suits or seen their circulations restricted when they published articles deemed offensive by the government.<br><br>The suit is the latest in a series brought by Singapore's leaders against foreign media and opposition politicians.<br><br>The Review celebrates its 60th anniversary this year and on Friday unveiled a new "Barometer of Asian Development", scoring 12 countries in the region over the past five years on a variety of data such as education, human mobility, capital access, creative rights, gender equality and labour flexibility.<br><br>China and Thailand were tied at the top, with Singapore a close second.<br><br>"We're trying to be very fair to Singapore, and I think the index reflects that we are not seeking to criticise them unfairly or trying to only emphasise the negative," Restall said.<br><br>Paul Gigot, editor of the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, which with Review Publishing is owned by Dow Jones &amp; Co., said the government's decision to ban the Review last month did a disservice to Singaporeans.<br><br>"We really regret that decision," he said.<br><br>The government said it banned the sale of FEER, which has about 1,000 subscribers there, because it failed to comply with its press regulations.<br><br>Singapore's leaders have won damages in the past from media groups, including the Economist, the International Herald Tribune, Bloomberg, and FinanceAsia -- as well as the Far Eastern Economic Review when it was published as a weekly news magazine.<br><br>In November 1989, a Singapore court found FEER guilty of libelling then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and ordered it to pay S$230,000 in damages.<br><br>At the time, Justice L.P. Thean said Lee was entitled to aggravated damages against the magazine, owned by Dow Jones &amp; Co., because of "express malice" by the defendants and the conduct of their lawyer Geoffrey Robertson during the trial.<br><br>The case stemmed from an article published in 1987 dealing with the arrests that year of 22 people, mostly lay church workers, for alleged involvement in a Marxist plot to subvert the government.<br><br>Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders, which ranks Singapore 140th out of 167 countries for press freedom, slammed the government's decision in August to issue restrictions on five foreign publications, including FEER.<br><br>The government ordered Time, Newsweek, the Financial Times and the International Herald Tribune to post bonds of S$200,000 and appoint representatives in Singapore. </blockquote>I wonder how long they will last... and lose.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

The magazine's editor said on Friday the publication would vigorously contest the suit in court.<br><br>Following are some libel suits filed in Singapore courts:<br><br>1985: Asian Wall Street Journal apologises and pays fines after Singapore files contempt-of-court charges over a newspaper editorial on the treatment of an opposition politician.<br><br>1989: Singapore court awards then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew thousands of dollars in damages after he sues the Far Eastern Economic Review for libel.<br><br>1994-95: International Herald Tribune is sued for an article by a visiting U.S. academic critical of oppressive Asian regimes. Without mentioning any country, the article referred to governments "relying on compliant judiciary to bankrupt opposition politicians". Arguing that the article could only refer to Singapore, the Attorney-General cited 11 cases where government politicians sued opposition figures successfully.<br><br>1997: PAP leaders, including then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, file a total of 13 lawsuits against Tang Liang Hong of the Workers' Party, for comments made during an election campaign. Tang flees the country and PAP leaders win a record S$8 million in damages, later reduced.<br><br>1997: J.B.

It will probably be a closed-door affair.  There have been many instances where the court will find a way to dismiss or render irrelevant any evidence that bolster the case of anyone who dares to face the SG leaders in court.<br><br>I doubt it will be any different this time around, especially since the FEER article challenges the govt-controlled media's public portrayal of Chee as a misguided lunatic.</div>
