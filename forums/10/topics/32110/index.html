            <div class='col-md body'>All the issues that we have been arguing about all tie in indirectly with the SAF.  The airspace issue (RSAF), the CIQ (Singapore's boundary), the Water issue (Singapore's National Interest), and the Lighthouse, (Singapore's control over surrounding waterways)<br><br>It seems that the Malaysians are testing Singapore's resolve to resort to military deterrence by pressing on these issues.   They are probing into water, to see how deep the SAF runs.  And recently, they have "Requested" or rather is taunting the SAF to move.<br><br>They hope to trigger any military response from the SAF, in order to observe and in future hopefully deal with.  They feel they have nothing to lose at the moment since any response from the SAF would violate their "national sovereignty" and earn Singapore condemnation from the international community.<br><br>If Singapore could, the SAF should be holding large scale exercises on home soil to flex its military muscles to show that it has the resolve.  Yet due to the land and space constraint, it cannot do that.  Large scale exercises tend to offer some combat experience, instill confidence, and raise morale.<br><br>A foreseeable move by the MAF would be likewise.  They may do what the SAF cannot.  They may hold large scale exercises to intimidate the SAF, and try to nullify Singapore's Military deterrence.  At the same time, they would attempt to impose their political will, on Singapore.  Succeeding in that, would indirectly imply that Malaysia IS S.E.A's regional leader.<br><br>WHY:  The Malaysian Govt is fearful.  Not to mention sick and tired of being 2nd best.  They feel out of control of regional politics and now seek to correct that.  The time is right, regional countries including Singapore are slowly recovering from the economic downturn.  Recovering but no doubt still hurt.  They should have acted earlier, but perhaps they couldn't.  In anycase, their time is now.<br><br>It seems that the top of their agenda is creating a submissive and manageable Singapore.  And their first attempt is taming Singapore's lion, the SAF.  Without a  doubt, they are hunting the SAF, attempting to corner it, and hopefully tame it by demoralising it, and starving it of public confidence.  It is a dangerous game, taunting lions.  They had better be prepared to kill the lion should they fail.</div>

Hahaha.... please leh, those stupid malaysian politician knew  nothing and then they start barking for nothing.... their army got no committment at all and even go to the extend of selling their guns to robber.

            <div class='col-md body'>jus relax lah bros........<br><br>I dun really see the situation as a war is coming , but seeing it as their election is comiing... U will to realise every time their govt needed support from their pple , they will resort to such dirty tricks , scandal or propaganda ( if u like calling it ).<br><br>If Singapore will to reply or react , maybe by senting more warships to the island ( as we have the capacity to do so) , or flexing too much of our military might in public , we are doing wat malaysia want us to do. They want us to agitate the malaysian pple , so they the malaysian pple are inline with the govt on the water , land reclamation....blah blah topic.<br><br>Actually , we need not flex our muscle in public , it will agitate the malaysians , however if the malaysian's intell is running well , they should know how well SAF can perform.<br><br>We should keep cool , as there is a time for us to hunt them down one by one , there is a time where we have the chance to flex our muscle in public, but i dun view it as now , unless they wanna do some stupid acts along the border ........then we got to do wat we are train to do for 35 yrs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
