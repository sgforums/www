            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>well there is this website talk bout the types of ppl thinks about 9-11<br><br>http://www.geobop.com/Symbols/911/<br><br>i'll quote some of it:<br><br>"The picture is divided into four Â“windows,Â” a reminder that people have different views of September 11. The lower left window is shuttered, representing people who donÂ’t want to see the truth. The four sections also represent the four commercial airliners that were hijacked on September 11."<br><br>"9/11Â” is an abbreviation for September 11. ItÂ’s also similar to 911, the telephone number Americans call in emergencies. Thus, itÂ’s a symbol of danger.<br><br>Â“?3Â” represents United Airlines Flight 93, which in turn represents the countless unsolved mysteries of the Attack on America. The red stripes represent the Â“red tapeÂ” and government secrecy that makes it hard to learn the truth, as well as the people who are being held in prisonÂ—often unconstitutionally and on flimsy charges. Finally, itÂ’s symbolic of the loss of AmericansÂ’ civil liberties.<br><br>The pyramid and Â“all-seeing eye,Â” taken from the Great Seal of the United States, are the source of many conspiracy theories. Thus, itÂ’s a reminder of the amazing conspiracy theories that have evolved around September 11. The Pyramid is also a reminder of the Middle East (though theyÂ’re actually located in Egypt, in North Africa) and the Muslim nations that are so strongly associated with terrorism.<br><br>At the same time, the pyramid is a reminder of the close ties between the United States and the Middle East, mostly revolving around oil. It further recalls that President George W. Bush is a business partner with Osama bin LadenÂ’s family.<br><br>The motto Â“In God We TrustÂ” features a dollar sign, reminding us of the religious and corporate symbolism that is sometimes hard to separate from September 11. E pluribus unum is the United StatesÂ’ original national motto and one of our grandest symbols. It means Â“one out of many,Â” suggesting one nation composed of different cultures. But the question mark (not a part of the actual motto) is a reminder of the divisions that still plague the U.S., from racism to a government that sometimes seems to be at war with its citizens."<br><br>"How September 11 Symbols Were Created<br><br>In general, the evolution of September 11 symbols began with the events of that memorable day. Some symbols were created almost instantly, forged in the minds and hearts of people who observed the terrorist attacks on television. Others were modified or created by propaganda, frequently supported with patriotic or religious rituals. Eventually, some of these symbols may be given official status by being signed into law. Some symbols had symbolic status even before September 11, which simply changed the way people think about them.<br><br>1. a) Before 9/11 &gt; The World Trade Center (WTC) is a symbol of AmericaÂ’s wealth and power.<br>1. b) Before 9/11 &gt; Some see the WTC as a symbol of arrogance &amp; corporate greed, spelled Wall Street.<br>2. 9/11 Events &gt; The World Trade Center instantly becomes a symbol of terror, vulnerability and hate.<br>3. a) Propaganda &gt; The government promotes the WTC as a symbol of righteousness and heroism.<br>3. b) Propaganda &gt; Some citizens promote the WTC as a symbol of AmericaÂ’s folly.<br>4. Rituals &gt; President George W. Bush leads the nation in praying for the WTCÂ’s dead.<br>5. Later Events &gt; An astounding corporate crime wave reinforces Wall StreetÂ’s image as evil.<br>6. Laws &gt; President George W. Bush issued a proclamation designating September 11, 2002 Patriot Day.<br>In general, the governmentÂ’s view has prevailedÂ—at least in the media. But some people have different attitudes towards the World Trade Center. Some of these people are actively fighting the governmentÂ’s efforts to influence people. Other people havenÂ’t yet made up their minds.<br><br>An Emotional Tug of War<br><br>Propaganda and manipulation (as in patriotic rituals) are what people need to be aware of. Powerful people have long been fighting a titanic battle for AmericansÂ’ hearts and minds. Their weapons are propaganda and manipulation, both of which often unite in symbols. They tell people what they should think and how they should feel about America, then pressure them to demonstrate their loyalty through patriotic and religious rituals. When people participate in these rituals, many people think, Â“It looks like everyone else supports these people, so I should, too!Â”<br><br>Who are these people, and why do they care about what you think about September 11? What should you think about September 11?<br><br>Different Perspectives<br><br>Before you decide what to think about the Attack on America, you should try to understand the big picture. That means studying events and people and pondering other points of view. Remember: September 11 affected the entire world, with some nations suffering more than the United States.<br><br>People have many different ideas about September 11, but most can probably be grouped into three main views:<br><br>Most Conservatives (especially<br>Republicans), Corporations &amp; Many<br>Liberals (especially Democrats)<br>Many Liberals &amp; Independents, Some Conservatives (mostly Libertarians)<br>&amp; Citizens of Other Nations<br><br>1. We were innocent victims of evil and irrational terrorists who hated us because they were jealous of AmericaÂ’s wealth, power and democratic institutions. 2. We were attacked by people who were angered by the United StatesÂ’ disgusting foreign relations and its mistreatment and exploitation of other nations.<br>Many Liberals &amp; Independents, Some Conservatives<br>(mostly Libertarians) &amp; Citizens of Other Nations<br><br>3. Our own government played a role in the terrorist attacksÂ—either letting them happen or possibly even helping plan themÂ—for one or more of the reasons below:<br>a) The government wanted an excuse to attack Afghanistan, which offers access to Central Asian oil fields.<br><br>b) The government wanted an excuse to spy on U.S. citizens and strip them of their civil liberties, thereby empowering the government.<br><br>c) The government wanted to boost President BushÂ’s sagging popularity by encouraging frightened citizens to rally behind him.<br><br>d) Corporations wanted an excuse to get billions of dollars from the government.<br><br>All of these groups are fighting to make their voices heard. They want Americans to view symbols of September 11 they way they do. Though American conservatives and corporate officials are greatly outnumbered, they have a lot of power. For example, President George W. Bush (a conservative Republican) is President of the United States, and corporations (which support conservatives even more than they do Democrats) own most of the media. At the same time, many Americans have been stunned by the corruption and cowardice among Democrats, most of whom have refused to challenge Republicans and often support them.<br><br>Conservatives and corporations can also pressure people and governments of other nations to accept their views by threatening or bribing them. Thus, Republicans and Big Business have largely determined how Americans view September 11 and the symbols that represent it.<br><br>Many conservatives say itÂ’s unpatriotic, or un-American, to criticize the government, suggest that it might have played a role in the Attack on America, or even to simply ask embarrassing questions. In fact, their attitude is unpatriotic and un-American. People who care about their countryÂ—or the worldÂ—should always pursue the truth. And government officials who are reluctant to answer tough questions, or who call people who ask those questions traitors, are the real traitors.<br><br>When people act like this, we should ask, Â“What are they trying to hide? What are they afraid of? Why should we vote for government officials who arenÂ’t even honest with the people they represent?Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, duotiga83, there have been many views on Sept 11 and I think we should respect all views.  There are many ways to interpret Sept 11.  Some people might even see Sept 11 as the spark which got US thinking more about such newer forms of warfare rather than the conventional large scale military invasions or the massive missile strikes which the US is trying to protect itself against.<br><br>Sept 11 involves alot of people and their feelings and all are entitled to their own feelings.  If certain people want to believe things as it is, then I aam of the opinion it is their right to do so.<br><br>Whether one finds out the truth or not is really not essential in such a case unless you are working to prevent such future attacks.  Some people would rather leave all such incidents to the government and the different government services.<br><br>Regarding your comments on how the US govt tried to influence views of people by leading them in rituals and declaring Patriot Day, I only have to say that it seems the right thing to me.  The US prays for them as a collective group so as to be able to support each other.  If they do not want to participate, then so be it.<br><br>Sometimes, we view the US govt as all powerful and invulnerable, the attacks drive home he point that this is not so.  Perhaps it is because of our original view of the US govt that we have treated any hint of US govt knowing about Sept 11 attacks before hand with uproar.<br><br>I too think it is un-American to criticise for Americans to criticise the American govt at this point in time.<br><br>Hindsight is a powerful tool.  When we look back on events, we see little clues that we have ot seen before leading up to the big event.<br><br>Perhaps a more appropriate time to criticise would be when the US has matured in its fight against the terrorists.  As it is, the US is trying to garner the support of the international community, what sort of suuport can it expect from the world if its citizens do not support it....<br><br>Once again, i respect your vies and opinions on the Sept 11 issue, these are just mine, its a bit messy 'cos i was damn tired when typing and half awake.... but that basically my stand on the issue...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NathanG5<br><br>Hey, fellow recce trooper. You are the first one I met in this forum so far. Hang in there. Does your batch still do "power" PT while on course? My batch was the last 2 batch when the commander and men train together. What about yours? From what I know the current batch of recce troopers train separately. Commanders first and then the men even though on exercise it is usually full participation. Not really a good idea to train separately as this will not foster the espirt de corps among them. What do you think?<br><br>Well, after a few years, I still miss my bike and carbine. If you been to cresendo, the bikes there are lousy. Anyway, nice to know another recce trooper in here. Do your best. Remember recce elements are the on the ground eyes and ears of any army units.<br><br>Sorry to other readers for this non-related post.</div>

I received this from someone and I thought it appropriate for the times.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Moderator, hOtSpOtTeRs.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The Words of William Shakespeare:<br><br>"Beware the leader who bangs the drums of war in order to whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor, for patriotism is indeed a double-edged sword. It both emboldens the blood, just as it narrows the mind...<br><br>And when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with hate and the mind has closed, the leader will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry. Rather, the citizenry, infused with fear and blinded with patriotism, will offer up all of their rights unto the leader, and gladly so.<br><br>How do I know?<br><br>For this is what I have done.<br><br>And I am Caesar."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>A Conclusion<br><br>In memory of the many fathers, mothers, husbands, wives, sons, daughters, sisters, brothers, cousins, friends, grandfathers, grandmothers, grandsons, granddaughters, mentors, teachers, students, girlfriends, boyfriends, and good companions from almost every country, religion, and culture on the planet and the many brave souls who lost their lives trying to save them and who left us to contemplate the meaning of it all on September 11th, 2001... let me say this...<br><br>Let there be no more killing and violence in the name of profit, religion, political ideology, race or creed.<br><br>Let us understand that peace does not come from acts of violence.<br><br>Let us realize that the REAL enemy is the our own hearts and minds.<br><br>Let us reflect on the real CAUSES of all violence which produce the EFFECTS we see around us today.<br><br>Let us act in the spirit of of the Great Teachers who were incapable of violence toward another being.<br><br>Let us transcend the need to KEEP the peace by MAKING peace.<br><br>Let us all recall Mahatma Gandhi's words: 'An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind'.<br><br>Let us be inspired by the bravery and selflessness of all those who lost and continue to lose their sense of separateness when called by the need of others.<br><br>Let us take a lesson of love from the families of every nation who have lost loved ones yet reach out to communicate and share the spirit of love and understanding with the so-called 'enemy' thereby destroying the self-created illusion of separateness.<br><br>Let us rise above and see through the real motives and causes which lie behind the shrill war cries to sense the common thread that binds us.<br><br>Let us think, feel, speak and act with the power and strength which lives in the spirit of harmlessness and the awakened spirit.<br><br>Let us not sacrifice all freedoms and securities for the false safety of higher fences, bigger guns, better security systems, louder alarms, bigger jails, more surveillance, more . All these 'security measures' are nothing more than instruments of violence in themselves and will never ever bring real security. Violence begets more violence. Peace begets security.<br><br>Let us not forget ALL the lives lost in the fires of hate, in the interests of profit, in the desire for hegemony, in the passion of revenge, to keep the status quo, and for whatever reason we justify for waging our 'righteous wars'.<br><br>Let us...turn off the TV...and wake up from our slumber.<br><br>And...let us re-direct the trillions of dollars spent on security and world war machines and apply it to making peace, reaching out, healing, and planting the seeds of hope not fear.</div>
