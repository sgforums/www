We were at a Labour Day weekend event and he was munching on a hot dog. He suggested I choose four people, firefighters or police officers, and tell their stories. I guess I had disappointment written all over my face, because the former official - in office back when the World Trade Center collapsed - looked down, paused for a moment, and then said: 'Write that the government let us down.'<br><br>Then he could not be stopped. He started with the first bombing of the World Trade Center back in 1993 and what was learnt about Al-Qaeda and terrorism then.<br><br>He went on to the bombing of the United States Navy warship, the Cole, in the harbour at Aden, Yemen, and how that was for sure an Al-Qaeda operation. He did not mention the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, a residence for American servicemen, but he did mention the bombing of two American embassies in Africa. Those cost 224 lives.<br><br>It has been almost a year since Sept 11, but still the anger was in his voice. The government should have known something was coming, he said. The government should have done something.<br><br>'I lost a lot of good men,' he said. 'The best men we had.'<br><br>Not a day goes by when I do not think of Sept 11.

He and his political party .. not the nation of Iraq. Its the leader who is the problem. So solution is to get rid of the leader.

Definitely that is the truth for most Singaporeans like you and me. What you see here is just a small part of the big picture. We choose to talk about military affairs here simply because most of us have an interest in it. Please do not misinterpret it as celebrating the Government throwing money on white elephants. I've said in my other post, our defence budget does not take up a large percentage of our GDP. The Government has to strike a balance between being ready for war and being a developed nation. Somehow I think the 2 doesn't go hand in hand to you. If the Government cuts its defence expenditure significantly, it effectively means we are choking our military. Who will defend us then? Will it be better to anyone if Malaysia or Indonesia gains possesion of our land?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that we have to look past "colonializm" as a pure military concept. True, in the past, our masters had to resort to armies to conquer. Nowadays, its a different ball game.<br><br>Dr M is not afraid of being invaded. He is afraid of his people totally dependant on foreign companies for jobs. That is the true strength of your own nation. When you can depend on your homegrown companies.<br><br>Taiwan, South Korea, Japan are countries that have thrown off the yoke of the new colonist. Sadly, Singapore is totally dependant on FDI to survive. If we were to be cut off from FDI, we will suffer. Same goes for Malaysia. They will sink if FDI is gone.<br><br>So my concept is Why spend on military stuff at the expense of the economy? With so many people out of work , is it wise to beef up the military? Or to create jobs for Singaporeans?<br><br>I feel that the government has lost its direction. Case in point is allowing SingTel to buy Optus.

            <div class='col-md body'>Kenhor<br><br>The reason for singapore's consistent spending on defense is so that rogue nations catching us with our pants down is minimised. True that the govt need to create jobs, but on the other hand she also need to ensure that there is firstly a country, a nation and a home to do that. There must never be a time for us to become complacent. Should that happen, it will be a kuwait scenario in SE Asia.<br><br>There could be hidden reason in buying Optus and it is not appropariate to discuss this here.<br><br>A strong military now will not remain unchallenged if a country armed forces does not upgrade her equipment. Imagine a scenario,  if a war should break out in the distant future. Based on your argument, our army could be using antique weapons fighting the agressor who might be armed with the latest technology, very much like as archer armed with a bow and arrows against a rifleman with a modern rifle. Don't you think by that time, it will be too late to lament why we did not procure new equipment.<br><br>Judging from the current status of our northern and southern "neighbours". Do you think they are not eyeing us. If we did not have this weapons, do you think you and I will still be here discussing about this issue? Think about it.<br><br>Also without a strong military, singapore will never be a stable and safe country for foreign investments. And without this foreign investments, how can we improve our economy? With new weapons and technology, we can make use of these and opened new areas of research and production and that too does aid the economy in a way, don't you agree?<br><br>To summarise, beefing up our army and the economy are interlinked. One can't do without the other.<br><br></div>
