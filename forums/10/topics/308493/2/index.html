              <p>for housing, isn't it typical for an average joe to take 20-25 years to pay off, regardless of where you live? i am not sure when you mention `donkey years', how many years is that. unless one is rich, this is a typical life cycle one goes through. my parents slough for most of their lives to pay off their house too, in addition to raising their children.</p>
              <p>as for cars, cost aside, most will also take 3-7 years to pay the car off for an average joe. typically, one will change their cars at least 3-5 times in their lifetime. technology upgrade, car safety and exterior look are main reasons for the change. i am on my 7th car already (call me stupid, but that is another discussion all together). whether your car(s) can be owned in perpetuity or 10 years is a moot point for reasons i listed prior. most will change their cars. even if you can own your car in perpetuity, they is no value in your car, unless it is a classic. let's use everyone's favourite comparison, australia. if you own a 15year old toyota camry,  i am not sure what is the market price there, but you can check on the carsales.au site easily, it will probably sell for AU$6k.</p>

              <p>Hi bro,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I apologize for not making my point clear. Because cars in Singapore is expensive 50-60k (my facts may be wrong) and it lasts 10 years after which you get scrap value back.... there's not much room for additional repayments to the Avg Joe's mortgage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So alot of SGs are basically using their CPF to finance their loan (but the interest rate is low which is why many do it i believe) minimally and it takes ages to pay off (25 years is a long time in my opinion) their HDB.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And all these are leases. You own the lease. After which your kids take up their own leases and the cycle goes on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Freehold/999 is very hard (expensive) for new couples to break into without help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the rich (with freehold) passes on their freehold to their kids and HDB owners pass on a lease which is going to be used up .... one of the reasons why i think the rich get richer and the poor gets poorer.</p>

              <p>True that. But that's fair cause its still 5% bro.</p>

              <p>However the fact that average Joe's are likely to purchase HDB/99 year lease within their means they actually contribute less to the next generation which isn't the case for freehold/999.</p>

              <p>5% is actually a more conservative estimate... When the economy is better, it could be more... Not to mention that the rich will most probably not need to touch those money, so they can be safely used for investing., whereas the average Joe would not dare to invest as much.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I apologize for not making my point clear. Because cars in Singapore is expensive 50-60k (my facts may be wrong) and it lasts 10 years after which you get scrap value back.... there's not much room for additional repayments to the Avg Joe's mortgage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So alot of SGs are basically using their CPF to finance their loan (but the interest rate is low which is why many do it i believe) minimally and it takes ages to pay off (25 years is a long time in my opinion) their HDB.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And all these are leases. You own the lease. After which your kids take up their own leases and the cycle goes on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Freehold/999 is very hard (expensive) for new couples to break into without help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the rich (with freehold) passes on their freehold to their kids and HDB owners pass on a lease which is going to be used up .... one of the reasons why i think the rich get richer and the poor gets poorer.</p>

              <p>thanks for clarifying.</p>
              <p>there is the average joe who earns quite a fair bit (say up to S$6k/month) and the average joe who is really `average in his wages' (S$2-3k). the upper a-joe if he lives in a hdb flat, can let his CPF takes care of the repayment. technically, his disposable income is not affected as his CPF can take care of the payment, more so if mrs average joe chips in with the flat repayment. hence, he is left with his only other big ticket item, which is the car. in the singapore context, this average joe should be able to afford his car, i supposed an `average joe car like an altis'. </p>
              <p>the rich getting richer is a conventional norm we accept as truth. maybe there is some truth in it. luckily, god is fair, things can go both ways. the rich, if they are not careful, can also be a pauper. just as the less-rich working their way up.</p>
              <p>imo, the universal truth is 20% of the population probably control 80% of the wealth in a country, australia no exception. why single singapore out?</p>

              <p>Seldom will people think that there's too much money. It's something inherent in most of us. The thing is, if you tax them to the point where the risks are no longer worth taking, they can easily just pack up and move to another country where the tax might be lower and the risks more worthwhile. The influence could be rather significant, and is especially so for the heavily foreign talent based Singapore. The balance is indeed delicate.</p>

              <p>fair point, but the reality we are in is, has the government let any of the hdb lease lapse? property price swing aside; typically, at the 25-30 years level, the government will exercise its redevelopment program in these estates. look at toa payoh, queenstown, AMK or one of the older estates. I have not seen or read that the `owners' of these flats gotten back a fraction of what they paid for or left homeless because of the lease expiring. The government always acquire these flats back for redevelopment, apparently at market price. if your flats are 25-30 years old, chances are you will still make a tidy sum of the flats because if you purchase the flat new 30 years ago, it will probably cost a fraction of what you paid for.</p>
              <p>there is also a political motive to this. PAP's will not let this be a political issue. when it made its commitment of home ownership to the majority of singaporeans in its early days. they will need to keep to this promise, by hook or by crook. this is a huge factor that could capitulate the PAP if they overlook the home ownership matter.</p>
              <p>your illustration is a theoratical exercise. it makes sense in isolation but the reality is there are socio-political factors that comes into play that will alter the entire premise of what you said.  </p>

              <p>I'm not sure if any of the HDB leases have expired and the lease taken back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if none has occured whats the point in maing it a 99 year lease then? ....why not make it freehold or 999?</p>

              <p>Singapore how old only? HDB how long only? how can any 99 year lease expire?</p>
              <p>Lease hold or freehold all Britist system, finally the land belong to the government. and at the expiry of the lease, the government has the right to take back. Usually places around same areas are same leasehold. Now mostly only 99 yrs cause government need redevelopment.</p>
              <p>Farrer Court, Braddell Heights, and the other one along Alexandra Road, all were HUDC flats, 99 years only. Then sold en bloc, owners all laughing to the bank.</p>
              <p>Your hypothetical calculation also wrong lah, "But I have got (99-70)/99 x $10 = $2.93 .... I have lost $7 bcos my parents bought a godam lease."</p>
              <p>99 years lease is for 2 generations, if you can fully pay up in your lifetime, your son just need to pay the maintenance fee, what happen after that you think you can see from the grave huh?</p>

              <p>Yar I'll agree that 99 year lease should last 2 generations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But that means there is a depreciation factor lor <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"> Haiz</p>

              <p>Depends on your petrol tank... Let's say for a 1800cc car with 40 litres petrol tank (Toyota Corolla Altis)</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.simetric.co.uk/si_liquids.htm">http://www.simetric.co.uk/si_liquids.htm</a></p>
              <p>Density of petrol is 737.22 kg per cubic metre, which works out to 0.73722g/cm3</p>
              <p>half tank is 20 litres, which works out to 20000cm3, which works out to 14.744kg</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For other cars, the petrol tank might be even smaller...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, as already said in the first post of this page,</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Some calculations will tell you that the difference
                                          between half a tank and a full tank (assume 40 litres tank) will,
                                          on average, only affect less than 1% of fuel consumption</p>
