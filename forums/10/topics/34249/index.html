            <div class='col-md body'>He's too far gone... if Malaysia were to start interacting with Singapore on the bare terms of the law and start exercising even basic lawful ideas, it would entail such a radial reversal on all the nonsense they have thrown out that it would certainly spell doom for the political carrier of anybody who starts the ball rolling. That's why they contuine to lash out like the one-eye blind, insane and shot up tigers they are because they know as long as they keep blaring out their grandose and threatening roars, their people will rally behind them, irregardless of logic.<br><br>This is the malaysian politican way. Years of failure to basically achieve or even live up to their self-exalted fantasies have made them all the more willing to give their hearts over and keep their "pride" to rethoric rather than act like barely rational and logical people. Lying repeatedly to themselves is the only way they can have any shred of self-esteem left, and they will go for it no matter how silly they may look. They have no pride to swallow, as a matter of fact, they have so little pride to hide their country behind they have to resort to these measures. What to do?</div>
