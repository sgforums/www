              <p>Let me help you soul_rage as i really cant quite bear to see
              seyKai take credit as the most capable dude around. Understand that
              GST is a final tax on all produced goods and services i.e. taxes
              are imposed on the <strong>final value of the good or service
              transacted</strong> wheres for VAT it is a tax that is being
              imposed on the value added between each stage of its production
              i.e. taxes are imposed on the <strong>additional value of the good
              generated after each stage of production</strong>. And bout their
              similarities VAT and GST are both indirect taxes which means that
              those paying the taxes are not the sole bearer of the tax as in
              this case producers who are being taxed can pass on the tax burden
              onto consumers in terms of price adjustments and the relative
              proportions of the burden depends on the various elasticities of
              demand and supply. Hope that you seyKai given your fantastic
              intellect can understand this, hope it helped =D</p>

              <p>Hi speakup</p>
              <p>Interesting. I looked upon VAT and GST as being an indirect tax due to the fact that you aren't paying it directly outright such as our income tax, but more so because through the goods and services you purchase, you pay them indirectly.</p>
              <p>As for VAT and GST, my understanding seems also different from yours, as in I see VAT more as a taxation tool for value-added product or service.</p>
              <p>Anyway, this is a more interesting discussion, than with people who do not have the capacity to read AND analyse. There are those who study dead books (wiki in this manner) and sprout dead information (not knowledge).</p>
