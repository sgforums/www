              <p>don't understand your question.</p>
              <p>Basically, in other countries, VAT is not added on basic necessities.</p>
              <p>So for example, rice has 0% VAT tax.</p>
              <p>And at the end of the day, taxation is a complex topic. Yes, there MAY be other sort of taxes such as import duties, but it's irrelevant to this discussion, because what you are asking now is VAT/GST, which is a consumer-specific tax.</p>

              <p>My answer to you is that GST and VAT's basic concept is similar, BUT not exactly the same. VAT = Value Added Tax. GST is Goods and Services Tax. While VAT implies that the tax is applied on high-value items such as luxury goods, cars, restaurants, etc, GST implies that it's a tax on ALL goods and services.</p>
              <p>Not to mention, the implementation for VAT or GST varies for each country.</p>
              <p>So your question essentially is too general for a proper answer to be given.</p>

              <p>Don't quite understand why you keep insisting they are the same. Their purpose are similiar, but they have different implications.</p>
              <p>Well, if it makes you happy, ok they are the same. After all, apples and oranges are fruits :). So now that you have won, so tell me, what does it achieve for you?</p>

              <p>Either way, there is no point educating you since you already have the prenotion that both taxes are the same. At the same time, it doesn't benefit me, so I will leave it to you to decide that all of us are incapable while you are the most capable guy around. :)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Let me help you soul_rage as i really cant quite bear to see seyKai take credit as the most capable dude around. Understand that GST is a final tax on all produced goods and services i.e. taxes are imposed on the <strong>final value of the good or service transacted </strong>wheres for VAT it is a tax that is being imposed on the value added between each stage of its production i.e. taxes are imposed on the <strong>additional value of the good generated after each stage of production</strong>. And bout their similarities VAT and GST are both indirect taxes which means that those paying the taxes are not the sole bearer of the tax as in this case producers who are being taxed can pass on the tax burden onto consumers in terms of price adjustments and the relative proportions of the burden depends on the various elasticities of demand and supply. Hope that you seyKai given your fantastic intellect can understand this, hope it helped =D</p></div>
