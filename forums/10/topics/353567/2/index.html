              <p>If the GST does not hit 15%, then the ERP charges will be increased, or that more ERP gantries will be built as more COE are also released to create some semblance of traffic congestion that justify the additional ERP gantries - (instead of widening existing roads and highways, or buidling new roads or highways).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With so many more Ministers in the PM Office, it looks like LHL needs alot more time to meditate so as to relieve stresses - that will surely reverse the remission of his cancer in his butt.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are now paying S$3million PLUS for a PM that spend half his time meditating to ensure his cancer remission remains steady, while we have to fork out another $2M+ each for MM, 2 SM, 2 Ministers without Portfolio.</p>
              <p>The report seems to have missed out Lim Swee Say as a Minister without Portfolio - as this post has always been given to the Secretary-General of the NTUC.</p>
