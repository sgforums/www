              <p> </p>
              <p>In fact in my private housing here, people also stare at me even i am withdrawing only $20, no surprising as i checked here and there, keyed here and there before withdrawing, and the Q behind suggest the anger in most of them. Cos i alway key very slowly and cover up the nos key pad with my handbag and chest before punching the nos, i just follow the instruction given..to be careful.</p>
