Some changes in the system seems very political and seem to be following the US systems.<br><br>Personally, I think the US is not right at the moment.  They should leave the Arabs to go kill each other... not racist or anything, but the Arabs seem to have created the biggest messes in the recent past.<br><br>However, this would make Singapore a target but someone must make it clear that Israel is not part of the problems now.. Israel has been used as an excuse for Arab aggression for ages, notice even when Saddam went for his walkaround in Kuwait, Israel was threatened and Scuds flew into Israel even though it did not have anything to do with it?<br><br>Who knows what the PAP is going to say?<br><br>Do they actually speak for Singapore or for themselves?<br><br>Worse, do Singaporeans really care?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sdaddy03:</div><div class="quote_body">Read JBJ's article in today's Today, sets me thinking ...</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup.. but it remains even more relevant today as the basic human rights are slowly eroded away and no one stops to think about it because of apathy.<br><br>Even in Singapore, where our lea-duhs are elected to serve us end up serving themselves but no one takes them to task because no one cares enough.  So they can do whatever they want.<br><br>They have even forgotten what being a "MINISTER" means.  They are supposed to minister to the people, but end up looking like self-serving megalomaniacal despots living in their Ivory Towers.<br><br>So what is going to stop the next lot from eroding away what is essentially our right.. they will tell us it is our "privilege".. then they can take it away.<br><br>Just like Bush and Saddam now... whatever happened to the right of other countries to disagree with them?<br><br>President Bush<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laser51088:</div><div class="quote_body">I thought the original version is something about the someone's comments during Nazi reign in germany?</div></blockquote></div>
