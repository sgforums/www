            <div class='col-md body'><br>Whistleblower: One who reveals wrongdoing within an organization to the public or to those in positions of authority<br><br>The thing about whistleblowing is that the term often brings with it a certain amount of publicity and satisfied vindictiveness. It isn't just about bringing up an issue but about BLOWING up an issue. (Hence WHISTLE blow, like policeman.)<br><br>The big danger with whistleblowing is how it first invokes fear in the society. You don't do something not because you understand it is wrong, but because you are afraid to get caught.<br><br>Secondly, it empowers an individual with the right to threaten, and invoke punishment. It is something that can be so easily abused it isnt funny. This is a very dangerous step because it is just a thin line away from a witch hunt.<br><br>Thirdly, it builts distrust amongst society. Yesterday you were the bystander. Today you are the whistleblower. Will you be the whistle-blowEE tommorrow?<br><br>Of course, sometimes it is RIGHT to whistleblow. E.g. If you see your neighbour abusing his child, and you inform the police... and the police investigates and if there is evidence, your neighbours gets convicted.  But it gets a bit out of hand if you inform the police, then inform the RCs, then inform the press - before the investigation takes place.<br><br>Ideally, It would be great to correct wrongs through education, example, encouragement, err.. suitable deterrents. And only when these have completely failed.. well, we move on. But. -shrugs- looks like our goverrnment is looking at whistleblowing as a cue to responsible citizenship nowadays.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm quite curious about that Rjc student too.<br><br>It seems that upon whistleblowing, if the case is blown out of proportion, there really is a lot of publicity.  However, how many of us really remember the incident after sometime?  Unlike in the US, many whistleblowers are viewed as heros, in Singapore, do we think whistleblowers are deserving of praise?<br><br>Mr Soh, were you not fearful of the repurcussions when you whistleblowed.  You maybe the boss when you have sufficient evidence, but how many people actually supported you during the process to really make you feel like you are the boss?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be a whistleblower , you have to make sure u have the facts and technical data n proof to back it up. Not to mention supports within the organisation and outside of the organisation. Normally these wont do. Asian cultures tend to be more low profile. We sometimes do not use the proper right we have e.g suiing. If these practices become common , companys n buisiness will try to better themselves from being sued. But instead.. alot of whistleblowers will get intimidated, n in stead they will be harrased by gangsters paid to instill fear.<br><br>The whistleblower has to have strong principles in order to gurantee a change in ther performance of the work ethics by companies and also able to withstand pressures when under fire. Well, but acceptence of whistleblower in our society is considered like a traitor. Shunned n prosecuted by the masses because the society doesnt understand the bigger picture sometimes..But what do u guys think? Will u accept if you are being sabo'd by ur underlings ? Goes both ways i suppose...</div>

But I would like to talk about these related issues....<br><br>1) there must be proper, independent checks and balances at multi-levels for it to work.  Otherwise, how effective would whistleblowing be? If there is investigative lax in thoroughness?  the investigator accepts half- truth, has witch-hunt complex or has low moral standing?  Whistleblowing, unwittingly, can be used as get-even tool.<br><br>2) This bring me to this premise- if there are proper checks and balances at diff levels, why the need for whistleblowing?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Timing is important, as you begin your mission in spy-mode. You must certainly be familiar with all avenues of protection you can seek at the different stages. Keep a secret journal of events/send self-addressed envelopes of all the activities, and really don't trust anyone with the information. If is is a MNC, you must really know the organization structure inside out, do a stakeholder analysis, the implications, who they deal with. Make sure the information is fully conclusive that something is wrong or it could hit back at you. When you pass out that damning information, it must not be limited to Singapore but propagated to various sources overseas/other media organizations if necessary. Business is competitive and if you want a progressive society with a fair playing ground for all, do it.  Otherewise, when it is exposed and you are privvy to the information but kept mum, you are just no different from being in cahoots. The wealth or benefits shouldnt be reserved to those few at the top who commit fraud. Yes, you will be viewed as a traitor by those you reported, but that is because they are just angry at themselves for not being experts enough in hiding their fox trails. The reward you get, is your conscience is clear and you will not want to live with something against your belief where you could actually have done something about it when you are in your dying bed. Many things in the world today are highly uncertain. You may have lots of money, a nice car, a respectable job, but as individuals get too comfortable, they become arrogant and believes the world owes a genius like them such a living where others whom are equally or much capable are just slogging away like dogs and slaves. The demon inside curries up the greed even further, and up to the breaking point, it could all just be taken away. And that is where relevation and soul searching comes in. Perhaps many are misguided and blinded in this competitive environment as they fight their way up to positions of power and authority. But I am sure there must be some enlightened individuals this generation who do not see excessive money as the goal in life, for they have lived in that comfort before. There should be more people like you... that being said, I think you can't be a whistle blower. Is that a GP topic or some undergrad social ethics or strategic business assignments maybe a management staff shipped a gold plated toilet bowl or additional toilet roll for home use??&gt;.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ocean84:</div><div class="quote_body">It appears that many people in Singapore are still not ready to whistleblow on unethical, illegal practices in their companies.<br><br>Nonetheless, whistleblowing have brought to light many corporate mismanagement which is to the benefit of public at large.
