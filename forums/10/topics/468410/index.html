              <p>Before we introduce the FT MP, how about reviewing the (duplicitous) GRC system of elections? (The Parliamentary Elections Act)<br> <br> Before PAP decides to introduce a FT MP scheme (dun pretend, U know what
               the abbrv.'FT' means), lets free minority political representation of <strong>the duplicitous GRC system of elections</strong>, as PAP ceaselessly invites <strong>more and more foreigners to run our little country</strong> ...<br> (Old story, <a href="http://temasektimes.wordpress.com/2012/10/10/former-ntuc-director-amy-cheong-is-an-australian-citizen/">'Former NTUC (Asst.) director Amy Cheong is an Australian citizen'</a>)<br> By extension, I wonder if under the PAP's talent search scheme such as <a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2006/yax-615.htm">'GRCs make it easier to find top talent: SM' ST, 27 June 2006</a>, <em>SM
                GohCT: "Without some assurance of a good chance  of winning at least  
              their  first election, many able and successful young Singaporeans may  
              not risk  their careers to join politics"</em> due to the lack of <em>able and successful young Singaporeans</em> we should also soon see more FTs in positions of authority [see in quotes '<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/archive/monday/premium/forum-letters/story/my-point-20130415">Can PRs be judges?</a>']- a <strong>FT <a href="http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/default.aspx?pgID=40">Chief Justice</a>, FT Police men, FT Army, FT <a href="http://www.adminservice.gov.sg/">Admin Service</a> perhaps even  FT MPs</strong>- it doesn't take too much stretch of the imagination what the  PAP would do, how about a FT <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel">SS</a> for Singapore, would make SG more stable and prosperous under a 'united' strong ruling party...

              <p>Perhaps  by removing the anti-competitive and quite unnecessary GRC system of  election from statute, there can be <strong>more competition amongst all  political parties through fully single seat parliamentary elections </strong>so
               that  only the best candidates can win. If the PM loses his own MP seat
               due to  the opposition scheming to usurp him from his seat, then he 
              doesn't  deserve to be PM. In anycase, I think that SG has reasonably 
              safe hands  in DPM Tharman and Mr Heng SK currently if not temporarily.<br> <br> And what about the sacred minority representation issue originally  
              legitimizing the GRC system of elections?- PM Lee has answered his own  
              question... the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominated_Member_of_Parliament">NMP</a> and subsequently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-constituency_Member_of_Parliament">NCMP scheme</a> was meant to revive the almost extinct opposition voice in parliament 
               (or notional semblance of such), it succeeded overwhelmingly. A simple 
              tweak of  rules under the NCMP could now introduce the new <strong><span style="color: red;">NC(RM)MP scheme- the Non-constituency Racial Minority MP scheme</span></strong>.<br> <br> Under the NC(RM)MP scheme, the current system of 'guaranteeing' 15 minority MPs in parliament will be maintained (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituencies_of_Singapore#2011_changes">Wiki: '(GE)07May2011. There are fifteen GRCs'</a>).
                Minority MPs will, like all other candidates, all stand as single seat
                candidates, however, any short fall of minority status candidates  
              elected will allow the remainder best performing loosing candidates to  
              take up NC(RM)MP seats such that <strong>no fewer than 15 registered racial minority MPs</strong> (or such number deemed appropriate) shall be represented in the SG  
              parliament. Alongside the scrapping of the duplicitous GRC system of  
              elections, the NCMP scheme shall also be scrapped (The NMP scheme can  
              continue its circus act although with liberalization, more  
              entertainment value is expected).<br> <br> <strong>GRC system duplicitous really? </strong><br> Tell me, if PAP were really sincere about racial minority  
              representation, notwithstanding PAP's paranoia about the adverse  
              outcomes of by-elections, what other reason could there be for the  
              Parliamentary Elections Act, Section 24  [<a href="http://mysingaporenews.blogspot.sg/2012/04/parliamentary-elections-act-section-24.html">source</a>]:<br> (2A) In respect of any group representation constituency, no writ shall be issued under subsection <br> (1) for an election to fill any vacancy <strong>unless all the Members for that constituency have vacated their seats in Parliament</strong>.<br> <br> Thus, having passed elections, there is basically <strong>no interest   whatsoever placed upon whether or not the minority race MP is indeed  seated in parliament</strong> (he could die/ be sacked by the PAP but the show  goes on like nothing 
              happened). Since this is a stumbling block to PAP  of the GRC system of 
              elections whereby if minority rep. were really  adhered to, then the PM 
              might have to undergo by-elections if the  essential member of the GRC 
              were to have his seat vacated.<br> <br> If the problem were to be determining <strong>when a NC(RM)MP should be allowed to have his vote in a matter counted</strong>, then surely PAP again has the correct answer as it currently decides when the whip in Parliament is raised (<a href="http://singaporearmchaircritic.wordpress.com/2013/02/07/lift-the-whip/">only 3 times in 4 decades before 2002[Lift the Whip]</a>)
                so (by inverse logic perhaps) perhaps by default, NC(RM)MPs should 
              only  be banned from voting 3 times in 4 decades- every issue has a 
              racial  slant if U think hard enough... anyway, for now, unlike FT 
              (Foreign  Talent) judges and Ast Directors at NTUC, MPs are still all, 
              by statute,  Singaporean- males of whom have served NS with other races 
              so they  should not be too parochial in their thinking and 15 really 
              isn't a  majority in an 87seat (or more) parliament- by any count.<br> <br> So dear Mr PM Lee, before you choose to introduce FT MPs,<strong> please  consider my NC(RM)MP scheme</strong>, it's do wonders for your reputation if you can  even be bothered to read it; really.<br> <br> Written by a Singaporean who wants his humble vote to count, even if  it
               means spending time researching and forgoing whatever distractions life
               might bring...<br> <br> <strong>No, no, no... FTs must not be allowed to vote in Singapore parliamentary elections.</strong><br> <br> Perhaps the best guarantee of PAP winning elections is a high chance of not winning, otherwise to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_Party_of_Korea">Workers' Party of (North) Korea</a> here we become!<br> Rgds all, <br> B.C.<br> <br> <a rel="lytebox[75528775]" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zLigHkNjTRE/TdHT1-Y7ejI/AAAAAAAABSU/Uzg1rWyrsPU/s320/228724_10150247580831383_14440041382_8777898_4019758_n.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zLigHkNjTRE/TdHT1-Y7ejI/AAAAAAAABSU/Uzg1rWyrsPU/s320/228724_10150247580831383_14440041382_8777898_4019758_n.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>[<a href="http://singaporemind.blogspot.sg/2011/05/why-people-dislike-tin-pei-ling.html">Pict source: Why people should not hate Tin Pei Ling....</a>]<br> <br> <a rel="lytebox[75528775]" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_amkacIIwAFE/StE7T9VyIUI/AAAAAAAABs8/AZ505YgAQwo/s1600/liftupgrade.jpg">
