No problem! Everybody gets the drinks they want! So I think older workers can do it."<br><br>This tribute from Mr Lee to older workers struck a chord with coffeeshop assistant Hoon Juat Eng.<br><br>She was 57 when her ice-cream factory closed down.<br><br>But she did not want to retire and soon found a new job as a kitchen assistant with Killiney Kopitiam.<br><br>"I would continue working for as long as I could. Work gives me a sense of purpose," she said.<br><br>The owner of Killiney Kopitiam said older workers like Hoon give younger workers a run for their money.<br><br>Mrs Woon-Leong Bak Heng, Owner of Killiney Kopitiam, said: "They are fast at their work, they have good memory, they are experienced and very reliable."<br><br>Mr Lee also singled out 70-year-old radiographer Ng Hon Wing who works at Singapore General Hospital.<br><br>Ms Anna Fok, Director of Human Resource at SGH, said: "They come with rich experiences, they also bring with them wisdom. And they are able to impart their life experiences and guide the younger colleagues in their respective careers."<br><br>Throughout his 44-year career, he never stopped learning.<br><br>Mr Ng said: "The important thing is to have the right attitude, to continue to upgrade yourself, so whatever comes along, take the opportunity to learn it, master it, overcome the obstacles.<br><br>"And I keep abreast of new technologies. I always attend conferences, read library books, journals, things like that."<br><br>About one in 10 hospital staff is above 55 years old.<br><br>The hospital also employs 77 older workers who are past their retirement age of 62.<br><br>The hospital said not only is it more cost-efficient to employ older workers, they are also a great asset when it comes to mentoring younger workers.<br><br>Ms Fok added: "We encourage all our supervisors to conduct retirement planning with all the staff at least six months before the intended date of retirement.<br><br>"For those who are in leadership positions...even before age 60, we will encourage them to transit to a different role, so that would create opportunities for the younger ones to move into the leadership positions. That is where post-retirement roles like teachers and mentors can be created to keep them interested in the job."<br><br>It is employers like SGH who show that with good planning, older workers can continue to be role models and add value to the organisation.</div>
