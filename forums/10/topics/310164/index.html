              <p><strong>Singapore
                  				faces blogging ire over militant escape</strong></p>
              <p>Singapore's
                  				state-controlled media and government have come under fire from
                  				critics and Internet bloggers for failing to give the public
                  				important answers on the escape of a suspected Islamic
                  				militant.<br><br>With a cynical eye cast on local newspapers such
                  				as the pro-government daily, the Straits Times, critics say media
                  				coverage has skirted key issues and so more people were turning
                  				to alternatives such as blogs for a differing viewpoint.<br><br>"The
                  				mainstream media did its job of trying to play down the most
                  				shameful part of the incident. It is a blow to Singapore's image
                  				as being efficient," Seah Chiang Nee, a political
                  				commentator and former Singapore newspaper editor, told
                  				Reuters.<br><br>"The more Internet savvy would not depend on
                  				the mainstream media for news of what's happening in the country,
                  				they would go to the Internet," said Seah.<br><br>Mas
                  				Selamat bin Kastari, the alleged leader of the Singapore cell of
                  				al Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiah, a group blamed for the 2002 Bali
                  				bombings that killed 202 people, escaped on Wednesday last week
                  				from the toilet of a detention centre.<br><br>Security experts
                  				said the escape was embarrassing for a country that prides itself
                  				on tight security. The escape sparked an unprecedented manhunt in
                  				the small island and a rare apology from the government, who
                  				blamed a "security lapse". But few further details of
                  				his escape have since been released.<br><br>Cherian George, an
                  				ex-Straits Times journalist and media lecturer, wrote on the
                  				Internet that the Singapore media had not answered the
                  				"immediate" question of how Kastari escaped.<br><br>"The
                  				question is so natural and so obvious that you'd think anyone
                  				barely paying attention would ask it. Unless, apparently, one
                  				worked for the national news media," George wrote.</p>
              <p><strong>Loss
                  				of credibility</strong></p>
              <p>George
                  				said the absence of this question was due to media management by
                  				the government and that the main result would be a loss of
                  				credibility for the national media that would push readers to
                  				other sources.<br><br>Letters to The Straits Times have also
                  				poured scorn on the government's handling of the crisis and flow
                  				of information.<br><br>"I am disturbed by the security lapse
                  				... more explanation is required," wrote Rosemary Chwee Keng
                  				Chai in a letter.<br><br>Patrick Daniel, editor-in-chief of the
                  				Straits Times, told Reuters by email that the paper took its
                  				responsibility to readers seriously and that George was "utterly
                  				wrong" in his conclusion or that its journalists had never
                  				asked questions on how Kastari escaped.<br><br>"If Cherian
                  				had checked with us, we would have told him that we asked that
                  				question, and many others too, many times," he said, adding
                  				the paper had run an article exploring the issue headlined "How
                  				did he manage to escape?" on Friday.<br><br>Reuters, a
                  				global news and information provider, repeatedly asked the
                  				Ministry of Home Affairs for more details on the escape but was
                  				either referred to its initial five-line statement or was unable
                  				to reach its spokeswoman on by telephone.<br><br>Singapore
                  				retains a tight grip on its national newspapers through a
                  				comprehensive legal framework that requires, among other things,
                  				a publication permit to be granted at the discretion of the
                  				minister. A substantial shareholder of a newspaper company must
                  				also gain approval of a minister.<br><br>"I think that there
                  				was tacit understanding between the government and the media,"
                  				Catherine Lim, a prominent local author and political
                  				commentator, told Reuters.<br><br>"It's a good working
                  				relationship. Local media would never be as inquisitive, probing
                  				or rambunctious as the Western media."<br><br>Some bloggers
                  				had a field day, morphing Kastari's face onto a poster for TV
                  				series Prison Break and saying even students doing examinations
                  				in the city-state were accompanied to the toilet.<br><br>"We
                  				are not like those free-wheeling and chaotic governments from
                  				Western democracies that make their leaders accountable for every
                  				little thing," wrote Lee Kin Mun, better known under his
                  				online moniker 'Mr Brown', Singapore's most famous blogger.</p>
