              <p><span class="texto1"><strong>WASHINGTON, 28 Dec (IPS) - U.S. intelligence
              has concluded that the document published recently by the Times of
              London, which purportedly describes an Iranian plan to do experiments
              on what the newspaper described as a "neutron initiator" for an atomic
              weapon, is a fabrication, according to a former Central Intelligence
              Agency official. </strong> <br> <br> Philip Giraldi, who
              was a CIA counterterrorism official from 1976 to 1992, told IPS that
              intelligence sources say that the United States had nothing to do with
              forging the document, and that Israel is the primary suspect. The
              sources do not rule out a British role in the fabrication, however. <br><br>The
              Times of London story published Dec. 14 did not identify the source of
              the document. But it quoted "an Asian intelligence source" - a term
              some news media have used for Israeli intelligence officials - as
              confirming that his government believes Iran was working on a neutron
              initiator as recently as 2007. <br><br>The story of the purported
              Iranian document prompted a new round of expressions of U.S. and
              European support for tougher sanctions against Iran and reminders of
              Israel's threats to attack Iranian nuclear programme targets if
              diplomacy fails.<br><br>U.S. news media reporting has left the
              impression that U.S. intelligence analysts have not made up their mind
              about the document's authenticity, although it has been widely reported
              that they have now had a full year to assess the issue. <br><br>Giraldi's
              intelligence sources did not reveal all the reasons that led analysts
              to conclude that the purported Iran document had been fabricated by a
              foreign intelligence agency. But their suspicions of fraud were
              prompted in part by the source of the story, according to Giraldi. <br><br>"The
              Rupert Murdoch chain has been used extensively to publish false
              intelligence from the Israelis and occasionally from the British
              government," Giraldi said. <br><br>The Times is part of a Murdoch
              publishing empire that includes the Sunday Times, Fox News and the New
              York Post. All Murdoch-owned news media report on Iran with an
              aggressively pro-Israeli slant. <br><br>The document itself also had a number of red flags suggesting possible or likely fraud.<br><br>The
              subject of the two-page document which the Times published in English
              translation would be highly classified under any state's security
              system. Yet there is no confidentiality marking on the document, as can
              be seen from the photograph of the Farsi-language original published by
              the Times. <br><br>The absence of security markings has been cited by
              the Iranian ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Ali
              Asghar Soltanieh, as evidence that the "alleged studies" documents,
              which were supposedly purloined from an alleged Iranian nuclear
              weapons-related programme early in this decade, are forgeries. <br><br>The
              document also lacks any information identifying either the issuing
              office or the intended recipients. The document refers cryptically to
              "the Centre", "the Institute", "the Committee", and the "neutron
              group". <br><br>The document's extreme vagueness about the
              institutions does not appear to match the concreteness of the plans,
              which call for hiring eight individuals for different tasks for very
              specific numbers of hours for a four-year time frame. <br><br>Including
              security markings and such identifying information in a document
              increases the likelihood of errors that would give the fraud away. <br><br>The
              absence of any date on the document also conflicts with the specificity
              of much of the information. The Times reported that unidentified
              "foreign intelligence agencies" had dated the document to early 2007,
              but gave no reason for that judgment. <br><br>An obvious motive for
              suggesting the early 2007 date is that it would discredit the U.S.
              intelligence community's November 2007 National Intelligence Estimate,
              which concluded that Iran had discontinued unidentified work on nuclear
              weapons and had not resumed it as of the time of the estimate. <br><br>Discrediting
              the NIE has been a major objective of the Israeli government for the
              past two years, and the British and French governments have supported
              the Israeli effort. <br><br>The biggest reason for suspecting that the
              document is a fraud is its obvious effort to suggest past Iranian
              experiments related to a neutron initiator. After proposing experiments
              on detecting pulsed neutrons, the document refers to "locations where
              such experiments used to be conducted".<br><br>That reference plays to
              the widespread assumption, which has been embraced by the International
              Atomic Energy Agency, that Iran had carried out experiments with
              Polonium-210 in the late 1980s, indicating an interest in neutron
              initiators. The IAEA referred in reports from 2004 through 2007 to its
              belief that the experiment with Polonium-210 had potential relevance to
              making "a neutron initiator in some designs of nuclear weapons".<br><br>The
              National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), the political arm of the
              terrorist organisation Mujahedeen-e Khalq, claimed in February 2005
              that Iran's research with Polonium-210 was continuing and that it was
              now close to producing a neutron initiator for a nuclear weapon. <br><br>Sanger
              and Broad were so convinced that the Polonium-210 experiments proved
              Iran's interest in a neutron initiator that they referred in their
              story on the leaked document to both the IAEA reports on the
              experiments in the late 1980s and the claim by NCRI of continuing
              Iranian work on such a nuclear trigger. <br><br>What Sanger and Broad
              failed to report, however, is that the IAEA has acknowledged that it
              was mistaken in its earlier assessment that the Polonium-210
              experiments were related to a neutron initiator. <br><br>After seeing
              the complete documentation on the original project, including complete
              copies of the reactor logbook for the entire period, the IAEA concluded
              in its Feb. 22, 2008 report that Iran's explanations that the
              Polonium-210 project was fundamental research with the eventual aim of
              possible application to radio isotope batteries was "consistent with
              the Agency's findings and with other information available to it".<br><br>The
              IAEA report said the issue of Polonium-210 – and thus the earlier
              suspicion of an Iranian interest in using it as a neutron initiator for
              a nuclear weapon - was now considered "no longer outstanding". <br><br>New
              York Times reporters David Sanger and William J. Broad reported U.S.
              intelligence officials as saying the intelligence analysts "have yet to
              authenticate the document". Sanger and Broad explained the failure to
              do so, however, as a result of excessive caution left over from the
              CIA's having failed to brand as a fabrication the document purporting
              to show an Iraqi effort to buy uranium in Niger. <br><br>The
              Washington Post's Joby Warrick dismissed the possibility that the
              document might be found to be fraudulent. "There is no way to establish
              the authenticity or original source of the document...," wrote Warrick.
              <br><br>But the line that the intelligence community had authenticated
              it evidently reflected the Barack Obama administration's desire to
              avoid undercutting a story that supports its efforts to get Russian and
              Chinese support for tougher sanctions against Iran. <br><br>This is
              not the first time that Giraldi has been tipped off by his intelligence
              sources on forged documents. Giraldi identified the individual or
              office responsible for creating the two most notorious forged documents
              in recent U.S. intelligence history. <br><br>In 2005, Giraldi
              identified Michael Ledeen, the extreme right-wing former consultant to
              the National Security Council and the Pentagon, as an author of the
              fabricated letter purporting to show Iraqi interest in purchasing
              uranium from Niger. That letter was used by the George W. Bush
              administration to bolster its false case that Saddam Hussein had an
              active nuclear weapons programme. <br><br>Giraldi also identified
              officials in the "Office of Special Plans" who worked under
              Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith as having forged a
              letter purportedly written by Hussein's intelligence director, Tahir
              Jalail Habbush al-Tikriti, to Hussein himself referring to an Iraqi
              intelligence operation to arrange for an unidentified shipment from
              Niger.<br><br>*Gareth Porter is an investigative historian and

              They will do everything to create fear of Iran which does not even have the technology to make a nuclear bomb.  This is just a pretext to justify bombing of the country.  Everyone knows that in the Middles East only Isarel has about 200 nuclear bombs and my guest the number would have increase as they have the technology with the help of UK and USA sometime more than 20 years ago.   To all Non-western leaders, are you going to nod your heads again for the bombing of Iran?  
              Remember WMD in Iraq to justify the invasion in 2003.  All other world leaders including ours dare not question or challenge the western leaders's assertion.   Until today, the ongoing enquiry in UK is a waste of time and public funds as the former PM, Tong Blair will definitely be cleared of false statements to invade Iraq.

              <p>They will do everything to create fear of Iran which does not
              even have the technology to make a nuclear bomb. This is just a
              pretext to justify bombing of the country. Everyone knows that in
              the Middles East only Isarel has about 200 nuclear bombs and my
              guest the number would have increase as they have the technology
              with the help of UK and <span>USA</span> sometime more
              than 20 years ago. To all Non-western leaders, are you going to nod
              your heads again for the bombing of Iran?<br> Remember <span>WMD</span> in Iraq to justify the invasion
              in 2003. All other world leaders including ours dare not question
              or challenge the western leaders’s assertion. Until today, the
              ongoing enquiry in UK is a waste of time and public funds as the
              former PM, Tong Blair will definitely be cleared of false
              statements to invade Iraq.</p>

              <p>And turn a blind eye to every questionable action they commit?</p>
              <p>To begin with, American innovation and ingenuity does not equate to the American government. Often, the American government uses American talent and innovation to accomplish inhumane goals.</p>
              <p>And anyway, I don't see a link between recognising American talent in shaping industrialised society and being aware of the media spin by an imperialistic foreign policy.</p>
              <p>American culture definitely plays a major role in shaping Singaporean culture, which is no surprise given they are the world's only global superpower. In any case, Singapore is too young to have a culture of its own as we easily assimilate foreign cultures such as American, British, Japanese etc.</p>

              <p>You may want to look up John Perkin's "Confessions of an Economic Hitmen", which details how, during his days as an economist for a private consulting firm, he and other "economic hitmen" used the WB/IMF and other 'international' institutions as tools to bring third world countries to their knees via economic means. First corruption, then assassination, finally military invasion. Iraq was an example where the first two failed, thus the 1991 and 2003 invasions.</p>
              <p>The advantage of working for a private corporation while trying to economically bring developing countries into western servitude was that even if he and his colleagues were caught, it wouldnt cause an international scandal.</p>
              <p>According to him, that's how the US and western interests have built the world's first global empire, though that is unknown to most people, even Americans.</p>
