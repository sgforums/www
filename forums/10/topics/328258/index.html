              <p>It can be done. It only needs the opposition parties prove their mettle, and really keep to its election promises. Would be just happy if they can keep to 60% of their promises.</p>
              <p>They should stop trying to impress the citizens with national and foriegn policies. They are no match for the ruling party and the civil service. Their facts and figures would only make them laughing stocks.</p>
              <p>They had forgotten how Spore won its independence. The ruling party didnt try to interfere with Malaysia's national foriegn policies or major domestic issues. They did not fight the endemic corruption then spuriously, or challenge the rulers. They focus on one single major issue - ethnic equality and ran the federated state of Singapore capably, impressing the citizens, enough to stand by their side when the breakaway came.</p>
              <p>Similiarly, our opposition must learn from the past. Manage the town council well, focus 100% on making the lives of the constituents better, even way before the election, and the citizens will give them the chance to lead.</p>
              <p>But are our opposition members capable of sheding their authoritative and centrist ways, show and impress with domestic actions within their communities? As long as they are not, the current educated citizens will fear them more than they fear the ruling party.</p>
              <p>Once should they manage to gain control of the town councils, will then they be able to form the next government or turn Spore into a 2 party state.</p>
              <p>It is OUR votes, that will determine how many parties or a single party will administer the country. And it is a more intelligent society that lives here now, unlike the older generation, deprived of education, will vote just because of a slight or a perceived slight.</p>
              <p>Action, not talk, will win that vote.</p>

              <p>Politics is a full time vocation and not for wimps. Not many want to be in this field, for it is challenging, and challenging is rather mild as a term. Furthermore, the pay was small in the past.</p>
              <p>However. the opposition party should be thankful for the high salary scales of MPs. What's more, when they form the next government, it is million dollar salaries for the appointment holders. No small change in politics, and would be attractive as a career choice for many, for their efforts to make the lives of present and future citizens better.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, to run a political party, one would need funds, which is not easily obtainable, more so to run it professionally and full time, with paid grassroots leaders who are willing to devote their entire lives to helping citizens. Even if they are full of heart and dedication, they would still need at a minimum of $2000/mth just to survive and tide over till they get voted as MPs.</p>
              <p>Thus, the leader of the political party must plan properly on how he can get funds from a pool of well-wishers and financiers. Without money, it would be impossible to run a political party professionally. But the ultimate prize, in terms of money besides honour and glory of service to fellow citizens, is the US$300billion in reserve and growing. Whoever controls these funds will get to determine the future direction of reforms within our country.</p>
              <p><strong>Win Votes</strong></p>
              <p>History teaches us many subjects and would be a good learning example to start a strategic plan for winning the mandate to rule.</p>
              <p>Mao Tse Tung was an intelligent man of his time. When he failed to rouse the entrenched elites within the cities to his cause, he fled with his team to the countryside.</p>
              <p>Once there, he lived, work beside, sweat and toil beside, and made the simple folks understood his cause. In time, the peasants' children flock to his cause, and his gathering grew large enough, with the support base of entire China's countryside, to take control of the cities.</p>
              <p>Spore don't have any countryside, but town councils are the relative countrysides so to speak. These are the heartlands where ordinary citizens, with ordinary aspirations live. Thus, it is no small thing to ask the opposition parties to work on town councils. They will be the support base to win a country.</p>
              <p>The opposition party really do need some businessmen within their teams, and consider marketing strategies seriously instead of beating around the bush, staying stuck in one place for 43 years and probably another 43 years more if nothing is done. MP Chiam, MP Low and NMP Sylvia Lim are the wise ones and future of any 'opposition political party' hopes.</p>
              <p>But make no mistakes. The ruling party is not stupid. What i can think of, they are already miles ahead of me, filled with the best and the brightest. I am just a simple nobody. They had stayed relevant to the people through constant renewal of the people within their movement, with the ability to focus on the conservative simple folks as well as the hip younger citizens.</p>
              <p>Do not, do not under-estimate the power of the lightning striking across the globe. Because of them, everyone of influence knows Singapore and what we are capable of as a nation. Best everyone knows reality from fantasy if they seriously want to rule the nation. </p>
