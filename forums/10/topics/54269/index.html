            <div class='col-md body'>im really worried about something similar happening in singapore, especially during national day. even if they cannot pull off something substantial, an attack on our morale and mood would be good enuff for them.<br><br>such times really underlines the need for strong leadership that is vested wif the trust of the citizens, so that the authorities can act decisively. the sars outbreak illustrated this.<br><br>indonesia is lamenting their lack of similar acts as that in singapore and malaysia tt allows them to detain suspected terrorists. isa was mooted at the height of communists threat in singapore. the terrorists threat now, though less organised and less sponsored, is really more latent and evasive and from the ground. so as much as it is controversial, the isa really comes into use at such times against these extremists who dont bet an eyelid to killing millions for their warped cause.<br><br>singaporeans will definitely lash out and fully support our authorities to deal all its weight onto the perpetrators shud (touch wood) they ever succeed in pulling off something here. tt is what we can be assured and consoled of. but the damage to our economy and morale will be lasting.<br><br>so every single one of us should be vigilant at these times and not assume that everything has been taken care of by the authorities or nothing of this sort will happen in singapore.<br><br>we have to make those murderers think twice b4 trying anything funny on our soil!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Burning the terrorists, especially openly, will not only reduce the govt forces to the lowly level of the terrorists, but will promote further support for the terrorists, who will then have died as matyrs.<br><br>I personally am undecided as to whether the terrorists should be executed.<br><br>An execution would also help the terrorists die as matyrs.  Death is a punishment for most of us sane and logical people.  However, when we think of terrorists, the thinking should not be in logical humane terms, if the terrorists wishes to die for Allah, then by putting them to death for setting off a bomb, wouldn't the Indonesian govt have helped the terrorists meet their objective?<br><br>However, if the terrorists were not executed, then, given the poor security at jails in Indonesia, coupled with rampant corruption, it is more than likely that they will eventually escape with the help of their associates.  Should this happen, they will only be given a second chance to blow up another place and if caught a second time, will still be put to death anyway.<br><br>Indonesians must be made to see the suffering caused by the terrorists to pull them over to the side of the government.  The difficulty is in getting the message across.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Call me a cruel person. But my own personal opinion is that irregardless of whether the execution of a terrorist will render them to be seem as a hero in the eyes of other potential terrorist is secondary.<br><br>The reality is that the bulk of the renegade segment must be severly warned and 'educated' about the consequeces of their 'heroic' acts.<br><br>As as proposed by Sun Tze in his Art of War, we must kill one to warn a hundred. And futher prompted by the Legalist Fraction (Han FeiZi), the punishment must be severe and one-time crippling.<br><br>Maybe something harsh like the following:<br><br>1) Execute the terrorist in public and dismember it into bits and pieces.<br><br>2) Make all fragments of executed terrorist bodies to be unclaimable by their families.<br><br>3) Remove and ban ALL related family members from civil service employment.<br><br>4) State confiscate ALL existing assets of remainant family members of the executed terrorist.<br><br>5) And finally, exile individual individual family members to seperate and remote parts of the country to isolate them.<br><br></div>
