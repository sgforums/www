            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, CDC and grassroot organisations will play an useful role if they are not appointed to serve the ruling party in welcoming them during functions and walk-abouts of ministers.<br><br>Now these organizations are a waste of public fund as their members are seen as supporters of the party structure and functions rather than serving the functions of speaking up for the people on high costs or pro-foreign investments and employment policies. The advisers and senior positions are closely linked to support of the ruling party not the people. Many CCC chairmen were businessmen who were trying to serve in order to have better chance of listing their companies or in tendering for government's projects or services.<br><br>These organisations' senior positions were seen working for the ruling party MPs and party members preparing for their walk-abouts and other party functions.<br><br>They do not play any useful role in their present set-up until they are revamped to become more neutral to serve the people in solving bigger issues like lowering the high costs of living or changing the current pro-foreign investments and job policies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Isn't this just another indication of the insecurity of the Ruling Party: Their need to re-emphasize their insistence that CDCs and grassroots bring the community together, despite alternative parties lambasting them for being politically-linked?<br><br>If they truly have faith in their concepts that CDCs and grassroots serve the people and not the ruling party's politics, why the need to continuously 'condition' singaporeans by stating and re-stating their position? Why not let the people decide?<br><br>This is classic double play: they rebutt the negative comments from the ruling party but feel the need to reiterate their position over and over again becuase they themselves are not convinced that the people believe them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
