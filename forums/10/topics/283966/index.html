They can't even come with the money they take from us to pay those that live over eighty five an annuity.Yet they have the cheek to increase their million dollars salaries.<br><br>This quote below has been super-seeded, they have given up.<br><br><blockquote>Barclays May Abandon ABN Amro Bid, Clearing Way for Royal Bank<br><br>By Ben Livesey and Jon Menon<br><br>Oct. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Barclays Plc, Britain's third-largest bank, may abandon a six-month battle to buy ABN Amro Holding NV, clearing the way for Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and its partners to complete the biggest banking takeover.<br><br>Investors had until yesterday to tender ABN Amro shares to Barclays's 62.8 billion-euro ($88.7 billion) offer. They have until 3 p.m. in Amsterdam to back the competing 71.8 billion-euro bid from Edinburgh-based Royal Bank, Spain's Banco Santander SA and Fortis, though the banks could decide to extend the bids.<br><br>``Barclays has failed,'' said Simon Willis, a London-based analyst at NCB Stockbrokers who has a ``reduce'' rating on Barclays. ``They may well put out a statement later today.'' </blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
