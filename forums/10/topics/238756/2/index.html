No, our tactics consist of supplying troops overseas to any threat that might arise in this region, or the world, helping out whichever friendly nation is being attacked, before the threat comes down to singapore. thats why our troops spend so much time training overseas. if for some reason this does not succeed, then obviously you'd know by then singapore is doomed, and might as well pack your bags... because there wont be all that many troops defending singapore by then <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

I'm all for ideals and the burdens of citizenship, but there has to be a level playing field for Singaporean males as well ... and don't think that a few hundred dollars worth of NS bonus will make things even ... that just smacks of "here's a bone, so shut up already" ...<br><br>I remember a conversation I had with a malaysian poly classmate, way back in 1998 ... I asked him if he intended to get a job here, settle down here, and get a PR after graduation ...<br><br>his reply ?  "sure, I'd want to get a job here, it's quite easy to get a job in Singapore, but PR ? ... siao ah ! ... I'd have to serve NS then ...
