After all, parenthood is more than just about having babies. Lots of responsibility go with it, and couples must be prepared for the lifelong commitment to care for and bond with their children.<br><br>Being the youngest in a family of nine siblings - spaced a year or two apart - I was told when I was 14 that immediately after I was born, my mum considered giving me away to a nurse. Although I fully understood what she was going through at the time, I could not help feeling hurt, that perhaps I was an accident.<br><br>However, my late father, who was a pig farmer, was determined that no matter how poor he was, he would raise me, never mind the cost. To this day, I am deeply grateful to him for showing me that there is a whole lot of responsibility tied to parenthood.<br><br>Apart from the qualitative aspects of parenthood, I view the issue of longer maternity leave as being detrimental to business productivity and efficiency, and which would invariably raise the cost of doing business in Singapore.<br><br>A neighbour told me candidly that if the Government passed a law to extend maternity leave, he would stop hiring women who wanted to start a family. Even if a woman said she had no plans, he would advise her to practise birth control!<br><br>It is time Singaporeans stopped expecting the Government to do everything for them. If some young couples do not wish to have children, so be it.<br><br>At a recent gathering of the Singapore business community in Shanghai, a woman kept telling Minister of State (Foreign Affairs and Trade &amp; Industry) Raymond Lim that the Singapore Government should make an effort to keep her whole family together in Shanghai and to provide school facilities for her children there.<br><br>I was shocked to discover that despite being abroad for a few years, she still entertained the notion that it was the Government's responsibility to provide all these for her.<br><br>While I can accept the fact that attitudes and mindsets require some time to change, I was flabbergasted when I read in Lianhe Wanbao that a woman actually suggested that four to six months' maternity leave was insufficient, that it should be at least one year!<br><br>We need not be alarmed if the birth rate continues to fall. Our policy of welcoming foreign talents who want to be Singaporeans should help to augment the numbers.<br><br>It might also help to re-inject life into our nation as many of us are too reliant on government help. After all, Singapore started as an immigrant nation.<br><br>As a member of the business community, I urge the Government to rethink its recommendation. Perhaps it would be fair to allow for maternity leave of three months, including one month to be subsidised by the Government.<br><br>It is ludicrous that couples should have more children just because the mother could stay home longer. While I empathise with the stress that working couples go through, to expect to have more children on account of that incentive alone is very worrying.<br><br>Imagine how hurt the children would be if they are told later: 'Honey, we had you because the Government allowed Mummy to have longer maternity leave.'<br><br>KENNY YAP KIM LEE<br>Executive Chairman<br>Qian Hu Corporation<br></div>

But that is where finding middle ground comes in. This is precisely why the government has ideas on "punishing" married Singaporeans for not having kids, its easier to give Singaporeans the big stick for not having kids, rather than find common ground where exists a pro-family work environment while minimising disruptions to companies, and to enshrine pro-family labour regulations into the Employment Act.</div>

The final decision on procreation still lies with the individuals. GRACE SUNG reports.<br><br>THE southern Italian village of Laviano is dying out.<br><br>Only four babies were born among its population of 1,850 last year. In 1970, there were 3,000 residents and 70 births.<br><br>The demographics are so dire that the mayor made a desperate offer a year ago - 10,000 euros (S$21,000) over six years to anyone who produces a baby.<br><br>'It's do or die. But we cannot stay impotent while our village disappears,' mayor Rocco Falivena told La Repubblica daily.<br><br>Laviano's story is not unique in Italy, whose 1.24 total fertility rate (TFR) is the lowest in Europe. The country also has the world's oldest population.<br><br>The government is trying to arrest the population decline by offering parents a 1,000-euro bonus if they have at least a second child by the end of this year.<br><br>To varying degrees, other countries in the region face similar demographic challenges. The average TFR in the European Union (EU) is 1.47, well below the 2.1 replacement rate. Non-EU states fare no better. The 10 incoming EU members have a 1.29 TFR average.<br><br>Experts have pointed to the dramatic consequences of a greying Europe. If the demographics stay the same, the size of the working population in today's EU will drop from 230 million to 190 million, to the detriment of the welfare system and the economy.<br><br>One way to tackle the ageing phenomenon is to encourage people to have more babies. The question is how?<br><br>Like Italy, other countries have thrown money at citizens in an attempt to reverse the trend. <span style="color: red;">Two years ago, Austria (TFR 1.4) offered a 436-euro monthly payout for three years to people with new babies, if they earned less than 1,200 euros.<br><br>Combined with other allowances, the total monthly benefits reached 600 euros.<br><br>But birth rates have not risen. Experts point to various obstacles, like a lack of day-care facilities, keeping couples from having children.</span><br><br>Only 4 per cent of Austrian children under three benefit from state-financed day care. In Denmark (TFR 1.72), that figure is 64 per cent and in France (TFR 1.89), it is 20 per cent.<br><br>The amount of state money offered matters, of course.<br><br>Briton Jennie Vincent, 31, who has a 16-month-old daughter, said tax credits helped only a bit.<br><br>'We can get a few hundred pounds, but it's not even enough to cover nappies and food,' she said. 'It is just not cost-effective to get into full-time work. You'd end up paying most of what you make into childcare.'<br><br>Though surveys show most Italian women want at least two children, they too are unlikely to bite the 1,000-euro carrot. According to an official study, 38 per cent of 50,000 new mothers in Italy found it hard to reconcile family life with work, and 44 per cent cited working hours as a barrier to procreation.<br><br>Studies have shown that birth patterns are linked to job security. Italy, Spain and Greece, which have the lowest TFRs, had the highest youth unemployment rates in the EU in the late 1990s.<br><br>Their women's work participation rates are also low and activists say gender discrimination is to blame.<br><br>In Spain, twice as many women as men are jobless, though there are more female graduates. <span style="color: red;">Poor state support, uncertainty over work and rejection of women's traditional role as housewife and childbearer are some reasons why almost half of Spain's women are childless.<br><br>Under such conditions, money is hardly a stimulus.</span><br><br>'Child benefits are not perceived as a real incentive for couples to have more children,' said Mr Aidan Punch of Ireland's Central Statistics Office. He is also president of the Council of Europe's committee on population.<br><br>'What's needed are more family-friendly policies: parental leave, work-sharing arrangements, greater labour market flexibility and availability of childcare facilities.'<br><strong><br><span style="color: red;">It is the countries which have developed a coherent mix of policies facilitating partnering, childbearing and parenting choices which rank higher in the fertility table.</span></strong><br><br>Take France for example. Generous welfare allocations, tax breaks and other perks for larger families, subsidised maternity and all-day childcare services all help make motherhood more attractive.<br><br>Women have 16 weeks of maternity leave with full pay, and up to 26 weeks for the third child onwards.<br><br>They can also take three years of parental leave without fear of losing their jobs.<br><br>Money does talk - if the amount is substantial. France spends 4.5 per cent of its GDP on families, more than any other European state. More than 41 billion euros go to 10 million families annually.<br><br>'Family policy advantages and incentives have played a major role in reversing the downward trend of the early 1990s,' said sociologist Anne Muxel of the French Centre for the Study of Political Life.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Cont'd below...</span></div>

Parents are also allowed various kinds of leave with great flexibility in how they are structured<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MATERNITY/PATERNITY LEAVE</span><br><br>- Paid maternity leave is a given in western European countries. Sometimes, no distinction is made between birth and adoption.<br>- In most countries, fathers get paid leave too.<br>- The amount given ranges from 100 per cent of pay to a daily rate. Sometimes, a ceiling rate is imposed.<br>- Time off varies, starting at three months. Nordic nations are the most generous. Sweden allows parents 13 months off per child, at 80 per cent pay, and another three months at a nominal rate. Denmark gives full pay for 12 months.<br>- Often, a minimum period is reserved for the mother or father, and parents can share the rest of the leave.<br>- Leave can at times be spread out. In Sweden and Denmark, it can be consumed any time before the child is eight years old.<br>- Some Europeans get more paid leave for multiple births or medical complications.<br>- In France, mothers get 16 weeks' maternity leave for the first and second child, 26 for subsequent offspring, 34 for twins and 46 for multiple births.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ADDITIONAL LEAVE</span><br><br>- About half of the European Union countries allow parents unpaid leave, beyond maternity and paternity leave, to care for their children.<br>- In the remaining countries, some benefits are also given to parents who have to take care of children.<br>- The extra time off ranges from three to 36 months.<br>- Some countries allow people to consume such leave at intervals, until the child is eight.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BIRTH BENEFITS </span><br><br>- Some countries give a flat-rate birth grant.<br>- Many offer free maternity services and birth or child-related medical care.<br>- Parental leave is usually paid on condition that parents have worked a minimum period before birth. But several countries give aid to unemployed parents. In Norway, a lump sum of about 33,200 kroner (S$8,150) was offered last year.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHILD/CHILDCARE SUPPORT </span><br><br>- Monthly stipends for childcare or access to subsidised facilities are available in some places, particularly in northern Europe.<br>- 76 per cent of Swedish kids aged one to six years go to state-run centres and parents pay one-fifth the cost.<br>- Some countries give parents money to care for ill or disabled children.<br>- Monthly grants of 100 to 200 euros per child are common. In Germany, this is about 150 euros per child up till the age of 18.<br>- Other financial benefits such as tax breaks, education grant, allowance for single and poor parents, housing aid and unemployment aid are common.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WORKING ARRANGEMENTS </span><br><br>- Flexible working arrangements are getting more common, though not fully utilised. Some examples:<br>- Parents in Norway, Denmark and Sweden are allowed to consume their Cannot distribute vertically parental leave by working part-time over several years.<br>- British parents can ask for flexible hours if their child is aged below six, or take 13 weeks' unpaid leave if the child is under five.<br>- Parents in some countries get paid days off to look after sick or disabled children. In Portugal, it's 30 days per child a year, at 65 per cent pay.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sources: European Commission, Council of Europe, Eurostat, news reports </span><br></div>
