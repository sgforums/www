            <div class='col-md body'><br>Although the Education System in Singapore has produced many Â“educatedÂ” individuals and elevated Singapore to the status of the First World, the Government is caught in a bind Â– as evidenced by the comments of Â“the need to continue to tinker to improveÂ” the Â“Education SystemÂ” - which has been on-going since the early 1990's.<br><br>It is caught in this self-created mess, in that on the one hand the Singapore Government tries hard to produce educated individuals who can be independent and creative thinkers, so as to contribute significantly to the next stage of SingaporeÂ’s development into the World of Bio-Science and Creative Inventions.<br><br>Yet by creating educated individuals who can be independent and creative thinkers, they have also opened Â“PandoraÂ’s BoxÂ” by also creating the possibility of individuals who are creative thinkers and who cannot be subject to the present paranoid control of all aspects of SingaporeÂ’s life.<br><br>Hence, the half measures taken in tinkering with the education system, by giving certain schools the possibility of self regulating the need of having the Â“OÂ” and Â“AÂ” Level Examinations; but not allowing Polytechnic Students of getting further University Education immediately upon their graduation from Polytechnics.<br><br>The decision of creating a Singapore Management University is not any altruistic move to give Tertiary Education to Diploma Holders, but as another money spinner industry in absorbing the large pool of private cash that would otherwise have gone to finance young Singaporeans going overseas to study; and also to attract the multi-million dollars spent by the parents from this region who also need to send their children to UK, USA and Australia for further education.<br><br>The standards of education in Singapore, although high in result oriented lessons, remain pathetic insofar as getting the Mind to work as a Creative and Innovative Tool for the Singapore Economy Â– much like the entrepreneurs from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, USA, UK, Japan, Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark, and now China (?).<br><br>Despite several long overseas trips to UK, Germany, France, USA, Japan and other countries since the early 1990Â’s; the Singapore Government still remain dissatisfied with the results which they feel that these overseas education seem to be able to produce the extra Â“oomphÂ” that is missing from "home educated" Singaporeans.<br><br>Like the blind cat that look everywhere for the mouse, they fail to look at their own policies of paranoid control over every aspects of Singaporean Life, every Singaporean economic requirement is met by one or more Government Linked Companies, every bit of information has to come from Government Controlled Media (SBC, SPH, Media Works, Media Corp), even the initiative towards enterprise is taken away by the strong competition from NTUC FairPrice towards privately owned neighborhood stores.<br><br>In such an ordered society, in which free and open thinking (political or social or literati) that surface into the public realm will only be smacked down with the utmost urgency, to prevent disorder from ever occurring in Singapore.<br><br>Given this paranoid environment of control, can the Singapore Education System thrive to produce the talents that are found in abundance in the USA, Japan, Germany, France, UK, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Australia and now in China?<br><br>These are the countries that the Singapore Government envy for the strength of their creative talents and enterprise that make their countries into economic industrial power houses; and which Singapore is sorely lacking despite our recognized and lauded high standards of education.<br><br>These are the talents that will be sorely needed to mould Singapore into a strong economic powerhouse that can be comparable to at least Taiwan or Hong Kong, if Singapore cannot emulate the Japanese or Koreans, or the Economic Power Nations of Europe and the USA.<br><br>Quote Posted by Tripwire:<br><br>Â“the GOVT can only do so much at the macro level... while their influence is great... they cant and dont influence the minds and thoughts of every people in singapore....Â”<br><br>The Government has done too much at the macro level to serve their own interests, and I will question your statement that the Singapore Government Â“donÂ’t influence the minds and thoughts of every people in SingaporeÂ….Â”<br><br></div>

Or did your miss lessons of moral education in school? If you continue this kindda attitude in the working world, I guarantee you that you will suffer.<br><br>If you don't agree just prove your point in a modest way.

In the end he depend on his portfolio and they did accepted him. Of course my friend loves his course and did pretty well.<br><br>The thing is that many people in his course quit halfway because they come to realise that this is not really the thing they want to do due to the fact that when they are chosing course - it SEEMED interesting and a 'hot' course, therefore they just chose it. Imagine those who are really interested and had a talent in pursuing that course, but is unable due to that result - by missing 3 or 4 points. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>My friend is lucky, but he feels for other people who are in the same plight.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, Tripwire, thanks for the 'constructive criticism' but I'd like to point out a few flaws in your reply.<br><br>Firstly, I think i'll have to agree with your saying that the greatest idiots are those who thinks others are idiots. I suppose your thoery also applies to the greatest morons being those who think others are morons?Also, you'll find that no where in my entire (earlier) post did I even mention that I thought the goverment was idiotic, I have the utmost respect for the leaders who made Singapore what it is today, I was merely pointing out what I thought they should improve on.<br><br>Secondly, I whole-heartedly agree with you on the part about ourselves being the only ones who are capable in making ourselves failures. Consider this though, some people have a weak will, some have virtually no will at all. These people will surely succumb to all the pressures of our society. Now, I admit there arent ALOT of these people around but consider this also, is it not by the pressures of society that these few people lose faith in themselves?<br><br>Thirdly, where in my post did I ever mention that my accquaintance felt like a loser? I simply said he felt bitter towards the government for creating a society where his skills are shunned. And also, there was really no need for the encouragement (stand on your own feet) i'm doing great in my line of life, thanks anyway.<br><br>P.s Do you know any other threads on this subject?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed with the orginal author and the bit about non-profitable talent being wasted in Singapore.<br><br>Lets have, say... someone who is vastly talented in the military field... or maybe someone who is brimming with ideas for communication studies and advertising. But with average results in other fields.<br><br>But both the courses/scholarships that suit them (For example, the DSTA scholarship and say, NUS Communications Studies course) are "4A2S"-type... meaning that you won't get anywhere near them without a near-flawless A-level cert.<br>I'm sure that you have heard of DSTA scholars who really don't have the interest (and know nuts about) military matters... They only seek to get the scholarship to improve their CV and for the money. They don't make up <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> the DSTA scholars, but there are enough of them to be noticeable (I know some of them personally). Ditto with the Comm Studies course (I know that, sister graduated from it)<br><br>As a result, those with the <span style="font-style: italic;">interest and the specialised ability</span> don't get anywhere near these courses/scholarships. And Singapore loses another talent.<br><br>What we need to do is to remove that damned "excellent academic results" requirement from the <strong>specialised</strong> scholarships and in-demand courses. Sure, the so-called intelligent fellows will bitch and moan (because their 4A's, plus a B3 in GP) just doesn't cut it anymore with a "4B's, with an A1 in GP" fellow when competing for, say... a place in an English-specialised course.<br><br>But that's the only way we can get <strong>commited</strong> people who are interested and talented in that field into the course... Not some ticket-punching rote-learning 4A bugger with the intention of getting a better CV and NO personal interest (aside from required mugging) in mentioned high-demand course or scholarship.<br><br>Same thing goes with the DSTA scholarship... If the 4A2S scholar wannabe wants to get the title and money, but cannot tell the difference between a tank and APC, etc. then he should NOT get the scholarship. Instead, it should go to someone with the <strong>interest</strong> and the <strong>ability</strong>.<br><br>Trust me, I've met some of these types of people who actually admit to "going for the name/money" as opposed to being truly commited to the path. Not all of the high-flyers are like that... but sadly, enough of them are.<br><br>Finally, a note to tripwire:<br>Get off your high horse and quit it with your "Oh I'm so intelligent" BS. Most of the time I don't care about tactless forumers, but your needless insult of someone who has made a valid question is uncalled for and bloody rude. Do you realise that your unwarranted name-calling is offensive to the point of being a ban-able offence in other forums?<br>There's a hell lot of guys here whom I find pretty smart, and I'm sure that they aren't employed in places that truely realise and allow them to use their talent. Don't make the mistake of assuming yourself to be a *special* one and go around bad-mouthing others.</div>
