            <div class='col-md body'>Such a fanatical all out scenario might become possible in the days ahead.  All it needs is a coup, or a change in power in the respective governments to move such an action.  The trigger would probably be overt Singaporean support for a "UN" lead action against certain muslim states.<br><br>Personally, I feel that we should have accurate intelligence of TNI forces in Malaysia.  And whether we have enough firepower to bear on them.  Also, we will have to maintain complete maritime surveillance to keep the two forces as far apart as possible, at the same time, cut C3I between the two forces.  In otherwords, complete destruction or takeover of non-friendly communications equipment and facilities.  This I believe will be within our limits.<br><br>Once this is achieved, we need only concentrate on breaking one enemy, forcing them to surrender.  The means?  Its up to your creativity and imagination.  Once one of them surrenders or signs a "Cease-fire," the other might not be as compelled to pursue a war which his ally has gave up on.<br><br>Calling for international assistance is a must.  However, holding out the period, (totally unknown length of time it takes for a resolution),  would be the risky part.  As it depends on us being able to delay and defend until "help" arrives.  Which means the war would be fought in at least two phases, a military phase: Green light to blow away and take land, and a political phase: Restrained action by SAF, and fight a preferably mobile defence, and launching deadly counter-attacks that hopefully can wear them down.<br><br>Which means, a swift and complete victory in a military sense might not be what we want to achieve.  But a victory with as few consequences and backlashes as possible, may be what we really need.<br><br>And as what tripwire suggests, covert operations that take out the political leadership.  How?  Well, we can learn a few tricks from Israel.</div>

S-S missiles are not exactly as plentiful as 7.62 shorts...<br><br>the whole point of having a fortified objective, be it a hill or a beach, is to hold that area and enhance the survivability of troops on it. it they can be simply taken out through saturation of firepower, then u have to take the "fortified" out of the objective...<br><br>and China's S-S missiles are not exactly tomahawks u know... one shot one kill? get real. the kidd class destroyers can already engage them. the ones who gets through may not be enough to cause the substantial damage u suggest.<br><br><blockquote>2) massive air moves to gain air superioty in the Taiwan's strait with it's Su 30. The taiwan F-16 and Mirange isnt matchable to the SU. Air bombardment on to the beaches will be done.</blockquote>again, don't underestimate taiwan's AA capabilities. the defender always has certain advantage. i wouldn't write off their air force so easily.<br><br><blockquote>3) Strike they will call.

With StS missile in to the beaches ..taiwan will be outnumbered 4 to 1.( their amphibious assault quite hot leh.....look at they excersise abt 10,000 at a time......)</blockquote>yes, they have the men, but they don't have the ships to bring them all there at once. china has always been weak in this. muster fishing boats? don't bother... they'll be shot out of the water if they fail to gain control of the air and the sea and it is still questionable if they can do that with 7th fleet between them.<br><br>and what about logistics? we don't know the state of their logistics effectiveness. they may suk for all we know. they'll fry if troops manage to land but supplies and reinforcements don't reach them fast enough. u're not moving toy soldiers on a board here.<br><br>again, i disagree with your estimates of casualties from S-S missiles. how are they supposed to secure a beach head if they can't overwhelm an the defending garrisons on the beaches?<br><br><blockquote><br>4)Commando will clear the way by air drop into middle taiwan.</blockquote>again, assumption. if they're dropped and the beach head fails to materialised, they'll be slaughtered.<br><br><blockquote>5)Kilos and their 'Anti-Aegis' destroyer will block all trade route to taiwan from the Phillipines and japan....Kilo will block US support ship to.</blockquote>do we have reasons to believe that a few kilo diesel subs can block 7th fleet? in fact, i see a lot of dead chinese submariners if they should decide to escalate by firing at US ships.<br><br><blockquote>6) massive airdrop along the way into taiwan....surrender form will be send.</blockquote>u drop propaganda pamphlets only if u're winning. they may not win and it will further piss of the taiwanese. psychological warfare is not as simple as dropping leaflets asking your enemies to surrender. timing is everything.<br><br><blockquote>i can confirm something lor....China will not so easy use Nuke one.....i dun think Nuke will be use lor....China want taiwan back.....no a taiwanese waste land..</blockquote>then they can't win and if they can't win, they won't initiate a disaster fully knowing that it will be exactly that.<br><br><blockquote>then the war may not be stage in this Ten years time...Because for the olympics......in 2008...unless no choice ...if US intevent to much....</blockquote>don't be shallow. Beijing is more than willing to tolerate American presence here. lots of noise and table banging but they know they can't do shit about anything until they're stronger and to be strong, u need to engage, not renegade. and how exactly would u define "too much" ? Washington isn't stupid. they didn't give Taipei a blank cheque u know... so all parties are restrained in many ways.<br>[/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>China would not want to take taiwan back through military actions.  PRC knows that a forced reunification will not serve its purpose at all.  PRC must first be able to catch up with ROC in terms of economy and development, thus PRC would not hastily launch any attack to secure Taiwan.<br><br>But, along the line of discussion.  China will be unlikely to mount a successful invasion of Taiwan at all.  Be it theirs superior number of SSMs, and 2nd generation fighters, or their Navy without carrier.  The fact that the US always has an Aegis platform parked in Taiwan almost negates the potency of the SSMs.  Taiwans fighter, are mostly state of the art western designs, can almost assure air-superiority over their Land.  China, being unable to achieve air supermacy, and unable to bombard coastal forts, will only see their expeditionary force sunk.<br><br>Reminds me of the battle of britain.  The Germans actually had more planes, and most of them equal to their Brit counter-parts.<br><br>PRC pilots would eject at sea, hopin for rescue, while ROC pilots would land in friendly territory.<br><br>From the way it looks, PRC will rule out the military option to invade Taiwan.  At most, they will run Special operations against Taiwan, but nothing else.</div>

As many of you know, southern Thailand suffers from some unrest since it is a mostly Muslim region in a largely Buddhist nation. If this region decides to secede to Malaysia, ethnic violence flares up, and the Malaysian Armed Forces decide to intervene, such a limited conflict is conceivable. Incidentally, the Malaysian media also use Thailand and even Indonesia as bogeymen, not just Singapore. This is business as usual in most democracies. Dirty business, but still business.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> a scenario between malaysia and thailand... is not entertaining...  becos.. the thais will simply tied MAF up like a bondage girl and pull out the whips..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The last scenario that is possible is Malaysia vs Indonesia, or Brunei + Malaysia vs Indonesia. This might be the result of the central government in Java losing control, or being toppled in a coup, and the various provinces and islands splintering into many smaller officially or unofficially autonomous bodies. Once such a Pandora's box opens, East Malaysia may be under low level siege from numerous irregulars, and Brunei may get dragged in. Singapore may then pile on, since we are allies with Brunei and friends with Malaysia. This would be a guerilla war with onerous rules of engagement -- Vietnam writ large. This is actually the kind of fight that SAF is really bad at, and TNI is really good at.
