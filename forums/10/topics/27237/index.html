SINGAPORE will still be finished...<br><br>to win..... there is a way... but obviously i am not interested in expounding that here... but understandably... i would consider nothing less than total occupation of peninsula malaysia, disarming it and then break malaysia up into a dozen new state if not more...  i might even consider some rapid demographical changes to make sure that malaysia will never reappear....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course it is true that the actual battle plan will depend on the situation we actually encounter. However, since this is a scenario, I am only quoting the most likely response that I think the SAF would take. Any real response would probably be some variation on it.<br><br>It is an open secret that SAF relies upon preemptive strike to defend Singapore. If there is even the <span style="font-style: italic;">threat</span> of war, we must strike immediately to create the strategic depth we need to defend Singapore. So, actually yes, we <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> a rather trigger-happy nation in a manner of speaking. Once we announce that we feel that we have been threatened with war, the other side has about three hours before the 50k active duty NSmen and regulars begin their assault to convince us that we should not attack. That is why Singapore has been called a "doomsday machine" and why our neighbors make so much noise about our military posture.<br><br>An attack on Riau would be costly and dilute our strength, but it would unfortunately also be completely necessary. We cannot allow the enemy to gain a foothold so close to the mainland. Standoff weapons like MLRS (and maybe even ERBB artillery shells) can even be launched from there directly into Singapore and it is an ideal staging point for ambhibious invasion. I disagree that a Riau invasion can be skipped.<br><br>In any protracted conflict against both Malaysia and Indonesia, we will eventually lose if we are drawn into a war of attrition. That is why my suggested response aims for a rapid diplomatic resolution to the conflict. By conducting a limited military action, with clearly defensive goals and minimizing civilian casualties, it is easier to present our case that we are the victims. By quickly taking and maintaining the initiative, we force the other parties to the negotiating table from a position of strength.<br><br>You suggest annexing Malaysia. This would be a military victory, but a total and devastating political defeat. That would kill Singapore more surely than a nuclear attack. Such actions are simply not acceptable any more. At the very least, we will become an embargoed and impoverished pariah state and face decades of a new Confrontasi against our neighbors. At the worst, we will face an armed international coalition, with the US at its head. Take your pick. I'd rather not. I do not even want to ask what you mean by inducing a "rapid demographical change" in annexed Malaysia.<br><br>In fact, the problem of "what do we do once we get there" is the biggest problem the SAF faces. We can easily defeat our neighbors militarily, but we have no follow-on option. We cannot hold their land, especially in the face of a hostile populace. Remember that every NS soldier out there means one less worker at home -- we cannot fight protracted conflicts because of our force structure. While decades of uneasy UN mediated peace is not ideal, it is probably the best option, if combined with a heavily policed DMZ. Our neighbors would accede to such a peace because the alternative is far worse -- we can DESTROY them if we wanted to (though we would destroy ourselves in the process -- doomsday machine again). That is why even when we are crying for peace, we must also bay for war.<br><br>The issue of war reparations after a war is always thorny. Is the goal justice, or welfare? It might be just to drag out all the responsible parties and have them shot, but it might lead to more misunderstanding, hatred and eventually suffering. The reverse may also be true. And do not be too quick in assuming that it would be the other side that starts the conflict. It may be our side, or neither side, or both sides, or even a third or fourth party. Things are never that clear cut anyway. I won't try to cover this issue since what kind of war reparations (or war trials) should be sought after a conflict depends too strongly on the specifics of the conflict.<br><br>The damage from any such conflict would be incalculable. Fortunately, such a conflict is also very unlikely. All three sides know how futile the Mexican standoff that would result would be, and there is no advantage to any party to start a war. Nevertheless, it is an interesting scenario from a geopolitical standpoint.</div>

Is the goal justice, or welfare? It might be just to drag out all the responsible parties and have them shot, but it might lead to more misunderstanding, hatred and eventually suffering. The reverse may also be true. And do not be too quick in assuming that it would be the other side that starts the conflict. It may be our side, or neither side, or both sides, or even a third or fourth party. Things are never that clear cut anyway. I won't try to cover this issue since what kind of war reparations (or war trials) should be sought after a conflict depends too strongly on the specifics of the conflict.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> war reparation is unncessary..... because... i doubt malaysia will have anything left to give us after we are through hurling rains of fire on their land... but PEACE should be the ultimate aim... NOT reparations...  in a settlement.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> secondly... it doesnt matter who started the war... the important thing is to end it fast and do watever is neccesarry to prevent another war in the future...<br><br>The damage from any such conflict would be incalculable. Fortunately, such a conflict is also very unlikely. All three sides know how futile the Mexican standoff that would result would be, and there is no advantage to any party to start a war. Nevertheless, it is an interesting scenario from a geopolitical standpoint.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> unfortunately... events can change like the weather... unexpectably...... its best to keep all options open then just simply bite on that mersing line...</div>

RSN will then need to create a maritime perimeter around Singapore to the south with air support.

Helimobile Guards and airborne Commandoes should be dropped ahead in the area to recce, disrupt enemy formations and call airstrikes and artillery barrages. Strategic objectives such as water pumping works and power generation stations will be captured intact as far as possible by follow on infantry units. Surround urban areas and persuade isolated enemy units inside without food, water or power to surrender. Contain them and all civilians there until they do, or attack if we have access to overwhelming force. We cannot afford pitched urban combat, and we are not fighting a war of occupation.

I do not believe that Malaysia and Indonesia would attack us in such a suicidal and fanatical manner that they will not come to the negotiating table when faced with the threat of destruction. I do not think that actually destroying them would be necessary (especially since we'd destroy ourselves in the process). In particular, I disagree with your disapproval of UMNO. I actually like UMNO -- they are relatively rational, reasonable and cooperative. They have more of a tendency toward politics than the PAP at home, and still use Singapore as a bogeyman. However, that's because there are NO politics in Singapore, making Singaporeans very thin skinned (we are a lot less democratic than the guys up north). As far as these things go, I think that UMNO is OK.

An invasion of the Riau islands would definitely be required in any conflict where there is a southern threat.<br><br>Innocent_Malaysian, you really need to do a bit of reading up before you post about military matters here. Singapore alone has nearly twice as many warplanes and tanks than Malaysia and Indonesia *combined*, and our equipment is more capable and better maintained. We have more than twice the number of troops as Malaysia. Our navy has more anti-ship missile tubes than both nations combined, and our missiles are more accurate and have longer range. There is a lot more, but I've said enough. The only nation in SEA that is stronger than Singapore militarily is Thailand. I can see that you're trying to be patriotic, but the best way to do that is to confine your discussions to reality.<br><br>want to know, whether or not we could keep any territory we capture in the course of defending ourself depends on what form diplomacy takes when peace is negotiated. It is unlikely though, since the UN Charter forbids it. If anything, the land may be owned by no one (that's what a DMZ basically is).<br><br>Again, while we may be able to defeat our neighbors militarily, it would serve no purpose. In the process we would destroy ourselves. It is a much smaller version of MAD -- mutually assured destruction.</div>

Its definitely not Thailand, not Brunei either. To suggest countries from out of the region would be ridiculous. Whos left? Indonesia and Malaysia naturally. Malaysia + Singapore + Indonesia = Powerful Force? Please, Malaysia and Indonesia combined won't even have half the SAF's numbers. The reason we are comparing is exactly because we are so close together. You wanna compare Singapore with China or USA? Go ahead.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OK, tripwire, you've made yourself clear. I guess we just have to agree to disagree  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  I simply am less paranoid about our neighbors than you and do believe that they will behave decently (or at least rationally) if any conflict occurs. However, if the situation becomes critical, then I agree that the doomsday machine will have to go into action  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Actually, an equally interesting scenario would be SEA vs China, centered around the Spratleys. Right now, this is very unlikely, since China does not even have the power projection capability to invade Taiwan (their probable first priority). However, if this changes, it would be interesting to consider this.<br><br>Yet another interesting scenario is Thailand vs Malaysia. As many of you know, southern Thailand suffers from some unrest since it is a mostly Muslim region in a largely Buddhist nation. If this region decides to secede to Malaysia, ethnic violence flares up, and the Malaysian Armed Forces decide to intervene, such a limited conflict is conceivable. Incidentally, the Malaysian media also use Thailand and even Indonesia as bogeymen, not just Singapore. This is business as usual in most democracies. Dirty business, but still business.<br><br>The last scenario that is possible is Malaysia vs Indonesia, or Brunei + Malaysia vs Indonesia. This might be the result of the central government in Java losing control, or being toppled in a coup, and the various provinces and islands splintering into many smaller officially or unofficially autonomous bodies. Once such a Pandora's box opens, East Malaysia may be under low level siege from numerous irregulars, and Brunei may get dragged in. Singapore may then pile on, since we are allies with Brunei and friends with Malaysia. This would be a guerilla war with onerous rules of engagement -- Vietnam writ large. This is actually the kind of fight that SAF is really bad at, and TNI is really good at. Again, interesting to consider, even if President Megawati's government seems solid at present.</div>

Singapore has always been relatively quiet during regional turmoils, and I don't see any significant advantages in joining such a war. Maybe we'll get the Riau Islands, but very unlikely. As mentioned,  SAF is not "built" to fight a prolonged jungle war, and to do so could be disastrous.<br><br>From what I see, Indonesia won't have a problem with someone else. The war that is most likely to happen will be their internal uprisings. If lets say Indonesia sends its troops overseas for war, there is bound to be rising tensions in the country. With their armed forces actively deployed elsewhere, Indonesia would literally eat itself out, so I doubt they would be of any "threat".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh, one small correction, tripwire. We were the 1st country in the world to have a towed 52 cal 155mm artillery piece in our orbat, the really nice FH2000. However, many nations now have this weapon, and it is not hard to obtain it. We are no longer the only country to manufacture towed 52 cal 155mm artillery either. In addition, many countries had self-propelled (SP) 52 cal 155mm artillery before us, just not towed pieces. The US is one example.</div>
