              <p>I always feel that the PAP government is very similar to the Qing dynasty, in fact PAP is even worst than the Qing dynasty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. The Qing dynasty sell their country to the foreigners so does the PAP. The difference is that the Qing dynasty did not want to sell their country to the foreigners. They were being bullied by the foreigners and forced to do so as they are military weaker than the foreigners and they did put a good fight against the foreigners. The PAP voluntarily sell our country to the foreigners.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the PAP is worst than the Qing dynasty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. The Qing dynasty is ruled by an Emperor who have absolute power. The PAP is ruled by an Emperor too who have absolute power too which I don't need to say the name you all should know who it is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. At the ending of the Qing dynasty, it is ruled by an old and stupid woman by the name of Cixi. At the ending of the PAP, it is ruled by an old and stupid man by the surname of LEE</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. This old woman think that she is very smart and refuse to listen to all other right advice and think that she is always right. Similary, this old man controlling the PAP thinks that he is very smart and he is always right.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. The Qing dynasty is corrupted so is the PAP. But the PAP is smarter. They are corrupted but they do it in a legal way. They increase their own salary and say that they must get high salary to prevent corruption.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They are more hypocritical than the Qing dynasty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6. Many heroes such as Hong Xiuquan came out to set up the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom to overthrow the evail Qing dynasty which nearly overthrowed the Qing dynasty but failed in the end. Than came a hero call Sun Yat Sen who succeeded to overthrow the Qing dynasty and set up a real democratic country. Although his revolution failed 10 times, he did not give up and persisted in his revolution and in the end, he succeeded. Sun Yat Sen was a hero who really put the interest of his country above himself. He could have declared himself Emperor when he overthrow the Qing dynasty but he did not do so. In fact he voluntarily step down as President and after Yuan Shikai was overthrowed, the people wanted him to become President only than did he become the President.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many heroes such as Dr Chee, Mr Chiam, Mr Low arose in singapore to overthrow the evil PAP but they did not succeed. But don't despair. Eventually, there will be a hero who will arise in our country like Sun Yat Sen who will overthrow the evil PAP and establish a truly democratic country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The time will come soon because the end of the PAP is coming soon</p>

              <p>PAP = Qing Dynasty ?</p>
              <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/history/qing.htm">Qing Dynasty </a>was a continuous series of successors from the bloodline of a single Royal Family that began in 1616 till 1911.</p>
              <p>The PAP has no royal blood and claims no title to any.</p>
              <p>The PAP Government is a grouping of individuals hanging on to political power through sheer instinct at political survival.</p>
              <p>If there is any comparison for Singapore, it has to be renamed as the Singapore Lee Dynasty to the North Korea Kim Dynasty - as the lines are close enough.</p>
              <p>Both adopt the Stalinist grip on the political life of the country and its people.</p>
              <p>Both government depend on the secret police to keep tabs on the activities of their communities and society at large.</p>
              <p>Both rely on paranoid and monopolistic grip over all press and broadcast medias.</p>
              <p>Both believe in the supremacy of the vision and talent of the Supreme Leader.</p>
              <p>Both supreme leaders believe in their infinite relevance and importance for the proper advancement of the country.</p>
              <p>Both believe in the supremacy of their genetic lineage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reviewing the leadership succession path of Singapore and North Korea, it bears close resemblance except that the Singapore version had to take a modest interval to conceal the obvious.</p>
              <p>Prior to LHL stepping into politics, his meteoric rise through the military was beyond comparision to any military except in North Korea.</p>

              <p> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/dprk/leadership-succession.htm">North Korean Leadership succession </a>is almost similar to Singapore's - with the Supreme Leader making his selection of his own son, and the preparation work begins. </p>
              <p>The propaganda machinery will go into overtime, the career path is prepared to allow for a polished image that shines with leadership quality.</p>
              <p>Before Kim Jong-il succeeded his father Kim Il-sung, the father had arranged for junior to take on some leadership role in the center of all North Korean political and military affairs.</p>
              <p>At least in North Korea, there were at least two coup attempts ti remove the father and son Kims, but traitors and carpet beggars revealed the plots, the conspirators died horrible deaths.</p>
              <p>After <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il-sung">Kim Il-sung </a>died in 1994, Kim Jong-il succession was not immediate, and had to be cautiously stage-managed, with him not appearing for more then eight months after the death of his father.</p>
              <p>Now, that Kim Jong-il's health is said to be deteriorating, he has announced his choice of successor by naming his 24-year old second son - Kim Jong-un, who was educated in Berne, Switzerland; and said to be an introvert</p>
              <p>Without any military training, young <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.newstin.co.uk/rel/uk/en-010-015163198">Kim Jong-un </a>has now been <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/06/113_47168.html">appointed as Military Chief of North Korean Armed Forces </a>- which parallels the efforts in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> <em>North Korea's new 24 year old Military Chief</em>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The North Koreans have seen the third successive generation providing political leadership for the country.</p>
              <p>Will this ignite the vain ambitions of the Old Man of Singapore ?</p>

              <p>You must be joking at the same time being too kind to LKY ?</p>
              <p>If he is the Constitutional Monarch, why is tax payers' money wasted in paying President Nathan more than the wages paid to his own son PM LHL ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>If at all, LKY is attempting to be Chairman Mao - not King George V the father of England's Queen Elizabeth - and the democratic practices is no better than the people's democracy practised in Communist China that assures the supermacy of China's Communist Party.</p>
              <p>Singapore's politics is neither a Constitutional Monarchy nor a democracy in any form - as the politics in Singapore is that of Stalinism, which is practised successfully by the North Koreans, as there is a successive lineage compared to Stalin's inability to ensure his own to succeed him.</p>
