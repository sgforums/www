Just follow what Taiwan has been doing in going into computerizations as their major push into science and technology. They did it in a total master plan employing holistic manpower and educational strategy.<br><br>At least we can use the empty lands or factories to put these resources to good use, like allowing the unemployed to occupy them on short leases to produce agri products that will substitute our food and livestock import bills.

How much can you earn growing vegetables? You cannot do chickens because of bird flu and pig farming can pollute the environment....<br><br>No, I would support the use of empty factories for higher value goods...question is, what goods?
