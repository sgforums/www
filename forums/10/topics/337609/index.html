              <p class="first">SINGAPORE, Nov 18, 2008 (AFP) - Singapore's budget deficit could be three times larger than initially estimated this year partly because of the global economic turmoil, the finance minister said in comments released Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The government originally projected a deficit of 800 million dollars (524 million US) this fiscal year but expenditures are now expected to be significantly higher than budgeted, Tharman Shanmugaratnam said.</p>
              <p>"We should therefore expect a significantly larger deficit in FY08 (fiscal year 2008) -- possibly more than three times larger than the initially estimated 800 million dollars," he said in a written response to a question raised in Parliament on Monday.</p>
              <p>There may be some dampening of revenues in view of lower-than-expected economic growth and more subdued property transactions, especially in the last two quarters of the fiscal year, the minister said.</p>
              <p>At the same time, government expenses have risen with an August announcement that cash handouts to ease the burden of a rising cost of living would be increased by 50 percent along with electricity rebates, Shanmugaratnam said.</p>
              <p>In August the government also announced a doubling of spending on incentives to address a severe shortage of babies. These measures and "higher cost factors in infrastructural projects" have also contributed to the higher deficit, he said.</p>
              <p>"The larger deficit is an appropriate fiscal stance in the context of an economy that has entered a slowdown," he said. "We will be able to fund the larger deficit from the surpluses we accumulated in FY07, when we had unexpectedly higher revenues."</p>
              <p>Singapore, which is already in recession, could experience negative growth next year, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned on Sunday.</p>
              <p>To help deal with the downturn and to prepare for the future, the government is bringing forward its budget from February to January, Lee said. The proposed budget will include measures to support growth and jobs, strengthen business competitiveness and stimulate domestic demand, he said.</p>

              <p><br>Reverse Psychology apply here, top private sector jobs will slack in time of recession, therefore, most get removed or paid cuts. But during a recession, our talented pools in the Govt get busy in trying to find the correct words and phrases to console the citizens and also in way putting their talents into great use, most important on the project  "how to tax the citizens more in time of recession". And that need talent mind that no school every taught. So we should pay them more for such initiatives.</p>

              <p>They pay themselves millions and millions to avoid corruption and LKY believes to pay high high to get the best people to work.    These are just lame excuses, indirectly it can be viewed as corruption in itself.    Sorry, but I don't see any talent among the Pay and Pay's ministers.  But if you are talking about money making then I agree they do have the talent to explore in many areas to earn quick big bucks out of the public.</p>
              <p>I don't believe lee hsien loong can help "fix " the economy, he just can't make it lah.   If he is that capable, he will not need at least 3  ministers to assist him - they are his papa, LKY, Goh C T, Wong Can't Sing, Lee Boon Heng , did I miss out any ministers??</p>
