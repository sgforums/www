                                      Pressure Builds on Singapore's System</p>
              <p>by Hugo Restall</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">During the National Day festivities last month, Singapore
                                    Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s gloomy prognosis
                                    for the economy — a “bumpy year” ahead — was
                                    overshadowed by even more dire warnings that the city state
                                  is about to start running low on its main resource, people. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">With an aging society and one of the lowest fertility
                                    rates in the world at 1.29, the government is pulling out
                                    all the stops, doubling the budget of baby-making incentives
                                    to $1.13 billion. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Meanwhile, in order to make Singapore a more tolerant
                                    and pluralistic place, political videos will be allowed,
                                    as well as protests in a downtown park.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It’s all straight from the ruling People’s
                                    Action Party’s standard playbook. Play up the anxiety
                                    of a small nation beset on all sides, in need of a strong
                                    government to take positive action to avert disaster. <br> <br> Individual
                                    citizens who are failing to live up to the expectations
                                    of society need to be brought back into line. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">At the same time, leaders are willing to give those citizens
                                    a few of their rights back, as long as they are not used
                                    to undermine harmony.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Since
                                      Mr Lee took over the premiership in 2004, Singaporeans
                                      have been watching for any sign
                                      he plans to reform substantially
                                    the authoritarian state created by his father, Singapore’s
                                    founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">So far there has been little indication that in his heart
                                    the prime minister is a liberal democrat. But the system
                                    of control is coming under increasing stress due to the
                                    changing structure of society. A process of subtle change
                                    will continue to be driven by pressure from below, rather
                                    than a change of heart at the top.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Last
                                      month’s gestures far fall short of lifting
                                    what the opposition calls the climate of fear—past
                                    experience, such as the detention of former Solicitor General
                                    Francis Seow in 1988, suggests that retribution for challenging
                                    the PAP can come in many forms, from bureaucratic harassment
                                    to detention without trial under the Internal Security
                                    Act. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The government is making a virtue out of necessity by
                                    lifting the 10-year-old ban on making or showing political
                                    films, and allowing political podcasts during election
                                    campaigns. Oppositionists were successfully skirting the
                                    restrictions, so that they only served to hamstring the
                                    PAP's own efforts to utilise online media. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
                                      opening of a protest area is a token gesture, which no
                                      doubt will be raised to deflect international
                                      criticism
                                    the next time police arrest dissident politician Chee Soon
                                    Juan for illegal assembly. In that sense, the move suggested
                                    that Mr. Chee’s campaign of civil disobedience is
                                    causing some heartburn within the regime.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">But
                                      the real problem is not Mr. Chee — the stressors
                                    on Singapore’s political machine lie elsewhere. The
                                    PAP’s legitimacy has always rested on its performance,
                                    backed by trust in the party. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Given its chaotic past and neighbours, Lee Kuan Yew argued,
                                    the tiny country could not afford the risks associated
                                    with liberal democracy. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In the past that argument was largely taken at face value
                                    by the Chinese working class, despite the experiences of
                                    other Asian nations that contradicted it. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Today,
                                      however, there is more apathy than agreement. No one
                                      seriously questions the PAP’s track record of
                                    governance or probity of its top leaders, yet trust is
                                    giving way to resentment at the party’s arrogance.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
                                      main proof is in the erosion of the party’s
                                    share of the popular vote in elections. In 2006, it hit
                                    66.6%, down from 75% in 2001, and 75.6% in 1980. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In the past, opposition parties deliberately refrained
                                    from contesting more than half of the seats, since they
                                    found that while some Singaporeans wanted to cast a protest
                                    vote, they would not vote for the opposition if there was
                                    any chance the PAP would be thrown out of office. <br> <br> But in
                                    2006, the opposition contest 47 of 84 seats, suggesting
                                    that the PAP’s hold on voters’ loyalty is not
                                    as fearsome as before.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Why is this? For one thing, Singaporeans are better versed
                                    in critical thinking. During the 1980s and '90s, people
                                    may have grown wealthy, but they remained politically unsophisticated.
                                    Development happened so quickly that it took decades for
                                    education levels to catch up. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">According to the government statistics, between 1990 and
                                    2005 the percentage of the population with a university
                                    degree grew to 17% from 4.5%. <br> <br> That is matched by an even
                                    more dramatic shift in individual age cohorts — in
                                    2005, 32.1% of 30-34 year olds had a university degree,
                                    as compared to just 6.6% of 50-54 year olds. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The language spoken at home is now predominantly English,
                                    meaning that Singaporeans are increasingly able to learn
                                    about and interact with the outside world.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Moreover, the PAP has pushed the economic structure of
                                    the country in a direction that is no longer win-win for
                                    all classes. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">A certain
                                      amount of economic inequality is tolerable as long as
                                      there is a sense that everyone’s
                                      lives are improving. But inequality and real hardship
                                      are on the
                                    rise, as inflation running at 6.5% erases the 3.3% wage
                                    gains that the poorest tenth of the population enjoyed
                                    last year, even as the top tenth picked up an 11.1% increase
                                    in income. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">PAP
                                      loyalists control a lucrative web of government-linked
                                      companies, while ministers have also
                                      picked up big pay
                                    rises, since their salaries are indexed to the private
                                    sector, making them some of the world’s highest paid
                                    politicians. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Scholars predominate</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">As for social mobility, the top scholarships, which are
                                    a ticket into the elite, increasingly go to students from
                                    wealthy families that live in private apartments, rather
                                    than public housing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Despite this trend, the PAP is unwilling to dismantle
                                    its policies of holding wages low in order to attract multinational
                                    companies to invest. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">This
                                      was a strategy born of necessity in the 1960s, when Singapore
                                      was short of capital and struggling
                                      to catch
                                    up with Hong Kong’s model of creating an export-oriented
                                    growth. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Today it is economically obsolete, yet it suits the government
                                    politically because the combination of state-owned companies
                                    and politically quiescent multinationals prevents the emergence
                                    of an independent commercial class that might push for
                                    political change.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The result is a top-down economy which is running up against
                                    the limits of its capacity to drive growth. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Without
                                      an entrepreneurial class and successful home-grown companies,
                                      Singapore’s productivity
                                      growth has historically lagged behind that of its laissez-faire
                                    twin, Hong Kong. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">As University of Chicago economist Alwyn Young showed
                                    in a 1992 paper, Singapore had one of the lowest returns
                                    on physical capital in the world. <br> <br> Its growth has been fueled
                                    by forced savings programs shoveling ever increasing amounts
                                    of capital into the furnace, rather than by innovation
                                    or managerial efficiency.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Diffuse dissatisfaction? - Give away money</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Mr.
                                      Lee’s administration has found
                                      that the only way to defuse public dissatisfaction is
                                      to do something
                                    the PAP consistently condemned as the hallmark of Western
                                    democracies: Give away money. <br> <br> The government used to damn
                                    welfare as a dirty word, yet transfer spending is on the
                                    rise. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">This
                                      year, $2.1b in giveaways were planned. Then last month
                                      Mr. Lee announced a 50% increase, totaling
                                      $179.8m,
                                    in utility rebates and “growth dividends” — cash
                                    payments to households that started in 2006. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
                                      new prime minister has brought in other social spending
                                      programs for the poor. For instance in
                                      the 2008 budget,
                                    the Ministry of Manpower’s expenditure rose by 184%,
                                    almost entirely due to a new scheme of workfare, the $306
                                    million Income Security Policy Programme.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
                                      pressure for more entitlements will only grow as retirees
                                      find that their savings do not
                                      provide enough of a cushion.
                                    The compulsory government-run Central Provident Fund sucked
                                    up a huge percentage of income to finance the state’s
                                    development goals, but offered dismally low returns. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">As a result, many of the generation that built the Singapore
                                    miracle now finds itself eking out a retirement in public
                                    housing while the government surpluses remain under the
                                    management of the PAP.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Beside the carrot, there is also a stick. Starting in
                                    1985, the PAP began to warn voters that if they supported
                                    the opposition, their government-built apartment buildings
                                    would not get priority for maintenance. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">This was gradually refined to the point that in 1997,
                                    then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong explicitly campaigned
                                    on the promise that individual precincts would get housing
                                    renovation spending according to their votes. When the
                                    US State Department condemned this as undemocratic, the
                                    interference of foreigners was used as another rallying
                                    cry.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Indeed, it seems that Singapore is increasingly cursed
                                    with the shortcomings of a democracy without enjoying the
                                    benefits. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">During
                                      the 2006 campaign, Prime Minister Lee inadvertently blurted
                                      out his fears of what would
                                      happen if there were
                                    more opposition members of parliament: “Instead of
                                    spending my time thinking what is the right policy for
                                    Singapore, I’m going to spend all my time thinking
                                    what’s the right way to fix them, to buy my supporters’ votes….” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Putting
                                      aside the ominous sound of “fixing” opponents,
                                    the remark was ironic because the PAP now expends so much
                                    effort to buy the support of the populace with giveaways,
                                    all in order to avoid the transparency and accountability
                                    that a vibrant opposition would bring.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Some younger Singaporeans with skills respond to this
                                    by voting with their feet, moving abroad to find greater
                                    freedom and a higher standard of living working with the
                                    kind of entrepreneurial companies that Singapore has yet
                                    to create. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In order to eventually win some of them back, the possibility
                                    of recognising dual nationality is increasingly discussed,
                                    a move that would represent a huge concession for a nation-building
                                    party that demands self-reliance and sacrifice of its citizenry.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In
                                      the place of the émigrés,
                                      foreign workers are flooding in to man the factories,
                                      docks and construction
                                    sites, as the government steadily opens the doors wider.
                                    Foreign workers already account for more than one million
                                    of the total population of 4.6 million. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Among the immigrants are talented individuals like the
                                    Chinese table tennis players who provided the country with
                                    its first Olympic medal last month. But they lack the loyalty
                                    to the country that the PAP has put a premium on.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">If Singapore were a plural democracy, it would no doubt
                                    have developed an independent civil society capable of
                                    binding together the native-born and immigrants, providing
                                    mutual support. <br> <br> But the PAP and Lee Kuan Yew are like the
                                    African baobab tree, whose spreading canopy hogs the sun
                                    and prevents other trees from growing up underneath. <br> Alienated, rootless society</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Such
                                      a society may be easier to control, but it is also alienated
                                      and rootless, jealous of others’ gains—the
                                    oft-quoted national characteristic, kiasu, literally means “fear
                                    of losing.” In a developed economy that depends on
                                    attracting and retaining creative individuals, this has
                                    become a significant handicap.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
                                      arrogance of the winners in society is becoming a major
                                      issue. The elder Mr. Lee’s
                                      ego is legendary, but given his accomplishments it is
                                    perhaps understandable. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">When
                                      his minions take on similar airs, however, it is a different
                                      story. In one extreme example
                                      two years ago,
                                    a furor erupted after the daughter of MP Wee Siew Kim used
                                    her blog to berate a man afraid of losing his job as “one
                                    of many wretched, undermotivated, overassuming leeches
                                    in our country” who should “get out of my elite
                                    uncaring face.” To make matters worse, Mr. Wee tried
                                    to defend her remarks.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Naturally the PAP is aware of these trends and that its
                                    monopoly on power has become an important issue in itself.
                                    Over the years it has tried to come up with mechanisms
                                    for citizens to register their complaints and blow off
                                    steam. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
                                      government no longer seeks to destroy all opposition,
                                      leaving alone and even praising those
                                      tame MPs who focus
                                    on constituents’ issues rather than the PAP’s
                                    system of social control. Yet ultimately there is no solution
                                    to this problem, since the party is unwilling to share
                                    power in any meaningful sense.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">A siege mentality has been the hallmark of Singaporean
                                    politics for four decades, often with good justification
                                    given hostile neighboring governments to the north and
                                    south. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Yet it is increasingly hard today to see how that anxiety
                                    can be justified and maintained. The generation now coming
                                    onto the political scene grew up in at least moderate prosperity,
                                    and may not be so easily bullied into voting for the PAP. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It is eager to put down roots and create a civil society.
                                    So far the PAP has finessed this aspiration without compromising
                                    its control.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Prime Minister Lee can afford to be sanguine for now,
                                    with the security apparatus, corporatist economy and civil
                                    service all at his command. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Yet if this economic downturn worsens, he will be confronted
                                    with a more difficult choice of whether to accede to demands
                                    for greater pluralism. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">As
                                      academic Michael Haas once wrote, “Whenever the
                                    public exercises the independence of thought that better
                                    education brings, ‘a danger to be nipped in the bud’ or
                                    some similar cliché is articulated as the basis
                                    for repression.” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It
                                      bears remembering that the laws like the Internal Security
                                      Act that have been used in past
                                      such exercises remain on
                                    the books. If pushed too hard, Lee Hsien Loong still has
                                    the means to prove he is his father’s son.<br> Mr. Restall is editor of the REVIEW.</span></p>

              <p>to ask that question means you're not ready to know the answer.. the URL says it all.</p>
              <p>The article presents a fair review of Singapore's political landscape. However, it failed to mention the crux of its citizen's dissatisfaction... high salary of the minister coupled with their incompetence and insensitivity to the general population; and the unwillingness of the government to hold them accountable.</p>
              <p><br>My thoughts are that before LKY dies (which is a matter of time), LHL had better shore up his reputation and earn the people's respect. His shielding of Wong, Wee, Mah, especially Ho and the many incompetent cronies is only going to cost him politically.<br>The opposition may not be ready but they are slowly gaining momentum where the current party is loosing.</p>
              <p>The current party is the incumbent but has done nothing to strengthen their position with the people; instead, they chose loyalty and partisan over accountability.</p>
