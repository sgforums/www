              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>John Perkins calls himself a former economic hit
              man. He has seen the signs of today’s financial meltdown before. The
              subprime mortgage fiasco, the collapse of the banking industry, the
              rising unemployment rate—these are all familiar to him.</p>
              <p>Perkins was on the front lines of monitoring and helping create
              these very events that were once just confined to the third world. From
              ’71 to 1981, he worked for the international consulting firm Chas T.
              Main, where he was a self-described “economic hit man.” It was based in
              Boston.</p>
              <p>He’s the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, <em>Confessions of an Economic Hit Man</em> and <em>The Secret History of the American Empire</em>. Well, he’s out with a new book. It’s called <em>Hoodwinked: An Economic Hit Man Reveals Why the World Financial Markets Imploded—and What We Need to Do to Remake Them</em>.</p>
              <p>He joins me here in the firehouse studio.</p>
              <p>Welcome, John. Well, for starters, though we’ve discussed this before, what exactly does an “economic hit man” mean?</p>
              <p><strong>JOHN PERKINS: </strong>Well, Amy, I think it’s fair to say that we
              economic hit men have managed to create the world’s first truly global
              empire. And it’s basically a secret empire.</p>
              <p>We do it in many ways, but principally, we identify a country
              that has resources that corporations covet, like oil, arrange a huge
              loan to that country from the World Bank or one of its sisters. The
              money never actually goes to the country; it goes to our own
              corporations to build the infrastructure projects in that country that
              help a few very wealthy people, but don’t benefit the majority of the
              people, who are too poor to buy electricity or have cars to drive on
              the highways. And yet, they’re left holding a huge debt that they can’t
              repay.</p>
              <p>So we go back at some point and say, “You know, you can’t pay
              your debts. Give us a pound of flesh. Sell your oil real cheap to our
              oil companies. Vote with us on the next critical UN vote. Allow us to
              build a military base in your backyard.” Something along these lines.</p>
              <p>And when we fail—as I talk in my books, I failed with Jaime
              Roldos, president of Ecuador, Omar Torrijos of Panama—the Jackals go in
              and either overthrow or assassinate these leaders. And if the Jackals
              fail, as they did in Iraq, then we send in the military.</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>And what personal experience do you have to prove this?</p>
              <p><strong>JOHN PERKINS: </strong>Well, I was there. You know, I was with
              Jaime Roldos in Ecuador. I was the guy—one of the guys who was supposed
              to corrupt him, bring him around, and Omar Torrijos of Panama and many
              others. When I failed with those two gentlemen, the Jackals went in and
              assassinated both of them. And I was there; I was in those front lines.
              My official title was chief economist of Charles T. Main. I had about
              three dozen employees working for me and did this for ten years, and
              finally saw the light.</p>
              <p>But I think what’s—you know, what’s really important about all
              this is that in this period of time, since the 1970s, and really
              beginning very strongly in the 1980s, we’ve created what I consider a
              mutant, viral form of capitalism. Earlier on the program, you showed
              the statistics of 37 percent of the people in the survey not believing
              that capitalism is working. I don’t think the failure is capitalism. I
              think it’s the specific kind of capitalism that we’ve developed in the
              last thirty or forty years, particularly beginning with the time of
              Reagan and Milton Friedman’s economic theories, which stress that the
              only goal of business is to maximize profit, regardless of the social
              and environmental costs, and not to regulate businesses at
              all—regulation is bad, all forms—and to privatize everything, so that
              everything is run by private business. And this mutant form of
              capitalism, which I think is really a predatory form of capitalism, has
              created an extremely unstable, unsustainable, unjust and very, very
              dangerous world.</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>You talk about the robber barons, the modern day robber barons. Who do you mean?</p>
              <p><strong>JOHN PERKINS: </strong>So many of them. You know, we’ve seen them
              recently on Wall Street, the people from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup
              and so many other organizations, people like Jack Welch, who is a
              former CEO of General Electric. And as I lecture at business schools
              and MBA programs, Jack Welch is often held up as this idol. Jack Welch
              laid off a quarter of GE’s employees. You know, he said he was making
              the company meaner and leaner—he certainly was making it meaner—gave
              himself huge raises and bonuses at the same time, turned General
              Electric essentially from a manufacturing company into a financial
              services company, which really was one of the leaders in taking us down
              this course today that we’re on of a failed economic system.</p>
              <p>And we truly have a failed economic system at this point. It’s deep. You know, one of the reasons I wrote <em>Hoodwinked</em> is because I saw a lot of books coming out that deal with what I
              consider triage. What do you do with AIG? What do you do with General
              Electric? What do you do about the immediate problems with Wall Street?
              But the problem is much, much deeper. There’s a cancer beneath all
              that. And this is this very basics of our current economic system. And
              we must delve down and root out that cancer and move into something
              much better.</p>
              <p>I have a two-year-old grandson. And as I look at this baby, you
              know, I think, what’s this world going to look like in six decades,
              when he’s my age? If we stay the course, it will be horrible. But we
              have this opportunity now, and I think this economic turmoil that we’re
              in today is teaching us that we must change. We have a failed system.
              We must create something better. And we must realize that my grandson
              can’t possibly hope to inherit a sustainable, just and peaceful world,
              unless every child growing up in Ethiopia and in Bolivia and in
              Indonesia and in Israel and Palestine has that same expectation. For
              the first time in history, we’re really living on a very, very tiny,
              highly integrated planet, and we’re all communicating with each other.
              Everybody is listening to <em>Democracy Now!</em> all around the world.
              We’re all talking on the cell phone and by internet. We really get it.
              We’re a very, very small community, and we need to recognize that.</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>John Perkins, you have an interesting theory
              about what happened in Honduras, the coup that just took place there.
              What do you think?</p>
              <p><strong>JOHN PERKINS: </strong>Well, I don’t think it’s a theory. You
              know, I think it’s—I was in Panama at the time that the coup took
              place. And, you know, the democratic—</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>In June.</p>
              <p><strong>JOHN PERKINS: </strong>Yeah. The democratically elected president,
              Zelaya, had called for a new constitution to replace the old one that
              was really set up by the oligarchy in favor of the very, very, very
              wealthy and the international companies. He also called for a 60
              percent increase in the bottom wage rate, which had a huge impact on
              Dole and Chiquita, two of the biggest employers in that company. They,
              along with a number of companies that have sweatshops in Honduras,
              strongly objected, very much the same way that they had objected to
              Aristide in Haiti, when he did something similar, and called in the
              military. The general in charge of the military was a graduate of our
              School of the Americas, this, you know, school that’s famous for
              creating dictators, and they overthrew Zelaya. It was a classic
              CIA-sponsored type of coup, very similar to what United Fruit had done
              in Guatemala in the early ’50s. And, of course, United Fruit became
              Chiquita.</p>
              <p>So you had this—you know, this strong relationship and got rid
              of this democratically elected president, because he was drawing a line
              in the sand. We had seen ten countries in Latin America bring in new
              presidents who are instituting very significant reforms in favor of the
              people, in favor of using local resources to help the people pull
              themselves up by the bootstraps, and I think the corporatocracy decided
              to draw a line in the sand in Honduras.</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>Iran and the swirling clouds?</p>
              <p><strong>JOHN PERKINS: </strong>You know, I think Iran today—Iran is this
              example of where we went in and overthrew a democratically elected
              president, Mosaddeq, in the early ’50s, and we’ve seen terrible
              blowback from that ever since. It’s, you know, not only in Iran, but it
              impacted the whole Middle East. If we had supported that president, who
              simply wanted to use more of his oil money, his country’s oil money, to
              help the poor people—we strongly objected. We overthrew him in a coup
              and replaced him with the Shah. So we’ve seen the blowback that comes
              out of that. And this has led to this situation that we’re in today.</p>
              <p>And the swirling clouds, to me, are the big corporations. So, in
              the past, you had roughly 200 countries on the planet, which a few had
              a lot of power—the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, the United States.
              But today the geopolitics might better be envisioned as the same
              roughly 200 countries with these huge swirling clouds that are the big
              corporations. And they are really calling the shots all over the
              planet. They know no national boundaries. They don’t listen to any
              specific set of laws. They strike deals with the Chinese and the
              Taiwanese and the Tibetans and the Israelis and the Arab nations.
              Whoever has the markets or the resources, they cut deal with—deals
              with. And as we’ve seen in our most recent election here in the United
              States, we bring in a president who is very diametrically different
              from the former president, and yet the corporations are still calling
              the shots.</p>
              <p>Which takes us back, Amy, to the fact that we, the people, must
              create the change. This has always been the case. And this is a clarion
              call for us at this point now in history, that we must get out there.
              We’ve got to get behind Obama and all the other politicians. We’ve got
              to force the corporations to change their goal, get away from this goal
              of maximizing profits regardless of social and environmental costs, and
              instead say, “Yeah, it’s OK. Make profits, but only within a context of
              creating a sustainable, just and peaceful world,” only within the
              context of creating a world that my grandson will want to inherit, and
              that means every child on the planet will want to inherit it, because I
              think it’s really important that we understand today we cannot have
              homeland security unless we understand that the whole planet is our
              homeland. Our homeland is now no longer defined by the Rio Grande and
              the Canadian border. It is—we are one—one human species living on a
              very fragile planet.</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>What is the burden of the melting glaciers?</p>
              <p><strong>JOHN PERKINS: </strong>The melting—you know, I was in Tibet a
              couple of years ago, and I stood there with these nomads and looked at
              this glacier that had been down at the road a decade or so before, now
              it’s way back a mile away. And these glaciers up in the Himalayas feed
              the five largest rivers in the world. They provide water to China and
              to India. And as these glaciers melt, the water is drying up. The
              glaciers are melting because of global warming, because of us. And what
              we have to understand is the huge consequences. If these five rivers no
              longer can feed water to the Chinese and the Indians, these people are
              going to die of thirst. And before they die of thirst, they’ll become
              very rebellious.</p>
              <p>We have to understand that one of the root causes of terrorism—I
              don’t even like the word “terrorism,” because I don’t think it really
              is—it’s a whole bunch of diverse groups all over the world. But in
              every—practically every case, it results from starvation, from
              desperation. I’ve met a lot of terrorists. I’ve interviewed them for
              books. I’ve never met one who wanted to be a terrorist. These are
              farmers who have been driven off their farmlands by oil companies or
              hydroelectric projects, or they’re fishermen, like the Somali pirates,
              who can no longer make a living fishing, because their waters have been
              fished dry or destroyed by nuclear waste from US military vessels. I
              have not met anyone who wanted to be a terrorist. They’re desperate
              people. If we want to get rid of terrorism, we must get rid of the root
              causes, that cancer that is destroying our whole system.</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>The new rules you propose for business and government?</p>
              <p><strong>JOHN PERKINS: </strong>Well, you know, we all know that getting
              rid of the rules that protected us from another recession has helped to
              bring on this current recession, you know, things like Glass-Steagall
              and the banking laws and so forth. We need to implement a lot of those
              again.</p>
              <p>But I think we also need another whole new set of laws that says
              businesses must be—look at being environmentally and socially
              responsible. For a hundred years after United States became the United
              States, no corporation was allowed to get a charter unless it could
              prove that it served the public interest. And charters came up for
              renewal every ten years or so. They didn’t get a renewal unless they
              could prove they served the public interest. That all changed with a
              Supreme Court ruling that made corporations equivalent to individuals
              in the late 1880s, and then John D. Rockefeller stepped in and really
              took things—made things go out of hand.</p>
              <p>But we need to go back to an understanding that corporations are
              there to serve us. When I went to business school, I was taught that a
              good CEO takes care of the long-term interests of the corporation—the
              employees, the customers, the general economy—not just there to make
              short-term profits. And we really need to get back to that, to an
              understanding. I think we need laws and rules that say that
              corporations must be aiming toward creating a sustainable and just and
              peaceful world. We simply have to do that. These are our main
              controlling organizations today, and they must be answerable to what’s
              best in the public interest, not just the interests of a few very
              wealthy, powerful people.</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>John Perkins, self-confessed economic hit man, he’s got a new book out. It’s called <em>Hoodwinked: An Economic Hit Man Reveals Why the World Financial Markets Imploded—and What We Need to Do to Remake Them</em>.</p>
