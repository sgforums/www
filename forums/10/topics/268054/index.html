Normally when a company wants the best food or cuisine, it could count on some established suppliers to delver the best or median with prices all known and it is pretty straightforward to fill up an order form with quotations listed and grade ticked to ensure all conformation to financial regulations.<br><br>For this durian order, someone might have got carried away and blown it out of proportion. It is pretty obvious they could ring up a few suppliers and ask them to quote with quality price and tasting all spelt out with a bit of explanation by the purchasing department. It becomes a public tender for a huge supply to satisfy everyone's need for durian.<br><br>Just because of a publicized royal occasion to treat some VIP with certain human needs for durians it makes the salivary grand flow with yearning for everyone to have a good durian treat.<br><br>The irony is that it leads to satisfying all the entourage with durians to boast of the occasion with many more human yearning for durians without any stoppage. If the same thing is to happen to shark fins or expensive wine what will happen during and after that function?<br><br>How do we know there is no constant supply of durian after this tasting session for the other non-royal occasions. At what quality and how many kgs and how much cheaper?</div>
