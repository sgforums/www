            <div class='col-md body'>That said, we should actually post more interesting things in this thread as well, such as about the ESTONIAN INTELLIGENCE AGENCY!<br><br><img src="http://whirledview.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/estonia_tartu_university_main_building_7.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>Estonia maintains one central intelligence and security agency, the Kaitsepolitseiamet (KPol), Security Police Board. The KPol administers intelligence gathering and information analysis, and reports its findings to the executive branch of the government. KPol governs several operational divisions, including Counterintelligence, the Security Police, the Anti-terrorism Bureau, Constitutional Protection Bureau, and Anti-Corruption Bureau. The KPol's main objective is the protection of national interests and national sovereignty. The agency seeks both domestic and foreign intelligence.<br><br>Estonia emerged as a modern, independent nation in 1920. During World War II, however, the nation was invaded by both Soviet and German forces. After the war, Estonia fell in the Soviet sphere of influence. Estonia lost its sovereignty, becoming part of the Soviet Union for four decades. In 1988, the Estonian parliament decreed the nation autonomous, but Soviet forces kept the nation from seceding for over a year. After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain in 1989, Estonia began the process of regaining its status as an independent nation. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 allowed Estonia to finally reemerge as a democratic, independent nation.<br><br>The move to democracy in Estonia required extensive social, economic, and government reform. The new Estonian government sought to dissolve any remaining Soviet institutions, most especially those that were used as state-sponsored instruments of suppression, intended to quell nationalism. Estonia did not maintain its own intelligence community under Soviet rule, but had to distance its new, national intelligence agencies from the legacy of the KGB and Soviet secret police.<br><br>Corruption is a primary concern for the Estonia government. A legacy of Soviet occupation, government corruption was prevalent in the early 1990s. However, anticrime and corruption task forces, as well as intelligence surveillance of government officials, has greatly reduced the problem. Business corruption, as well as incursions into the national economy by the Russian mafia, are also targeted by KPol intelligence operations.<br><br>Today, Estonia is actively pursuing membership in several international organizations. Reforms have aided a rapid transformation of the Estonian economy. Diplomatically, Estonia gravitates toward Europe, but maintains ties with neighboring Russia.</blockquote></div>

Crossing this line harms not just a racial group, but the very fabric of society, and this was why a deterrent sentence was needed.<br><br>The case, which became a major talking point and even drew comments from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last month, is being seen as a watershed moment in the arena of Internet expression.<br><br>It was sparked by a letter to The Straits Times from Madam Zuraimah Mohammed, who asked if cab companies allow uncaged pets to be transported in taxis, after she saw a dog on a taxi seat.<br><br>She was concerned because many Muslims in Singapore are forbidden by their faith to come into contact with a dog's saliva.<br><br>In response, Koh posted 'highly inflammatory' remarks on his blog, or online journal.<br><br>'He spewed vulgarities at the Muslim Malay community, derided and mocked their customs and beliefs and profaned their religion,' Deputy Public Prosecutor Amarjit Singh said.<br><br>One comment compared the Muslim religion to Satanism, while others were so extreme they cannot be printed.<br><br>Lim posted similar, but less extreme, comments on an online dog lovers' forum.<br><br>'He (Lim) derided the practices of their faith, preached intolerance of their beliefs and used highly insulting words against their community,' DPP Singh said.<br><br>He stressed that the prosecution was not trying to police and regulate the Internet, but certain basic rules had to be followed to maintain order in Singapore's multi-ethnic society.<br><br>After noting that both Koh and Lim had taken action to reduce the offensiveness of their acts by posting apologies on the Internet and in court, the judge closed with a stern warning.<br><br>'Bloggers who still have similar offending remarks are well advised to remove them immediately,' he said. <strong>'The Court will not hesitate to impose... <span style="color: red;">stiffer sentences in future cases.</span>'</strong></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what was the situation in 2000:<br><strong><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw00/001209sc.htm" rel="nofollow">            Running into trouble,  	South China Morning Post,December 9, 2000<br>JAKE LLOYD-SMITH </a></strong><br><blockquote>...Dr Chee will start at the Whitley Detention Centre, where some ISA detainees are believed to be held,...<br><br><strong>A spokesman for the Ministry of Home Affairs said that only one person was presently detained under the ISA - on suspicion of spying.</strong><br><br>"The person in question had engaged in espionage activities on behalf of a foreign power," the ministry said in a written reply to questions. "The government has not published his identity because to do so would inflame bilateral relations with the country concerned. The person, however, is not detained secretly; his family members and lawyer, as well as all those involved in the ISA review processes, have access to him and are obviously aware of his identity and his detention."<br><br>According to the ministry, the act is used to counter threats to internal security, public order, ethnic relations and essential services.<br><br>According to the United States State Department, which issues an annual survey of human rights conditions around the globe, the ISA has indeed been applied sparingly over recent years.<br><br><strong>"No one was detained under the ISA from 1989 through to the end of 1996. Two persons were detained in 1997, and four in 1998, all for alleged espionage. Of these six, two remained in detention at the end of 1998. There were no reports of any new detentions under the ISA during [1999]," the latest survey said.</strong> </blockquote>-http://www.singapore-window.org/sw00/001209sc.htm</div>
