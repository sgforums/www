              <h1>PAP MPs admit that ethnic enclaves have emerged in the HDB heartland</h1>
              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>The Housing Development Board (HDB) announced lately that it is now considering introducing a separate ethnic quota for permanent residents to prevent them from forming enclaves in public housing estates.</p>
              <p>However, it is too late as judging from the feedback from some PAP MPs, ethnic enclaves may already have emerged in the HDB heartlands.</p>
              <p>In an interview with the Straits Times, MP Lim Wee Kiat from Sembawang GRC related a notice he saw pasted on a wall in his Canberra ward written entirely in Burmese.</p>
              <p>It was from a real estate agent offering his services solely to Myanmar permanent residents (PRs) looking for flats in Sembawang.</p>
              <p>He said there are some floors of HDB blocks in his ward where more than half the residents are foreign.</p>
              <p><em>“They are a mix of nationalities. So although there is no ‘ethnic’ enclave as such, there is a high concentration of foreigners ‘to the point where Singaporeans feel threatened and become a minority. When that happens, then it becomes an issue,”</em> he added.</p>
              <p>Another MP Ho Geok Choo recalled a visitor describing her Boon Lay ward as being so cosmopolitan that it felt like being overseas. She felt imposing an ethnic quota will “make it more difficult for PRs to artificially inflate prices in certain areas by all snapping up flats there.”</p>
              <p><em>“It would also assuage the concern of those Singaporeans who feel besieged in their neighbourhood by new sights and smells. On her house visits, every block throws up at least two or three Singaporeans who voice their concerns about this,”</em> she was quoted as saying in the Straits Times.</p>
              <p>Due to the ruling party’s liberal immigration policies, foreigners now make up 36 per cent of Singapore’s population, up from 14 per cent in 1990. Of the remaining 64 per cent who are citizens, an increasing number are born overseas.</p>
              <p>Foreigners are now ubiquitous everywhere in Singapore. Besides Sembawang and Boon Lay, ethnic enclaves have emerged in Geylang, Changi, Sengkang, Tampines and Jurong as well.</p>
              <p>It is no exaggeration to say that one can find Chinese from almost all the 23 provinces of China congregated in Geylang or Indians from across the Indian subcontinent in Sengkang.</p>
              <p>While PRs make up “only” 5 per cent of the buyers of resale flats, many of them rent HDB flats which are not subjected to the ethnic quota.</p>
              <p>The root cause of the problem lies in the relentless influx of foreigners into Singapore which shows no signs of abating despite recent promises by PAP leaders to “moderate” and “slow” the inflow.</p>
              <p>At the rate the PAP is “mass-importing” foreigners into Singapore, we may soon find little Hunans, Liaonings, Yangons, Dhakas and Delhis emerging all across the island and it will be Singaporeans who need to “integrate” themselves into a new Singapore dominated by these newcomers instead of the other way round.</p>

              <p>whats wrong with having ethnic enclaves ?</p>
              <p>Holland Village and other middle-upper class residential areas also got foreign ethnic enclaves for the longest time, why nobardie complain ?</p>
              <p>Why must Singaporean feel intimidated ? Must we intimidate the foreigners in order to feel good about ourselves ?</p>
              <p>Are Singaporean so racists ?</p>

              <p>Shouldn't there be an "integration" period before they are allow to apply for citizenship?</p>
