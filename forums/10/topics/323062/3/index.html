              <p>It is very sad that many people in this forum do not makes a
              difference between PAP and Singapore. Giving a very bad name to the

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">This is the profound statement that many people here need to get into their brain. Somehow they don't seem to have the ability to understand, and they bring bad names to the oppositions. Sad.</span></p>
