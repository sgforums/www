              <p>If Atobe offers no solution, why ask me to wait for his reply?</p>
              <p>The govt may have heard of everything that happened within our society, but what would prompt them, wake them up, to take action? what would make them take audit on their current systems to ensure that they are tackling issues before they happens? The abuse of public funds in NKF, the escape of Selamat...all go to show that despite their farsightedness over the years of our national history, they are not immune to mistakes.</p>
              <p>Having said that, I also have doubt if all information, views and opinions of general public reach the top of the hierarchy, much were censored by those down the line who consider such views as trivial, and irrelevant. Many would just want to present the good views. æŠ¥å–œä¸�æŠ¥å¿§ã€‚Why can't there be other channels?</p>
              <p>I understand the limitation of the country, I agree that government had done a great job, in the past, and they are making changes now for the future, but do they have the citizens at heart or are they only keen in making Singapore a successful country, even at the expense of its citizens, just like CEO who would retrench thousands of workers just to make sure that the company stays profitable, and their high salary intact? You may like to say that the government has done this and that, but when the government wants old folks here to work after 60, when the government continues to tax on fuel but talk about the evil of subsidy, I can't help but feel that the government is only interested in making Singapore a successful global company. The people of Singapore first have to sacrifice.</p>
              <p>Is Singapore so fragile that a few people voicing different opinion would turn the country upside down? If it is, then it is better for that to happen when LKY is still around, isn't it?  </p>

              <p>The problem with the duh-Hunter is that he cannot see through his own vision blurred by his continuous perspiration 99% of his wilfull juvenile life.</p>
              <p>Can he know what a solution is - with his dependence on only 1% inspiration ?</p>
              <p>With an ability of plagiarising and bastardising the lines from the Elitist Group, he think that he can be safe standing on the "right side" of the dividing line, without any inspiration to see the clues in how those 'elititst lines' have even been formed.</p>
              <p>By sheer vanity, he hopes to be recognised as one with the Elites by simply mouthing those regurgitaed elitist lines..</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, his skills at bastardising the elitist lines and shamelessly plagiarised to be his own, will simply degenerate the lines into a sycophantic monotone that only a servile self-seeker in the "duh-Hunter" is best at.</p>

              By arresting and charging people in court the govt is trying to instill fear in us. But if the govt continues to disregard us more and more people will overcome their fear and speak up. There is always a limit to one's tolerance.

              <p>In the political context, fear is obviously present in many people in sg.</p>
              <p>I believe the root cause of all these fears is that there is a continous brainwashing modus operandus in applying the <strong>Pavlovian Conditioned Reflex</strong>.  Whereas Pavlo practised the <strong>CR</strong> on animals, here humans are the subjects.</p>

              <p>I was with the civil service and i bet i understand things better so let me put it again that it is not good to go around spreading unnecessary rumours which is detrimental to our political climate.</p>
              <p>The more some people want PAP to go, the more these people must stand up and vote against the PAP. There is no reason to fear as far as i know.</p>

              <p>There are laws and orders within a civilised society and we lived in a civilised society in Spore. Do you think the govt doesnt listen or realized such issues happened within our society?</p>
              <p>They are more aware of it than any of us here, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">proven</span> by their farsightedness over the years of our national history, achieving much beyond the hope of similiar countries at the same point of departure from colonnialism.</p>
              <p>The govt had attempted to share this farsightedness with many thru various channels and media, and accepted by many as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">proven by our sacred votes at each electiion</span>, but a minority few who will NEVER be satisfied will always use it as a means to stir resentment to realize selfish political ambitions, heckling down solutions, nitpicking it such as those shown by Atobe, the rabid heckler of them all.</p>
              <p>As for MPs, whether they are ruling or opposition parties, besides parliamentary debates, they are in communication always with the Executives of the state, and would know full well what are the avenues of greviances legally avaliable, followed by a dissemination of information to the grassroot levels to reach out to their constituents to understand and accept the full picture of a perhaps misplaced greviance.</p>
              <p>This had always serve our country well, and many are at peace to go on with their lives in this small little red dot, with freedoms in all except for freedom to slander without evidences. What you see here are only the minority, who will never be satisfied no matter what is possibly done within the limitations of our society, deluding themselves that they are bigger than the whole, if not our society itself.</p>
              <p>As a demostration of what i meant, just wait for the reply by heckler Atobe, who offers no solution except nitpick, unless she grown wiser overnight. </p>
