              <p><strong>Singapore Democrats interview with activist Jaslyn Go<br> 03 July 2008</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.sgpolitics.net/picsarchive03/jas.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="215"></p>
              <h2>“I will not live by fear”: Activist, businesswoman, mother</h2>
              <p>What prompts a young mother of two to stand up for her rights and
                  the rights of her fellow citizens in a country known for crushing
                  dissent with frightening efficiency? This is a question that many
                  Singaporeans will ask if they met Jaslyn Go Hui Leng.</p>
              <p>This is because Ms Go is one of the 18 Singaporeans charged with
                  taking part in an assembly and procession without a permit on 15 Mar
                  this year.</p>
              <p>That event launched the Tak Boleh Tahan! campaign which is aimed at
                  highlighting the PAP Government’s raising of prices and fees that has
                  thrown hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans into economic disarray and
                  hardship.</p>
              <p>And what will be her answer?</p>
              <p>“<strong>I will not live by the fear the PAP seeks to instill in its citizens,</strong>” explains Ms Go. “<strong>They can try to cripple me with arrest, jail or fine, but they can’t stop me from speaking up.</strong>”</p>
              <p>So what does the financial plight of workers have to do with a
                  successful businesswoman who leads a more-than-comfortable lifestyle
                  with her family?</p>
              <p>“<strong>I used to be very poor when I was young,</strong>” explained Ms Go, “<strong>now that I am better off, I hope I can do my part and highlight the plight our elderly and poor in Singapore are going through.</strong>”</p>
              <p>“<strong>If we continue to allow the PAP to rule with an iron fist,
                  the people’s problems will not be addressed and I fear that the younger
                  generation will suffer more than we are now as the cost of living are
                  skyrocketing and our jobs are being taken over by foreigners.</strong>”</p>
              <p>The Singapore Democrats first came to know Ms Go during the vigil
                  outside the Burmese embassy in September 2007. Since then, the
                  vivacious and determined advocate of democracy has been actively
                  helping to promote human rights in Singapore.</p>
              <p>“<strong>Prior to the protest, I tried in my own ways to engage the
                  government by writing to my MP, Tanjong Pagar GRC MPs, and the Straits
                  Times. But time and again they refused to reply to me, or publish my
                  letters,</strong>” she writes in her blog.</p>
              <p>There is a steely quality about Ms Go that pushes her on. And it is
                  not just starry-eyed ideals that propels the lady’s actions; she makes
                  no bones that she is also doing this for the sake of her two children,
                  aged 3 and 5.</p>
              <p>Children in Singapore have been deprived of quality life which is so stressful even for young children, she points out.</p>
              <p>“<strong>Child suicide has been on the rise. The root of the problem
                  lies in the stiff competition that our children are being put through
                  in school,</strong>” says Ms Go. “<strong>I hope this can be a thing of the past.</strong>”</p>
              <p>Asked what she hopes for in the next 5 to 10 years, Ms Go replies
                  that she would like to see elderly folks who have contributed to
                  Singapore’s progress be taken care of by the government and not reduced
                  to collecting cardboard boxes and empty drink cans to eke out a living.</p>
              <p>And how does she think this can be achieved?</p>
              <p>“<strong>I hope to see a change in government to a more humane one that puts the country and the citizens first.</strong>”</p>
              <p>Ms Go will appear in Subordinate Court 23 together with the other 17 activists.</p>
              <p>Many Singaporeans shy away from engaging in the public process by
                  claiming that they have their families to think about. Such fear is a
                  damning indictment of the PAP. Be that as it may, Ms Go’s example and
                  courage should be a ringing call to citizens of this country to
                  overcome their fearful inertia and become actively involved in matters
                  that concern their everyday lives as well as their future.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans can get involved by taking the first step next Friday,
                  11 Jul 08. Come down to the Subordinate Courts at 9 am to lend your
                  support to this woman of incredible courage as well as to the other
                  activists who have stood up for justice and democracy in Singapore.</p>
              <p>If Singapore had more committed citizens like Ms Go, this country would be a much better place to live in.</p>

              <p>Don't spew your parania of 'shadow of fear' without substantiating it. You are the typical heckler attempting to sow fear and resentment when here when there is no need to.

              <p>Is there a shadow of fear or not?</p>
              <p>The answer is quite obvious.</p>
              <p>The question is not if there is, but to what level. You do not need to kill or always imprision people to create fear, there are plenty of other ways that it can be done.</p>

All citizens of Singapore should speak up and the relevant authority should work with the parents and schools to solve the problem. While I do not agree with her on "the root of the problem ...." I do not agree that only MPs are allowed to highlight such a problem in our midst. I agree that "the rise of child suicide"  should be thing of the past, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">and not "the stiff competition in school"</span></p>

              <p>Well, she made the right decision to speak up for the people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I personally think that part of the reason for the country people not willing to speak up is because of the fear. Not fear of imprisonment but fear of bankrupt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Govt controlled our budget by rising the taxes and others but not our salary. Based on what we've earned, do we still have enough money to pay the govt for the lawsuits that they will impose on us if we speak up?</p>

The root of the problem lies in the stiff competition that our children are being put through in school,” says Ms Go. “I hope this can be a thing of the past.”"</strong> Anybody should be concerned when child suicide is on the rise. All citizens of Singapore should speak up and the relevant authority should work with the parents and schools to solve the problem. While I do not agree with her on "the root of the problem ...." I do not agree that only MPs are allowed to highlight such a problem in our midst. I agree that "the rise of child suicide"  should be thing of the past,</span> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">and not "the stiff competition in school"</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>"she would like to see elderly folks who have contributed to Singapore’s progress be taken care of by the government and not reduced to collecting cardboard boxes and empty drink cans to eke out a living."</strong>  This is also the wish of all Singaporeans, especially the senior ones, and anybody should be allowed to voice their wishes (as long as it is not intended as a curse), if the voices of the elected MPs are not loud enough to bring about some changes.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>

In fact, we don't feel that the government is concerned when we touch our pockets. Our MPs may not feel the same with their salaries. Can't we voice out if we were not MPs?</span></p>

              <p>There are laws and orders within a civilised society and we lived in a civilised society in Spore. Do you think the govt doesnt listen or realized such issues happened within our society?</p>
              <p>They are more aware of it than any of us here, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">proven</span> by their farsightedness over the years of our national history, achieving much beyond the hope of similiar countries at the same point of departure from colonnialism.</p>
              <p>The govt had attempted to share this farsightedness with many thru various channels and media, and accepted by many as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">proven by our sacred votes at each electiion</span>, but a minority few who will NEVER be satisfied will always use it as a means to stir resentment to realize selfish political ambitions, heckling down solutions, nitpicking it such as those shown by Atobe, the rabid heckler of them all.</p>
              <p>As for MPs, whether they are ruling or opposition parties, besides parliamentary debates, they are in communication always with the Executives of the state, and would know full well what are the avenues of greviances legally avaliable, followed by a dissemination of information to the grassroot levels to reach out to their constituents to understand and accept the full picture of a perhaps misplaced greviance.</p>
              <p>This had always serve our country well, and many are at peace to go on with their lives in this small little red dot, with freedoms in all except for freedom to slander without evidences. What you see here are only the minority, who will never be satisfied no matter what is possibly done within the limitations of our society, deluding themselves that they are bigger than the whole, if not our society itself.</p>
              <p>As a demostration of what i meant, just wait for the reply by heckler Atobe, who offers no solution except nitpick, unless she grown wiser overnight. </p>

              <p><strong>Singapore Democrats interview with activist Jaslyn Go<br>03 July 2008</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.sgpolitics.net/picsarchive03/jas.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="215"></p>
              <h2>“I will not live by fear”: Activist, businesswoman, mother</h2>
              <p>What prompts a young mother of two to stand up for her rights and the rights of her fellow citizens in a country known for crushing dissent with frightening efficiency? This is a question that many Singaporeans will ask if they met Jaslyn Go Hui Leng.</p>
              <p>This is because Ms Go is one of the 18 Singaporeans charged with taking part in an assembly and procession without a permit on 15 Mar this year.</p>
              <p>That event launched the Tak Boleh Tahan! campaign which is aimed at highlighting the PAP Government’s raising of prices and fees that has thrown hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans into economic disarray and hardship.</p>
              <p>And what will be her answer?</p>
              <p>“<strong>I will not live by the fear the PAP seeks to instill in its citizens,</strong>” explains Ms Go. “<strong>They can try to cripple me with arrest, jail or fine, but they can’t stop me from speaking up.</strong>”</p>
              <p>So what does the financial plight of workers have to do with a successful businesswoman who leads a more-than-comfortable lifestyle with her family?</p>
              <p>“<strong>I used to be very poor when I was young,</strong>” explained Ms Go, “<strong>now that I am better off, I hope I can do my part and highlight the plight our elderly and poor in Singapore are going through.</strong>”</p>
              <p>“<strong>If we continue to allow the PAP to rule with an iron fist, the people’s problems will not be addressed and I fear that the younger generation will suffer more than we are now as the cost of living are skyrocketing and our jobs are being taken over by foreigners.</strong>”</p>
              <p>The Singapore Democrats first came to know Ms Go during the vigil outside the Burmese embassy in September 2007. Since then, the vivacious and determined advocate of democracy has been actively helping to promote human rights in Singapore.</p>
              <p>“<strong>Prior to the protest, I tried in my own ways to engage the government by writing to my MP, Tanjong Pagar GRC MPs, and the Straits Times. But time and again they refused to reply to me, or publish my letters,</strong>” she writes in her blog.</p>
              <p>There is a steely quality about Ms Go that pushes her on. And it is not just starry-eyed ideals that propels the lady’s actions; she makes no bones that she is also doing this for the sake of her two children, aged 3 and 5.</p>
              <p>Children in Singapore have been deprived of quality life which is so stressful even for young children, she points out.</p>
              <p>“<strong>Child suicide has been on the rise. The root of the problem lies in the stiff competition that our children are being put through in school,</strong>” says Ms Go. “<strong>I hope this can be a thing of the past.</strong>”</p>
              <p>Asked what she hopes for in the next 5 to 10 years, Ms Go replies that she would like to see elderly folks who have contributed to Singapore’s progress be taken care of by the government and not reduced to collecting cardboard boxes and empty drink cans to eke out a living.</p>
              <p>And how does she think this can be achieved?</p>
              <p>“<strong>I hope to see a change in government to a more humane one that puts the country and the citizens first.</strong>”</p>
              <p>Ms Go will appear in Subordinate Court 23 together with the other 17 activists.</p>
              <p>Many Singaporeans shy away from engaging in the public process by claiming that they have their families to think about. Such fear is a damning indictment of the PAP. Be that as it may, Ms Go’s example and courage should be a ringing call to citizens of this country to overcome their fearful inertia and become actively involved in matters that concern their everyday lives as well as their future.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans can get involved by taking the first step next Friday, 11 Jul 08. Come down to the Subordinate Courts at 9 am to lend your support to this woman of incredible courage as well as to the other activists who have stood up for justice and democracy in Singapore.</p>
              <p>If Singapore had more committed citizens like Ms Go, this country would be a much better place to live in.</p>

              <p>Standing up to the rising(steeply) cost of living, and wanting to speak up for the rise in child suicide, i think for her that is a good thing.. At least she speaks for the people, and as a mother of 2, speaking for the rising child suicides, she speaks for herself as a mother.. Nothing wrong.</p>
              <p>It's only those opposition who makes personal attacks at government figures for the sake of wanting to oppose.. Now if only we have oppositions who truly cares, that would really let us citizens be torn apart in choice during election times.</p>
              <p>Based on past elections and who got the final victory, it's really quite obvious to say that we citizens aren't to the point where we are torn between choosing the opposition or the current government.. And that in turn, speaks about the number of quality oppositions vs. the number of oppostions-for-the-sake-of-opposing in Sg..</p>
              <p>If you opposition <em>really</em> <strong>truly</strong> wish to do your part for this country and us people, you guys really should put in more effort (sensible ones pls..) ..</p>
