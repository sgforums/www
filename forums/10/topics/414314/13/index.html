              <p>Young Singaporeans like Lim Zi Rui are becoming increasingly disillusioned and they’re not afraid to let it show.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old final-year aerospace engineering student was among a 1,000-strong crowd who attended a Ministerial Forum organised on Friday by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Students’ Union.</p>
              <p>Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong was the guest-of-honour.</p>
              <p>During a dialogue session after SM Goh’s main address, Lim stood up and asked if the Minister was aware that many young people no longer felt a sense of ownership in Singapore.</p>
              <p>“When I was younger, I was very proud of being a Singaporean,” said Lim.</p>
              <p>“But that was about five, ten years ago. Five years later, with all the changes in policies and the influx of foreign talent, I really don’t know what I’m defending any more.”</p>
              <p>He said this was a view that many of the men he served with during National Service also held.</p>
              <p>“I feel that there is a dilution of the Singapore spirit in youth… We don’t really feel comfortable in our country any more,” he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Goh replied, “‘This is one early sign of danger… If this is happening, it is very serious.” He went on to ask Mr Lim why he felt disconnected.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim told SM Goh, ”‘I’m still serving as an officer and I definitely would love to defend Singapore.”</p>
              <p>But he said the key difference between him and his foreign friends was, “I tell them, this is my country. I can’t just leave here whenever I want to. You can come and play and work here, but I have to stay here.”</p>
              <p>SM Goh responded by defending the government’s policy of welcoming foreigners.</p>
              <p>“You want to have a home. Who’s going to build your HDB flat?” said the Minister.</p>
              <p>Lim replied that due to the inability to afford the sky-high public housing prices, his brother had to call off his engagement. </p>
              <p>“My brother got engaged, but lost his engagement because he could not afford an HDB flat,” said Lim, who went on to state that his question was not about “integrating foreigners”.</p>
              <p>“My question was, how are we going to help the younger generation feel a sense of belonging to Singapore? I don’t think it’s about integrating foreigners,” said Lim.</p>
              <p>“This is your country,” SM Goh replied. “What do you want me to do to make you feel you belong?”</p>
              <p>“For my part, don’t worry about me,” Mr Lim said. “I will definitely do something, if I can, for Singapore. But I can tell you honestly that the sentiment on the ground is a bit different.”</p>
              <p>“If this is happening, it is very serious,” said SM Goh.</p>
              <p>“If the majority feel they don’t belong here, then we have a fundamental problem. Then I would ask myself: What am I doing here? Why should I be working for people who don’t feel they belong over here?” asked SM Goh.</p>
              <p>Earlier on during the dialogue session, the Minister made the point that the next General Elections, due to be held by February 2012, would be a “watershed” for the future of Singapore from which a “fourth Prime Minister and a core team of younger ministers will emerge”.</p>
              <p>SM Goh also challenged the young undergrads in his audience to “make a difference to Singapore” by joining local politics.</p>

              <p>SM Goh should say...</p>
              <p>" You are defending your own ass from being in prison when you serve army. "</p>

              <p>well personally i liked being a soldier, but the current system is too full of BS to have any sort of strong military culture from arising, esp. when you've served your nation and return to civvie life and realize that you are handicapped because of some policies that leave you with less then a level playing field.</p>

              <p>1. i disagree with FT policy.</p>
              <p>2. i do not like singapore sponsor foreigner studying in singapore and not only they are not paying school fees but we are paying them to study here. fuck off!!</p>
              <p>3. i disagree with PR earning money in singapore and bringing it back to malaysia for retirement.  fuck off also.</p>
              <p>4. i disagree with minister and president multi million dollar salary.</p>
              <p>5. i disagree that foreigners working in singapore are not paying more taxes than singapore in the same income bracket.</p>
              <p>6. i agree govt are not doing enough to curb property prices.</p>
              <p>7. i agree serving reservist is fucking waste of time and the armed forces are not showing enough compassionate to the NS men.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>bro, do you know why no one wana work as construction workers?paid fucking low.</p>
              <p>that why. on the otherhand, capitalland, city development, are earning hundreds of millions /quarter profits. because, we are being kick out of this indstry altogether so that this company or govt invested cmpany can make billions a year.</p>
              <p>another note is most of us are not saying we dont need foreigner workers or talent. we never say we dont need. we do need but not when they make up 25-40 % of its population. that is absurb!!! totally unacceptable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>another pt i want to raise why govt allow foreigners in millions working in singapore which many of us never know. GDP. Go study how to achieve GDP growth and you will know why. another of the govt tool use to make ou GDP growth look fantastic but most heartlanders never felt!!</p>
