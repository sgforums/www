              <p>Below is a brief descrption of this singaporean and his problem with the tyrannical or ignorant spore gov:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As i took my oath and received my Pink IC on stage at an acceptence ceremony, I remember proudly thinking to myself, finally, this is home, and i belong here, i decided to renounce my Japanese citizenship at the age of 21, and be a full pledge Singapore citizen, for there’s no other place that i would call Home.</p>
              <p>Things when on fine for a few years, until recently, when i went to the ICA to renew my Passport, i was informed that I was no longer a Singaporean, because i did not take my pledge, and that i could no longer stay here in Singapore, i felt betrayed, unjustified, and most of all, i felt lost, i finally have the chance to take over my mothers company so she can retire, and i finally can move on with my life when all of it is taken away from me, i am now stuck with a dilemma with no obvious solution, i can’t go back to Japan for i had renounce my citizenship there for Singapore, but i can’t stay or do anything here because officially, I’m not a Singapore citizen, and unfortunately, i can’t go anywhere else because i do not own a passport anymore.</p>
              <p>In hopes to settle this predicament, i went to my local MP, Mr. Lee Boon Yang, to see if he could help me with this issue. Though with his good graces, Mr. Lee help me send a request to reinstate my citizenship, it was rejected due to a no provision law, not wanting to give up, i went to seek the help of another MP, 1 that had shooked my hands as i received my NRIC Mr. Heng, and as my status as a Singaporean lingers as the unknown, i hope that i can settle this issue as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>Not Local, Not Foreign, i wonder what my outcome would be.</p>

They felt in order to compete with the influx of foreign professional plus the high standard of living is making them feel dejected. I believe this could b the reason for many local migrating to other countries. I think the reduction of full time NS to 2 years is not enough to make a soldier operational esp for spec or officers.

              <p>Young Singaporeans like Lim Zi Rui are becoming increasingly disillusioned and they’re not afraid to let it show.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old final-year aerospace engineering student was among a 1,000-strong crowd who attended a Ministerial Forum organised on Friday by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Students’ Union.</p>
              <p>Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong was the guest-of-honour.</p>
              <p>During a dialogue session after SM Goh’s main address, Lim stood up and asked if the Minister was aware that many young people no longer felt a sense of ownership in Singapore.</p>
              <p>“When I was younger, I was very proud of being a Singaporean,” said Lim.</p>
              <p>“But that was about five, ten years ago. Five years later, with all the changes in policies and the influx of foreign talent, I really don’t know what I’m defending any more.”</p>
              <p>He said this was a view that many of the men he served with during National Service also held.</p>
              <p>“I feel that there is a dilution of the Singapore spirit in youth… We don’t really feel comfortable in our country any more,” he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Goh replied, “‘This is one early sign of danger… If this is happening, it is very serious.” He went on to ask Mr Lim why he felt disconnected.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim told SM Goh, ”‘I’m still serving as an officer and I definitely would love to defend Singapore.”</p>
              <p>But he said the key difference between him and his foreign friends was, “I tell them, this is my country. I can’t just leave here whenever I want to. You can come and play and work here, but I have to stay here.”</p>
              <p>SM Goh responded by defending the government’s policy of welcoming foreigners.</p>
              <p>“You want to have a home. Who’s going to build your HDB flat?” said the Minister.</p>
              <p>Lim replied that due to the inability to afford the sky-high public housing prices, his brother had to call off his engagement. </p>
              <p>“My brother got engaged, but lost his engagement because he could not afford an HDB flat,” said Lim, who went on to state that his question was not about “integrating foreigners”.</p>
              <p>“My question was, how are we going to help the younger generation feel a sense of belonging to Singapore? I don’t think it’s about integrating foreigners,” said Lim.</p>
              <p>“This is your country,” SM Goh replied. “What do you want me to do to make you feel you belong?”</p>
              <p>“For my part, don’t worry about me,” Mr Lim said. “I will definitely do something, if I can, for Singapore. But I can tell you honestly that the sentiment on the ground is a bit different.”</p>
              <p>“If this is happening, it is very serious,” said SM Goh.</p>
              <p>“If the majority feel they don’t belong here, then we have a fundamental problem. Then I would ask myself: What am I doing here? Why should I be working for people who don’t feel they belong over here?” asked SM Goh.</p>
              <p>Earlier on during the dialogue session, the Minister made the point that the next General Elections, due to be held by February 2012, would be a “watershed” for the future of Singapore from which a “fourth Prime Minister and a core team of younger ministers will emerge”.</p>
              <p>SM Goh also challenged the young undergrads in his audience to “make a difference to Singapore” by joining local politics.</p>

              <p>SM Goh was actually the BEST PM Singaporeans could ever had. Too bad he had to make way for someone else's inevitable promotion.</p>
