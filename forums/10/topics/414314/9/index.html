              <p>The rebates can be Gst rebate or certain taxation hike that do not really affect the lower income who do not spent so much on Gst, so from that point of view, the lower income gained from the Rebates, but most uncles took the rebate and end up in thailand or batam..or lucky plaza. And in a family of 4 adults, the rebate is not small in comparing to a single person.</p>

              <p><br>Basically, when we do an annual increment for workers or staffs, we do look at the hike and the inflation rates and of course the contribution and the performances given, and there is such thing as service and merit increment. In this way, Singaporeans are able to sustain their livinghood with all the essential needs and maybe a bit more luxuries like cars and holidays for those affordable. So, the issue of fee hike also go inline with paid hike, if not, you will not be able to sustain a long term progress when peoples are not able to meet their end needs.</p>
              <p>By living within your means is critical, if your earning power is less, do not expect to spend lavishly and end up unable to pay for this and that, and that is what happening to locals, easily lure by advertisments and luxuries goods which mends for the rich to spent on, but end up they, most in the middle class spending and committed more than the rich, and then call themselve poor with not enuf money to survive, is that fair?</p>
              <p>I maybe rich, but i got to pay more for my landed properties taxes, business taxes,and many more, I would have to eat at posh restaurant charging Gst, high class coffee lounge, spa, country clubs, golfs,,..travel etc etc and pay high taxes, and for higher income, you less rebates. But for a layman, if he spend at local shop and kopitiam, travel near, live in HDB, and live moderately, he pays less Gst and taxes, when he gets his rebate which is higher, he gained. Unless he choose to spend like the rich, drink in starbuck, buy luxury car thru loans, travel far and eat at posh restaurant, shop at ION, then, I will say he is digging his own grave.</p>
              <p>Having said that, this twin challenge thus not imply that we need FT to help our economy but also the aging and dminishing population, now without attracting young foreigners to live here and hoping that they borne singapore citizenship childrens, we see no light at the end of the tunnel. A self destruction.</p>

              <p>I agreed that for some middle income group, the cost of living can be adjusted by living within their means.</p>
              <p>For lower income group, their pay is already very low and every hike in fee will affect them a lot.</p>
              <p>It is a matter of necessity and not luxury.</p>
              <p>So, these area are normally overlooked by the policy makers as most of them are like you looking from top down and will find it very hard to understand why the lower income group always struggle.</p>
              <p>I support the need for foreigners to come in to assist in the economy and not as a replacement for local labour.</p>
              <p>If not for foreigner policy, you will not be enjoying your life in sg and supporting the policy.</p>
              <p>But, the foreigner policy is now out of control and heading for another destruction.</p>
              <p>We have to encourage the growth of the economy through local people and not relying on foreigners to become citizens as they will eventually leave here to go some where else if there are greener pastures.</p>
              <p>If your business is not doing well in sg, you will also be shifting to some where else profitable.</p>
              <p>Then, the foreigner-dependent economy will collapse when all the foreigners shift out of singapore.</p>

              <p>Yes, agreed that the cost of living can be adjusted by living within their means. And everybody (I am sure) have been doing that.</p>
              <p>The problem is when everybody have adjusted, fare hike comes again! And seem like govt see pple comfortably, they will try ways to suck the money out from them again.</p>
              <p>Many times we adjusted within our means, but constantly adjusting is a bit fustrated and not really happy.</p>

              <p>Below is a brief descrption of this singaporean and his problem with the tyrannical or ignorant spore gov:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As i took my oath and received my Pink IC on stage at an acceptence ceremony, I remember proudly thinking to myself, finally, this is home, and i belong here, i decided to renounce my Japanese citizenship at the age of 21, and be a full pledge Singapore citizen, for there’s no other place that i would call Home.</p>
              <p>Things when on fine for a few years, until recently, when i went to the ICA to renew my Passport, i was informed that I was no longer a Singaporean, because i did not take my pledge, and that i could no longer stay here in Singapore, i felt betrayed, unjustified, and most of all, i felt lost, i finally have the chance to take over my mothers company so she can retire, and i finally can move on with my life when all of it is taken away from me, i am now stuck with a dilemma with no obvious solution, i can’t go back to Japan for i had renounce my citizenship there for Singapore, but i can’t stay or do anything here because officially, I’m not a Singapore citizen, and unfortunately, i can’t go anywhere else because i do not own a passport anymore.</p>
              <p>In hopes to settle this predicament, i went to my local MP, Mr. Lee Boon Yang, to see if he could help me with this issue. Though with his good graces, Mr. Lee help me send a request to reinstate my citizenship, it was rejected due to a no provision law, not wanting to give up, i went to seek the help of another MP, 1 that had shooked my hands as i received my NRIC Mr. Heng, and as my status as a Singaporean lingers as the unknown, i hope that i can settle this issue as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>Not Local, Not Foreign, i wonder what my outcome would be.</p>
