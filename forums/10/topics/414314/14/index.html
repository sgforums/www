              singapore might very well be defending itself from space aliens.
              
              A new report circulating in the Kremlin today prepared for President Medvedev by Russian Space Forces (VKS) 45th Division of Space Control says that an upcoming WikiLeaks release of secret US cables details that the Americans have been â€œengagedâ€� since 2004 in a â€œwarâ€� against UFOâ€™s based on or near the Continent of Antarctica, particularly the Southern Ocean.
              
              According to this report, the United States went to its highest alert level on June 10, 2004 after a massive fleet of UFOâ€™s â€œsuddenly emergedâ€� from the Southern Ocean and approached Guadalajara, Mexico barely 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) from the American border. Prior to reaching the US border, however, this massive UFO fleet is said in this report to have â€œdimensionally returnedâ€� to their Southern Ocean â€œhome baseâ€�.
              
              The fears of the Americans regarding these Southern Ocean UFOâ€™s began, this report says, during the unprecedented events of July 11, 1991 (referred to as 7/11) when during the Solar Eclipse these mysterious aircraft appeared by the hundreds over nearly all of Mexico, even their Capital city. Most notable about the events of 7/11 were that as millions of Mexicans were watching on their televisions the National broadcasts of these UFOâ€™s over Mexico City, the American media refused to allow their people to view it.
              
              Since 2004, this report continues, fleets of Southern Ocean UFOâ€™s have continued to emerge from their bases, with the latest such event being this Friday past when another of their massive fleets was sighted over the South American Nation of Chile.
              
              The â€œimmediate dangerâ€� to our World when these massive UFO fleets emerge from the Southern Ocean, this report warns, are the massive waves caused by their sudden eruption from what are believed to be their underwater base, or bases. In the past week alone, the Clelia II, an Antarctic cruise ship with 160 people onboard, was nearly capsized when hit by waves generated by these UFOâ€™s emerging from the Southern Ocean, and just today the Number One Insung has been reported sunk with only 20 of its 42 member crew said saved due to the same cause.
              
              Interesting to note in this report is its confirming our October 14th report US Shuts Down New York City Airspace Over UFO â€˜Threatâ€™ that these same Southern Ocean UFOâ€™s were responsible for the closing of the airspace over New York City this past fall (October 13th) when they â€œappearedâ€� openly and were witnessed by tens of thousands of people, and which, coincidentally, occurred during the same time frame as the mysterious Crystal Skulls of the ancient South American peoples were being exhibited there too.
              
              Even more interesting to note is that the mysterious earthquakes being reported in the Gulf of Aden (where another â€œextraterrestrialâ€� event is currently ongoing and we had reported on in our December 1st report Mysterious â€˜Vortexâ€™ Warned Is Creating Global Weather Catastrophe) are now being reported occurring in the Southern Ocean too.
              
              This report goes on to state that after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange warned last week that he would begin releasing secret US cables relating to these Southern Ocean UFOâ€™s, and the Americans â€œwarâ€� against them, he was immediately arrested by British Police on trumped up charges issued by the Swedish government which in our December 8th report, Global Rebellion Erupts After â€œUnprotected Sex Meets Disrobed Governmentsâ€�, we noted were engineered against him as a â€œclassicâ€� CIA â€œHoney Trapâ€�.
              
              Note: Since our last report on the EU-US frame-up of Assange it is now being reported that one of his two accusers, Anna Ardin, has fled Sweden and is now in hiding in the Palestinian territories.
              
              To if Assange, or his WikiLeaks website, will survive to see the whole release of these Southern Ocean UFO files it is not to our knowing, nor does this report say.
              
              What is in our knowing, however, and when coupled with the information we reported on in our December 10th report Massive Earthquake Fears Rise After Mysterious Object Moves Nearer To Earth, suggests that the timing of these events, as we near the December 20/21 Total Lunar Eclipse, and as Mercury turns retrograde and joins Mars as it forms a conjunction with Pluto, that the ending of this year, 2010, truly marks the ending of this age as prophesied by the ancients.
              
              In the Sorcha Faalâ€™s seminal work published in 2007, Battle Begins For Throne of This World: The Return of the Einherjar Warriors, she notes that in these â€œlast daysâ€� the â€œguidepostsâ€� to what the future will hold for humanity does, indeed, rest hidden to the discerning reader in the words handed down to us by the ancients, none being more important in this case than those of Nostradamus, who in writing of this coming Lunar Eclipse and feared conjunctions warned:
              
              â€œThe arms to fight in the sky a long time,
              
              The tree in the middle of the city fallen:
              
              Sacred bough clipped, steel, in the face of the firebrand,
              
              Then the Monarch of Adria fallen.â€� Quatrain 3:11
              
              Most ominously for our World today, â€œthe tree in the middle of the cityâ€� has, indeed, â€œfallenâ€� with news from Glastonbury that the 2,000-year-old Holy Thorn Tree, one of Christianities oldest and most revered symbols, has been cut down by vandals. With the great tree now â€œfallenâ€�, the battle for this Earth now moves to the â€œskyâ€� until the â€œMonarch of Adriaâ€� (Pope Benedict XVI) has â€œfallenâ€� too.

              Darlene Stewart said she was outside taking pictures of the sunset when she saw something fly overhead.
              
              She snapped a picture of the object in an attempt to zoom in on it to see what it was.
              
              â€œEven with the camera, I couldnâ€™t make it out until I put it on the computer,â€� she told CBC News. â€œI knew then it wasnâ€™t an airplane. It was something different.â€�
              
              Stewartâ€™s picture shows a blurry image of what appears to be some kind of missile-like object emitting either flames or heavy smoke.
              
              Emmy Pardy also saw the object.
              
              â€œIt appeared to come out of the ocean,â€� she told CBC News. â€œIt was like it was in the middle of the bay.â€�
              
              An RCMP officer was in the community Tuesday to investigate the reports.
              
              Pardy said sheâ€™d like to know what the object was.
              
              â€œItâ€™s kind of scary because you donâ€™t know if something is being set off out in the bay, [or] if someone is doing experiments,â€� she said.
              
              The residents plan to be outdoors again Tuesday evening to see if there is a similar sight in the sky.

              With Wikileaks all set to unravel the secret documents or reports by governments on Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), New Zealand has decided to go ahead and make public some 2,000 pages of secret UFO files dating from 1954 to 2009.

              The Dominion Post said that the documents contain drawings of flying saucers and alien writings and also witness accounts of UFO sightings.
              
              Many Australian Ufologists were pressing the government to release the documents for over a decade. Suzanne Hansen of UFOCUS, NZ was happy to see the government unfolding the secret papers on its own. "I started lobbying, and at first they said there was no way in the foreseeable future they'd be released. It's been a long time coming," she to told the Dominion Post.
              
              Explaining the government stand, New Zealand Air Force spokesman Kavae Tamariki maintained that the military never carried out any probe into the reported UFO sightings. "We have just been a collection point for the information. We don't investigate or make reports, we haven't substantiated anything in them," he told the Dominion Post.

                The reports, released under freedom of information laws, contain no names but include accounts by individual members, army personnel and commercial airline pilots who claimed to have encountered UFOs, mostly involving objects with moving lights.
              
              The report said files include filming of strange lights in 1978 in Kaikoura town off South Island by commercial pilots, which officials later termed as a natural phenomenon pertaining to lights from boats reflected in clouds.
              
              Even Ben Radford of Discovery News was quite skeptical about the UFO sightings saying "not a single person has come forth with hard evidence of extraterrestrials."

              New Zealand's UFO files: examples 
              Hundreds of previously classified reports detailing claims of UFO sightings and alien encounters have been released by the New Zealand military. Here are some examples: 
               
              By Paul Chapman in Wellington 3:21PM GMT 22 Dec 2010 
              1. A man who in 1995 met the giant alien with size 440 shoes says the being told him that on dying humans ascend as hydrogen atoms. "You will remain in hydrogen form for 150 years. Then it will change to sodium."
              
              2. Sinister forces reported to be criss-crossing the sky over Auckland, the country's largest city, with what looked like aircraft contrails in May 1999. "A vast many people in Auckland will suffer flu-like sickness," the alarmed writer warned.
              
              3. In one of the earliest reports, a UFO enthusiast wrote in to say that a witness had described seeing a "strange bowl-shaped object" fall from a clear sky. "As the object fell it made a hissing sound, hit the wharf pier he was standing on, and then bounced high and landed on a government survey vessel."
              
              4. A writer reproduced what were described as samples of alien writing.
              
              5. A woman reported seeing a large round or oval object, glowing with a bright reddish light, in April 1998. "Weather conditions were calm, although there was a sensation of light rain falling on the woman's arm," the file says.
