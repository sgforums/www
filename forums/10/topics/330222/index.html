              <p>Singapore should look into the pull factors that result in migration and address them..... if its not realistically possible let the people understand that and point out the qualities of Singapore that competitor nations can't offer. Don't avoid the issue, address it publicly and let the public know the steps taken to improve the current standard of living.</p>

              <p>Of all Fworkers here, nearly 1/3 are being conned here with no other choice but to work and work to get even with their agents fees. They came with long sleeve shirt and tie, but the next day, they are up the lorry with spade and dirty cloth ready for hard physical work. They carried on the 2nd term ie another 2 years because in the first 2 years they earn to paid back their agent fees only +high cost of expenses here,  so the next 2 years they need to extend so as to get back what they lost and perhap some profit out of it.</p>

However it would be wrong to then call yourself a Singaporean, they should renounce their Singaporean citizenship, and become the citizen of whatever country they have moved to, and be proud of it, sing it's anthem, be ready to die for that nation that they have called home. Afterall a nation isn't what you see on a map, or the ground beneath your feet. It is an idea, hopes, and dreams of many people to live and progress with each other. If you don't like singapore's idea, and prefer another country's? Leave by all means, but ask yourself why you leave, and how will you answer to your descendents in the future, make sure it isn't "Because I didn't like the weather", what kind of a person would that reflect of you? Unloyal, with no futher interests than your selfish own? Fine...but I cannot see how they would then contribute to their new nation, and why that new nation should accept them. Nation before self, because it should be that you believe in that nation's ideals. I would die for Singapore, because there are singaporeans in it, and I believe they would too for me. </p></div>
