              <p>The prob with the current ruling party is that they are more self serving, placing their selfish interest before the citizens.     Unless they change, if not don't expect anything positive they will do to improve situation.</p>

              <p>You've all made it clear to me that we're led by despicable despots, and I won't bother to ask why you haven't revolted because your obvious reply would be that it's impossible. Now...Our standard of living has dropped...I will only ask why, the reply I expect would be, "It's the despotic government's fault", we're being oppressed and the government's corrupt, but you do nothing about it, because again it is impossible, why may I ask? "Because L.K.Y has told us he'd cleave us with his sharp hatchet he carries in his bag, so we cower in silence". It strikes me, that not only is our government dishonourable, but the people's actions have not proven to be very honourable in any way. It's so depressing I'm laughing hysterically here.</p>
              <p>I stated before that I woul die for my fellow Singaporean, that includes his family. Will you not die for mine? You say you live for your family, well so do I...so will you not live for mine, and I for your's? You call me naive, but yet you show me no better example. True enough I've been inspired by Braveheart and Gladiator...but these people especially for Braveheart did exist...Braveheart as William Wallace of scotland who is their national hero, and by the way, Scotland gained it's freedom after William Wallace died and then a Scottish king at on the English throne, some time later, joining the two countries. To this day, the scottish do not call themselves "English", but "Scots". Honour, courage exists and it does pay to have them.</p>
              <p>We are the citizens of Singapore, and I will be twenty one next year, old enough to vote. Tell me, should I be "realistic" and vote for the PAP then? I am lost, to tell the truth, I have the stories of great men as examples, but no one I can follow. Tell me then, what should I do?</p>

              <p>But as a Singaporean yourself and living among Singaporeans, would you leave and migrate when you're doing good in Singapore? Not many Singaporeans have that kind of exploration spirits as mentioned by you, most are insecure and will be happy to stay on and enjoy their lives with their loved ones in Singapore IF they are doing good here.</p>
              <p>It may looked like a valid argument point you have there, but it's just not a sensible point worthy of mentionng it in the first place.</p>

              <p>I mentioned "socially convince" which is only meant for trash. So if a person migrates because their friends/environment/society makes them feel rejected, and they are encouraged by these factors to migrate.....then yes, that person is a trash.</p>

              <p>So those migrating are trash lol. You are so jealous I don't even know where to begin.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Try to be subjective instead of chanting "Singapore Singapore" slogans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore should look into the pull factors that result in migration and address them..... if its not realistically possible let the people understand that and point out the qualities of Singapore that competitor nations can't offer. Don't avoid the issue, address it publicly and let the public know the steps taken to improve the current standard of living.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That would at least assure the people that the govt knows and cares about their well being and the countries shortcomings.</p>

              <p>Please do your research before you attempt to correct me. William Wallace is a historical figure in case you didn't know, go wiki it if you doubt me. You seem to only provide me with information that I already know, as in regarding the state of affairs in singapore. Unlike certain people, I'd rather stay and change things here than to flee, simply because it is alot easier to run away than to face the problem.</p>

              <p>I have listened to both sides of the story and staying in Singapore and living overseas both have their benefits and flaws.  I have often asked myself and my friends their point of view and would like to relate the benefits of living and working in Singapore as compared to living and working overseas.  This is an important decision for Singaporeans studying overseas to make when the Graduation approaches.  It's really up to the individual to decide for himself but the best way to find out is try out both experiences and determine what is best for you.</p>
              <p>Living in Singapore</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advantages</span></p>
              <p>1) Close to family members and childhood friends</p>
              <p>2) Takeaways are convienient and taste good</p>
              <p>3) Excellent Job Prospects if you are in an industry supported by the Goverment at the moment.</p>
              <p>5) Lower Tax and Better Healthcare System</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disadvantages</span></p>
              <p>1) Have to work long working hours to stay competitive in the business</p>
              <p>2) Singaporean Salaries are lower than other leading countries (US, Europe) . This explains why FTs are paid more in order to bring them over.</p>
              <p>3) Preference by the Goverment to support certain industries only (Research, Biotech)</p>
              <p>4) High inflation cost</p>
              <p>5) Most Singaporeans tend to lack assertiveness and take offence to positive criticism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Living Overseas</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advantages</span></p>
              <p>1) Good salaries, and working for established organisations recognised by the world.</p>
              <p>2) 37-40 hours work week on average (shorter working hours)</p>
              <p>3) Healthier Homecook Meals</p>
              <p>4) More free speech, as a result of this, I have learnt more about how gays and lesbians get persecuted in Singapore and they have no choice but to work overseas.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disadvantages</span></p>
              <p>1) Being apart from the family</p>
              <p>2) Going back to Singapore becomes a holiday (a real holiday!)</p>
              <p>3) Overseas foreigners believe that there is a glass ceiling that prevents them from reaching Senior Management Post in big MNCs.</p>
              <p>4) Most local food delights are available overseas but not all. (Like Hokkien Mee)</p>
