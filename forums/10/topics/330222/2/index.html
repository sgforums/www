              <p>You've all made it clear to me that we're led by despicable despots, and I won't bother to ask why you haven't revolted because your obvious reply would be that it's impossible. Now...Our standard of living has dropped...I will only ask why, the reply I expect would be, "It's the despotic government's fault", we're being oppressed and the government's corrupt, but you do nothing about it, because again it is impossible, why may I ask? "Because L.K.Y has told us he'd cleave us with his sharp hatchet he carries in his bag, so we cower in silence". It strikes me, that not only is our government dishonourable, but the people's actions have not proven to be very honourable in any way. It's so depressing I'm laughing hysterically here.</p>
              <p>I stated before that I woul die for my fellow Singaporean, that includes his family. Will you not die for mine? You say you live for your family, well so do I...so will you not live for mine, and I for your's? You call me naive, but yet you show me no better example. True enough I've been inspired by Braveheart and Gladiator...but these people especially for Braveheart did exist...Braveheart as William Wallace of scotland who is their national hero, and by the way, Scotland gained it's freedom after William Wallace died and then a Scottish king at on the English throne, some time later, joining the two countries.

              <p>You mock me, when I say die. By death I do not mean that I would so easily give my life for a cause, without considering the life I could have had. There are few things that is truly owned by a man. His life, dignity and principles. I express death, because I would have tried to live my life with dignity and priciples, should I have to pay more, it would be with my life. It is my final statement to show my resolution, for I value my life above my family, or my country or my honour, or love itself. For without life I couldn't have had experienced any of these. Death is a statement that shows our mortality, thus our precious time on earth, therefore it is something one would not squander. I do not say it lightly nor do I use it as a metaphor, I mean it as a vow. I have my cards, and I'm willing to place my bet, where are the other players I wonder? Will you leave me alone in this rigged game with the banker? </p>
              <p>And they wonder why the youth of today are becoming numb to the world, what have they got to feel, sorrow and loneliness?</p>

              <p>Twenty years, not a great number of years compared to many, but enough I think to know that life and the world is a miracle. Harsh as it is, like the rugged tundras or the icy polar caps, nothing much can survive there, yet the harshness lends it a sort beauty that cannot thoroughly be described in words alone. We do not all see things the same way, nor are our sensations alike, but have you not stood before a cloudless sky with the moon alight, or the sun aflame with a brilliant crimson as it sets in the east? Have you not laughed with good company and thought nothing else but that moment existed between you and your friends? These are things that life is worth living for, and the world is filled with many opportunities for many of these moments, would you not say that it is something worth fighting for? Regardless of country, or government, our lives are for us to lead not anyone else, how we live it is up to us.</p>

              <p>"I love my country, this motherland which fed and brought me up. I love the people, the  ground which we stand on, the air which we breath. In times of crisis or when the nation's future is at stake, I will shed blood for my countrymen, my home and my place.</p>
              <p>With so much feelings for the nation, yet I felt nothing for the constitution, the leaders and the governers.H ow long have they not touch the ground? How long ago have they lived the life of peasant? When, was the last bus trip they take, or a smrt ride? None, I assume.</p>
              <p>While I have been trained to defend my nation against outside forces, what about forces inside that I need to be cautious? Will it ever work out one day, we need to kill our own? I will fire once, twice or as many times needed to foreign invasion. To protect and to serve. But what about inside? Will I one day need to fire at them as well?"</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>To take a life, I suppose is not a trivial matter, it is one that requires a certain amount of resolution, such that one would take it upon himself to end another person's life unnaturally, in the belief that he is doing the right thing. My question would be why I would believe I had the right to end another's life. If it were for a political cause, is it justified, is there no other way to negotiate? It is better to be killed for the right reason than to kill for the wrong reason. Remember that the other person you face is also a Singaporean, he deserves to live as much as you do.</p></div>
