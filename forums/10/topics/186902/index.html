Â– PAP ministers lead in salaries by receiving CEO equivalent salaries.- while SGporean and foreigners fight for jobs and are the coolie workersÂ…   SG CEO is highly paid bc SGpore as a Â‘companyÂ’ is cost effective bc of cheap abundant workforce, high productivity = big profits for top mgmt.- (but workers remain poorly paid).<br><br>Remember.. SG is only country w GRC systemÂ… so PAP gov has upper hand in elections.<br><br>Top salaries, self favoring election rules- SGporeans have been taken advantage of by their govt?<br><br>Hopefully Â… PAP top dollar intelligent Ministers can surely do a good job of making the elections fair<br><br>Otherwise why then pay top dollar for a gov that is no different from many others in terms of morals or performance?<br><br>Is GRC really for the minorities?<br>http://groups.google.com/group/soc.culture.australian/msg/0469393407aed58f?<br><br></div>

No govt will willingly aid their opponents. In fact, if the APs are canny enough, they could use legitimate cases such as time lags and obstacles 'set by HDB' in attempts to performing upgrading as a strong indication of bias against them to help gain as much political mileage and win sympathy votes.<br><br>By setting the bar so high, it will take a special team extra effort to overcome and win an election.<br><br>When that happens, you can be assured that this challenger is well qualified and capable to run a govt.
