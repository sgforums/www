              <p>we have come a long way, from a poor sea village to a thriving port and now a country... before you say i'm digging the past, remember that the past is your present and your present is your future. we must not forget our old guards, those that shaped Singapore, those that sacrificed their years on improving Singapore as a whole.</p>
              <p>was MM Lee a good man? no one could be certain but we know he is a hard-liner, willing to crash oppositions and destroy those who stood in his way... is he hated? i believe so... but admired at the same time. History has proven that men that leaves their name in history has to be ruthless. Of course there are a few that was kind and honourable yet their ending never sounded nice... if i could make a film based on MM Lee, the name will be, "The Last Man Standing". he has survived when many of his foes and friends have left. if that is not admirable enough</p>
              <p>did PAP made mistakes? obviously... birth control in the early 80's was already a mistake confirmed today... if you were born in the 80's, your parents might have told you that Singapore government wanted to stop families having more than 2 kids but today, the more the merrier... it doesn't stop there but still we are here... in the turn of the decade of 2000, reaching 2010... as a pretty prosperous country in South East Asia... we have strict rules and we have laws that foreigners do not understand... yet, we are still here, surviving the "economic downturn" pretty well. of course we have the lower income earners, who struggle everyday but we can be sure in Singaporean's own words... "we won't starve to death but we won't get rich either"...</p>
              <p>i know we have many greviances and there are certainly rooms for improvement for the present government. i only ask that they do listen to the people and act accordingly to their conscious.</p>

              <p>I personally think that people spending during recession has nothing much to do with the recession.</p>
              <p>Take for example, those buying necessities from Giant, Carrefour etc. They are buying for their daily needs. And the ferrari. Drive ferrari so? The car might be a few year old, bought before the recession starts?<br><br>Does it mean that during recession, we cannot do shopping, cannot drive a car or rather cannot eat as well?<br><br>If the phrase "in Singapore, you won't die of hunger neither would you be very rich"... can i apply to the recession, you won't die of hunger, neither if the economy improve, your boss won't increase your salary to make you slightly richer?</p>

              <p>Right one old man vs a whole bunch of people is just a digression from the point.</p>
              <p>The point actually is, the masses in Singapore still have buying power while in the mother of all recessions, that means the government must be doing something right.</p>
              <p>What exactly, as Ah Chai has asked, I don't know, as I can't pin it down. It is a whole gamult of governance working together that brought this about and not just one facet of it.</p>
