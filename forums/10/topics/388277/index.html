              <p><strong>By Lawrence Pek</strong></p>
              <p>I have lived more than 12 years outside of Singapore. During these times, I have missed home and my family, my country and I have tried my best to keep track via the net, what is happening, where is it going and what it will take to get us there.<br>I cannot say that I am at all happy with all that has happened in the last 2 to 3 years. The PAP which I knew, trusted and depended on, has changed, evolved and maybe mutated….<br> <br>There has been many articles pro and anti government / PAP in recent months, with all sorts of people with all sorts of ideas thrown into the mix. I have read many of them and after a while, paused to wonder, where all these will lead to, while entertaining, many of the stories are now merely specific incidences of indiscretions by either pro or anti establishment figures. Pro government / PAP stories are heavily carried in the Straits Times and other MSM (Main Stream Media), while any anti government antics are heavily exposed via the various blogs.<br> <br>The objective of my article is not to go into specific issues like growing influx of foreigners, rising HDB prices or losses incurred by our GIC and Temasek Holdings. As the battle rages on b/w pro and anti establishment, I am inclined to think about the following questions.<br> <br>Where is my country going? Why are we on this course and who decided?<br> <br>Why do we need 6 mil headcount in Singapore by 2020? What is this number about and how was it derived? What scares me is that our numbers people from various Ministries will be so fixated with this number and becomes a KPI which they will die trying without a clear understanding of how this number was derived and what impact this number will mean.<br> <br>My assumptions are that in the various ministries, the below were discussed at length:</p>
              <p>1. We need this number to achieve a certain GDP growth, to sustain our economy, living standards and yes, our way of life. (in biz, we acknowledge that Size Does Matter), if we do not achieve this KPI, we will be left behind in the global fight for talents and growth engines.<br> <br>2. Our local birthrates is not growing, if not declining, therefore if we cannot do it organically, lets artificially import them.<br> <br>3. Yes, there will surely be unhappiness in streets, but our people have always known a singular PAP, we can explain, communicate via our MSM, we will highlight examples of “Success Stories” and eventually, at some point in the future, they will accept our policies, they always have anyway….When we (PAP, the government of Singapore) arrive at 2020, my local children will understand my pains and they will thank me later, for now, the healing medicine is bitter and they need to be forced feed to them.<br> <br>My concern is not whether these assumptions are right or not (in the rules of global politics, these are never straightforward) – but what about the voices of the local people? what they want and if there were any constructive discussions before the conclusions, the target settings and eventually, the executions.<br> <br>Yes, there will be a lot of objections if these issues were brought up 5 years ago and nothing will move forward, if such sensitive issues were to be brought up for discussions and a referendum sought. Further, there is a lot of arguments to be made for a lot of successful policies that benefited the people, which were not welcomed and not discussed and so why should this be any different? (ERP is a good example, no one likes it, but it does solve the congestions problem, somewhat..)<br> <br>But why can’t we do things differently? How about a simple 3 step process…<br> <br>1. Please tell us what you are thinking? What are the basis of such thinking? What are the alternatives?<br>2. Let’s table for discussion via a debate online or via MSM – with either Opposition or NMPs or even better yet, the common man on the streets (lets choose them carefully, of course)<br>3. Let the Various Ministries Decide with clear communications about what were the critical issues and why we need to do this, what will be the impact if not….<br> <br>I would like to implore the ruling party to consider the following…<br> <br>a. The Policy of the Paternal PAP – has worked (somewhat) for the past 44 years – but given the new social fabric, will be the way to go in the future ? Is there no scope, no more tolerance for public discussions before each and every major policy announcements?<br> <br>b. The Process of Discussions has a lot of benefits – the people cannot say their views were never considered, they did not know before, the government agencies, the ruling party (which we have voted in) has studied the issues, heard the feedback and now, have made a decisions.<br> <br>c. The Winds of Change are Blowing – things are different now, the policies of the Past cannot be the way forward, unless I am mistaken, the ruling party knows this, but maybe, just have no idea what to do about it. They need to evolve and not mutate, if they continue to NOT LISTEN to the people, they will do so at their own Perils.<br> <br>On a more personal note – having served my National Service, I have grown to realize, to value, to love, the sanctity of a sovereign state, my Country, my Singapore. I consider it my privilege that I have met my Minister Mentor, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, in person….I will take a bullet for the man, but I do not want him to lead my country into the next lap, the next 50 years.<br> <br>The Winds of Change are blowing….</p>

              <p>A patriot man must standby his country, no matter if the govt is good or bad, no matter if the country is up or down, that is the true citizenship, he must give back what the society had given him unless there is totally economy breakdown, chaos, riot, civil war or war in that particular country where one and one family have to survive for the generation to move on and perhap to build the country again.</p>
              <p>Anyway, being away for so long, what does he really knows about the ground, the real ground of what is happening in Singapore, and in life, it is always better to talk cork and sing song from an outside perspective, because he/she got nothing to loose other than crying crocodile tears for his/her country while living in another country.</p>
              <p>Look at those indians, the mynmars, the PRCs, viets, bangalas etc etc, even at the worst situation in their country, they will not back down and said that their country is lousy or poorly governed, and if you said about their country, you are going to be their enemy, but our singaporeans in overseas are spreadly our bad images which is not true and one own opinon, and when peoples in that country said Singapore is so lousy, they agreed with them...my goodness...I close my case.</p>
