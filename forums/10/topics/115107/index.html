            <div class='col-md body'>Hit and racially abused by Aussies<br><br>Aussie witness' father defends Singapore pair, who had to withdraw for chasing offenders<br>By Tan Kim Han<br><br>TWO young Singapore sailors, Teo Wee Chin and Terence Koh, who were previously punished for infringing racing rules in the Australian 420 Championships on Jan 5, have now had the dark clouds lifted from them.<br><br>The Singaporean pair, both 18, had admitted cutting across markers illegally to chase their Australian rivals.<br><br>Their unsporting behaviour prompted SingaporeSailing to withdraw them from the 51-boat competition, in which they were poised to take third spot.<br><br>But the tables are now turned on the Australian pair, skippered by S. Thomas, who is now alleged to have sparked the incident by throwing a punch at Koh.<br><br>They are also believed to have hurled racist remarks and profanities at the Singaporeans.<br><br>The ugly scene was witnessed by Max Taylor, another Australian sailor, who was told by his coach not to testify.<br><br>But Max's father, Glenn, later e-mailed SingaporeSailing to 'put some balance to the matter'.<br><br>He wrote: 'As a family, we deeply regret not doing the morally correct thing at the time.<br><br>'We have written to the authorities, explaining all the circumstances, in an effort to put some balance to the matter.<br><br>'The SingaporeSailing federation should take great pride in the way Terence and his skipper conducted themselves, particularly at the presentation function.'<br><br>The Singapore duo's behaviour also impressed Michael Chapman, national president of the International 420 Class Association of Australia Inc.<br><br>He had originally insisted that the Singaporean sailors apologise and shake hands with their Australian counterparts as he was 'unaware' of the fracas at sea.<br><br>Later, in an e-mail to SingaporeSailing, he said: 'I was personally very pleased and impressed by the strength of character of the Singaporean skipper and crew who came to the presentation dinner with his team and shook hands.<br><br>'At that time I was unaware that:<br><br>'(a) The Australian skipper had thrown a punch at the Singaporean;<br><br>'(b) Racial abuse had been spoken loudly by the Australian skipper at the Singaporean crew,<br><br>'If these factors had been known at the time, the Australian skipper would have been dealt with differently and most severely.'<br><br>Chapman recommends that the Australian pair undergo counselling for their unacceptable behaviour, which includes physical assault and racial abuse.<br><br>He said: 'The selection of that person to represent Australia at the Isaf World Youth Championships should also be reviewed very closely.'<br><br>The nasty incident happened in the last of the 12-race event when the Singapore pair tried to block - or, in sailing terms, 'cover' - the Australian boat which was in fourth place.<br><br>As they approached the windward mark, the two boats collided. It was then that the Australian skipper was alleged to have turned violent and thrown a punch and racially abused the Singaporean pair.<br><br>But officials on shore did not know of the incident. They were only aware of the illegal chasing incident and wanted the rule-breakers sanctioned.<br><br>Yesterday, SingaporeSailing president Low Teo Ping stressed that the Republic's sailors did not retaliate.<br><br>He said: 'The only thing they did wrong was to chase the Australian boat by cutting across markers. We have counselled them about this already.<br><br>'To call them cheats or being involved in a punch-up is grossly inaccurate and unfair.'<br><br>As for the Australian pair, investigations are ongoing.<br><br>Phil Jones, CEO of Yachting Australia, said that he views the incident 'as a very serious matter'.<br><br>He added: 'In the light of these facts, it is unfortunate that a hearing did not proceed at the event.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Racism is the belief that race is the primary determinant of human capacities, that a certain race is inherently superior or inferior to others, and/or that individuals should be treated differently based on their ascribed race.</strong><br><br>Sometimes racism means beliefs, practices, and institutions that discriminate against people based on their perceived or ascribed race. There is a growing, but controversial, tendency to state that racism is a system of oppression that combines racist beliefs, whether explicit, tacit or unconscious, with the power to have a negative effect on those discriminated against at a societal level.<br><br>Since the last quarter of the 20th century, there have been few in developed nations who describe themselves as racist, so that identification of a group or person as racist is nearly always controversial. Racism is recognised by many as an attack on basic human dignity and on the very notion of human rights. A number of international treaties have sought to end racism. The United Nations uses a definition of racist discrimination, laid out in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and adopted in 1965:<br><br>...any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life. [1] (http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/d_icerd.htm)<br><br>Assuming that every individual's character adequately can be determined by racial or ethnic stereotypes is race prejudice, and granting or withholding rights or privileges based on such stereotypes is racial discrimination. The term racism sometimes is used to mean a strong and persistent bias towards these activities.<br><br>Some believe that the term also is often used incorrectly by supporters of cultural relativism and political correctness to stigmatise their adversaries.<br><br>Racism is a controversial issue. Whether there is any validity to the concept of race is an issue that is discussed in the article Race. The issue of how and if past practices might be remedied is discussed in Affirmative action, reverse discrimination, and, briefly, in the reparations section of the article on slavery.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>From Sammyboy's Alfresco Coffee Shop Â™</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OZ/NZ emigration? Myths dispelled posted by leongsam (aka mr sammyboy himself)</span><br><br>Some Common Myths dispelled<br>1. Australia / New Zealand are racist countries.<br><br>False!<br><br>If you belong to one the minority ethnic groups in Singapore (Indian, Malay, Eurasian etc), you'll find that OZ/NZ are a lot LESS racist than Singapore in every aspect.<br><br>If you're an ethnic Chinese Singaporean, the difficulties you may experience (as a new immigrant) when you apply for a job, is not racism but a loss of your "old boy" network.<br><br>In Singapore, when you go for a job interview, chances are you have something in common with the interviewer. You may find that you were in the same army camp, or you went to the same school, or the same church, or you both support Geylang United. These sorts of common experiences create bonding and lead to you being hired.<br><br>When you arrive in OZ or NZ, you know nuts about rugby, OZ rules football or cricket. You have nothing in common with the OZs.<br><br>The interviewer also knows absolutely nothing about you and your proud heritage. NUS is unknown in OZ. Being educated in "Raffles Institution" opens doors in Singapore but means precious little to an average OZ or NZer.<br><br>To overcome this hurdle, the solution is simple... START NETWORKING! Join a church and volunteer on the committees. Do some charity and social work.<br><br>If you are an expert in a certain field, offer your services for FREE to get established. When I first arrived in OZ, my first 3 web design projects were done FOC. After 6 years, I now demand top dollar and I get still get the project.<br><br>Establish your reputation in ANY country and you'll find that "racism" is no longer in your vocabulary. It's only those with defeatist attitudes that scream "RACISM" with every negative experience.<br><br>2. Taxes are very high in these countries.<br><br>False!<br><br>Taxes are only low in Singapore if you live in a 3 room HDB flat, take public transport and own a hawker stall where you don't declare your actual income.<br><br>Those who drive a car, own a 5 room HDB flat, enjoy a good drinking session every so often and are salaried employees actually pay astronomical amounts of taxes every year in the form of COE. ARF. Road Tax, ERP, liquor taxes, property tax, parking fees, regular fines and so on.<br><br>In Australia, all you need to do to lower your tax burden is to set up a small home business so that you can offset a good portion of your expenses against your earnings. NZ is the same. You'll then find that you can own 3 cars and a 4 bedroom house and still be paying less tax overall compared to Singapore.<br><br>3. Services are very expensive.<br><br>False!<br><br>Plumbing, car repairs, electricians, gardening are all very competitive nowadays and probably only about 10% more (at most) compared to what you would pay in Singapore. With the free time available and the prolific number of DIY stores, more often than not, you'll probably find yourself happily doing your own repairs. Eg I now do my own oil change and the oil costs a lot less here than it does in Singapore.<br><br>4. Food is expensive.<br><br>False!<br><br>If you go to posh restaurants, you'll pay the earth no matter what country you are in. There are food courts in all major cities which are no more expensive than their Singapore equivalents.<br><br>If you cook at home, food is actually cheaper! Asian fare is readily available in all major cities and the large Asian population in most cities has resulted in a proliferation of shops selling Asian spices. This has brought the prices down considerably.<br><br>Once you arrive in OZ/NZ and settle down, you'll find yourself actually eating a lot more at home. The reason is simple... it's FUN!<br><br>People have more time for leisure in OZ/NZ. You'll be home by 5.30 pm (or earlier) and it is extremely common for friends to get together for dinner. If you live in the suburbs, you'll definitely have a reasonably large yard (with that famous BBQ) where everyone gets together to fill their faces. The kids can play in the garden while the adults eat and booze. Now THAT'S what I call LIFE!<br><br>5. It's bloody boring!<br><br>False!<br><br>I'll qualify that... if your idea of excitement is window shopping along Orchard Road from dawn to dusk, then by all means stay on in Singapore.<br><br>Large countries like OZ/NZ offer a lot more variety. There is so much to do I won't go into it here. Needless to say, if you can't enjoy leisure activities in these countries, there's something wrong with YOU!... not the country!<br><br>For the die hards who enjoy Karaoke, Brothels, Nightclubs, Bars and Watering Holes, rest assured that the large cities in OZ / NZ offer the same sinful experiences at a much cheaper rate.<br><br>If you're a mahjong addict, you'll soon meet like minded people from Singapore, Malaysia, HK, Taiwan and the Mainland. Overnight mahjong sessions are common... no different from Singapore.<br><br>There are large shopping centres in Sydney and Auckland that open till late at night. Supermarkets open 24 hours. There are loads of Casinos which are great fun even if you don't gamble. I have not been to all the larger cities in OZ but I'm sure things are similar.<br><br>6. The School System is inferior.<br><br>Let's put it this way... the emphasis is different. Singapore stresses scholastic achievement and absolutely nothing else. Inferior kids are labelled as LOSERS from an early age and they have to wear that label around their necks throughout by being called "normal".<br><br>OZ / NZ strive for a rounded education. The aim is to bring out the best in each and every child regardless of their scholastic ability.<br><br>There are excellent schools and lousy schools in any country. If you want the best for your kid, send them to private school. Good public schools are easily available. Do your homework.<br><br>6. The crime rates are very high.<br><br>False!<br><br>This is where the shitty times always has a field day putting down OZ by generalising and not painting a true picture of the situation.<br><br>There are parts of the large cities where the crime rates are high. However, a bit of common sense will surely keep you out of these areas. You need to be pretty dumb to walk into a gang infested ghetto at 1.00 am while drug deals are being negotiated.<br><br>However, the good neighbourhoods are as safe as singapore. There is a higher risk of being burgled though and that's because of the complete absence of iron grills and fences in many OZ suburbs.<br><br>Get yourself a large rottweiller and install a good burgler alarm and you have nothing much to worry about.<br><br>Most rural areas are even safer than Singapore. I leave my rural property unlocked for weeks on end and I have never lost anything.<br><br>Happy emigration!<br><br></div>
