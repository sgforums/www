Or is it a closed society where the mass mediaÂ—the newspapers, journals, publications, TV, radio. . . feed menÂ’s minds with a constant drone of sycophantic support for a particular orthodox philosophy?Â”</span></span><br><br><strong>Ironically, these eloquent statements seem to have faded away, as Singapore has supposedly progress into the First World, and those 'BATTLE CRIES' that appeal for sanity and clear thinking are now conveniently dispensed and forgotten.</strong><br><br>FORTY YEARS ago, LKY had offered these ideals so emotionally, appealing to Singaporeans to support his position.<br><br>FORTY YEARS later, after gaining the upper hand in politics with the support of Singaporeans who answered his calls by remaining loyal to his politics, these ideals are now suppressed.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everytime before they are being elected as the government and being the leader as they are the opposition, they would crticise the government not having freedom of speech, lower taxes etc and say that they would bring in this measures if the people elected them. But if they are being elected as the government. They would bring in minimal measures to take place and the rest would be supressed and saying that they are no good or whatever thing. So this shows that all the government in the world is not really perfect and they will sometimes break their promises. So being in a government it is quite difficult to rule over the country and implementing of measures too as they want the country to be peaceful  like banning strikes and etc.</div>
