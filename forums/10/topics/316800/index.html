              <p>Many times I have seen very well written pleas by forumers in this site and others pleading with PM Lee, ministers or MM Lee to change its hard-hearted draconian policies aimed at serving leaders' or ruling party's own selfish interests, claiming credits or success or glory.</p>
              <p>I do not see any of such posts be acknowledged with PM Lee continuing to talk like he or the government is the one which created success with again many more new measures taken like the past to cause more hardship to the people.</p>
              <p>Will such reasonable voices of the people be heard? <br> <br> For example many posts were written about PM Lee causing rising costs of living with increases of GST even in year when government was making good surpluses with no necessity to up taxes at all.</p>
              <p>There has been no acknowledgement of such errors or heartless behavior on the part of PM Lee.</p>
              <p>The saddest part is for some 40 plus years people supported the government
              and made great sacrifices and yet what we see is a mercenary and
              selfish government which continue to exploit the people endlessly
              without any compassions or remorse.<br> <br> It is the people who have trusted the ruling party, to give them a
              second or a third chance and a fourth chance to prove their abilities
              and leadership and the heartless leaders simply took all these for
              granted and claim glory and success.<br> <br> It is the people who through enduring all kinds of pains and making
              necessary sacrifices who have uplifted the moribund economy caused by
              inefficiency in restructuring the economy time and again.<br> <br> The leaders have long ago failed to run the country as witnessed by the
              deep recessions time and again with little or no idea to upgrade the
              economy except in playing with property and taking a ride on world
              recovery to claim credit for themselves.<br> <br> But look at what is happening. Leaders will continue to make it look
              like their own success with people continuing to suffer rising costs
              and more hardship to no end.<br> <br> With this type of responses so far from the leaders I see no change and your prayers will not be answered.</p>

              <p>So tell me how you guys intend to tackle the problem of rising food costs thats happening globally?</p>
              <p>How do you intend to fight inflation?</p>
              <p>What schemes or plans do you have to combat rising energy costs?  Oil is expected to hit $200 per barrel by 2010. </p>
              <p>Even if all the MIW take a pay cut now, also won't solve much problems.  Perhaps some geniuses (if any here please take the hint), should get attracted by the superscale salary and join PAP to figure out how to get us out of this mess.</p>
              <p>The only thing that I feel bitter about is all that bullsh1t in the 198x about "Leading a Simple Life, be content."  Remember this chinese song called, "Xiao ren wu de xin sheng?"  I think that pretty much killed the sense of adventurism and ambition for a whole generation of Singaporeans.  That generation turned out to be a bunch of, "I'm content with what I'm getting, so I'm just gonna vote for the same ol guys."</p>

              <p>The higher the oil price, the happier the government.  Singapore is effectively an oil exporting country with the cheap oil contract signed in the past.  There is no reason why the government should increase oil price in Singapore.  We should get a subsidy instead.</p>
              <p>With the SGD highly appreciated, the government will announce soon, look people, inflation is very low here.  Stop complainting.</p>

              <p>like a typical PAP  supporterwho blame others for not making suggestion but more than often failure to take suggestion / feedback from citizens.</p>
              <p>here is my FOC suggestion.</p>
              <p>1.get rid of GST taxes from all necessity items until prices resume normal. such as rice,cooking oil, sugar,salt, meat, flour and etc.</p>
              <p>2.shelve the implementation of new ERP entry.</p>
              <p>3. speed up the process of allowing CNG usage for private cars.</p>
              <p>4. promote high tech agriculture that suit singapore. reduce dependency on foreign country.</p>
              <p>5.promote extensive use of green energy. such as reduce tax for green cars such as hybrid cars to make it more affordable to public.</p>
              <p>i had done my part FOC. but you have dont nothing but blame others for blaming govt!!</p>

In the word of the almight PAP - 'competition'. We need to get more opposing views into parliament. Look at the number of snoring faces during parliament sittings.

We need to get back to the basic. We need a political climate where the voters hold the each and every politician accountable for his words and action. And we need lively and real debate with sparring of ideas and germination of solutions in parliament - not snoring.   <br>    </p></div>
