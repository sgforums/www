            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Just for the fun of discussion, lets speak hypothetically.<br><br>The Thai Military Expansion.<br><br>We all know that Thailand is know control by a militarilistic government. The current Thai PM, with the support of the Thai king would probably replace the parliament with military generals.<br><br>Needless to say, balls will get bigger in Thailand and military spendings are bound to raise. Thailand would begin re-structuring her military organisation and rebuilding her former glory. After all, Thailand was the only country that was not colonize in S.E.A during the colonial times.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Cannons would begin to point towards Burma/Myanmar, which was Thailand's traditional rival. Centuries of war have been fought between these 2 countries. e.g. white elephant war, , ransacking of temples. Some of Myanmar lands like the Shan States have been disputed and claimed by Thailand.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The Thai military expansion would probably go eastwards too. To Laos and Cambodia. These states have been traditionally Thai sovereign, Thailand gave up sovereignty of these states due to external pressures and colonial<br>appleasement. Moreover, Cambodia and Laos are 3rd world countries that so culturally similiar to Thailand. Would we see a merger similiar to Germany-Austria? or a swift invasion like Germany-Poland?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Then there is Thailand's restless muslim malay southern states. In an effort to pacify the southern thai states, would Thailand move southwards to attack West malaysia on the pretext of merger to 2 malays peoples together.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Lastly on the southern most tip of Malaya lies Singapore. Where all the ruckus of Thai militarism began. Singapore's Ho Ching made a blunder that ousted Thaksin's economic driven govt. A singaporean 96% buyover of Shin Corp would mean that Thailand will have the right to accuse Singapore of spying. Afterall, Shin Corp is a multi-billion communication govt-linked cooperation in Thailand. Thailand would invade Singapore too on the grounds that Singapore's Temasek-Shin Corp had top secret information that would jeopordize Thailand.<br><br>History has shown that the Thai's are very politically smart, avoiding centuries of colonization and war. E.g. the alliance between japan-thai during WW2 that resulted to the collapse of S.E.A and hasten the battle in oceania.<br><br>We are already beginning to see the change in Thailand's politics. Ecomomy boosting plans have been shelved off in flavour of military spending. Singapore-Thailand cold war, Thailand reviewing Singapore's used of Saiyuk Camp...<br><br>Would a mistake by Singapore's Elite Ho Ching pave the way for a major S.E.A war that includes Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia and Singapore?</div>

In the Battle of Hakata the mongolians after defeating the samurais in a small battle (because they used long spears,bows and arrows)thought they were ready for a big invasion.Two years later they landed again in Japan with a giant fleet of ships but this time they chose to go into close combat.At the end of the day,they kena sliced teruk teruk by the blade and retreated to their anchored vessels.......then suay suay came a big typhoon and the whole Mongolian navy got sandwitch between the bad weather and the blood thirsty shorties.....lan lan what to do?

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, open up to possibilities...<br><br>imagine what a China backed Thailand.<br><br>Thailand's invasion on backwater 3rd world countries would be cake. Burma,Laos,Cambodia are drug, corrupted govt regimes by past dictators. They are too poor and weak to defend from Thai aggression. Due to the fact that Burma,Laos and Cambodia does not have much support from superpowers like USA herself too. Cultural identity would probably assimilate these countries too, making the task even easier for Thailand.<br><br>With Burma, Laos and Cambodia as Thailand's resource hinterland. Thailand would begin her southward advancement. Malayan Peninsula. Malaysia does not really have any really good friends to back the bumis too. Perhaps the 30% of chinese population in Malaysia would welcome this move too, afterall, the are unhappy with UNMO's bumiputra and unpopular policies. (note that thailand herself has 15% chinese population too)<br><br>Malaysia, without much political/military friends and racial discontentment would be absorpted to Thai's expansion too.<br><br>Lastly, and the trickiest part would be Singapore. Can Singapore be strong enough to defend from the King's armies?<br><br>Lets not talk about USA helping S.E.A region. Iraq-USA war had led much discontentment. The Vietnam wars also led to USA's failure on foreign policies. Morale in USA would be too low for them to send another 100k troops half the world across to fight an unmotivated war. Isn't it wierd tht you people say u dun like to bootlick ang mo's ass, but u guys expect ang mo's to save our ass?<br><br>Again, hypothetically speaking.</div>

In ancient times no warrior could stand a chance against a samurai swordsman not even your great great grandfather Wong Fei Hong OK! In the Battle of Hakata the mongolians after defeating the samurais in a small battle (because they used long spears,bows and arrows)thought they were ready for a big invasion.Two years later they landed again in Japan with a giant fleet of ships but this time they chose to go into close combat.At the end of the day,they kena sliced teruk teruk by the blade and retreated to their anchored vessels.......then suay suay came a big typhoon and the whole Mongolian navy got sandwitch between the bad weather and the blood thirsty shorties.....lan lan what to do? All die lah!! Till this day you can never find a good mongolian sailor.How this story ok or not??If hollywood dowan done I go to bollywood now</div></blockquote>Dun over glamour samurais la...Got one time a samurai managed to slice off a gurka hand..And the gurka stare and smiled "u may have chopped off mine hand but u have not killed mine heart.." With that statement the Gurkha sliced off the samurai head with his thick and short kuri gurkha knife..(True story)<br><br>So morale of the story is samurais is not what they seems invincible la...<br><br>Got one more story is that when the jap forces stepped into Thailand borders..Got 1 japanese general challegence a thai rebel to a sword fight wanting to test wheater which sword skill is more superior..With that the Thai simply smile and say "sure'..The japanese general charged with ferocity at the still standing rebel..Between a arm distance away from the still standing rebel..The rebel just took out a hand pistol and shoot him dead in the face  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
