Thailand has enough problems with the south as it is, don't think they want to add to the problems. You might as well suggest that USA and China go into an alliance to dominate the world, each country taking possession of half of the world.<br><br>Invade Laos, Cambodia and Burma? Like you said, these countries are all undeveloped economies, why would a rich person living in a Bungalow go rob a person living in a 1 room HDB?<br><br>Hello! Reality Check!</div></blockquote>Ok, lets look long term. Which country would be major superpowers in Asia in years to come?<br><br>China and India?<br><br>Theres a saying a hill ain't too big for 2 tigers. China in supporting Thai's action would have her gain a strong ally on her side. Moreover, a strong buffer state would be needed to mediate the issues between these 2 countries. If Thai's Junta really to be turned agressive, who would want to be her allies or enemies?<br><br>As for Laos, Cambodia and Burma, yeah, they are dirt poor countries but they have land and resources. These would be good feeder states to Thai. On the pretext of liberating Laos,Cambodia and Burma from their ill-governed government, Thai would invade and later develop to make these areas Thai's war hinterland. Like what germany did to poland. Dumping POWs there would be a good idea too.</div>

Then theres massacre the citizens. "Maintaining" would marshall law imposed. Then theres also an option to razed the city to the ground. Wanna talk game might as well say build more police HQ and lower the taxes loh, else try moving a governor to the city.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
