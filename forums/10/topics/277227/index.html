            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>After the Iraq war, oil price skyrocket, out of control, pollution and global warming, the west and Japan have focussed more than ever before to use alternate energies.  You now have Toyota Prius, and other hyrid and 100% electric cars that run faster than any lambo (no joke!).<br><br>I see this as a certain reality.<br><br>This leads to the question.  How much of our GDP comes from crude oil processing and refinery?<br><br>Where is singapore going to cover this loss in future?<br><br>What is the master plan , if any? Has it started ? If not, should they start planning now?<br><br>Its said that it will take some time before most cars do not run on diesel or petrol. But the effect has already started although still very few are hybrid / electric. In as short as  10 years time, more cars will not need much petrol. And these car will only get cheaper by the years. In 20 years, I predict the effect will be substantial. In 40 years time, most cars should run on electricity or alternative forms of energy. no more glory days for oil cartels. L<br><br>So, I am worried that our super world class world record talents , not sure they have any idea how to deal with this loss of GDP ?<br><br></div>
