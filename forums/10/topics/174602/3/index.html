            <div class='col-md body'>On the surface, a credit card problem seems to be the irresponsible educated young people of this generation. But look at the Credit Card problem at another view - The rising debt could be due to ease of getting credit over the years.  Applying for DBS cash line used to be laden with restrictions but now it comes together with a credit card application without you even applying for it. The rise in credit card problems is also due to relaxing of credit policies by the government.</div>

Money lending has been around for a long time, and the reason those ah longs never get a chance to become legalize is because they never get approved nor permitted. So why are those loansharks not approved to become a legalize entity is because the government rationale is that these money lending scums are harming the society. And today, money lending is legalized, and at those cut throat interest rates, I do believe it's comparable to loan sharks as well as harming the society. But why is it legalized for SingPost to do it? Well, go figure, your guess is probably as good as mine...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

But most Singaporeans are average. 10k is the highest target I set. </div></blockquote>You have your point, but the rule of thumb for angpow is $60, $80 or $200 in very very special case where it's a close friend or big big boss or big big customer then lan lan.<br><br>1 table at hotel banquet normally $600 to $800<br>1 table at famous restaurant also cost $300 to $400 liao.<br>1 table can sit 8-10 people<br><br>1 wedding banquet at least 25-30 tables though I have seen some with 10 tables at private weddings.<br><br>so by simple division you can find out much you need to pay so you won't overpay or underpay lor and normally people do that, before going in ask each other "how you pay, how much you pay".<br><br>Most singaporeans may be average but one of the main bulk group of guest one often sees being invited to such dinners are office colleagues, ex-office colleagues or close uni friends of many years, not school student or army boy. And normally these people are already in their late 20's or 30+ and already working for some years. So the collection may be more than 10k.<br><br>But the point is the couple getting married have saved enough to pay for the dinner so it's already planned and budgeted for so whether they can recoup that amount from angpow or how much collection is immaterial. Therefore it's unlikely a wedding dinner costing 40k will mire them into any bankruptcy.</div>
