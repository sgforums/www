            <div class='col-md body'>Bad Economy or Poor Money Management?<br>Your views?<br><br>====================================================<br>Credit Counselling S'pore<br>By Pearl Forss, Channel NewsAsia<br><br>SINGAPORE : A new support group has been set up in the business district for professionals facing severe credit problems, after counsellors find that more young professionals are slipping into a life of debt.<br><br>Well-educated, a string of credit cards in their wallets, and often living a lifestyle beyond their means - non-profit organisation Credit Counselling Singapore says these are the main characteristics of many of the 1,100 people they are currently counselling for debt problems.<br><br>Some 600 of them have signed up for debt management programmes to structure their repayments to the banks.<br><br>In August 2004, Edward Job started a help centre in Geylang for those with gambling debts and loan shark problems.<br><br>Back then, most who turned up at the One Hope Centre were low and middle income debtors.<br><br>But in recent months, high income young debtors in trouble with banks have started turning up too.<br><br>So he started another support group in the financial district in January this year to help this group.<br><br>And so far, 40 to 50 people are attending the support group meetings every Thursday.<br><br>Said Edward Job, founder of One Hope Centre: "Most of them are living a wrong lifestyle. Sometimes they buy car without thinking whether they are able to pay tomorrow.<br><br>"All of a sudden, they find themselves having a pay cut or they may lose their jobs. And they can't pay their debts incurred on hire purchase companies. Their car may be repossessed and if being sold, they have to pay the difference."<br><br>In the last four years, about 500 young people between the ages of 30 and 40 were made bankrupt each year, due mainly to credit card debt.<br><br>Credit counsellors call this group of debtors the "new poor" in Singapore. They earn more than the bottom 20% of the population but after deducting their loan repayments, their remaining disposable income sometimes puts them in dire situations.<br><br>For an in-depth look at this issue, catch "Generation Debt," the next episode of Get Rea! on Wednesday January 18 at 8.30pm on Channel NewsAsia.<br><br></div>

Not the wedding ceremony.<br><br>I've heard and seen so many glamorous weddings that went up in smoke in just one two or three years!<br><br>In many things in life, I believe in the contents of a thing. Not the cover, wrappings, and or presentation.<br><br>I knew a friend of mine - he spent well over $40k on his wedding dinner, made everybody so envious and made a really good impression with his in-laws. But now he's regularly quarrelling with his wife, paying up the bank for the wedding costs, and in the process of divorce.<br><br>If I had spent so much on my wedding just to show off, today I may not be able to buy my wife the new SUZUKI Swift while I drive a Jaguar S Type and a commercial van for my business?<br><br></div></blockquote>Perhaps it is time that Singaporeans have to forego tradition(esp ethnic Chinese) and instead replace it with angmoh style of wedding reception?</div>
