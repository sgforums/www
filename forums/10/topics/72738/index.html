Come on, you can be honest </strong><br>By Asad Latif<br><br>I WAS amazed to receive your e-mail. Here I am, a baby not yet born, and there you are, in Singapore, asking for an interview. I dare say that technology is one of Singapore's major draws.<br><br>You say that everyone has a view on Singapore's baby shortfall. The carrots being dangled in front of couples are getting bigger, but there is talk of using the stick as well if people do not respond. In this frenzy, people have forgotten us - the babies-to-be.<br><br>Do I want to be born in Singapore? That was your question.<br><br>Here is my answer.<br><br>What I find astonishing about your baby debate is that it is not about babies but dollars. How much does it take to bring up a child? What does he cost his mother? How far should she be rewarded for her motherhood? How about men? Could they get some time off - time is money - for being fathers?<br><br>I do not know whether to laugh or to cry at those questions. Have these couples ever wondered whether their parents would not have been better off without having them? Are they willing to pay their parents for the bother of raising them, for dreams unfulfilled, for opportunities foregone? What is the going rate?<br><br>So why should we, the unborn seeking the sun, be born in a world of cold calculations? Why cannot couples just have us, as their parents had them, and take life from there?<br><br>I do understand why your government is desperate. Unlike parents who can choose not to have children, a government cannot choose not to have a country. A country requires people to work for it, fight for it and make babies for it.<br><br>Yet, there are problems. Asad, have you noticed how often the word 'contribution' is used in your Singapore? It is such a big word that I can barely spell it correctly.<br><br>Society values a person for what he or she contributes, ultimately to the economy. Baby incentives are the smiling face of the same coin whose other face demands sternly that the child contribute to the economy.<br><br>I have nothing against contributing, of course. In fact, I shall hardly mind if, some day, I pay more in taxes a year than what someone makes by way of a salary.<br><br>However, I cannot guarantee this. I am a brainy child-to-be, and so I know what is a guarantee, but how can I promise it? Can you promise me that Singapore will accept me whether my talents lie in making money or in making music, in excelling at things which make me happy without making others suffer?<br><br>I want to be born. Can you promise me that Singapore will cherish me for what I will be - which I do not know now - rather than treasure me for what it wants me to be?<br><br>Do not call my questions childish: I am not even a child yet. I know that there is no country where children rule. Everywhere, people welcome the next generation as the future, but by the time that generation comes of age, the future has passed into its past and it is time for another future, another carpet of mile-long hopes laid out for another generation waiting to be born.<br><br>I understand all this, but can you understand what I am saying? I am saying that I want to be myself, and so long as you count me in dollars, I am too precious to be born.<br><br>Are you upset, Asad? Sorry, but you wanted me to speak the truth.<br><br>All right, calm down. I have more to say about Singapore.<br><br>You have a lot going for you. I can be born in your country without cats and dogs hosting my reception on the hospital floor.<br><br>No civil war will kill me before the age of four. No mother will need to sell me off at 12 if I am a girl. No starving father will have to depend on my eight-year-old arms to bring food home by carrying the bricks with which the rich build their homes.<br><br>Your schools are not communes, but they are not palaces, either. They are playpens of the nation. Every child gets the same toys - English, maths, science, the mother tongue - with which to build tomorrow's Singapore.<br><br>These sharp toys often cut tender skin - God help the Singaporean who does not know how to play with them - but, at least, no Singapore child has to become a foreign worker because his parents were too poor to give him the most expensive of toys: English, the passport to the riches of the globe.<br><br>And, most of all, Singapore stops no child from climbing into its lap because of the colour of his skin or the name of his faith.<br><br>That is why I want to be born there.<br><br>I do not know what I shall be if I am born: girl or boy, a tycoon's child or a gangster's brat, the darling of my parents or the debris of a broken home.<br><br>I have no idea of which race or religion awaits my arrival. I do not know what my chances in life will be. Will I excel in school or elbow my way through the university of life? I do not know.<br><br>But I can speak about Singapore honestly because I do not know how the dice will fall for me.<br><br>I do want the dice to fall for me in Singapore because I want to live before I can struggle to be what I want to be.<br><br>For that, I need a set of parents.<br><br>Could you pass the word around?<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Yours Sincerely,<br>unborn child<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason why babies are viewed as dollars and cents and mere numbers is because the individual Singaporean never really mattered much to The Party for consideration at all.<br><br>Instead of building a soceity with systems which nutures each individual to discover his own ability and potential and to serve soceity in his own gifting and talent (the only exception being the system of NS). What we get instead is a Party that's always focused on the "needs" of the majority, expecting every single person to be mass-produced, factory-stamped units with put into very rigid moulds of preformance citera, yes, we are little more then parts in a machine, lifestock destined to go no futher then our holding pens.<br><br>For The Party, it's always a case of one for all and all for all. In the end everybody suffers except for the select few who are determined to be holding most of the stakes in Singapore's interests.<br><br>Since we don't matter to them as individuals, it is logical for them to think in terms of numbers rather then treating the Singaporean as an individual with his own aspirations and dreams, as a unique unit.<br><br>Hence their measures are just one more in another in a ham-fisted attempt to hammer what they view to be another area of Singaporeans exercising to much individuality into its place, and I have no illusions over what they might try...<br><br></div>

And of course the sharpest one of all would be the mother tongue, in particular CHinese: CL 'B' is NOT going to help at all, if they do not make the textbooks more interesting and relevant to the modern life.<br><br>then the unborn praises Singapore for all the benefits you get being born here i.e no civil wars, racial equality, economic strengh etc. of course, there are no civil wars. racial equality and economic strength, however, are rather facadious, considering the alleged formation of "racial enclaves" in our schools and foreign (white)preference in job application. as for economic strength, is it really accurate to say that the lay Singaporean is "rich"? lastly, the unborn forgot that being born in SIngapore means that he will not be able to speak his mind out on politicla matters as then he will be labelled as a "defamer".<br><br>i guess it is alright for the unborn to ask for a set of parents, but...*sigh*, this is soooo complex!<br><br>the pikamaster with conflicting thoughts</div>

We too are tired ourselves and we both have other things we want to do. (Like writing in forums) We cannot even have a chance to talk to them or bond to them properly... If I have more children, this short period of time will be divided even lesser. I will have lesser and lesser chance to emotionally attached to them. I do not know who is their best friend, I do not know their preferences, I do not know why they are more and more close up to their friends then to us. I do not want a situation where everyday I ask them "how is your day ? " and they sum it up in a word, "Fine".

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno, nowadays, everybody seems to be so money oriented. happiness is equated to the amount of luxury items. People get dissatishfied easily. The reason why many people can't get along with their lives is because they don't want to adapt regardless of the situation. They prefer to keep a lavish lifestyle rather than to downgrade during bad times. True, this is countrary to the swiss living thing, the gct promised us. But couldn't we be more realistic?<br>I have friends in dept too. But many of them fall into this dept because during good times they spend much of their money on expensive houses, cars and luxurious items etc. But when times are bad and they lose a large proportion of their incomes, they start to have problems paying for their loans. I mean such things could be controlled by individuals. It is all about  foresight. Like the weather, nothing can never be ideal at al all times. So save for a rainy day. Never know when you will need those extra cash.<br>As for jobs, you can't satishfy the whole world,everything goes by demand and supply. I am no economics expert, but every body knows that when there are low demands for something you can't just make extra jobs to accomodate them.I dunno about others, but if i were retrenched, i am willing to take on any job that pass my way, just to keep myself alive and wait till better times pass my way. The thing is, people are getting choosy nowadays. So many lament about the lack of jobs etc. So looking from another perspective, Singapore ain't that bad, it is just how you adapt.</div>
