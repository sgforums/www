            <div class='col-md body'>I was at a conference for some Rights movement (can't remember which one...) and CSJ was one of the guest speakers.  When it was open to the floor to ask questions, I asked him if it was strategic for him, given his political standing and reputation, to be seen as spearheading an otherwise politically neutral issue raised on a politically neutral platform.  He reacted rather violently and emotionally to that, saying if we don't want him there (at the conference) he can leave.  Um... really, all I expected was a simple rationale and composed reply to what I thought was a fair question (albeit somewhat confrontational).  That emotional and not so mature reaction didn't leave a good impression.</div>
