When did I say that speaking for the ppl is "the only job of the MP"?<br><br>If it is my boss who can change the legislation on political party, it will be PAP and the other, may be a renegade party split from PAP. As for WP, Low Thia Khiang has good track record, Goh Meng Seng is pretty down to earth, seen so in his exchanges on the Casino issue, Sylvia Lim is approachable, the friendly type, no air and she has a pretty face. As for the rest, especially the young ones, I will see how they grow, before I decide if and how I should put in a word to my Â“bossesÂ”.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>You can discuss in details with Robert Teh about Democracy.

PAP is not strong because the opposition is weak and the opposition cannot hope to be elected because of a weak PAP, because they are not.

What exactly is the interest of the country? you keep saying CSJ is putting down Singapore as his working with some foreign organisations and his doing things that is not in the interest of the ppl. So what is your definition of the interest of the ppl? my quote from the earlier post:<br><br><blockquote>is this good for the country? having nations like australia boycotting singapore is what the ppl of singapore wants? have more MNCs from australia refusing to set up business in sg becos of nguyen is also the interest of the ppl?</blockquote>As a singaporean, I can tell you no, I don't support the execution. Another question is, if for example every singaporean  supports the execution of nguyen at the cost of a trade embargo and the cancel of the free trade agreement between singapore and australia and singapore suffer, do you think then, the interest of the country is less important the the interest of the ppl? that, in my opinion, is what i mean by thinking of the interest of the country.</div>

Its important that we have passionate ppl to work for the country instead of the PAP, whose impression to me is to leach our money and our labor, while treating us like slaves. Singapore, to me, is in a bad shape. Honestly, i feel our opposition isn't doing much simply because only 2 seats in parliament is being occupied at the moment. Chiam See Tong is old, so is JB Jeyaratnam. Opposition figures are few in Singapore simply because of the fear of defamation lawsuits, which some ppl see it as being lopsided. Not to mention their livelihood. At times like this, we cannot afford to lose more prominent opposition figures. The consequences of not having enough opposition is dire. GST has already rise to 5 per cent, electricity bills have gone up, but definitely not our money. Do we want to see GST rising to 7 per cent after the upcoming elections, water/electricity bills going up and yet we are unable to do anything? So instead of condemning CSJ, which might be seen as the weakest link among opposition figures, why not give him a chance and see what he do and view his argument from another perspective? if there are more opposition figures in parliament, the ppl, we could be sure that our views are not being treated like dirt, like the casino thing, where the PAP suka suka decided on the casino even tho there are a lot of ppl that are against it.</div>
