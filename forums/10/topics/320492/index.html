              <p>I drive to work every morning. My office offers free parking and since it's only 10km from my house, petrol consumption is minimal considering the quality of living. Approximately $2.10 per trip. It usually takes 15 - 20min.</p>
              <p>I could have taken bus to work though. It's just 2 service changes but the routing make the distant further. I also have to wake up earlier so that I can join the crowd, squeeze and cross 2 overhead bridges. It takes 45min to travel 10km. Bus fare is about $1.71.</p>
              <p>With the rising petrol prices, I decided to cycle to work. 10km is manageable and I can probably reach there in 45min max. Also a good form of exercise. But the issue is, I feared getting knocked down my speeding cars and trucks.</p>
              <p>I dun understand the rationale of traffic police that cyclists cannot cycle on pavement and must cycle on open road with other traffic. I am a driver and I know that cyclists on the tarmac is a danger to both the cyclist as well as to other drivers who are always trying to avoid them while maintaining their fuel efficient speed and not letting other kiasu Singaporeans cut into their lane.</p>
              <p>The average safe speed for a cyclist is around 15 - 20km/hr but that would be a complete road hog to motorists. And mind you traveling at 20k/hr upslope is a killer!!!!</p>
              <p>It seems that the traffic police favours road accidents involving cyclist and motorist instead of cyclist and padestrian. But I think the mortality rate for the formal is higher!</p>
              <p>On one end, LTA is encouraging people to ditch their car and opt for public transport but alternatives to car ownership have huge disparities I think it's amusing. On the other hand, there is no support to make road suitable for cycling as a decent mode of transportation beside leisure/sport.</p>
              <p>Say I manage to survive my ride to the nearest MRT station. I cannot bring my bike onboard the train and locking my bicycle there is a sure way of having it stolen.</p>
              <p>Ok, enough of that. I was ordering my lunch and I realized that most stalls are using disposible utensils? Wow...not only the cost is passed on to me, the utensils are filmsy. After all the money spent in ads telling us to conserve energy, I think NEA is not even close to pass. Peole are still using disposibles. More resources have spent on picking the wrappers of the chopsticks from littered floor.</p>
              <p>Is it really that costly to hire someone or buy a machine to wash the untensils instead of using disposible utensils and getting rid of them?</p>
              <p>I think we need to be conditioned to live in an environment. I am talking about air-conditioning next. As I am typing this out, I am wearing a nice cozy sports jackey in my 22.4 degree Celsius office. Today is consider 'warmer' already as it can go to 21.5 degree Celsius on cranky days!!</p>
              <p>Frankly, I find any air-con below 25 degree Celsius too cold for comfort. I dun need the static chill of 21 degree Celsius. I want moving air of 26 degree Celsius. It's not just my office -  malls, libraries, movie theaters, buses, and food courts are all damn cold.</p>
              <p>Can someone coordinate with the agencies and come up with a more comprehensive and wholistic plan?</p>

              <p>hm. you have a point there. but...</p>
              <p>not all stalls use disposables...but i would notice which one uses them and try not to go there that often.</p>
              <p>i think if there's no more aircon in singapore, students like me would perspire to death after school...usually go to library to relax while finding some books...I think some energy using things in our daily life have to be there..</p>
              <p>as for the aircon wise in the office, it'll be better to get opinions from other colleagues as to if really the aircon is too cold for everyone..then maybe it could stay at a standard degree where everyone is ok with it? The more singapore gets warmer, the more people want aircon to be colder...if there's really totally no solution then just have 10mins out of the office and get some natural breeze from outside..I do that all the time in school...</p>
