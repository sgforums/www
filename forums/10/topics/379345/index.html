              <p>The likelihood of opposition winning the next election is very low.  If they can gain more seats say 15-20, then they stand a better chance of being able to persuade more and better people to join them.  I am sure more people will come into the ring when the chances of success is higher.  By the election after next, they might have the candidates to form an alternative cabinet!  Japan new ruling party was set up only 7 years ago.  It took them only 2 elections to gain power!  Hope springs eternal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the foreign investors / govt, so long as our opposition candidates show themselves to be responsible politicians, I believe they are far more receptive towards changes of government than singaporeans.</p>

              <p>with a GRC or a few more seats in the parliament would be considered a win for the opposition. Rome is not built in one day. and I don't believe the opposition would turn the parliament up side down with a few more seats, but that will be a start to encourage more people to come into politics, that is a win.</p>
              <p>If the opposition follow the step of Chiam, Low and Sylvia, meaning responsible, upright, then we will see more get elected, and more opposition leaders will emerge.</p>
              <p>and if the ruling party do not take steps to address the concerns of the majority, then this will gradually lead to an opposition, may be a coalition that will really be a challenge to the PAP, more new opposition leaders will emerge.</p>
              <p>Don't think the investors would take drastic action to withdraw from Singapore.</p>
              <p>I think Singapore electorate is more diversified than the japs, we have the different races, even among the chinese there are those who are less westernized and would still be more concerned about stability, the upper middle and the rich who would not want to see stock market tumble because of a political change.</p>
              <p>How vulnerable is Singapore? the first test is probably when the old lee kick the bucket.</p>

              <p>with a GRC or a few more seats in the parliament would be considered a win for the opposition.

              <p>If the opposition follow the step of Chiam, Low and Sylvia, meaning responsible, upright, then we will see more get elected, and more opposition leaders will emerge.</p>
              <p>and if the ruling party do not take steps to address the concerns of the majority, then this will gradually lead to an opposition, may be a coalition that will really be a challenge to the PAP, more new opposition leaders will emerge.</p>

              <p>well, there are two ways to look at this.  since we cannot expect the opposition to be able to form a govt now, it would be good if the current govt can start listening to the people.  how can we get that message across apart from voting opposition?  i have tried their feedback units, wrote to ST forum, not getting anywhere. and i believe i am not the only one facing this frustration.   Surely, if even "not-so-good" opposition candidates get elected they will start to take it more seriously? </p>
              <p>Standing as an opposition candidate is not something that singaporeans take lightly, especially if you are having a comfortable life.  So, as it is now, I feel any talk about weeding out opposition candidates is premature and counter productive.</p>
              <p>While I also feel that there are some opposition members that I cannot agree with, to claim that "a lot of the opposition idiots are clowns, charlatans or thugs.." is unfair to many opposition members.  Perhaps you have had the misfortune of meeting only those extreme examples, but please do not believe that most opposition members are idiots or clowns. </p>
              <p>To put  my views in context, I would like to declare that though I am not currently an opposition party member , i have friends / relatives who are, and from the way things are going, i will probably get pulled in as well sooner or later.</p>
