              <p>Rather than debate if current status of opposition can lead Singapore....U cannot used our pathetics 1 or 2 opposition member in the parliment to measure the performance when all other ministries are tied to pay n pay.</p>
              <p>I think there is a different  between being a majority in the parliment vs 30%-40% opposition and work their way up to earn Singaporean vote. I think Singaporean would be able to see if opposition can find their identity in the domestics politics of Singapore....</p>

              <p>Has the quality of the X-rated intellect not been trashed more then a few times now and still it believes in its shameless hollow superiority to demand more attention to its idiocy ?</p>
              <p>It is obvious that the low drive and low self-esteem of the X-rated intellect will not be able to appreciate the personal sacrifices of others who are willing to give more of themselves then the wishy-washy position of a X-rat that will change its opinion from one post to another.</p>
              <p>If the X-rat has a little more decency in knowing the difference between being honest then to perpetuate a propaganda lie, it would have at least some honor in being a rat.</p>
              <p>Has the X-rat the ability to prove who has written any book that is "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">filled with irrational drivel, expecting the commoners to go against our rule of law society, sacrifice their lives so that he can be king, get his hands on our treasury funds, enrich himself and his family/cronies, people whom he will and can only trust when he won ?</span></em>"</p>
              <p>Is it not ironic that the X-rat has displayed again its infamous ability to cross its own tongue - by stating the truth of the present political status-quo in Singapore with LKY getting "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">his hands on our treasury funds, enrich himself and his family/cronies, people whom he will and can only trust when he won ?</span></em>"</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>What is the worth of the respect of a X-rated intellect, who will hog the PAP's line of thoughts and pretend to praise the other political parties for working within Singapore Law, but will overlook the indecent lawlessness in the PAP actions towards innocent Singaporean, who are no more then social activists with the interest of Singaporeans in their hearts ?</p>
              <p>What law is the X-rat thinking, when the Attorney-General will re-interprete the laws to protect the Singapore Ministers - who happened to trangressed the laws that are to be applied equally to everyone Singaporean ?</p>
              <p>What law is the X-rat respecting when the PAP cannot even respect the letters of the Town Council Act that require the Government to liase with the Town Councils in implementing any plans for the Constituencies, but will indulge in petty politics to have their own PAP grass-root adviser to perform the same tasks ?</p>
              <p>What kind of idiocy does the X-rat want Singaporeans to believe in while he pretend that such idiocy is normal in its character ?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The danger of the X-rated intellect is that it believes in the superiority of its own idiocy that is based on nothing more then its immense ability to dutifully swallow anything fed to its brain without any second-thought to its own well being.</p>
              <p>Only the complete idiocy of a X-rated intelligence can produce the word "<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">outlawlery</span></strong>" that will surely "<span style="color: #0000ff;">incite naive others to perform <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">civil obedience</span></strong></span>".</p>
              <p>Is there a crime in performing <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">civil obedience</span></strong></span> ?</p>
              <p>Surely Dr Chee should be commended for such a task that is loudly promoted by the idiocy of a X-rated intellect to condemn Dr Chee ?</p>
              <p>With the existence of the X-rated Intellect that indulges in "bare arses" - surely it is a danger to Obama and to the naive followers who are not aware of the perversions of a X-rated rat that possess the intellect of a subverted political idiot ?</p>
              <p>The only one that has been proven to be naive is the X-rated intellect, who has been repeatedly proven to be incapable of any mature thinking, and whose "bare arse" has been trashed more then a few times, owned by a few and discarded by many.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Dr Chee has still alot to learn, just like A Turd here. Either that or he already knew he had lost, so his last gamble to become a ruler is by undemocratic means - by force and upturning every law of the land we cherish and agreed to abide upon, by becoming above the law, an outlaw, spewing hate, disillusionment, twisting words, rumours, lies with half truths, etc.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Is the X-rated intellect intending to change the course of history after being silenced more then once by its own embarrassing political idiocy, and now pretend to claim victory ?</p>
              <p>Surely, the X-rated intellect has not learnt to be more modest, as it continue to try to teach others when it does not even have the ability to find its own X-rated footings ?</p>
              <p>The only one that has been proven to be above the law is LKY and the PAP - who have shown their ruthlessness in not respecting the law by incarcerating anyone whom they will freely accuse to be a "Communist".</p>
              <p>Ironically, the only Communist in Singapore is LKY, himself - as Stalin re-incarnate.</p>
              <p>Should we elevate the X-rated devotion to be LKY's scion and allow the X-rat the opportunity to whiff his fart ?</p>
              <p>Afterall the X-rat is already familiar to LKY's abilities in being - "<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>above the law, an outlaw, spewing hate, disillusionment, twisting words, rumours, lies with half truths, etc.</em></span>" - and all it need is an education by the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/articlesglaw_ruleoflaw.html">‘Lawyers’ Rights Watch Canada report on Singapore’s Judiciary and Legal Profession’ (*1) </a>to further its education.</p>
              <p>When the X-rat has completed its first reading, it should improve its intellectual prowess in understanding - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw06/0610FEE2.HTM">‘Singapore’s Founding Myths vs Freedom’ (*2) </a>- so at least it will sharpen its tiny teeth to have some effect at attempting to bite big.</p>
              <p>Should we raise our hope by any iota that change will come to a die-hard X-rated intellect of a rat ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Sadly, activities such as his and A Turd here only reveal their true agenda, and because of them, they destroy whatever hope for serious genuine opposition political parties to grow, with the disappointed young instead turning to the ruling party to seek for change within a more stable and evolving political plateform.</p>
              <p>I, an insignificant nobody, speaks without prejudice but only true facts as perceived and revealed, nor am I from any political party. I speak only as my birthright as a citizen of my homeland, the land of our forefathers who sacrificed much for us so that we may live all in peace and prosperity, and face any crisis together and not be divided as they once were.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How pathetic the efforts of a true liar must take in attempting to make a half-hearted attempt at turning the tables onto others for its own treacherous effort to destroy any alternative political parties to protect its devotion to the PAP ?</p>
              <p>The X-rat would have been more convincing if it had simply been more forthright in staying with its PAP agenda - why should it be concerned about the political platforms of the Alternative Parties ?</p>
              <p>Is there any need for the X-rat to even respect the WP and SPP, or even to get to know RF - when his own X-rat PAPa knows more about them, then it possibly can ?</p>
              <p>If at all, the pseudo-politics of the X-rat has been exposed for its deceit in attempting to sow discord by taking sides amongst the different alternative political parties, even as it stand firmly in defense of the PAP.</p>
              <p>Yet the X-rat will put up a pretentious front to claim to "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">face any crisis together and not be divided as they once were</span></em>".</p>
              <p>Our forefathers will surely curse at the X-rat for claiming that they were divided, when in actual fact they have resolutely trusted LKY's call for merger with Malaysia, even as LKY had arrested all his opponents to silence the doubts raised.</p>
              <p>The sad part is now known in the short-lived merger that vindicated LKY's opponents, but their vindication is drowned in sorrow by their long term solitary confinement for more then 10 to 30 years - under false charges.</p>
              <p>With its self-declared position as an insignificant "No-Body" - the X-rat may as well be recruited by the Korean glamour girls as the main act in their hit song.</p>
              <p>Why will anyone want to listen to a "No-Body" - when the glamour girls have a better message than the insignificant "nobody in a X-rat</p>
              <p>It would have been better if he had remained incognito, and at least his ignorance will have been a better kept secret for its own mulling.</p>
              <p>Shame on the X-rat for intellectual dishonesty, even as it plagiarize shamelessly the propaganda that it borrow from the PAP and act as its appointed charlatan.</p>

But the western condition of education do not advocate to that closeness, it teaches shrewd way of management more than ethical way of management. No one is a brother or sister, but only colleagues. LKY understood that, he was cambridge trained, therefore, uncle lim and chia or others had failed miserably to understand the implication of politics in a British control state with a Cambridge trained lawyer governing it.</p>

              <p>When PAP first came to power, they were as blurred as a nerd who was attending school on the first day(even tears were shed).So what's there to worry when the oppositions come to power and form the next gov.When that scenario do happen probably PAP is in shamble and out of favour and most likely many of their members will cross over to join the oppositions and continue what they were doing but this time with another boss.</p>
