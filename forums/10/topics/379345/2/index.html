              <p>Have any Singaporeans - who do not see themselves as <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/377726?page=11">‘offsprings from "foreigners" nor see the ethnic Malays as being the son of the Singapore soil’ (*1) </a>- believe in any of the "zwei-siao" venomous crap produced by the MIW ?</p>
              <p>The Singaporeans in the two Hougang and Potong Pasir constituencies cannot be as bad as the resident "zwei-siao-imbecile" in this Speaker's Corner - for giving their ballot to two leaders of a "bunch of idiots" that had formed their respective opposition parties to challenge the MIW ?</p>
              <p>Either the Singaporeans in Hougang and Potong Pasir constituencies are fools, or the resident "zwei-siao-imbecile" must be the biggest idiot in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Note that Singaporeans are unable maintain a facade of stability while holding a protest. If you can remember the race riots of yester years, it's because the people want to organise a protest against what they deem as unfair treatment but it became unstable and degenerate in a riot. This is what Singaporeans do not want, not just to the Singapore government. Even if you want to protest, please do some research on the subject to present as a viable evidence in a court of law. Thus even brought to a court of law, it can be refuted that the appopriate ministry is not doing its job.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it any surprise that everyone remains confused and unfamiliar about the plans from the Alternative Political Parties if they should succeed ?</p>
              <p>Sadly, this situation is largely due to the fact that none of the present Alternative Political Parties in Singapore have published their views on how to correct the errors of the PAP - <strong>EXCEPT</strong> for Chee Soon Juan in several of his books :</p>
              <p>Amongst the six books written, his title "<em>Dare to Change: An Alternative Vision for Singapore</em>" - published in 1994, had detailed the short-comings of the PAP policies since 1966 and had proposed clear solutions for change - and some of his ideas were quietly seen in the changes that the PAP made in the economic reviews after the economic downturn in 2002.</p>
              <p>It was the ability of CSJ to be so clear in his thinking that he was viewed by LKY and the PAP as the most potent threat over the long term that required CSJ to be "<em>fixed</em>" - as now known in PAP parlance.</p>
              <p>LKY had to deal with CSJ - as CSJ's political success will affect the plans for LHL to be given a smooth ride into the PM's chair, and to have an unchallenged term in office so as not to aggravate LHL's cancer that was in remission.</p>
              <p>Is it any surprise that the full weight of the government was brought to bear by LKY - with the print and broadcast machinery, the judiciary, grassroots organisation - to tarnish the image of CSJ and prevent him from becoming a popular political figure ?</p>
              <p>CSJ is the only politician now left to fight the political battles not according to the unequal terms and conditions set by LKY and the PAP, and is doing his best to reset the political terrain - as in the same manner that so many other political figures in other countries have fought for their political freedom from oppressive rulers.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, while CSJ may have been disqualified from the electoral process by the schemes that were designed to "<em>fix</em>" him - he remain useful as a political activist in the political scene in Singapore.</p>
              <p>While he may not be involved as a relevant participant in the political process, he will be in a better position to support other candidates recruited by the SDP, as well as to aid the other Political Parties in speaking on issues that has the OB markers that block any open discussions to protect the PAP's image.</p>
              <p>The SPP under Chiam See Tong will flounder without Chiam grooming any clear nor capable successor - let alone to have credible political associates within his SPP.</p>
              <p>The WP has yet to make any further impact while barely retaining its Parliamentary seat for the Hougang Constituency, and have yet to make their views known in solving the PAP policy errors - nor making clear their ambitions as a government in waiting.</p>
              <p>The Reform Party under Kenneth Jeyaretnam - with his triple stars in economics - has the best potential to best the WP in providing Singaporeans with solutions to the PAP policy errors. He will need to quickly put his views known to Singaporeans, and begin to garner political points for his political party.</p>
              <p>However, if all these Alternative Political Parties intend to battle the PAP based on the terms and ground rules set by the LKY, they will have to find a key to break open the "political rubik cube" that LKY had designed in favor of his PAP.</p>
              <p>There remains the middle ground for all the political parties to work together to find the key to break open and reset LKY's political rubik cube. They will need the support from Singaporeans who have the interests to regain control of our future and that of the successive generations..</p>
              <p>The PAP is not infallible, and do not necessarily have all the solutions to the problems that are continuously added even as old problems are growing larger - as there is no incentive for the PAP to change the status quo.</p>
              <p>This was seen in LHL's comments to the recommendation and reports from his Economic Review Committees set up after the 1987, 1997 and 2002 downturns - when he stated that even as he said that he "<em>will leave no stone unturn, it is better to have turnover those stones, taken a look at it, and place the stones to their original positions as it is best to keep them that way</em>". </p>
              <p>Singaporeans will have to support the Alternative Political Parties in one form or another, so as to recover the politcal space that LKY had taken away from us so as to allow his PAP to dominate over everyone of us.</p>

              <p>Yes. Support the alternative butt sitting cluleless opposition parties IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER - get yourself placed in jail for rioting, sued for defamation, charged in court and get your future destroyed, worse still end up in body bags. And for what?</p>
              <p>For the asshole who sits on his butt, writing books filled with irrational drivel, expecting the commoners to go against our rule of law society, sacrifice their lives so that he can be king, get his hands on our treasury funds, enrich himself and his family/cronies, people whom he will and can only trust when he won?</p>
              <p>I personally have more respect for Workers Party, the SPP and yet to know the RP better, for at least they took the trouble to work within our society's laws, going out to meet the people and solving their daily issues, being and doing what a political party that seeks to change minds and hearts should do.</p>
              <p>But what had Dr Chee done? Outlawlery, inciting naive others to perform civil obedience, selling his bare arse on youtube appealing to President Obama for help! Is our society persecuting him in any way rather than his anti republican and democratic antics shamed and posed dangers not only to ourselves, but to his naive followers as well?</p>
              <p>Dr Chee has still alot to learn, just like A Turd here. Either that or he already knew he had lost, so his last gamble to become a ruler is by undemocratic means - by force and upturning every law of the land we cherish and agreed to abide upon, by becoming above the law, an outlaw, spewing hate, disillusionment, twisting words, rumours, lies with half truths, etc.</p>
              <p>Sadly, activities such as his and A Turd here only reveal their true agenda, and because of them, they destroy whatever hope for serious genuine opposition political parties to grow, with the disappointed young instead turning to the ruling party to seek for change within a more stable and evolving political plateform.</p>
              <p>I, an insignificant nobody, speaks without prejudice but only true facts as perceived and revealed, nor am I from any political party. I speak only as my birthright as a citizen of my homeland, the land of our forefathers who sacrificed much for us so that we may live all in peace and prosperity, and face any crisis together and not be divided as they once were.</p>

              <p>Yes. Support the alternative butt sitting cluleless opposition
              parties IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER - get yourself placed in jail for
              rioting, sued for defamation, charged in court and get your future
              destroyed, worse still end up in body bags. And for what?</p>
              <p>For the asshole who sits on his butt, writing books filled with
              irrational drivel, expecting the commoners to go against
              our rule of law society, sacrifice their lives so that he can
              be king, get his hands on our treasury funds, enrich himself and
              his family/cronies, people whom he will and can only trust
              when he won?</p>
              <p>I personally have more respect for Workers Party, the SPP and
              yet to know the RP better, for at least they took the trouble to
              work within our society's laws, going out to meet the people and
              solving their daily issues, being and doing what a political party
              that seeks to change minds and hearts should do.</p>
              <p>But what had Dr Chee done? Outlawlery, inciting naive others to
              perform civil obedience, selling his bare arse on youtube appealing
              to President Obama for help! Is our society persecuting him in any
              way rather than his anti republican and democratic antics shamed
              and posed dangers not only to ourselves, but to his naive followers
              as well?</p>
              <p>Dr Chee has still alot to learn, just like A Turd here. Either
              that or he already knew he had lost, so his last gamble to become a
              ruler is by undemocratic means - by force and upturning every law
              of the land we cherish and agreed to abide upon, by becoming above
              the law, an outlaw, spewing hate, disillusionment, twisting words,
              rumours, lies with half truths, etc.</p>
              <p>Sadly, activities such as his and A Turd here only reveal their
              true agenda, and because of them, they destroy whatever hope for
              serious genuine opposition political parties to grow, with the
              disappointed young instead turning to the ruling party to seek for
              change within a more stable and evolving political plateform.</p>
              <p>I, an insignificant nobody, speaks without prejudice but only
              true facts as perceived and revealed, nor am I from any political
              party. I speak only as my birthright as a citizen of my
              homeland, the land of our forefathers who sacrificed much for us so
              that we may live all in peace and prosperity, and face any
              crisis together and not be divided as they once were.</p>
