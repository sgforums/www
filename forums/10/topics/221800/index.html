            <div class='col-md body'>"..Singapore is undergoing significant structural adjustment, against a background of accelerated globalization and increased competition from other regional economies. In response to these challenges, the Government has undertaken a range of structural reforms to diversify the economy and to enhance its competitiveness. Indeed, prospects over the medium term largely depend on the effectiveness of these changes.<br><br>Singapore has been moving up the manufacturing value chain into selected knowledge-intensive activities, such as pharmaceuticals. Some traditional manufacturing industries are relocating elsewhere, but others are staying, and upgrading their products. Niche industries such as water technology and interactive media are developing. With its efforts to make wages and other business costs more flexible, Singapore is continuing to attract multinational companies and foreign direct investment. On the assumption of a healthy level of global growth over the medium term and continued efforts to push forward with domestic structural reforms, the growth rate is put at 4.5Â–5.0% in 2008Â–2010, broadly in line with potential.<br><br>Domestic risks to watch for include growing income inequalities and persistent skills mismatches, which could retard the momentum of structural reform. Nevertheless, given the strong external and fiscal positions, and gradual diversification of growth sources, the economy may well be better placed to face such risks than in the past."<br><br>http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/ADO/2006/sin.asp<br></div>
