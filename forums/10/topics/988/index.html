The reason why they behave like this is 2-prong, as it usually is when we have a dispute with them:<br><br>1) There is increasing social problems over there. Indons running riot, a restless Muslim/Malay populace, a stuttering economy have contributed to a constantly weakening government hold on power. Mahathirs speech at the WEF yesterday(Sun 03/02) points to that. In this situation they need to create a distraction so the prople will not notice or concentrate on the incompetence of those in charge, and as history has shown, the best way to do this is through a bogeyman: preferably foreign. We play that role to the hilt; we're better off, we're of a different race by majority, and we have a minority thats of the same race/religion as their majority. We're, in a nutshell, the perfect bogeyman.<br><br>2) They've never really accepted the fact that not only are we more successful, what really really yanks their chain is that our Malay countrymen, despite not having an unfair advantage like theirs and play on a level playing field, are still arguably more successful than theirs. Thats why they have always jumped on an opportunity to paint Malay Singaporeans as an oppressed, unfairly treated minority. Just look at the tudung issue, I've seen sharks react more slowly to blood in the water than the Malaysian politicians have to this issue.<br><br>What it all boils down to is that this is all bluster. As for the H2O issue, deep down, they're getting desparate because they know that our dependence on Malaysia on this issue is almost over. Once our desalination plants are ready, gone will be any chance to gain political and economic mileage(read: $$$) from us, so they're now trying to gain as much as they can.<br><br>Its nothing we have not seen before, and nothing we won't see again. As the Chinese say, just treat them like the barking mad dogs they are.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Viper52 (edited 04 February 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that we must not be too obsessed with technology. Technology is a force multiplier and enabler, but it is NOT the force.(Jeez, I'm starting to sound like a Star Wars fan) As John Boyd states, "People, Ideas, and Technology, in that order!" It would be a terrible mistake to think that having technology on our side would definitely win wars. Its the same fallacy as "High IQ means you will earn a lot of money", which is definitely not always true, yes? What's more improtant is that we have capable people in command, with good ideas. In this sense, though, I'm not too worried, cause I believe that we do have pretty capable people up there.</div>
