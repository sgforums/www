The trend is moving this way now......<br>They, the govt or the elites have no more moral or integrity in serving the nation since after mid eighties.<br><br>Every now and then, they are all talking about $$$, businesses, salary increment, world class here and there, casinos, fares hike here and there, CEO have to be answerable to its shareholders and blah, blah, blah....<br><br>They are drawing tonnes of salaries, dividends, perks, bonuses and etc, sometimes I wonder if the amount of money would be enough not not enough, or are they going to bring along with them to another world.<br><br>Human greed!!!
