Little coverage was given to that issue by the state-controlled media, but coverage elsewhere was certainly far more extensive.<br><br>For a start, the Philippines(prior to Seow's detention) had already offered him asylum(when things first started to go wrong) if he wanted and had mooted a plan to boycott tourism to Singapore. In addition, Seow stood for the '88 elections as an opposition candidate partly because he had the support of the US ambassador to Singapore at that point in time and needless to say, asylum in the US was never an issue should he ever take up that option(which proved the case eventually as he's officially - by the fascist media anyway - considered to be on self-imposed exile for some bogus tax evasion charges. In light of that, can LKY, the tough-talking but gutless fascist masked in the facade of a democrat, really afford to pursue a course of action that would incur the wrath of catalysts pivotal to Singapore's economy?<br><br>In that context, Francis Seow is certainly a far more reputable figure and has a much-higher profile than CSJ which this regime didn't dare mess with that lightly.<br><br>Tough-talking as the fascists may be, LKY certainly hasn't got the balls - even if he had the ambition - of Hitler.</div></blockquote>singapore's intelligence services certainly dont have the expertise and connections to carry out such an assasination operation even if it wanted to, unlike the KGB.  and this little nation of ours certainly tries to seem and punch above its actual weight on the international arena.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
