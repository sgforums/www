LKY could have done the same with Francis Seow if he really wanted.</div></blockquote>Have you any idea how the outside world responded to Francis Seow's detention in 1988? Little coverage was given to that issue by the state-controlled media, but coverage elsewhere was certainly far more extensive.<br><br>For a start, the Philippines(prior to Seow's detention) had already offered him asylum(when things first started to go wrong) if he wanted and had mooted a plan to boycott tourism to Singapore. In addition, Seow stood for the '88 elections as an opposition candidate partly because he had the support of the US ambassador to Singapore at that point in time and needless to say, asylum in the US was never an issue should he ever take up that option(which proved the case eventually as he's officially - by the fascist media anyway - considered to be on self-imposed exile for some bogus tax evasion charges. In light of that, can LKY, the tough-talking but gutless fascist masked in the facade of a democrat, really afford to pursue a course of action that would incur the wrath of catalysts pivotal to Singapore's economy?<br><br>In that context, Francis Seow is certainly a far more reputable figure and has a much-higher profile than CSJ which this regime didn't dare mess with that lightly.<br><br>Tough-talking as the fascists may be, LKY certainly hasn't got the balls - even if he had the ambition - of Hitler.</div>

Don't claim that it is rumour without proof. If only one person was drugged it can be dismissed. Unfortunely for the PAP this is not the case. The late president Mr. Nair too testified that he was drugged by GOVERNMENT DOCTORS. Mr. LKY sued him in an overseas court and was NOT SUCCESSFUL.<br><br>Taken from wikipedia:<br><br>On March 28, 1985, Nair resigned in unclear circumstances. Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew stated in parliament that Nair resigned to get treatment for alcoholism, a charge Nair hotly denied. According to Nair's counterclaim, he resigned under pressure when their political views came into conflict and Lee threatened to seek a motion in parliament to oust him as president. Nair also alleged that he was fed drugs to make him appear disoriented, and rumours were spread about his personal life in an attempt to discredit him. In 1999, an article about the case in the Canadian newspaper Globe and Mail resulted in a libel suit by Lee. [1] The suit was thrown out of court after Nair's counterclaim. [2] </div></blockquote>Think about it : if he didn't politicise the Judiciary in Singapore, how do you think LKY wins every libel suit he's involved in?  To think LKY was stupid enough to think he could repeat his repertoire of tricks elsewhere on the planet... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  You don't need a genius to figure out anyone could break the world record in the 100m sprint if he were allowed to start at the 99m mark(with all his challengers starting at 99m behind), do you?</div>
