This was because every time he ate what was served to him, he would feel nauseous and dizzy and then throw up. Normal sounds such as the jangling of the guard's keys and even the sound of his cell mate urinating are amplified causing him massive headaches. He has not been able to sleep and has been taking valium to help him rest. Dr Chee has also lost a considerable amount of weight.</blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>First, Dr Chee testified that he might have been drugged to visitors.</strong></span><br><br><blockquote>We are particularly disturbed to hear of the sudden deterioration in his medical condition.

HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL U 'DRUGGED' IS ONLY A SUSPICION?  Just because there is no update on SDP website, does it means nothing has been done?? IF PAP update their website by the minute, you would conclude they are 'working' hard??<br><br>2. HOW do you think SDP can HELP CHEE when they cannot even ascertain if Chee is being DRUGGED??  Family is not even allowed to visit him!<br><br>3.  What about 'Wheres my form'? What has that to do with this case? ANYWAY, you think there was FAIR coverage about James' case on our wonderful media?  Any IDIOT can see our MEDIA was busying PAINTING JAMES AS A CONMAN!<br><br>4. IF this is true, ALL MEDIA except our own will be interested in this story!  There is almost TOTAL media BLACKOUT on 'small' cases like ppl jumping MRT tracks!  Where have you been all these years??<br><br>5. Its a shame to have such BLIND PAP SUPPORTER in SINGAPORE!<br><br>6. Pro 'people' my foot!  More like u Pro your so call 'People's Action Party' aka PAP!  SDP change their policies?? Change to what?? Change to Pro PAP then you vote for them?? What crap!<br><br>And till today, you still think Chee set himself up with the ULTIMATE objective of going to JAIL??<br><br>I think you should stop embarrassing yourself here.. better stick to advertising ST products in 'Military nuts'!</div>
