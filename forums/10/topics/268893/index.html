Many office buildings, shopping malls and other public places employ security guards these days, and in an emergency or terrorist threat, I'd rather have security guards who have been properly trained to deal with them, instead of those who do not know what to do.<br><br>However, the shortage of accredited security guards is a real problem, and perhaps the government should address this by establishing more centrally-run courses to which security firms can send their employees for accreditation.</div>
