            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore leaders have claimed Singaore initial economic success as attributable to their supposedly extraordinary leadership and talents. To a certain extent up to 1970s, before our leaders obsessed with their talents and leadership, and therefore their own rewards, they have played a part in Singapore initial success.<br><br>That success was largely built on a system of taxing the citizens to the fullest through ingenious market fees and charges, direct and indirect taxes through asset corporation, privatization schemes allowing the state to save and stinge on provisions of serviees building up only the state surpluses.<br><br>Average household pay between S$500,000 -$800,000 in the form of transportation and housing toll to the state to build state surplus of S$150 billions which the leaders claimed as their success.<br><br>Such top-down leadership system is essentially self-centred and egoistic, anti-teamwork and anti-people benefiting only the leaders and their cohorts of elites. After 1970s, the top-down leaders have lost directions with the economy without any more talent with broad-based education or entrepreneurship or fire in the belly in upgrading the economy.<br><br>The whole economy was held to ransom by foreigners who obtained all kinds of concessions at the expense of nurturing local entrepreneueship and business vibrancy. That is the main reason why Singapore business conditions are now extremely bad and property market remains slumped as against other regional centres since the last two recessions.<br><br>Whereas other Asian tigers continue to prosper due to technological applications and broad-based people-driven vibrancy and entrepreneurship, Singapore economy is still boasting of old-fashion fossilised leadership of a few older leaders. Singapore has been at a cross-road for some years now neither here nor there and unable to upgrade or compete. The local SMEs are at wit's ends and unable to survive due to high costs. The government-favored foreign MNCs are shifting out to other lower-cost centres, China and India.<br><br>After such autocratic governance for so many years, it has now fossilised into a rigid counter-productive system which turn off people but the leaders are as to be expected would find it very difficult to admit their mistakes or shortsightedness or acknowledge any other recipes of success.<br><br>Hong Kong has been people-driven with a distinct fizz or x-factor due to their peculiar historical circumstance on personal freedoms and entrepreneurship.<br><br>Would our leaders ever acknowledge such people factor of success ? Hong Kong has transformed without top-down nannying or government leaders' controls and policies interfering with their lives unlike Singapore where political participants are totally flushed out under all kinds of gerrymandering and electoral manipulations. Even elected president is powerless to do anything to correct top-down autocratic power-play to suit such pompous and self-serving top-down leadership system.<br><br>It is too late for Singaporeans now to change as the whole system is too deeply counter-participative and anti-motivation.<br><br>How to be like Hong Kong people to make changes to their wrongful policies in order to build a more creative and entrepreneurial society? It cannot be done as the leaders are too proud to admit people factors as key factor of success as demonstrated in transformation of Hong Kong service standard.<br><br>Our educated youngers citizens should communicate with one another on thier political rights to do something and to see other factors of success as seen in Korea, Japan and Hong Kong.</div>

I said it before that displaying pride for nation within singapore is for show to the political party only.
