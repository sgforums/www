            <div class='col-md body'>It's interesting to note the dramatic change in govt's emphasis towards service orientated sectors in the past months.<br><br>With the integrated resorts (a glorified name for 'casinos') roadmap firmly in place, the challenge will be to compete with regional giants like macau and hong kong. Count Genting highlands too if you consider the publicity and crowds.<br><br>Back in 1999, service sectors were pretty much in the doldrums. I recall that in the same year, NTU closed down its hospitality and hotel management course for business students due to an obvious lack of interest. That was one of my primary courses so it is a pity that i missed out on it. NUS had no equivalent course and SMU wasn't ard yet. Shatec was the only viable solution at that time, offering an expensive diploma.<br><br>With the planned intent to fill the job vacancies with Singaporeans as much as possible, the govt is likely planning a crash course on service orientation. One wonders if this was a spur of the moment decision, with the monumental task coupled by a do-or-die mentality. It ultimately suggests a panic within the govt that in the next few years, the tourism industry in SG may depend on the success of our IRs and not on our tourist attractions, which aren't much by the way.<br><br>The recent mass renovations and remodelling of Sentosa adds weight to this argument, along with the superfluous 'renaming' exercise of Marina Bay and its total makeover image in past months.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nope.<br><br>Not with the push by the govt.  The fact of the matter (IMHO) is that this exercise does not translate to $$$ for the practitioners... ie the one providing the service.<br><br>In Hong Kong, they noe tat it is survival ornot if they cannot competite on price.  So they automatic upped their service level to match.<br><br>Another eg, there is a optical shop in Bras Brasah Complex name Kwong Shih... if u happen to pass by it, it is always crowded, as compare to the shop next door.  Y?  They provide excellent service, one that will ensure that the customer keep coming back (thus they are rewarded).  Even the staff turnover is low...<br><br>Conclusion: The govt miss the point .... where is the incentive?<br></div>
