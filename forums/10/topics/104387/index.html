They believe in self-contradictory ideals when it comes to women and has no intention of working hard for their family.

There have been too many debates about this already.<br><br>Maybe 10% of the men are like that.<br>Maybe more.<br><br>But why do we whine?<br><br>Is it because... you girls keep trying to tell us to succeed, succeed, succeed? Why? So we can buy better diamonds for you?<br><br>One thing a gf/wife/girl should never do to a man, is to nag excessively.<br><br>In "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus", it is stated that Men takes some time to do things.<br><br>Lets quote an example from the book.<br><br>"Honey, will you take out the trash?"<br>"Yea, later, let me finish this soccer match first"<br>"But it needs to be done now, its clogging up space in the kitchen"<br>"I said i will do it, just later. Give it a while"<br>"Â“HONEY! I HAD IT WITH YOU! TAKE THAT THRASH OUT NOW!Â”<br><br>Guess what happens?<br><br>A disagreement that could have been avoided, simply if you females know that as men, we WILL do it, just give us some time to do/think about it.<br><br>Its in our nature, it can't be helped.<br><br></div>

If you notice, those men who take wives from Kalimantan and Vietnam belong to the lower socio-economic group.  Men who are more educated, would usually prefer to marry local girls.  If given a choice, who would want to have a wife whom you can't communicate in the same language and share the same culture?<br><br>You said that you want the local men to show you that 'you are truly a man' but can you take it?  This means that there is not going to be equality.  This guy will most likely be a chauvinistic pig.  You can't expect to get a SNAG if want an alpha male to take charge and have backbone.<br><br>Think about what I say and may be you should reflect on your own expectations of men.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some Singapore females are simply arrogant, esp. those with high education levels. They always think that Singaporean male are good for nothing while thinking that they are 100% perfect.<br><br>I want to ask those woman -- Do you want to do NS, at least in a non-combat vocation, or what has you done for the defence in Singapore?<br><br>One more thing -- Why some Singaporean men want to go overseas to find wife? It's because Singaporean women are so choosy that they likes Ang Moh very much! Since they can choose overseas husband why can't we Singaporean men choose oversea wifes?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Categorizing all SG men as spineless and whiners over the simple "mail order bride" issue is really like saying all Muslims are bad people after you watched the video of kidnappers sawing away hostage heads in Iraq.<br><br>If SG men are all a bunch of spineless jellyfish, then I wonder why majority of PAP leaders are men (since founding days), and we "WOW" at the possibility of more women leaders. Women make great leaders too, I've worked with some great ones and of course some who really should stay at home to be a domestic engineer.<br><br>SG women aren't all materialistic people too. I would boil down the men/women problem to mostly the fact that in our generation, both parents work, and we hardly have time to know how to love. We prefer to concentrate on careers, and by 30 yrs old, we stop to think about family options. By then, you take home $4k - $6k, who wanna marry a blue collar partner?<br><br>Then after marrying, accuse each other of being not romantic, when the problem really is that you don't have your own group of friends... etc etc. Sometimes I think these mail order bridge people are sensible. At least they are doing something about their lives.<br><br>They are happy.<br><br>How about you?</div>
