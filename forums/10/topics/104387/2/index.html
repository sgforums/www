            <div class='col-md body'>Lee Kuan Yew has stated before that his second biggest regret after the seperation from Malaysia was giving education and equal oppurtunities to Singapore women.<br><br>Why? Because when women are kept relegated to their traditional roles of child bearing and looking after the home, the birth rate in the country is higher. Look at the developing countries, where women's rights have made less headway. Population explosion!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>In developed countries like Singapore, since women are more demanding i.e. in career and families, and have higher expectations from their marraiges. This leads to low birth rate as women (and men to a lesser extent) put themselves before their children.<br><br>Low birth rate will eventually lead to Singapore's demise as we run out of workers to replace the retiring ones. More retirees means more strain on taxpayers (although its not so bad in SG with CPF) You can see this already happening in Germany and Japan.<br><br>So... if Singapore goes to hell, ITS ALL THE FAULT OF YOU SELFISH THIRTY SOMETHING YEAR OLD CAREER WOMEN!!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> YOU CHAO  BITCHES!!!!<br><br>WE MEN DO OUR BLOODY TWO YEARS OF NATIONAL SERVICE TO OUR BLOODY COUNTRY AND YOU DO SHIT!!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Justic Legal. this is my very first post and i am pleased to say it has been dedicated to you. i have been following ur trail since the thread u created about teachers not being up to mark. you have provided great entertainment, indeed.<br><br>Now, getting back to the topic. you say that guys in singapore are losers who whine all the time. isn't that what you are doing, whining? Well, in my opinion, u may not be entirely wrong. Some are like that. the keyword is some. you have failed to weigh the facts before putting down that immature sweeping statement.<br><br>personally i wouldnt dismiss singaporean girls as being materialistic or sluts. most are nice, virtuos women. infact u girls are a nice mix of east and west.. a fine breed i would say. but its the rare few rotten apples that really paint a bad image of them. you are a fine example.<br><br>now first of all as all of us know u are a self proclaimed teacher who is, inferred from own post, better than the redundant school teachers. i dont see any traits of a good teacher in you. in fact you have failed miserably in not being able to look at both sides of the situation.didnt GP teach you that skill? are u actually qualified? or are u just another bogus?<br><br>do not insult the brides from vietnam too. you pale in comparison to them. what have you to offer? show me you wares. from what i see, u do not qualify to even ask for a guy who fits the bill u described. u should choose from where u stand. in fact i am happy the angmohs are snatching up our girls. they're probably getting the senseless, childish ones like you while the good ones are left to us.<br><br>guys i think we should let this young lady do some soul searching. maybe she shall be more mature after 10 years of growing up. do u have anything to say, lady? i challenge you to pick up the gauntlet.<br><br>Cheers,<br>stonko</div>

There is an article about rudenss and lack of basic countesy in Singaporean Women.  Sad to say.. some men are unfortunate to keep bumping into these group of women. And please don't stereo type, since you may be the unfortunate women whom keep bumping into those men whom you've stated.  There is million plus number of men in Singapore.  How many do you know?<br><br>Regardless, men naturally doesn't understand women.. and women naturally perceived that they actually understand and know men.  This is why.. women can be naggy.</div>

Many strong words, sweeping statements.<br><br>I've always had great respect for the local girls and most of my female friends have great respect for the local guys (excluding those who think that they'll marry members of F4 or 5566).<br><br>Anyway, the point is, let's not spew out nasty thoughts and cast every male or female (depends which side of the fence u're sitting on) into the fires of hell. Take time to understand what goes on and I think that'll make us better ppl.<br><br>Cheers!</div>
