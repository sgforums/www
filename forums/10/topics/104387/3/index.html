As a gesture, I really would like to say that having money and wealth doesnt necessary bring you happiness. You come to this world with nothing and you will leave this world with nothing, the only thing that will live with you forever is the love from your family.<br><br>When you say that man is expected to always upgrade and work harder, you are indirectly telling me that girls like you are weak, selfish, idealistic and unreliable, or in short fine weather companion.<br><br>Having dated many sg girls, what I can say is that knowing what you want is nothing but pure dreams and fantasy (aka the hollywood fantasy), it is getting what you want that is more important.<br><br>As for the Kalimantan and vietnamese girls, what I can say is that they will be more capable to bring up their children than girls like you. And their husband will be much happier because they dont a slave driver like you breathing down their neck.<br><br>Having said all these, I can only say that I pity your partner for having someone like you. And trust me, the only creature that will always be faithful to you is your dog, so you should consider being a BI T CH.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by JusticeLegal:</div><div class="quote_body">I will choose to interpret this as Singaporean women knowing what we want and Singaporean men being incapable of giving it and instead of trying to achieve it choose to whine and sulk and behave like spoilt children. I am not an SPG and I am happily in a relationship with a wonderful guy who has ambition and who is faithful. As a kind gesture, I really do suggest that some of you spend more time upgrading yourselves and work harder. No women will want you and I pity those Kalimantan and Vietnamese girls that you "buy" with your money and abuse them to prove your manliness. Shame on you all cowards <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div></blockquote>You certainly have paint yourself into a prefect woman.  No credits for you, however, since you are stereo typing again.<br><br>Yes.. from your intepretation, you have display yourself as a rather die than to get have alternative.  Just like the spoilt kid you mentioned.<br>Just curious, have you interview the millions of men in Singapore to draft out a statistic study? Do you think men doesn't know what they want?<br><br>By the way, how many Vietnamese girls do you actually know?  I used to visit my company's factories there and it is not like what you perceived. Vietnamese girls are actually very loving women whom will stand by her man and be contented with what was given to them. Still, not all Vietnamese girls are like that.  And not all men are like what you claim either.<br><br>In addition, care to comment about women who stray? All men's fault? What about those who abuses their hubby physically and mentally?  Any comments?  When things goes wrong physically, ie. fighting, men can't retialiant as one punch may knock the hell out of women.  So this is a kind of weakness?  MEN can't complain issit? There are tons of story about men being abuse by their wifes.  Go do your own research.<br><br>As for the society problem, some men had been working so hard all their life and you think that's fair to comment about them WITHOUT knowing their stories? Men spent 2 years plus in the Army doing what?  Sing song, fly kite, play manjong?  Men has to spent 2 years plus in army for just in case they have to protect women like yourself.  Some man work so hard to establish their career and they do not have the time to count women.  So it's wrong to mail order a bride?  What if their marriage is filled with happiness? *Sigh*<br><br>As a kind gesture, I really do suggest that some of you spend more time upgrading yourselves and read more.  MOST importantly, don't stereotype please.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Woman used to complain that man are not expressing their feeling too much.  When man expresses their feeling, some woman labeled them as as something else.</div>

Please list them out and address them directly.  Do you know how many men here are CEO, directors and managers???  IF NOT.. please refrain yourself to continue posting your egoistic viewpoint.  You are a REAL DISGRACE you know, heng, my siblings, those I know and most SG girls are nothing like you.  Absolutely nothing like you.  Otherwise, some other richer foreign country will have the chance to mail order Singaporean girls as their bride because I am sure most men in Singapore doesn't want a girl who thinks like you.<br><br></div>
