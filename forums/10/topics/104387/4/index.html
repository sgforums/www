            <div class='col-md body'>n u noe wat?? those gals frm kalimantan n vietnamese... they have every single virtue an ideal wife would have. They're probably as smart as u, JusticeLegal, n they're better. They noe their status well, they love their families dearly, they're POLITICALLY CORRECT, they have brains good enough not to MAKE SWEEPING STATEMENT, or goin up to this forum n waste time on a thread which does nothin but flaunt how STUPID u are, how IGNORANT u are, how CHILDISH u are. (man u noe wat i feel guilty, i feel like i'm insulting those words in capital letters to put them onto u...) They do their housework n they always do a good job, they can whip up a good meal for the family? wat can u do? whine on a forum like a kid who can't reach for her baloon? if singaporean men are whiny, i dunno wat to call u, seriously.<br>Hey, wake up stupid kiddo. No one owes u anythin in this world. U may have ur expectations (which are as ridiculous as u are), but who are u to make us give u wat u want? juz who the hell u think u are? not even LKY's daughter can do that. n who are u? a low life imbecile? sheesh... i think sum ppl really need a mirror to take a gd look at herself n look clearly, to know her place in this society. (That's if ur lvl of intelligence can give u the ability to reflect.) If u can't afford one, go beg for one. But then again, u dun expect use to give it to u readily. This world works in two ways: to give n to take. U wanna take wat u think should be given to u? have u ever asked urself, wat do u have to offer to others? Did u actually bother to give anyone anythin besides that bitching  of urs? now even the ladies are standing up against u... wat does it say abt urself... go dig a hole big enough to put urself into. (but then again i doubt u can actually do anythin besides whining n complaining, n again u dun expect anyone to do things for u. so i guess u should juz stand up n let ppl throw eggs n stones at u.) Shame on u!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> [/quote]</div>

Many of them are spineless and are whiners. They believe in self-contradictory ideals when it comes to women and has no intention of working hard for their family. Worse of all, to satisfy their ego and perhaps overwhelming sex drive honed from many years of Geylang training, they get wives from Kalimantan and Vietnam...women whose language they have difficulities in understanding. It is no wonder Singaporean women are left with no choice today. We Singaporean women wish to see some back bone in you all... we do not care about what you earn or whatever... just show us that you truly are a man and not some whining screwdriver.
