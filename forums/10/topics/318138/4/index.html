              <p>It is sad to watch them being misled, comming from different walks of life with a few of them grads. I dont know if it is because of IQ. Singapore has a high literacy rate of 97% just on O levels alone annually, which is more than enough to figure the 3 'r's, before many of them move on to specialized education either in acamadia or technical instructions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One don't need high IQ to understand basic needs such as food, shelter and jobs. Don't those on the opposition side ever just simply ask -</p>
              <p>'Can the opposition offer me such or do a better job than the current administrators?</p>
              <p>And what are the guarantees that they can perform?'</p>
              <p>All these years since Independence, you may be shocked, but there was no word on such issues from the opposition.</p>
              <p>All they want is to sit on that PM chair, and like qiqq9, for us to obey or be condemned, wouldn't it be worse off than present administration? And people follow these guys? </p>

              <p>That's not entirely the point of the opposition.  It's pretty clear that the opposition here doesn't have an iota of a chance of ruling any time in the foreseeable future.  But they don't have to be in a ruling position to add value to parliament.</p>
              <p>The value of opposition comes from putting forward an alternative viewpoint, and challenging the ruling party to justify its position.  Such challenge and debate can add huge value to the political scene.</p>
              <p>Take the Greens party in Australia.  They're never going to lead, and don't have the ability to administer the country anyway.  Does that render the party pointless?  No.  Their reason for being is to bring up for debate issues pertaining to the environment and to prevent the government of the day from glossing over such issues.</p>

              <p> Thank you for your thoughtful post. I agree with your point that the opposition party don't have to be in a ruling position and the reason for (their ) being is to bring up issues for debate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Which is why in Spore, opposition political parties are not banned. Since independence they had been allowed to garner votes within a level political field - whatever the rules, every party including the ruling one, must follow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Theoratically, there should not be any dominance by one single party. The number of voters and political parties make it impossible, but then, in Singapore, the impossible became possible - not of any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the ruling party, but simply because our opposition parties failed to convince the People of their capabilities ( or the sore lack of it ), worse still, engage in smearing reputations of our Executive Officers and Offices of State.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These officers will definately have to respond, for the reputation of the People is at stake. The PM is the representative of the People. To impunge his reputation is to cast slurs onto the People and those who put him in power. To not challenge such allegations would mean such slurs or allegations are true.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, while it may be true to have opposition figures in parliament for check and balances, but from a voter's point of view -</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a ) shouldn't the one he votes belong to a party that can best administer the nation?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>b.) If not, would it be fair for him to be the one to put in an 'alternative' source, when such votes are secret and the mandate to rule is only known when the results are fully counted, fixed for 5 years term?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Thus, the fault for the present lacklustre in local politics lay in the moribund opposition parties, who after so many years, had yet to offer anything credible to solve the problems of the People, except to whine and blame others than themselves.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is this another incredible ''blank_point'' that you are capable of making - when you cannot give any credible response ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This seems to be the typically standard reply of your types when confronted with the impossible list of issues, and the best defensive argument your type can throw up in another dismissive ploy that everyone prefer to ''whine and cry'' instead of taking positive actions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Despite your shallow display in courtesy, your replies have shown lack of sincerity to engage in sensible debate, when you indulge in empty rhetoric that resemble that is no better than senseless imitation of the MIW propaganda.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You must surely be the reason for the MIW Leadership complaining the lack of talent, as there do not seem to be any ability in independent or original thinking.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">My reply to Point_blank's postings have been deliberately cut up to address every issue that he had written, and is courtesy shown for his efforts made, and if you cannot handle such precise addressing of separate issues, what else can you be capable of handling ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Could this be the reason for Point_blank responding constantly and not according to your wrong interpretation, and for other forumers to join in this thread as evidence by the increasing number of hits - that even attracted your attention ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">At least try not to shoot yourself if you do not even know how to shoot the gun at others - it clearly shows yourself to be an amateur, if not an imitator.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Level political field in Singapore since independence ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Which year was there ever a level playing field <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">after</span></strong> Singapore became independent ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The only time when the political field was level was when Singapore was under the UK Colonial Government, and when Singapore was under the Federal Government of Malaysia.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Since Singapore became independent - after being kicked out of Malaysia - on 9 August 1965, LKY made sure that his MIW Party is the only party holding political power, having locked up all his most threatening colleagues - who walked out of his MIW Party to form the Barisan Sosialist in 1962, and bankrupted all who are left from 1965.</span></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you not being a fraud and dishonest with your statement, or are you simply in self-denial in making such statements in an open forum - inviting strong responses from other who know better ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The political field was not level to start with, and anyone who dare join or support the Alternative Parties are subject to constant ridicule and harrassment from the various State Agencies - which have become tools of the Ruling Political Party to prevent the growth of any Alternative Party that can be stronger to threaten the MIW.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It has always been clear that the Alternative Parties have been deprived of equal avenues of publicity to reach out to Singaporeans, when the MIW use its Governmental positions to ensure that all prints and broadcast medias are not available to the Alternative Parties; while the same are made use of by the MIW to discredit the image of the Alternative Parties in the minds of Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It seems that more often than not, it is the MIW Team that start the politics in assassinating the character and reputation of those in the Alternative Parties whom they feel most threatened. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This was seen first in the 1960s, when Chia Thye Poh was accused to be a Communist and locked up for 32 years on the flimsiest accusation that he had advocated armed revolution. Yet his cry for an open trial for evidence to be produced went unheard, while he was regularly tempted to freedom in exchange for his confession.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The late Dr Lee Siew Choh was made to be a buffoon in the many clashes during the 1960s to 70s, when he was the most vocal voice in opposing Singapore's entry into Malaysia - and he was proven right in less then 2 years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chiam See Tong was ridiculed by LKY - in an Election Rally - for daring to enter politics with his poor O-Level results that allowed him only to get a Law Degree through long distance correspondence course. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">J.B. Jeyaratnam was lampooned, insulted and derided by LKY to be a political charlatan - a dishonest, fraud - despite Jeyaratnam's solid reputation as a Singapore High Court Judge. Despite LKY's insults and personal vendetta - JBJ persevered against all the ''broken glass and nails'' that LKY showered in the political path that JBJ took. Unbelieveably, PM LHL conceded that JBJ is a loyal Singaporean - almost 30 years late.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">CSJ was similarly maligned from the start, as he was the first tertiary educated person, working as a NUS Lecturer, who dared to decline an invitation to join the MIW Team. Almost the entire State controlled machinery was rolled out to flatten CSJ after his first Election debut - before he became a bigger threat. All who dared to support him were ear marked for persecution, and it depleted the number of educated supporters - especially those from the tertiary educational institutions - leaving CSJ short of research teams that undermined his confrontation with the Government.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You can always have your dishonest personal wet dreams of your imagined level playing field, and your imagined political nightmares of Opposition Personalities raping your sweet dreams, but be prepared for any robust wake-up sound when you take your wet dreams into public forum.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>These officers will definately have to respond, for the reputation of the People is at stake. The PM is the representative of the People. To impunge his reputation is to cast slurs onto the People and those who put him in power. To not challenge such allegations would mean such slurs or allegations are true.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You should be clearer and more accurate in deciding whose reputation is at stake.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">First, you claim that the Oppositon Members raped the reputation of the Public Officers - now you claim that the reputation of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the People</span></strong> is at stake.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The logic in your reasoning seems convulted, and smack of dishonest effort in brainwashing your false information into young and unprepared minds.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Secondly, while it may be true to have opposition figures in parliament for check and balances, but from a voter's point of view -</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can you give any reason for your false position ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How can the People have an honest selection, when the full potential of other Singaporean Talents are purposefully made unavailable except only for those that bend to the principles of the POWER of ONE ? </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>b.) If not, would it be fair for him to be the one to put in an 'alternative' source, when such votes are secret and the mandate to rule is only known when the results are fully counted, fixed for 5 years term?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Again, your words are as convulted as your thinking ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How can there be a mandate, when the political field is not level ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How can there be a mandate when the politics is continuously subjected to manipulation by the incumbent Ruling Political Party ?</span></p>
              <blockquote>; Thus, the fault for the present lacklustre in local politics lay in the moribund opposition parties, who after so many years, had yet to offer anything credible to solve the problems of the People, except to whine and blame others than themselves. </blockquote>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Is it not typically childish to blame others so easily ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The reason for the moribund state of affairs in the Singapore Poltical Scene can be summed up by the actions of the Ruling Political Party, whose attitudes and actions against the other Political Parties are no better than those of Mugabe's style of politics in Zimbabwe.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is there any reason for the Members of Parliament from the Ruling Political Party to enjoy the full facility of having a proper political office constructed in the void deck of an HDB block, while the Members of Parliament from the Alternative Parties are only allowed to have half-height panel partition in an open HDB void-deck as their office ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is there any reasons for the Government to with-hold any development budget for the constituencies that voted for the Alternative Parties, when the citizens in these Constituencies also pay their Taxes annually ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is there any reasons from the Government not to allow the Members of Parliament from the Alternative Political Parties to be part of the Singapore Community and lead the community in their Constituency during observance during National Day ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is it not a fact that the MIW Team has divided Singapore when hypocritically encouraging Singaporeans to be ONE People, One Country, One Nation ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you believe that these are all repetitive, yes - and it bears repeating to counter the constant drumming of the false propaganda that is repeatedly made by dishonest people who prefer to make points that are blank.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> Dear Point_blank,</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Unfortunately, either you are unable to read what has been posted, or you do not know how to make relevant use of your precious time in providing accurate answers to the point.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is this the best reason for you to give ''blank'' answers to the different points that you have raised - which ironically is true to your preferred choice in your nick ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Excuses ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How did you so expertly read the presentation of factual events as excuses ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is this not the typical dismissive cop out reason of the MIW when pushed into an embarrassing corner that they cannot extricate themselves from ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Pathetically, you seem to take a preference in deluding yourself from reality, preferring to count the few that your short-sighted eyes can see, but refusing to see the bigger picture of real issues that are too overwhelming for your eyes to focus.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is this another incredible ''blank_point'' that you are capable of making - when you cannot give any credible response ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This seems to be the typically standard reply of your types when confronted with the impossible list of issues, and the best defensive argument your type can throw up in another dismissive ploy that everyone prefer to ''whine and cry'' instead of taking positive actions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Despite your shallow display in courtesy, your replies have shown lack of sincerity to engage in sensible debate, when you indulge in empty rhetoric that resemble that is no better than senseless imitation of the MIW propaganda.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You must surely be the reason for the MIW Leadership complaining the lack of talent, as there do not seem to be any ability in independent or original thinking.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even if you cannot offer a reasonable reply, at least do not lead yourself into a dead end, going into a 'Point that is blank''.</span></p>

              <p>Point_blank, as the nick suggests is blank, empty, he is full of emptiness, it is a shame that he in his stupidity and emptiness keeps challenging people.   His challenge fails, he points fingers, put words into people's mouths, he accuse, he destroys.</p>
              <p>I come to this thread not to contribute for I see no need to entertain this Point_blank with any constructive discussion.   Since he makes untrue comments and typical of him to always find fault, I come here to see his reactions.   Lackey Point_blank, go lick your PAP's ass.</p>

              <p>I am interpreting point blank in the context of your post, mainly blank points, devoid of substance, akin to firing blanks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I'd rather you engage me in your own words, "critical analysis".</p>
              <p>Are you able to point out the problems and solutions of a company merely by looking at the loss figure? If you can't, then don't expect opposition parties to do likewise for the P4P's government. Inflation at 7.5%, surely there are major errors in policies in the past few years.</p>
              <p>GDP at 6.7% while inflation at 7.5%, there is no real GDP growth, only inflationary growth.</p>
              <p>Like I said P4P has been running the government for eons now, they can't even figure out their mistake, yet you expect opposition members who has never even seen the company in vivo to come up with solutions for P4P's mistakes.</p>

              <p><br>The gist and fallacy of your post is that i 'expect opposition members who has never even seen the company in vivo to come up with solutions for P4P's mistakes.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Aren't you contridicting yourself? If the opposition members 'who has never even seen the company', how would know there are mistakes in the first place?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. If they deem what they 'allege' are mistakes, then what are their solutions? Even a 10 year old child can shout out alleged wrongs. But then being kids they may not be able to rectify. But the opposition parties are not 10yr olds...or are they?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So kiddo, I have heard all kinds of allegations the opposition parties make, but are they substantiated? Do they have any solid evidences to prove malpractices?</p>
              <p>You claim i shoot blanks. I say you shoot wildly. If the opposition parties continues to live in delusions and not start working on credible solutions to solve the daily issues of the comman person, then their demise and relevance to the People will end soon.</p>
              <p>I ask again: they have made many claims of wrong doings - now where are the evidences and solutions? Can you answer me, <a href="/users/193706">maurizio13</a>? You can back off now and say you didnt make any claims and push responsibility back to the opposition parties. Perfect excuse.</p>
