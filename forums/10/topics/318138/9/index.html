              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you capable of handling any opinions from anyone of the participants in this Speakers' Corner, or do you need some specialists and academics to verfiy the solutions offered to solve your ''assumed' inflation, oil, rice, FT, etc" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will you be wasting everybody's effort in asking anyone here to look at your presume crisis ''in the rise of prices that impacts most'' ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely, it is best for you to consult your academics and specialist, who you will surely respect their more discerning opinions than posing your assumed problems to the general participants whose qualifiications are unknown to you ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why will you risk being agitated when you cannot accept any logical views that are offered ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">One can only see you as either a masochist looking for a painful time at being agitated by others, who will surely insult your silly positions that have constantly been seen to be nothing but simply ''Point_blank''; or worst still, to be labelled a troll in an open forum.</span></p>

              <p>My purpose of this thread is to hope to hear something concrete,
              some credible solutions from the opposition parties, but what i
              have heard are only polemics from its supporters. Looks like
              there is no hope we will get any help from that
              quarter. Absolutely no reason to fight for their chance
              to get into power.</p>
              <p>Some say the govt are paid highly to look for solutions. Then
              are we going to sit, go hungry or bankrupt and wait till the
              next election to vote them out when they cannot solve them?</p>
              <p>I refuse to believe sporeans are a kiasu and apathetic lot. In
              these bad times, we can show our heart to our neighbours by
              skimping meals to donate that dollar to them. I refuse to believe
              that all intelligent sporeans are already in the civil service.</p>
              <p>We can bitch, moan, cry, fight and insult each other here,
              comment on who is right, who is wrong, allege wrongs without a
              shred of evidence, claim who was right and who was wrong, and it
              would not help our fellow citizens one bit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> But is there anyone who have a credible idea or
              solution to help our fellow citizens get thru these times? Or
              continue to mock one another here for another 100  pages?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Similarly, this Government should decide in favor of either the ERP to be used as the single and total traffic management system, or rid Singaporeans from the burdensome Import and Road Tax system to manage traffic - as presently, Singaporeans are burdened with a multiple layer of government traffic management charges that resulted in the present high cost of living made worst by global events.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will you advocate that this Government stop handing out the billion dollar refunds from Annual Budget Surplus, and to use the Billion Dollar annual payout for a National Health Insurance Plan for all Singaporeans ? Or are you doubtful that the talent of the government cannot prevent the Public Hospitals from being dishonest to cheat the insurance scheme with overcharged services ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can this government be more transparent in its costings for the hospital and medical care billings, when the strong Singapore Dollar still cannot allow the Singapore medical services to provide cheap health care cost to everyone except those in the Upper Income Group ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will this Government consider the restructuring of land pricing to help make housing more affordable to the next generation ? At the rate tthat this Government is manipulating the market prices of land for sale, it will only continue to increase the artificially high value of land for private and public housing, as well as for industrial and commercial developments - all of which increases the Cost of Living to higher levels.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">At this stage now, you surely should convince yourself - ''if it truly matters if you are insulted'' and you must figure out "who you really are" ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you sure you are an inconsequential ''Point_blank'' or someone of "more logical substance" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You persist in asking for solutions, can you handle the solutions that have been offered by different parties here, or do you need the solutions to be more clearly spelled out for a mind that is only capable of ''Point_blank" comprehension only ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is not so clever to attempt to turn tables on others, when the favor has always been returned to you - and it is painful to see you in an agitated state of mind that expose the vile side of your limited vocabulary used in simple debate.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It will seem that the MIW Leadership do not look at the situation as a crisis for Singapore, why will you contradict their position to make such alarmist presumption of a crisis occurring - or about to occur ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you smarter than those whom you want to imitate, or are you the one who will only listen to your own voice, and read what you want and block out the rest ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You had stated that your purpose for "this thread is to hope to hear something concrete, some credible solutions from the opposition parties" - firstly, is this the right place to hear from the opposition parties ? Should you not visit the websites of the various Alternative Political Parties ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you believe that you will find members from the Alternative Parties here, or ordinary Singaporeans with views that are different from the MIW Agenda ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How do you determine what are concrete solutions and what are not - when you have admitted that you are in no position to comment on anyone's views, and will need to refer to academics and professional for further evaluation ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is this not a futile exercise in getting yourself pawned half of the time, or are you simply trolling with this thread ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For you own indulgent trolling act - it seems that you are the only one suffering the unhappy consequences..<br></span></p>

Seriously?  I thought democracy was about elections and debate?  Since when was suing a legitimate path to democracy?  Suing for defamation is a tough pill to swallow, but suing because you think you have a better way of doing things?  What world are you living in Point_blank?  Scratches head.</p>

              <p>Did you get the spelling right, or did you actually mean ''swipe at an ass" - as a backhanded compliment <strong>in the manner that an ass has been dealt with consistently in this thread</strong> ? </p>
              <p>If you mean ''wiping an ass'' - you should know this skill better than anyone - least of all me - as not too many are willing to protect any ass in this Speakers' Corner, and will surely take a swipe at any ass for continuously protecting and wiping the MIW arse.</p>
              <p>The one that has been consistently exposed for the lies, half-truths and crap-words have been your goodself, which explains for your unnecessary display of agitated verbage - {as in verbal garbage} - as the tone in all of my responses has remained as cheerful and sprightly as the balmy wind on this sunny day by the sea.</p>

              <p>I would want to ask a few questions about politics.</p>
              <p>Does the oppostion party give any other solutions of helping the people now ? Like making solutions that could be made instead of the 7% GST solution provided by P4P?If the oppostion could produce better solutions,would the P4P regime would cease to exist?Or would have they covered that with half thruths and replies?</p>
              <p>If the oppostion could really prove themselves beter than the P4P's way of settling problems,that would be nice.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Firstly, do you think that the P4P will implement any good solutions from the Alternative Parties that will surely undermine the worth of the P4P Ministers and MPs - {forget about the politics of good ideas coming from low paid or unpaid members from the Alternative Parties} ?</p>
              <p>Secondly, are there any means available to the Alternative Parties to publicize their solutions to solve the present high cost of living for Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Thirdly, any solutions from the Alternative Parties to bust the high Cost of Living will require the current policies of the P4P Government to be drastically modified or withdrawn. Will the P4P Government be prepared to lose face for the sake of Singaporeans, or will they protect their Political Positions and play Politics at the expense of Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>The P4P Politicians in their interest to protect their Political Turf, they have insisted that Politics is for Politicians, and to be involve in politics one must join a Poltical Party. This is a lie spoken for their own political convenience, as under the UN Commission for Human Rights - renamed in 2006 as UN Human Rights Council -  every Human Being has a Political Right to be exercised.</p>
              <p>Politics is about living, about deciding one's future, one's present existence, the security for oneself and one's family, as well as that of the community.</p>
              <p>Poltics is about Life itself - in the manner that we organise the social, political, security, and economic structures for progress and development of oneself, one's community, and one's country.</p>
              <p>During the outburst directed at Dr Catherine Lim, it was stupid of GCT to insist that for any Singaporean to participate in political discussion or activities, one must join a Political Party. and that Politics is the exclusive turf of Politicians.</p>
              <p>Do we need to depend on any Politicians or any Poltical Party to make solutions for ourselves, for our community, for our country ?</p>
              <p>In Switzerland, the Swiss Citizenry has the ability to exercise their individual political  right in approving or rejecting any government or political policies that affect their individual or collective interests.</p>
              <p>The political process maybe tedious, but the political future of the Swiss Citizenry is not left in the hands of their elected Members of Parliament whose collective mandate - given by their constituencies - are hijacked by the Political Party led by any unscrupulous individual or groups of individuals with unknown private agenda.</p>

              <p>Is this really how your idea of democracy works?

              <p>You've completely dismissed or ignored every point that others have made against your hypothesis.  That's what I mean by shoving your opinion down our throats.  This thread is your attempt at a one-way discussion, and now it seems you're getting angry that it isn't working out that way.  If you flop your dick out in public then be prepared to have it judged.</p>
              <p>I think you'll find that I haven't stated my political viewpoint in this thread. I wish for healthy opposition and believe that this can benefit Singapore.  At no time have I made value judgements of either the existing opposition or the ruling party.  We don't all have to adopt venemous polarised positions here.</p>
