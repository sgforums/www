              <p>First off, political opposition figures have my deepest respects that they have the desire to serve the People and do have the People's interest at heart, at a time when many citizens would rather aspire for financial wealth than have their name banded about in public view.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But they must also have the quality to lead the People, to give them a better life, for desire alone is not enough. Only the best should aspire towards the highest honour of our state - Leader.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, do take stock of oneself first before even making that attempt to lead others. People can understand that there is no perfection, but at least there must be less mistakes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To perform based on lesser mistakes would be to gain experience. Visit other parts of the world and learn as much as possible, gain as much as possible, on effective solutions to help our People.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Politics is a dirty game and no party who had ruled will just simply handover power to the next without a fight to the bitter end. 'Know the enemy, know yourself, a thousand battles fought, a thousand won'. - Sun Tzi.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, don't go banging your head against the wall anymore and get sued for libel. Work on viable solutions that can solve the everyday dilemas faced by citizens. Other parties will copy and do the same.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The thing is, with the current financial turmoil and rise in daily costs, where some blame are unjustly thrown on our current leaders,  there is a window for the opposition to get elected - not by 'civil disobedience', but cool calculated intelligent reasoning with the masses. What the ruling party can do, the opposition can do too, with at least a chance for 'check and balance' within parliament.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do not oppose for the sake of opposition, but work only and solely for the good of the People and gain respect even with the ruling party.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if the opposition parties continues to whine and harp on 'unfair treatment', protest marches and freedom of speech - these isn't going to get my vote and others as well. We want solutions to daily issues and issues pertaining to the safety of our next generations!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If opposition can't come up with solutions, let alone form a team for government, then they better disband and vote for the ruling party instead, and let Singapore be a one party state.</p>

              <h1 class="title">Chia Ti Lik’s open letter to PM Lee and MM Lee</h1>
              <p>Dear MM, PM</p>
              <p>When i was a 13 year old boy, i bought the two books of your (Lee
              Kuan Yew’s) speeches by Alex Josey. To me you were a hero, you led
              Singapore from colonialism to independence. Your speeches were complex
              and had carried a lot of detail. Though i did not understand them
              fully, i had great respect for them.</p>
              <p>In 1988 when i was fifteen, i witnessed what was shown on TV and the
              news of the marxist ISD arrests detentions. I thought Lawyer Peter
              Cuthbert Low was doing a damn good and brave job. Subsequent to the
              televised confessions to the marxist conspiracy, i was a
              misleadingly convinced of what the government had to do. Nevertheless,
              the behaviour and high handedness of your administration disgusted me.</p>
              <p>In those years, with the exception of the 1985 economic recession,
              Singapore did well, so in the thought that there was still overall good
              in the administration, my political inclinations still remained with
              the then prevailing administration.</p>
              <p>1988 General Election, Workers’ Party’s  JB Jeyaretnam, Jufrie
              Mahmood, Francis Seow and i think Wee Han Kim all make close runs into
              parliament but fail to enter it by small margins. Having been misled by
              the PAP that Jufrie was playing communal politics i guess many in the
              middle ground gave their vote to the PAP.</p>
              <p>WP’s Dr Tan Bin Seng contested my ward in Changi against Teo Chong Tee. I remembered waving to Dr. Tan.</p>
              <p>I also saw the Tiananmen Massacre in 1989, i wondered if indeed it
              was necessary to do so. If staying in power justified the means of
              anything, then anything goes is it not? But staying in power had many
              facets and motives, though violence was used, i did not see the highest
              echelons of the Chinese government thereafter seek to enrich itself.</p>
              <p>In 1990 or so, you then spoke crap to the people about pegging
              political and administrative position (public service) salaries to the
              to earners in the private sector. I wondered what shit was beginning to
              show. In 1991 was the year when a number of my classmates had danced
              with a huge inflatable hammer during swing singapore. I recalled that
              they were manhandled to the police post and the inflatable hammer
              balloon burst. The Police did not take action after establishing that
              they were not linked to the Workers’ Party. I heard the recollection of
              the events by my classmates in Victoria Junior College with disgust.</p>
              <p>In 1991, PM Goh Chok Tong loses 3 seats to the SDP and 1 seat to WP.
              I then saw further steps taken to broaden the grip using GRCs.</p>
              <p>I had entered military national service in 1992, i met Teo Chee Hean
              once when he was the Chief of Navy, I had a favourable impression on
              him afterall he was our CNV. His departure from the Navy and entry into
              politics was expected as by then you develop a sense of where the press
              will try to open the road for the PAP, that prepares the way for the
              political steps to be taken.</p>
              <p>In 1992, SDP contests Marine Parade by-election introducing
              Commodore Teo Chee Hean. SDP loses quite dismally. Subsequent to that
              are mistakes made by SDP and dramatic responses by the PAP and its
              admininstration towards Dr. Chee Soon Juan and the SDP.</p>
              <p>In 1994, i entered law school. I read about the defamation cases in
              first year of law school. I saw the number of political cases which
              smeared the legal landscape.</p>
              <p>In the January 1997 General Election, I was feverishly preparing for
              my 2nd semester in 3rd year. I saw the close fight in Cheng San GRC
              degenerate into threats and almost gangsterism. According to PAPpy
              reports, We now have a chinese chauvinist and so on. Subsequent to a
              victory in Cheng San, your PAP then continued to lay waste to the
              personal estates of opposition candidates. WP’s Tang Liang Hong and JB
              Jeyaretnam.</p>
              <p>I forgot to add, i was in a clinic in Bedok when JB Jeyaretnam did his decoy rounds. I shook his hand.</p>
              <p>Year 2000, I was insidiously recruited into the PAP fold shortly
              after being called to the Bar. The induction to MPS under Chng Hee Kok
              opened my eyes. Chng Hee Kok was a good MP but what the PAP had created
              negated the good work. I also met Tan Cheng Bock once, i was impressed
              by the way he treated his men and his constituents, i also witnessed
              the loyalty and dedication of the party members at his branch. The PAP
              had its deep failings in creating a system that no longer served the
              nation but more to serving itself. GE2001, i began to distance myself
              from the PAP.</p>
              <p>General Election 2001, the elections department disqualifies the
              WP’s Ajunied attempt at nomination. I remember James Gomez leading the
              rest of the team walking down the staircase.</p>
              <p>Dismayed by the strength of the opposition and the uneven playing
              field. I entered WP in 2004. I contested the GE2006 election. I lost
              the fight at East Coast GRC.</p>
              <p>7th November 2006, I quit the Workers’ Party over a ban placed on me
              from engaging and criticising the PAP in internet forums using very
              harsh words under my real name. I left the party because i saw no
              reason why an opposition party should seek to silence its members from
              engaging in debates on political issues.</p>
              <p>This is totally different from the application of party whip or
              party discipline unlike what was described by Assoc Prof Ho Khai Leong
              in the Today Newspaper following the fallout. There is no party
              position to contradict at all. When the party refuses to take a stand
              or is too slow to do so, is it right to gag your members?</p>
              <p>I entered the citizen activist fold in 2007. My paths crossed with
              the much demonised SDP. I begin to see the truly valiant hard fighters
              that remained in the opposition. I was arrested with members of the SDP
              on 15th March 2008 World Consumers’ Day Parliament House Protest.</p>
              <p>In the police station, i witnessed in person the courage and the
              strength of SDP members in standing up to the Regime. My phone and
              beloved digital camera is still being kept by the prosecution. I am
              keeping this in mind all the time. Your boys think that this will
              intimidate me. The longer it drags, the more disgusted i become.</p>
              <p>I know on Monday 12th May 2008, the two of you Excellencies were
              going all out to crush the SDP. This is all well and fine. It just
              unfortunate that i like to side the underdog. The harder you hit the
              SDP, the harder i will fight you.</p>
              <p>The fight was adjourned seemingly because your missus and mommy had
              a 2nd stroke. I pray for her speedy recovery. I bear no ill feelings
              towards her. She is not the one who has to go, if you get what i mean <img class="wp-smiley" src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"></p>
              <p>With Mrs. Lee Kuan Yew is down with her 2nd stroke, the mortality of
              life must be pretty clear to your two Excellencies by now. Even if the
              PAP retains its grip on Singapore - by all means necessary - can you
              take Singapore with you wherever you go? Is it not time to be a little
              more realistic? Is it too late to salvage a good name for posterity? <img class="wp-smiley" src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"></p>
              <p>Now i really I cannot recall where i left those two books by Alex
              Josey, to me they are now utter rubbish. I am ashamed of saying what i
              will do to your Lee Kuan Yew memoirs Third World to First when i lay my
              hands on them.</p>
              <p>I will now do anything to unseat the PAP from power. Whether or not
              their MPs are good men and whether or not they give the oft-quoted
              excuse that their hands are tied. This is my promise to you. Mark my
              words.</p>
              <p>Yours faithfully</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>IF someone else can come along with better real life solutions that can satisfy all with their daily issues, do you think they will care if he has the pedigree to rule?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hate whomever you want, Poh, no one can stop you except the one you hate. But leave the constitutional laws alone. That is the only legacy we all have, left behind by our founding fathers, for the peace we enjoyed for years.</p>

              <p>In GE2006, the entire population of Singapore is 4.5 Million, the Total Voting Electorate was only 1,222,884 Singaporeans - without including the population from the Walk-over constitutencies that would have brought the actual toatal to 2,157,840.</p>
              <p>Almost half the eligible voting population did not get to vote.</p>
              <p>The PAP received only 747,860 votes {66.6%), the Worker's Party had 183,604 votes, and the SDA got 145,902 votes.</p>
              <p>The PAP saw a -8.69% decline in the popular votes, while WP had a gain of +13.3% and SDA also a gain of +0.96%.</p>
              <p>The detractors  will eagerly support the PAP line of propaganda by insisting that it is the fault of the Opposition in not putting up as many candidates to challenge the PAP.</p>
              <p>They will not admit that this is part of the PAP strategy to preserve their own political fortunes at the expense of the electorates and the Alternative parties. This strategy is coupled by legislations that prevent and discorage any direct or indirect political, morale, or financial support from the population to the Alternative Parties - by way of implied punitive reprisal or otherwise.</p>
              <p>Singapore is no bigger then the state of New York, and yet it is divided into wards that far outnumber New York State, which has a population of 19,306,183 - yet Singapore has more MPs holding public office at the expense of the Singaporean Tax Payers.</p>
              <p>It is disingenious and dishonest to claim that the Ruling Party has the mandate from Singaporeans, when half the population is unable to participate in the Election.</p>
              <p>Even Third World Thailand had called for election to be re-conducted, when it saw half of its population refusing to participate in Thaksin's snap-election held before his own downfall.</p>
              <p>Should a First World Singapore be measured with a lower standard of conduct ?</p>

              <p>Each time when the subject of the Opposition is brought up, it never fail to amaze me that the vocabulary in the expressed thoughts of a "Bear" is so negatively colored by uncouth language filled with vulgar expletives towards persons who are no less Singaporean than himself.</p>
              <p>For all the short-coming of CSJ - he is still a Singaporean, and who have given the best years of his life serving National Service, and recognised for his loyalty to even be promoted to the rank of Inspector in the SPF - as well as serving time in prison for his principles in calling for the constitutional abuses to be put right.</p>
              <p>He was prepared to stand up for Singaporeans - at a time when no tertiary educated Singaporean was prepared to volunteer to join the Alternative Parties - after the likes of JBJ, Francis Seow, Tang Liang Hong, the late Dr. Lee Siew Choh were viciously mowed down by the Third World political tactics and strategies employed by supposedly First World Leaders.</p>
              <p>Each time when the liberalisation of the political landscape is called, the same old worn out tune is constantly repeated - like the droning of the Communist Propaganda to drive fear into the general population, to fear those painted as fools and mad men who will enter politics to represent the community and steal the national reserves.</p>
              <p>Ironically, without the help of those who are accused as fools and mad men, the national reserves are already being raided.</p>
              <p>Is the Election Office not already there to prevent the supposed ''mad men and the psychotic'' from entering politics ?</p>
              <p>What has been proposed is the dismantling of the GRCs that is no better then to pull the weak candidate into office by the weight of stronger ones grouped together, and this goes entirely against the grain of any meritocratic principles.</p>
              <p>Like the Ruling Political Party - are you fearful that the collective wisdom of the majority in Singapore will be superceded by your narrow views concerning the politics in Singapore ?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000080;"> </span><span style="color: #000080;">If the Ruling Political Party is to shed off the dishonesty in claiming that the GRC is to ensure that the minority ethnic group will be fairly represented in Parliament, and reduce the number of constituencies to half, and do not indulge in constant redrawing of the election boundaries - then perhaps we can include the entire population into the election process.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">With a population of 4.5 Million - do we need 84 Members of Parliament to attend to the Population, of which at least 80 percent do not even get to meet their MP ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Is this bloated number of MPs not costing tax payer money ?</span></p>

              <p>Thanks for your reply. Amongst the many viewpoints you raised, the thing is, such actions had been approved in parliament, agreed by those whom we voted to represent us in a free election.</p>

              <p>Don't vote for that person again, if you feel so strongly about the issues. But once the vote had been accepted, you must respect the wishes of the majority, whom are educated people with at least 'O' levels and not yokels. They must have clearly felt such regulations are agreeable, if not, they will not vote for him/her again.</p>

              <p>The onus is on the opposition to prove why their point of view is correct, but in the end, the choice is still with the People. NO ONE pointed a gun to a voter's head and say he MUST vote for a particular person here in Singapore.</p>

              <p>If one wants the highest chair of office in the land to change the political landscape to his taste, he must not only lead, but must have the intelligence to lead.

              <p>Fellow forummers,</p>
              <p>Allow me to say something.</p>
              <p>I like to say that I have great respect for all our opposition parties.</p>
              <p>Although I may or may not be a opposition supporter,</p>
              <p>as a member of Democratic Society,</p>
              <p>I feel that to serve as a Opposition party member is more difficult than joining other kinds of parties in the Pore. Why ? Because they are doing what most dare not do.</p>
              <p>Just ask around, how many given the chance dare to take up this role?</p>
              <p>To me, these opposition people are greater than those who want to but dare not join the opposition. Look at how many earlier batch of opposition ended up? Look at dr Chee's situation.</p>
              <p>So, in the name of democracy, I am glad there are people who go into opposition .</p>
              <p>This is good because:</p>
              <p>1. How can a democracy be solid if there is ZERO opposition?</p>
              <p>2. Opposition's role is to keep the ruling people on their toes. But this is easier said than done. They represent the people by performing this role. They also can be used to speak up on behalf of the people.</p>
              <p>3. a Vibrant democracy needs a capable opposition.</p>
              <p>Sadly, like the young nation, the opposition is too young at the moment. Too inexperienced to dominate or really be able to do the check and balance role.</p>
              <p>As a member of this young democratic society, I also try to play my role by promoting democracy. encouraging check and balance. encouraging speaking up. encouraging challenging what can be challenged or need to be challenged. encouraging a mentality that questions what info is prescribed/ delivered to you.</p>
              <p>This can also be interpreted as supporting the ruling people by encouraging them to perform their best for the people. At the same time, encouraging people to be more responsible as a democratic citizen. What happens in the society affects us. Thus we must be involved.</p>
              <p>I hope the young democracy mature into a true 1st world democracy. Better do it fast. many have migrated. these are all capable ones. As I always said, to migrate is not for anyone. Even if u are rich and highly marketable.</p>
              <p>If everyone say yes, it will be yes.</p>

              For those who keep blowing the trumpet for the government, let them have a close-up look at the evidences of incompetence happening in various ministries year after year as reported by the Auditor General finally after years of keeping quiet as reproduced below:-
              
              According to CNA
              
              http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stori...346476/1/.html
              
              SINGAPORE: The Health Ministry overpaid nearly S$180,000 of financial aid to people without realising they had died.
              
              This was one of public fund lapses uncovered, according to a six-page report by the Public Accounts Committee, a parliamentary watchdog which scrutinises the annual financial statements of government bodies.
              
              The report highlighted the various lapses of three government ministries, a statutory board and the Supreme Court.
              
              The Health Ministry was particularly cited for overpaying S$178,150 of financial aid to beneficiaries who had died. After being informed of the lapse, the ministry said it had since recovered S$85,200.
              
              However, the rest remains unclaimed since the policy is not to recover payouts made up to 3 months of a person's death.
              
              The ministry said it will review its policy of allowing a grace period, and has since agreed to work with the Ministry of Home Affairs to obtain death records of beneficiaries on a monthly basis.
              
              The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was also found to have S$1.56m of unclaimed medical bills. These were incurred since 2003, during three overseas missions. The Ministry says it is currently filing the claims to its insurance company.
              
              The report also uncovered unnecessary expenditure of S$30,789 by the Supreme Court for replacing glass panels. Administrators have since recovered the amount from the contractors.
              
              The Manpower Ministry was also found to have made excessive advances to a building management agent. The ministry said the law does not allow it to claim interest on the excessive advances paid.
              
              However, a new contract, effective 2006, states that payments can only be made after works are carried out by contractors. Other safeguards, such as a banker's guarantee, are also in place to make sure advances to contractors can be recovered.
              
              The InfoComm Development Authority was found to have mismanaged cash surpluses.
              
              Under the current legal system, not all government bodies are required to be inspected by the Auditor-General.
              
              But the latest report recommends an expansion. So the Auditor-General will look into 18 statutory boards in the coming financial year, an increase from the previous 13. - CNA/ir

              For those who are constantly blowing the trumpet for the government and running down the oppositions or even citizen critics let them PONDER and touch their own heart and give their views frankly on the following POST in response to leaders' expectations to be worshipped or treated differently on occasions of tragedy among their own members :-
              
              Singapore has been and is being governed by PRAGMATISM.
              
              Courtesy aside, in this issue of whether Mrs. Lee should be wished and prayed for in her prevent condition provokes different responses from different people.
              
              If the government wants to practise the high-and-mighty PRAGMATISM POLICY ON ITS PEOPLE, THEN, IT WILL BE A GOVERNMENT WHICH WILL HAVE TO PUT UP WITH MANY "UNGRATEFUL" WISHES OF THE PEOPLE WHEN LEADERS AND THEIR CONSORT SHOULD MEET WITH TRAGEDY THEMSELVES.
              
              SOME PEOPLE MIGHT EVEN CALL THAT RETRIBUTION.
              
              GOVERNMENT LEADERS ARE REMINDED THAT THEY HAVE INSISTED ON PURSUING A COURSE OF MERCENARY PRAGMATISM AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE ALL THE TIME E.G.
              
              (1) OVER-THE-LIMIT TAXING (INCREASING GST 07 EVEN WITH REGULAR WINDFALL UNDECLARED LAND-SALE AND OTHER PROFITEERING SURPLUSES
              (2) HOARDING MONIES FROM CITIZENS,
              (3) RECOVERING COSTS IN EVERY SERVICES ALREADY PAID FOR UNDER TAXATION RESULTING IN RISING COSTS OF LIVING,
              (4) PAYING MILLIONS TO MINISTERS TO PREVENT CORRUPTION,
              (5) MEANS-TESTING, HOTA ADVANCE MEDICAL DIRECTIVE ETC
              (6) PERSISTENT AND ARROGANT AND SO-CALLED POPULIST SENTIMENT (7) CONSTANT COVER-UPS OF BIG MISTAKES LIKE IN NKF OR MAS SELAMAT OR SHIN CORP.
              
              For the sake of EQ, and belief in GOD (Not emphasising on any particular religion) I wish her a speedy recovery.
              
              For Pragmatism as GOVERNMENT ITSELF is always doing it to he people to save a few dollars, or for self-glory, I ask for change in GOVERNING PHILOSOPHY.
