              <p>Fact: Since the introduction of mega-GRCs, the opposition have never won a GRC.<br>Fact: The incumbent has only 66.6% of the votes, yet have 82/84 seats. Majority indeed.</p>
              <p>There was no vote on the implementation of mega-GRCs (5~6 persons). Voting for a government is different from voting for the implementation of the mega-GRC. Just the previous election, we see MM Lee in his mega 6 person GRCs leading 5 greenhorns who would most likely not stand a chance against a number of the opposition candidates. The same for GCT.<br><br>The other example that they did was 'voting' to join Malaysia. In none of the choices was there one that allows the population to vote no. The opposition wanted a 'NO' and they weren't given a choice. A blank vote was stated in the clause to be a 'yes'. They did raised reasons why it wasn't good, but even if their arguments were accepted by the majority, the majority weren't given a chance at all to vote for 'no' at all. What happened eventually? Singapore still broke away from Malaysia.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did you find the solutions finally after reading and extracting one paragraph from my posts ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Consumption can be curbed not by indiscriminately increasing the prices on a blanket basis that hurts the essential services that need petrol or industrial oil, which in turn affect the overall Cost of Living.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Electronic Road Pricing can be fine tuned to discourage the intensive use of saloon cars, and solve your concerns of petrol consumption for leisure - while commercial goods vehicles can be priced lower that do not affect transportation cost normally passed to consumer through product pricing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The selective use of Road Pricing is to be differntiated with the arbitrary and indiscriminate pricing currently implemented, which result in the ERP system being a Revenue Generating  Mechanism for the Government.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With or without local consumer demand, World Petroleum Prices will continue to spiral upwards, as the supply of petrol is finite, and is a depleting resource - which is manipulated as a speculative commodity by Oil Companies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why should Governments continue to use an inflexible tax system to moderate consumption, when there are more effective means that focus on specifics without producing negative effects generally to the Cost of Living ?.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How would you even know if any solution are well thought out proposals, if you do not make any effort to even understand the structure of the proposal ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is always easy to opt out and allow the academics and / or professionals to exercise thinking - what happened to your own intellectual faculties ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How will you know if Ah Meng is not more intelligent then your 'Point_blank' approach that have time and again led your points being exposed as blanks ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">At this stage, I am no longer surprise by your very presumptious and condescending remarks towards participants in this Speakers' Corner.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you are not willing to engage but prefer to indulge in polemics - why do you even bother to be here ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you believe that accountability is zero, continue with your Point_blank approach in your debating style, and see how far you get in this forum.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You got to make up your mind which is more important - your ''responsibility to society'' or to personal vanity.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why should you even care if your good solution is plagiarised by any thick skinned shameless academics - if it benefits society at large ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has this not been the position of CSJ in publicising his thoughts and solutions that he believe are good alternatives in his book ''Dare to Change'' ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The MIW dismissed his writings as ''western liberal thinking'' when it was released to the public in the 1990s; yet some of the policy changes in the Year 2002 were parallel ideas resembling CSJ's solutions published ten years earlier.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">During the preceding ten years that CSJ's proposal was dismissed, at least one generation of Singaporeans have to endure the selfish insanity of the MIW Government in office between 1992 and 2002.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With your expertise in insulting yourself so far, why do you need any extra help from me ?  Are you sure that you care for only answers from anyone, or only the answers that you want to see or hear ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You can take as much time as you want to cop out from this debate, as no one will miss your absence.</span></p>

              <p>I can see you have nothing else to comment, and have to resort to merely insults (a 2nd time) to justify yourself. I'm talking about the discussion between you and me. No idea why you would link me to others.</p>

              <p><br>yup, eagle. I am sad man. And have a case against the ineffective oppostion. But if you want a constructive comment from me, i can only offer - There's always the next election.</p>

              <p>If you were referring to the discussion between you and me and not link to others, then let me the first to apologise for that was the first discussion i had with you and you did not insult me before.</p>
