              <p>Atobe so from the post that u replied me. I agree that the opposition doesnt even have a single chance of expressing their views without being sued by LYK or have their web taken down.</p>
              <p>Although the opposition are powerless to display their resourcefullness.</p>
              <p>(*I still remembered poor old chiam wanted to plant <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">trees</span></strong> in potong pasir but was rejected.Look how hard isit with just planting<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">trees</span></strong>??The next day,the newspaper made a full blown article about him in mockery*)</p>
              <p>How are you sure that the opposition wont follow in P4P footsteps like in 5 to 10 years.Or worst continue adding on to the damage?Theres also no sign that the opposition party would naturally be much better than P4P.</p>
              <p>Oya by the way,hows the court fight le?Its today isnt it?</p>

              <p><br>Did i categorically said you support the opposition party such as: 'webben is an active supporter of so and so party;?</p>
              <p>Calling my call of help as 'an ego trip' is not 'venemous' to your belief system?</p>
              <p>'Hypothesis' or the unvarnished truth? Which Singapore are you living in?</p>
              <p>'one way discussion' - you got that right. How do you expect me to respond to asswipe atobe's allegations of electoral fraud and dishonesty other than to ask her/him to present it to the courts to determine the truth? These are serious issues right down to the integrity of national officer bearers which neither you or me have the right to comment other than an independent judiciary whom will be objective enough to judge.</p>
              <p>And did she/he did anything else such as taken such office bearers to court, as a priviledge of being a citizen, but to sow doubts on persons who had done nothing but to work their ass off(and hair off) for us all  on call 24/7? How else blind do you WANT to be?</p>
              <p>Lest you claim i avoid your comment on 'I thought democracy was about elections and debate?' then here is truly an opinion, but don't worry, i will state here CATEGORICALLY, DON'T accept it if you think it is being shafted down your throat! Only, just use your brains and analyse if what i said is true:-</p>
              <p>Democracy is as you perceive. Everything else should be transparent, EXCEPT for national defense issues, our savings investments, etc, things that are vital for the security of our People. Even other democratic nations will not bare it all, down to their last operational bolt.</p>
              <p>Debate - yes. Polices for the governance of the country for the elected term should be debated, so that the People can be better informed prior to casting their vote.</p>
              <p>But here is a darkside to democracy, and that is the dirty tactics of smearing a candidate's integrity so that he won't get elected, no matter how good in other areas he is. It is often used when the opposition whom have nothing better to offer to the People, and knows it will lose elections, thus the tactic.</p>
              <p>Since independence, haven't we seen how the opposition parties, whom had nothing better to offer to counter the evidences of growth and progress of our country under the current ruling party, use such dirty tactics almost on ALL our elections?</p>
              <p>It was an acceptable tactic, even though dirty, for which voter would want a less than moral person to rule? BUT, there must be evidences to substantiate such claims. And the person whom is defamed MUST go to court to clear his name if he wants the nation to trust him.</p>
              <p>But did the opposition parties had any evidences? NONE! All they wanted was to topple a good man who have uplifted the lives of many for years, even as such scums had nothing better to offer for the People. Go to their rallies, i encourage you and judge for yourselves the scary populist issues they promote. If they were good, they would have been voted. But were they? The votes are CLEAR. The People made a choice and must be respected by ALL, and this is democracy./</p>
              <p>As if not enough, when these scums lose the court case, they make all kinds of allegations thru the international press, helping us voters looked like fools in the international stage, that we foolishly vote for a dictator tyrant.</p>
              <p>Even worse, they dare impunge the honour of our independent judiciary without evidence and this is the highest crime to the People. If judges are deemed biased and not fair, then our legal system is totally corrupted and whatever we had signed and stamp is not worth the paper used. Nothing would be binding. It is worse than a terrorist attack.</p>
              <p>webben, If you want me to be civil to you, then the least you can do is be rational to me. That is all i ask.</p>

              <p>There is a difference being clueless and taking necessary action. Being clueless means you haven't a clue on WHAT IS GOING ON. Is the ruling party being clueless, or are they doing what they can to solve problems humanely possible?</p>
              <p>Even you yourself said it, 'They are not Gods'. I agree with you. Just ask yourself - is the ruling party doing what they can, or not, and then when election comes, you are free to make your own decision, as is your right.</p>

              <p>How are you sure that the opposition wont follow in P4P footsteps like in 5 to 10 years.Or worst continue adding on to the damage?Theres also no sign that the opposition party would naturally be much better than P4P.</p>

              <p>LKY do not need to sue every individual in the Alternative Party, and very much is left to their whim and fancy in interpreting the threat level as to what and when it is time to make a scape goat of someone to keep their vessel on an even keel.</p>
              <p>It is not necessary for LKY and his Team to sue the Alternative Parties for all their views all the time, but focusing the venom on one whom they have identified as the most potent threat to their cause should help to keep the others in check.</p>
              <p>Amongst the personalities in the Alternative Parties, CSJ is the most qualified, and has received the focus of LKY and his Team since his first debut into the political limelight - as CSJ represent the educated lot who dare to refuse the invitation to join the Master Team, and the rest should be discouraged from similarly doing so.</p>
              <p>It seems that if the Alternative Parties do not rock the status quo in the political landscape but challenging the box that LKY and his Team has placed around the existing Alternative Parties, he is contented to let them live until each of them retire from the scene.</p>
              <p>One can see the lack-lustre performance of LTK and CST in Parliament, both unable to press home their arguments, not able to make any impact in their views presented to the House.</p>
              <p>This boils down to the bolts and nuts in the organisation of the Alternative Parties, and it seems that WP has still not get their act together - as what CSJ had done - by rebuilding the support and administrative base, a stronger and meticulous team of researchers, and political activists to educate and reach out to the population.</p>
              <p>While LKY has solidly locked up the print and broadcast media, and practically monopolised all news and information available for local consumption, the Alternative Parties have to be more resourceful to reachout to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The WP and SDA seems to shy away from using the Virtual World to communicate to the younger generation, compared to SDP and CSJ - who are very adapt at podcasting, and conveying their agenda through the web.</p>
              <p>It is surprising that for a psychologist, CSJ is not sophisticated in the practise of his art in developing or projecting his image; and has allowed MIW Team to take the initiative to cast him as a lost cause through their dominating hold on state controlled media..</p>

                      To respond to both, I took your "if your intention here is not to contribute suggestions but to turn a blind eye and support the pathetic excuses of the clueless opposition parties, then GO ROT IN HELL!" as fair indication that you assumed I supported one party or the other.  And boy, ROT IN HELL sure shows the venom in your opinion.  Or do you consider those words 'rational'?  Didn't think so.
                  <p></p><p>    
                      No, I am of the belief that you are on an ego trip.  Nothing venemous about that.  I guess we'll have to disagree.  Try not to take it personally, because that wasn't the intention.  
                  </p><p>    
                      I appreciate your effort in your last response.  At the end of the day it all comes down to opinion.  Do you think an individual's public reputation is of greater value that the truth?  Is an individual's public reputation of more value than a truly democratic state?  Do you think the populace cannot tell truth from falsehood without taking it to court?  
                  </p><p>    
                      I ask you, how can a democracy function without defamation suits?  Is the Australian system, for example, just an illusion?  How are the ministers able to maintain their reputations without going to court?  It's not fantasy land, there really is another way. 
                  </p><p>    
                      "But here is a darkside to democracy, and that is the dirty tactics of smearing a candidate's integrity so that he won't get elected, no matter how good in other areas he is."
                  </p><p>    
                      And here is the darksite to libel.  Fear of lawsuits stifles debate, both libellous and truthful.  You throw the baby out with the bathwater.  You risk electing candidates, no matter how bad they are.  A candidate's reputation may come at a huge cost to the country.  Whether an individual's reputation is of higher value than democracy is a matter of opinion.
                  </p><p>    
                      Oh hang on, I almost missed it.  "here is a darkside to democracy".. what do you mean?  Isn't Singapore a democracy?  Democracy causes slurring?  So if we stifle the slurring through lawsuits then we're no longer a democracy?  Interesting.  I'm getting a better idea of your political ideals.
                  </p><p>    
                      The last issue of debate is whether the MIWs mudslinging/slurring/criticism is any better or worse, more or less truthful than the mudslinging/slurring/criticism coming the other way.  That is completely up to your opinion (and for better or worse, up to the courts).

              <p>Lest you claim i avoid your comment on 'I thought democracy was about elections and debate?' then here is truly an opinion, but don't worry, i will state here CATEGORICALLY, DON'T accept it if you think it is being shafted down your throat! Only, just use your brains and analyse if what i said is true:-</p>
              <p>Democracy is as you perceive. Everything else should be transparent, EXCEPT for national defense issues, our savings investments, etc, things that are vital for the security of our People. Even other democratic nations will not bare it all, down to their last operational bolt.</p>
              <p>Debate - yes. Polices for the governance of the country for the elected term should be debated, so that the People can be better informed prior to casting their vote.</p>
              <p>But here is a darkside to democracy, and that is the dirty tactics of smearing a candidate's integrity so that he won't get elected, no matter how good in other areas he is. It is often used when the opposition whom have nothing better to offer to the People, and knows it will lose elections, thus the tactic.</p>
              <p>Since independence, haven't we seen how the opposition parties, whom had nothing better to offer to counter the evidences of growth and progress of our country under the current ruling party, use such dirty tactics almost on ALL our elections?</p>
              <p>It was an acceptable tactic, even though dirty, for which voter would want a less than moral person to rule? BUT, there must be evidences to substantiate such claims. And the person whom is defamed MUST go to court to clear his name if he wants the nation to trust him.</p>
              <p>But did the opposition parties had any evidences? NONE! All they wanted was to topple a good man who have uplifted the lives of many for years, even as such scums had nothing better to offer for the People. Go to their rallies, i encourage you and judge for yourselves the scary populist issues they promote. If they were good, they would have been voted. But were they? The votes are CLEAR. The People made a choice and must be respected by ALL, and this is democracy./</p>
              <p>As if not enough, when these scums lose the court case, they make all kinds of allegations thru the international press, helping us voters looked like fools in the international stage, that we foolishly vote for a dictator tyrant.</p>
              <p>Even worse, they dare impunge the honour of our independent judiciary without evidence and this is the highest crime to the People. If judges are deemed biased and not fair, then our legal system is totally corrupted and whatever we had signed and stamp is not worth the paper used. Nothing would be binding. It is worse than a terrorist attack.</p>
              <p>webben, If you want me to be civil to you, then the least you can do is be rational to me. That is all i ask.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This was discussed before and you refused to have the courage to respond by not even making any reference to it; but prefer to convince webben with details that you plagiarised from the MIW propaganda and passing it of as your own opinion in your post on 23 May 2008 - 2.58P.M. on Page 4 of this thread.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This shows the pathetic state of intellectual honesty that you have sunk to.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will you not dispute the fact that a bloated parliament of 84 seats is only intended to stretch the resources of the Alternative Parties - which is already handicapped by all kinds of administrative and legislative measures that limit any morale, active or financial support that Singaporeans will dare to give ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Similarly, will you not dispute that with so many GRCs grouping various constituencies, and more being added to enlarge the existing GRCs - this has literally made nonsense of the Meritocratic Principles in allowing the weaker politician to be pulled into Parliament by the stronger candidates ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is it not a fact that the incumbent Political Party has continuously redrawn the election boundary to dilute the popular support given to the Alternative Parties ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you claiming that a level field exist when the incumbent Political Party continue to use its government powers - during an election - to control the press and broadcast media, even to the extent of disallowing politics to be on the internet ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you disclaiming that the incumbent Political Party has not influenced the Editorials in the printed and broadcast media to lampoon and project the Alternative Political Parties in the worst possible manner possible ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even during one of the recent Election - prior to E-2006 - three incumbent ministers had contravened the Election Act by appearing within the area of the Polling Stations when polling was conducted - and yet the Attorney General re-interpreted the events to absolve these ministers from any wrong doings. How will you interprete this ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yet, you will encourage actions to be taken in LKY's Court of Law - that interprete the Law according to their own convenience ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you hallucinating when you are in a blank-state-of mind, or simply have to make your points when you have nothing but blanks to offer ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As for being the ''asswipe'' - you have been the ass that got your butt swiped more often that once, you seem to be bonded with this term.</span></p>

Within a week, he returned to the United States. Dr.Lingle and the Singapore printer were subsequently fined for 'contempt of court by way of scandalising the judiciary' and ordered to pay the government's legal costs, totalling in excess of $100,000. Dr Lingle did not return to Singapore to face the charges. <br><br>Dec 1994 : Although the International Herald Tribune published an apology for the above article, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew filed a civil libel suit. The IHT agreed to pay the Senior Minister US$213,000 in damages plus costs for the civil suit. <br><br>Feb 1995 : Singapore police mounted a major crackdown codenamed "Operation Hope," raiding private homes where Jehovah's Witnesses members were holding prayer meetings. Officers seized bibles, religious literature, documents and computers, and eventually brought charges against 69 members, many of whom went to jail. A month later, 73 year old grandmother Yu Nguk Ding was arrested for carrying two "undesirable publications" - one of them a bible printed by the group. She spent a week in jail rather than pay a fine. <br><br>Jul 1995 : Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and his son, deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, won a libel suit against the International Herald Tribune for an article, published in August 1994, suggesting that the younger Lee was appointed to his post on account of his father. The High Court awarded a record judgment of $950,000. The Asian Wall Street Journal (AWSJ), Asiaweek, and the Far Eastern Economic Review remained gazetted in 1995. <br><br>Nov 1995 : Parliament censured Dr Chee Soon Juan and the Singapore Democratic Party for allegedly endorsing attacks on the judiciary made by Chee's fellow panelists, dissident Francis Seow and academic Dr Christopher Lingle, at a forum held at Williams College, USA. Government leaders said that the failure of Chee and other SDP leaders to contradict the attacks made by Seow and Lingle constituted positive assent by "clever omission." <br><br>Jul 1996 : <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The SBA (Singapore Broadcasting Authority) issued a set of broad regulations for the internet. Prohibited material was defined as "objectionable on the grounds of public interest, public morality, public order, public security and national harmony." Authorities underlined that the Sedition Act also covers the internet. The guidelines were subsequently elaborated on in SBA's Internet Code of Practice in 1997.</span> <br><br>Aug 1996 : <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Government denied the Singapore Democratic Party a request to produce and distribute video tapes on the grounds that visual images can be used to evoke emotional rather than rational responses. Moreover, according to the Government, the use of videos could allow political parties to sensationalize or distort information to capture the maximum attention of the viewer.</span> <br><br>Dec 1996 : Parliament levied fines in excess of $36,000 against Dr Chee Soon Juan and three other SDP members, claiming that they had committed perjury and other offenses during the proceedings of a special parliamentary committee examining government health care subsidies. <br><br>Dec 1996/Jan 1997 (General Elections) : <span style="color: #ff0000;">Despite being returned to power on polling day due to lack of opposition representation, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong threatened to turn constituencies into slums lest the rest of the electorate voted the ruling People's Action Party.</span> <br><br>The Elections Department, under direct command of the Prime Minister's Office, redrew electoral boundaries. Amongst others, residents of Braddell Heights, located in central Singapore, suddenly found themselves registered as voters under Marine Parade, a constituency on the east coast helmed by PM Goh. <br><br>The Workers' Party complained to the police that PM Goh and other PAP leaders had been speaking to voters inside a polling station on polling day, an act deemed illegal under the Parliamentary Elections Act. But the Public Prosecutor ruled that the PAP ministers had been inside the polling stations as opposed to "loitering" on the outside, so no offence had been committed.</span> <br><br>Name-calling by the PAP dominated hustings as Workers' Party candidate Tang Liang Hong was labelled an "anti-Christian, anti-English-educated and Chinese-language chauvinist." But it wasn't the PAP men who got sued. A group of senior PAP leaders - PM Goh Chok Tong, SM Lee Kuan Yew, DPM Lee Hsien Loong and eight other MPs - sued Tang for allegedly defaming them in a police report which he had filed to seek police protection. The police had handed Tang's report to PM Goh and SM Lee. Citing death threats, Tang fled to Malaysia shortly after the election results were announced. He did not return home that night and has remained in exile ever since. <br><br><strong>For producing the police report at the election rally, Workers' Party leader JB Jeyaretnam was also sued. All in all, PAP leaders filed a total of 21 defamation suits against both Tang and JBJ.</strong> <br><br>Jan 1997 : While on their way to meet Tang Liang Hong in Johor Bahru, Mrs Tang Liang Hong and her daughter were stopped by immigration officers at the causeway exit. Her passport was confiscated. On her return home, they found a group of lawyers representing PM Goh Chok Tong, SM Lee Kuan Yew other PAP leaders waiting to serve 13 worldwide Mareva Injunctions to freeze their assets. Shortly after, Inland Revenue officials stormed into their house and carted away tons of documents and articles. A similar raid was carried out at Tang's office in the city. <br><br>Apr 1997 : PAP leaders cancelled the passport of Mrs Tang Liang Hong because her name appeared as a co-trustee in one of Tang's documents. If she was allowed to leave Singapore, PAP leaders had feared that they may be unable to recover damages from Tang. <br><br>July 1997 : <strong>Political prisoner Chia Thye Poh was allowed to travel to Germany to study but was not allowed to make any public statements or address public meetings. He also needed written permission to take part in any political activity or be a member, adviser, helper, official or participant in any organisation or association. Chia, previously an opposition Member of Parliament - was detained without trial in 1966 at the age of 26. </strong><br><br>Aug 1997 : The Singapore Government demanded that the Foreign Correspondents Association cancel a speech by then Indonesian opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri. The group's executive committee acceded to the Government's demand. <br><br>Aug 1997 : <span style="color: #ff0000;">The Internal Security Department, Singapore's secret police, was alleged to have burglarised the home of an American academic helping political exile Tang Liang Hong take up a six-month fellowship at an American university. The break-in, which seemed intended to find computer files and other records listing people interested in Singapore affairs, was investigated by local police and the FBI. According to a recent US State Department's human rights report on Singapore, it is "widely believed that the authorities routinely conduct surveillance on some opposition politicians and other critics of the Government." The same report also stated that the ISD is believed to run a network of part-time informants in the US, Australia and other countries.</span> <br><br>Sept 1997 : JB Jeyaretnam was found guilty of defaming Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong at an election rally when he told the crowd police reports had been filed against the PM and his PAP colleagues. He was ordered by Justice J. Rajendran to pay $20,000 in damages plus legal fees. After a subsequent appeal by Mr Goh, the damages awarded were increased five-fold, to $100,000. <br><br>Nov 1997 : The High Court ordered political exile Tang Liang Hong to pay the PAP leaders $4.53 million in damages. <br><br>1997/98 : In 1997 two persons were detained and in 1998, four were detained under the Internal Security Act, all for alleged espionage. Of these six, two remained in detention at the end of 1998. The names of the six detainees remained undisclosed. <br><br>Feb 1998 : Tang Liang Hong was declared bankrupt by the High Court after failing to pay $739,976 in damages and interests owed to PAP leaders. Assets belonging to him and his wife were seized. In addition, he was charged with thirty-three counts of tax evasion and there is presently an outstanding warrant for his arrest. <br><br>Mar 1998 : <strong>The Films Act was amended to ban political films and videos. The Government justified the ban as protecting politics from sensationalism, innuendo, and inaccuracy. The legislation defines a party political film as one "made by any person and directed toward any political end in Singapore" or one that contains "partisan or biased references on any political matter." <br></strong><br>Mar 1998 : The Singapore Government asked foreign TV stations to restrict coverage of political parties that do not have a wide following. "If we are not careful, foreign broadcasters, like foreign newspapers, can undermine some of our important social and other policies," the Straits Times quoted Minister George Yeo as saying. <br><br>July 1998 : The Government passed the Computer Misuse (Amendment) Act, the Electronic Transactions Act and the National Computer Board (Amendment) Act. Under the amended CMA , the police now has lawful access to data and encrypted material in their investigations of offenses under the CMA as well as other offenses disclosed in the course of their investigations. Under the ETA, the police has been given broad powers to search any computer for an offence related to the act without a warrant. <br><br>Sept 1998 : The Undesirable Publications Act was amended to include CD-ROMS, sound recordings, pictures, and computer-generated drawings, and to raise the fine for distribution or possession of banned publications. The Government also publicized the list of banned English-language publications, which is made up primarily of sexually-oriented materials, but also includes some religious and political materials. <br><br><br>Nov 1998 : <strong>Political detainee Chia Thye Poh was granted unconditional release. He had spent 22 years, six months, two weeks and four days in jail, mostly in solitary confinement. He then spent another 9 years in Sentosa under severe restrictions. <br><br>"The best years of my life were taken away just like that without a charge or trial. As a victim of the notorious Internal Security Act, I sincerely call on the government to abolish the act," said Mr Chia.</strong> <br><br>Dec 1998 : JB Jeyaretnam and Workers' Party were ordered by the High Court to pay ten members of a committee which organised the first Tamil Language Week in 1995, including PAP MP R. Ravindran, $265,000 in defamatory damages plus legal costs for the 14-day trial. <br><br>Feb 1999 : Opposition leader Dr Chee Soon Juan was jailed twice for giving two speeches at Raffles Place without a licence. For both convictions he was fined a total of $3,900 but chose instead to serve two prison terms of seven and 12 days respectively. Chee's colleague, Wong Hong Toy, was also imprisoned for 12 days after refusing to pay a fine for adjusting the microphone and the volume of the speaker. Amnesty International named both men prisoners of conscience. <br><br>Mar 1999 : The ten members of the Tamil Language weekly filed a petition with the High Court to wind up the Workers' Party after it failed to pay over $500,000 in libel damages and legal costs. <br><br>Mar 1999 : Dr Chee Soon Juan was fined for selling his book, To Be Free, without a permit. He had pleaded not guilty to the charge as book stores and vendors had refused to sell his books out of fear of prosecution. <br><br>May 1999 : When JB Jeyaretnam and Dr Chee Soon Juan applied to register Open Singapore Centre, an official said the application would have to be sent for clearance to the Internal Security Department. <br><br>May 1999 : <span style="color: #ff0000;">After a law student complained to police that someone with an account in the Home Affairs Ministry had hacked into her computer, the Ministry disclosed that it had secretly scanned the computers more than 200,000 SingNet and SingTel Magix customers, ostensibly for viruses. Singnet apologised to its customers - by email - and says the security check has since been abandoned.</span> <br><br>However, according to a recent US State Department's human rights report on Singapore, the "Internal Security Department and the Corrupt Practices Investigation Board, have wide networks for gathering information and highly sophisticated capabilities to monitor telephone and other private conversations and conduct surveillance. It is believed that the authorities routinely monitor telephone conversations and use of the Internet.. The law permits government monitoring of Internet use." <br><br>May 1999 : In a Straits Times interview, Minister George Yeo warned Singaporeans: "We have had occasions to tell women's magazines not to get involved in partisan matters. If we did not do this, every political party will use women's magazines to get their views across. I do not think that is healthy for Singapore...If you are a civic organisation, whether you are an organisation, if you want to get yourself involved politically, please get into the political arena and not hide behind a religious group, a tuition class, or a theatre troupe." <br><br>Aug 1999 : The police rejected two applications by Dr Chee Soon Juan to hold public rallies.The application was rejected because the venues were outdoors, and there was "a potential for trouble" and public "inconvenience," said the head of the police licensing division. But in a letter to the Home Affairs Ministry, Chee said officials and MPs from the ruling People's Action Party "routinely give political speeches in outdoor areas." Public gatherings of more than five people in Singapore require a police permit. <br><br>Sep 1999 : Mrs Tang Liang Hong lost her appeal for damages from PAP leaders, whom she claimed had caused her financial loss. The Court of Appeal also found that she was not entitled to damages for mental distress and anxiety. <br><br>Sep 1999 : <span style="color: #ff0000;">Elected President Ong Teng Cheong resigned but not before criticising the PAP Government for not providing details of Singapore's financial reserves. They had told him that it would take "52 man-years" to provide the information. In rapid succession, Parliament passed four constitutional amendments to grab back some of the powers that had been vested in the elected president, like his right to veto both defense spending and laws that curtailed his own authority. In a news conference, Ong said that some Ministers and public officials had treated his office as a "nuisance." <br><br>"The elected presidency was Lee Kuan Yew's initiative. He came out with the idea way back in '82, '83," said Mr Ong. <br></span><br>2000 : According to the US State Department's human rights report on Singapore, the Singapore Government released a statement confirming that an individual detained by the Internal Security Act in 1998 was still in detention. <br><br>May 2000 : <span style="color: #ff0000;">Parliament passed the Political Donations Act. Apart from disallowing political organisations from receiving foreign funding, the Act also prohibits anonymous contributions of more than $5000 in any financial year. The Home Affairs Minister has the freedom to define which civil societies are political in nature and are thus bound by the law. <br></span><br>Nov 2000 : Following a four-hour standoff at the Drama Centre, police arrested the president of a theatre company after she tried to rehearse a banned play about marital violence in Singapore's Indian Muslim community. The government said the ban was necessary because artistic works must "respect religious sensitivities in multiracial and multi-religious Singapore." Ms S. Thenmoli, who heads the Agni Kootthu theater group, was given "a stern warning in lieu of prosecution." <br><br>Dec 2000 : <span style="color: #ff0000;">A Radio Corporation Singapore (RCS) radio report on a Human Rights Day event at Speakers Corner was re-edited after the first report went on air containing comments by JB Jeyaretnam and a letter by Kofi Annan. Shortly after, a spokesperson for RCS said that the journalist Fauziah Ibrahim had "resigned."</span> <br><br>Dec 2000 : On Dec 31, police arrested and later charged 15 Falungong adherents for conducting a protest without a permit; only 2 of those arrested were Singapore citizens. The 15 persons arrested had participated in an assembly of 60 Falungong members who sought to draw attention to the arrest and killing of Falungong members in China. The group had not sought a permit, asserting that police had not responded to their previous efforts to obtain permits. In March 2001 seven of the group were sentenced to 4 weeks in jail for refusing to hand over placards to the police. <br><br>Jan 2001 : JB Jeyaretnam was declared bankrupt after missing by one day the deadline for a $23,450 payment to eight claimants, members of the organising committee of Tamil Language weekly of 1995. As a bankrupt he is effectively disqualified from elections. <br><br>Feb 2001 : Police called up two activists from the Open Singapore Centre and Think Centre for questioning in connection with the above Human Rights Day event at Speakers Corner. In a strongly worded release, the Singapore Police Force pointed out that "it is one thing to have a group of people gather to hear a person or persons speak; but quite another when people come together for a specific cause, and in the process, they chant slogans, display placards and show gesticulations, such as clenching of fists. Police treat such actions as indicative of a demonstration or of disorderly behaviour." <br><br>Feb 2001 : Police rejected a permit by Think Centre who had wanted to protest outside a Singapore radio station next month to mark World Press Day. <br><br>Feb 2001 : The Public Entertainments and Meetings Act was revised to double the fines for holding a public talk or delivering a political speech without a police permit from $5,000 to $10,000. <br><br>Mar 2001 : The Government named Open Singapore Centre and Think Centre political associations, so making them ineligible to receive foreign funding. "An organisation which is not registered as a political party but carries out activities to influence the domestic political process should logically also be prohibited from accepting donations," the Government said in a statement. <br><br>Apr 2001 : Police summoned political discussion group Roundtable members Kevin Tan and Zulkifli Baharudin for questioning following an event in November to discuss freedom of assembly. Police had wanted to investigate whether the event had provided public entertainment without a license. <br><br>Apr 2001 : Parliament passed a law that allows punishment of foreign news broadcasters deemed to be "engaging in the domestic politics of Singapore." The rules are similar to those placed on the foreign print media in 1986. <br><br>Apr 2001 : <strong>Government officers raided Ngee Ann Polytechnic and confiscated film equipment and tapes after three lecturers had made a documentary about JB Jeyaratnam. The three were told that they could be charged in court if they went ahead with a planned screening of the film at the Singapore International Film Festival. They submitted written apologies for making the film and withdrew it from the Festival. <br></strong><br>July 2001 : JB Jeyaretnam lost his Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) seat in Parliament after he lost a final appeal against a bankruptcy order. He has been subjected to lawsuits, fines and jail throughout his political career and is estimated to have paid more than $1.6 million in damages and costs so far. Three months later, he resigned from the Workers' Party. <br><br>Aug 2001 : Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng warned that Singapore could face the chaos that hit Indonesia after the fall of Suharto if there were too much emphasis on democracy, human rights and press freedom. "We do ourselves a great disservice if we import unthinkingly and wholesale fashionable and hollow abstractions...So do not believe those few Singaporeans who tell you that with democracy, human rights and press freedom a hundred flowers will bloom and Singapore will prosper," said Mr Wong. <br><br>Aug 2001 : Parliament passed new laws to restrict political campaigning on the internet. All political websites are to register with the authorities. Non-party political websites are not allowed to campaign for any party, such as displaying party banners and candidate profiles. Election surveys and exit polls are banned. <br><br><br>Aug 2001 : Sintercom, a popular political discussion website, shut itself down after eight years due to pressure by the Government to register as a political site. <br><br>Aug 2001 : The Singapore Democratic Party called off a planned political rally after a permit from the police came too late. Approval from the police licensing division had come only four days before the planned rally. "Approval for political rallies is rare in the strictly-governed city-state where the government has been accused of restricting freedom of speech," reported AFP. <br><br>Oct 2001 : Despite earlier promises to allow overseas voting, Parliament passed a bill to suspend overseas voting for citizens in the coming general elections, citing security concerns due to ongoing US military strikes in Afghanistan. <br><br>Oct 2001 (General Elections) : <strong>Snap elections were called 17 days before polling day - the shortest in Singapore Elections history. Parties were given only 9 days to campaign. Election deposits for each candidate were increased to $13,000, up from $5000 in 1997.</strong> <br><br>A Workers' Party team of candidates were disqualified by the Elections Department from contesting after submitting incomplete forms, resulting in the opposition contesting only two-thirds of the total number of seats, the lowest since 1968. <br><br><strong>Under the New Singapore Shares scheme implemented before polling, Singaporeans were given between $200 and $1,700 worth of shares which could be converted to cash. <br></strong><br>Non-party political websites were prohibited from political campaigning, while exit polls and appeals for funds over the Internet were banned. Restrictions were also imposed on campaigning via mobile text messaging service. Citing terrorist scare, police banned lunchtime rallies at the central business district. <br><br><strong>Dr Chee Soon Juan of the Singapore Democratic Party was labelled a "cheat, congenital liar and political gangster" by Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew. Defamation suits followed, and again it wasn't Lee who got sued. Chee was sued by both PM Goh Chok Tong and SM Lee Kuan Yew for questioning a $17 billion loan to former Indonesian President Suharto in 1997. <br></strong><br>15 men and a woman were arrested for alleged "rioting" after an opposition rally. The police said the arrests occurred after about 200 people had gathered at a roadside and waved flags in support of the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA). The crowd held up traffic and tapped on windows of passing cars, the statement added. <br><br><strong>The US State Department's human rights report on Singapore's electoral system noted that "the PAP completely controlled key positions in and out of government, influenced the press and courts, and limited opposition political activities,"</strong> </span></p>
