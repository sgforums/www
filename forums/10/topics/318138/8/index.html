              <p><br>I agree.    No transparency equals no accountability.   In any country, it is of utmost importance and is necessary for govt to be as transparent as possible.   If there is nothing fishy, there is no need to hide away from being transparent.   </p>

              <p>Yes this is one possible way to gauge whether or not a government is "good" or "bad".</p>
              <p>However, is it still a good government if it's truly transparent but it fails the nation in terms of not bringing peace and prosperity for example. Further, how can we tell if a government is genuinely transparent. Forgive me but when politicians speak, half of what they say is puffery.</p>

              <p>i dunid the govt to be truly transparent in order for me to trust them.. i only need a govt to TRY to be as transparent as possible..(of coz 'try' here doesn't mean wayang wayang kind of 'try' la..) no govt can guarantee u 100% transparency.. but no govt should be HIDING things from u mah..</p>
              <p>if a govt fails the nation by not bringing peace and prosperity, u oso cant judge it as good or bad govt, maybe bad becoz it failed, but maybe good because it tried..</p>
              <p>i think if the govt is trying, the ppl should be able to see it la.. but if the govt is misleading the ppl with false info or hiding info, and actually be blatant about it.. den something's not right..</p>

              <p>What do you mean by try to be as transparent as possible ?! or you don't need the govt to be truly transparent ?! Even by your own standards you are being vague, what more an entire nation of different people casting their votes (if at all) dues to different reasons/standards.</p>
              <p>A government "may be good because ti tried". What is the government there for ?</p>

              <p>Some say the govt are paid highly to look for solutions. Then are we going to sit, go hungry or bankrupt and wait till the next election to vote them out when they cannot solve them?</p>
              <p>I refuse to believe sporeans are a kiasu and apathetic lot. In these bad times, we can show our heart to our neighbours by skimping meals to donate that dollar to them. I refuse to believe that all intelligent sporeans are already in the civil service.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Consumption can be curbed not by indiscriminately increasing the prices on a blanket basis that hurts the essential services that need petrol or industrial oil, which in turn affect the overall Cost of Living.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Electronic Road Pricing can be fine tuned to discourage the intensive use of saloon cars, and solve your concerns of petrol consumption for leisure - while commercial goods vehicles can be priced lower that do not affect transportation cost normally passed to consumer through product pricing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The selective use of Road Pricing is to be differntiated with the arbitrary and indiscriminate pricing currently implemented, which result in the ERP system being a Revenue Generating  Mechanism for the Government.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With or without local consumer demand, World Petroleum Prices will continue to spiral upwards, as the supply of petrol is finite, and is a depleting resource - which is manipulated as a speculative commodity by Oil Companies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why should Governments continue to use an inflexible tax system to moderate consumption, when there are more effective means that focus on specifics without producing negative effects generally to the Cost of Living ?.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is quite obvious that in your delusion you have seen the Alternative Political Parties as not listening to the views of Singaporeans, when it has always been the MIW Team that always dismissed the Singaporean views by pushing their own MIW Agenda.</span> </p>

              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Good grief !!! By this time, anyone who has followed this thread will know that you are psycholtic, mixing the position of an ordinary Singaporean to be that of the Alternative Political Party - will you be specific as to which Opposition Party is set in your mind ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If we were to extend your argument that a teacher cannot run a Ministry of Defense, what was Rear-Admiral Liu doing as the Acting Minister of Education after being discharged from the Navy ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did Minister Tharman peform badly as the previous Minister of Education, when he had graduated in Economics only ? Should we entrust him with the Ministry of Finance when he is purely an economist by training ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">From your assumptions made in your reply - are Singaporeans not being taken as suckers by LKY's MIW Team in paying Million Dollar wages for these untrained and miss-matched talents to run ministries on a trial and error basis, and at great risks that another few generations have to bear the consequences of their decisions ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is Minister Khaw doing in the Health Ministry when he is not a Doctor ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If we were to take your argument further - it probably explains for the stupidity of LKY and his recruited talents comprising of the best lawyers, engineers, accountants having to decide on the feasibility of an MRT system for Singapore in the 70's.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It seems all the talents recruited by LKY were hopelessly lost and were not in any position to accept the vision of the late President Ong Teng Cheong,- who was an Urban Planning Architect and had recommended the necessity of a modern subway system to serve an extensive urban city with a high concentration of people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It explains the action of LKY's cabinet in deciding to employ three groups of experts at being transportation consultants to advise if Singapore should have the MRT</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The first team concluded that the existing bus system can be further improved, while the second team gave a recommendation that the MRT line should be built throughout the island; and the third gave a brilliant report that both the bus system should be further developed in conjunction with the implementation of the MRT System. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This exercise in idiocy took over three years and cost Singapore a sum of US$22,000,000 {??} - with more unknown sums paid for several extensive study trips made by different teams of ministers, ministers-of-state, permanent secretaries, LTA officials travelling to all the major cities on different continents and island nations - adding further millions of dollars to the cost of the MRT Project.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was it not obvious to the MIW Team that every major city that aspire to be a modern and efficient megapolis will need a modern transportation system to serve a growing concentration of an urban population, and that the surface road-bound vehicular traffic cannot be sustained ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Returning to our own discussion, why will you need the assistance of professional and academics to be in any position to have <strong>a simple debate</strong> on the mechanics of government tax manipulation affecting the supply and demand in affecting the Cost of Living ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For this current topic on petroleum charges - if you simply do not have any further points to make, at least have the decency of making a ''Point_blank'' honest admisiion to the fact.</span></p>

              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Were you not supposed to be away for ''a while'' or has your ego been addicted to posting in this Speakers' Corner that you simply cannot walk away for a ''little while longer'' ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For one who is suppose to show conciliatory signs, your signature mark seems to be one that challenged others for a reply more then conciliation - is this your way of being ''Point_blank'' in your action ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">''Blanks in the points'' that you intend to make ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did my brilliance blinded you, or were you blinded by your own presumptious ignorance and self-deceiving nature - in which your effort at false conciliation fell through your inability to hold the bottom of your own points made in the previous post ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How has your reading ability resulted in seeing me admitting to anything in my previous post, or have you again make some false presumptions that deceived yourself into a wrong conclusion ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It does not take too much brilliance for any fool to come to wrong conclusions, especially when one is so hopeless understanding the meaning of clearly intended sentences.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why will you maligned the Alternative Parties, when it is my own views and ideas that has no association with any Political Parties - either from the MIW or its challengers ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This clearly shows your vain obssession in believe that you are single handedly battling with the entire Oppositon Force. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Good luck to the MIW Team with defenders like you reinforcing their points with blanks like you. .</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did you not give a comment that by reducing petrol taxes it will result in cheaper fuel prices, which will lead to more fuel consumption ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did you relate my reply - that you have dutifully extracted - with the comments thatt you had initially posted ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you not the person who ''do not seem to read anyone else's words, except your own'' ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It seems that it is YOU who should re-read your post again and relate to what has been given in my reply that you are now objecting.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For one who make a statement that differs from my position, it is amazing that you believe that you have not challenge my assumptions. Are you deluded ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Should we give any further credence to your effort in deriding the Alternative Parties at each turn of your desparate position ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is quite obvious that in your delusion you have seen the Alternative Political Parties as not listening to the views of Singaporeans, when it has always been the MIW Team that has listened but prefer to dismiss the Singaporean views by pushing their own MIW Agenda.</span> </p>
              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Good grief !!! By this time, anyone who has followed this thread will know that you are psycholtic, mixing the position of an ordinary Singaporean to be that of the Alternative Political Party - will you be specific as to which Opposition Party is set in your mind ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If we were to extend your argument that a teacher cannot run a Ministry of Defense, what was Rear-Admiral Liu doing as the Acting Minister of Education are being discharged from the Navy ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did Minister Tharman peform badly as the previous Minister of Education, when he had graduated in Economics only ? Should we entrust him with the Ministry of Finance when he is purely an economist by training ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">From your assumptions made in your reply - are Singaporeans not being taken as suckers by LKY's MIW Team in paying Million Dollar wages for these untrained and miss-matched talents to run ministries on a trial and error basis, and at great risks that another few generations have to bear the consequences of their decisions ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is Minister Khaw doing in the Health Ministry when he is not a Doctor ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If we were to take your argument further - it probably explains for the stupidity of LKY and his recruited talents comprising of the best lawyers, engineers, accountants having to decide on the feasibility of an MRT system for Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It seems all the talents recruited by LKY were hopelessly lost and were not in any position to accept the vision of the late President Ong Teng Cheong,- who was an Urban Planning Architect and had recommended the necessity of a modern subway system to serve an extensive urban city with a high concentration of people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It explains the action of LKY's cabinet in deciding to employ three groups of professionals transportation consultants to advise if Singapore should have the MRT</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The first team concluded that the existing bus system can be further improved, while the second team gave a recommendation that the MRT line should be built in several stages throughout the island; and the third gave a brilliant report that both the bus system should be further developed in conjunction with the implementation of the MRT System.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This exercise in idiocy took over three years and cost Singapore a sum of US$22,000,000 - with more unknown sums paid for several separate extensive study trips made by different teams of ministers, minister-of-state, permanent secretaries, LTA officials travelling to all the major cities on different continents and island nations - adding further millions of dollars to the cost of construction.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Was it not obvious to the MIW Team that every major city that aspire to be a modern and efficient megapolis will need a modern transportation system to serve a growing concentration of an urban population ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Returning to our own discussion, why will you need the assistance of professional and academics to be in any position to have <strong>a simple debate</strong> on the mechanics of government tax manipulation affecting the supply and demand in affecting the Cost of Living ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For this current topic on petroleum charges - if you simply do not have any further points to make, at least have the decency of making a ''Point_blank'' honest admisiion to the fact.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Should we be amaze that you have arrived at this agitated state of mind by now ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It clearly shows your inability to hold your own position, when you have nothing to stand on except for your ''Point_blank'' opinions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If at all, you seem to be the one that has been proven repeatedly to be a fool defending an indefensible positon.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With you sinking into a tirade of personal name calling, it clearly show the pent up frustrattions arising from your agitated situation.</span></p>

                              <p>First off, political opposition figures have my deepest respects
              that they have the desire to serve the People and do have the
              People's interest at heart, at a time when many citizens would
              rather aspire for financial wealth than have their name banded
              about in public view.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But they must also have the quality to lead the People, to give
              them a better life, for desire alone is not enough. Only the best
              should aspire towards the highest honour of our state - Leader.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, do take stock of oneself first before even making
              that attempt to lead others. People can understand that there is no
              perfection, but at least there must be less mistakes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To perform based on lesser mistakes would be to gain experience.
              Visit other parts of the world and learn as much as possible, gain
              as much as possible, on effective solutions to help our People.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Politics is a dirty game and no party who had ruled will just
              simply handover power to the next without a fight to the bitter
              end. 'Know the enemy, know yourself, a thousand battles fought, a
              thousand won'. - Sun Tzi.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, don't go banging your head against the wall anymore
              and get sued for libel. Work on viable solutions that can solve the
              everyday dilemas faced by citizens. Other parties will copy and do
              the same.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The thing is, with the current financial turmoil and rise in
              daily costs, where some blame are unjustly thrown on our current
              leaders,  there is a window for the opposition to get elected
              - not by 'civil disobedience', but cool calculated intelligent
              reasoning with the masses. What the ruling party can do, the
              opposition can do too, with at least a chance for 'check and
              balance' within parliament.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do not oppose for the sake of opposition, but work only and
              solely for the good of the People and gain respect even with the
              ruling party.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if the opposition parties continues to whine and harp on
              'unfair treatment', protest marches and freedom of speech - these
              isn't going to get my vote and others as well. We want solutions to
              daily issues and issues pertaining to the safety of our next
              generations!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If opposition can't come up with solutions, let alone form a
              team for government, then they better disband and vote for the
              ruling party instead, and let Singapore be a one party state.</p>
