              <p>At last, something new!</p>
              <p>Only thing is, you brought out the problems. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Now, where are the solutions?</span></strong> example:-</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Can you cope with solutions that have been offered before and w</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">ill you advocate a lowering of the cost of living for Singaporeans - by having a reduction in the high petroleum tax, which is no longer valid to control the car population size when COE limit the number of cars available to Singaporeans ?"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Is one of your solution to lower cost of living is to reduce petroleum tax</span></strong>? Which in reality lead to more petrol consumption as it becomes cheaper, driving prices up eventually and something which governments around the world are trying to curb consumption and reliance on it?</span></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You seem to be hasty and incomplete in the things that you do, and jump to conclusions too quickly. You should learn to be more circumspect in so quickly expressing your thoughts.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did you find the solutions finally after reading and extracting one paragraph from my posts ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For a little while you confirmed my suspicion that you are blind, and choose to see only what you wish to see.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you certain that petrol prices will ever become cheaper ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Consumption can be curbed not by indiscriminately increasing the prices on a blanket basis that hurts the essential services that need petrol or industrial oil, which in turn affect the overall Cost of Living.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Electronic Road Pricing can be fine tuned to discourage the intensive use of saloon cars, and solve your concerns of petrol consumption for leisure - while commercial goods vehicles can be priced lower that do not affect transportation cost normally passed to consumer through product pricing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The selective use of Road Pricing is to be differntiated with the arbitrary and indiscriminate pricing currently implemented, which result in the ERP system being a Revenue Generating  Mechanism for the Government.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With or without local consumer demand, World Petroleum Prices will continue to spiral upwards, as the supply of petrol is finite, and is a depleting resource - which is manipulated as a speculative commodity by Oil Companies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why should Governments continue to use an inflexible tax system to moderate consumption, when there are more effective means that focus on specifics without producing negative effects generally to the Cost of Living ?.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is only one example. I will not attempt to challenge the validity of your 'alternative solutions'. I only seek that it be a well thought out proposals, challenged by acadamics and proffesionals,  before submission and not something even an Ah Beng can pluck from the air.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How would you even know if any solution are well thought out proposals, if you do not make any effort to even understand the structure of the proposal ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is always easy to opt out and allow the academics and / or professionals to exercise thinking - what happened to your own intellectual faculties ?</span></p>

              <p>Nor will  I attempt to play expert to comment on your 'alternative solutions'. Or even teach you what to do with such proposals when fine tuned if it can truly help the country. But one thing i will have to say is that you will not get fine tuning here in Speakers Corner. You must be nuts to think so.

              <p>There is a responsibility to society attached to opposition political parties. My question to you is:-</p>
              <p>a. Would you, assuming you are an opposition political party member, tossed a perfectly good solution peer reviewed by proffessionals, into the gutter if you will not get credit for it?</p>
              <p>Or will you instead swallow such pride, un-politicised your proposals and submit for consideration, for the greater good of society, more so in these current pressing times, in the belief that should one day you gained power, there definitely would be problems that you can use to shine your party?</p>
              <p>b. If your solutions are rejected by the administrators, will you whine and cry foul play, if such solutions had been passed through the grind mill and found wanting?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You got to make up your mind which is more important - your ''responsibility to society'' or to personal vanity. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why should you even care if your good solution is plagiarised by any thick skinned shameless academics - if it benefits society at large ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has this not been the position of CSJ in publicising his thoughts and solutions that he believe are good alternatives in his book ''Dare to Change'' ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The MIW dismissed his writings as ''western liberal thinking'' when it was released to the public in the 1990s; yet some of the policy changes in the Year 2002 were parallel ideas resembling CSJ's solutions published ten years earlier.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">During the preceding ten years that CSJ's proposal was dismissed, at least one generation of Singaporeans have to endure the selfish insanity of the MIW Government in office between 1992 and 2002.</span></p>

              <p>1. Aren't you contridicting yourself? If the opposition members 'who has never even seen the company', how would know there are mistakes in the first place?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. If they deem what they 'allege' are mistakes, then what are their solutions? Even a 10 year old child can shout out alleged wrongs. But then being kids they may not be able to rectify. But the opposition parties are not 10yr olds...or are they?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So kiddo, I have heard all kinds of allegations the opposition parties make, but are they substantiated? Do they have any solid evidences to prove malpractices?</p>
              <p>You claim i shoot blanks. I say you shoot wildly. If the opposition parties continues to live in delusions and not start working on credible solutions to solve the daily issues of the comman person, then their demise and relevance to the People will end soon.</p>
              <p>I ask again: they have made many claims of wrong doings - now where are the evidences and solutions? Can you answer me, <a rel="nofollow" href="/users/193706">maurizio13</a>?

              <p>Our electricity rate is grossly overpriced when compared to a comparable country like Australia (in terms of GDP per capita).</p>
              <p>Electricity rate is charged in Australia (ActewAGL) at 12.10 cents (Australian Dollars), when converted gives a Singapore Dollar rate of <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">15.13 cents.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>(AUD 1 = SGD 1.25)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore Power charges electricity rates <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">23.88 cents.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The difference between Singaporean electricity and Australian is 8.75 cents, a pecentage difference of 58% when compared to Australian electricity.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Well I guess so long as Singaporeans are lapping it up, then it's not a big issue.</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>P4P confirm overcharges us for everything, because they are profit motivated, they are a business organisation rather a government for the people.</p>
              <p>The opposition has yet to take over the reins, so it is still a question mark. An unknown.</p>
