              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Singapore. A prison state.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Singaporeans are in truth prisoners in their own country. The Chief Superintendent of this prison is Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, with his son, the Prime Minister together with his other ministers being senior prison wardens.<br><br>This
              category includes the High Court judges, senior civil servants,
              teachers and other senior government officials. The normal Joe Bloke is
              just a prisoner. The only difference between the regular prison and the
              Republic of Singapore is the fact that you cannot escape from a normal
              prison. You can from Singapore if you want. And that is exactly what
              many do by emigrating to reside permanently in other countries. Many
              are unable to escape because they either lack the skills that other
              countries need or because they are unwilling to accept the rigors
              inherent in moving.<br><br>I was just looking at the index of country democracy listings on <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Wikipedia</span>. Please click on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index</a> . You will see that Singapore is one step below Albania! It is 84<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">th</span> down on the list with Albania and Bolivia more democratic and
              Madagascar and Lebanon less democratic than Singapore. Despite Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, the strongman or the Chief Prison Warden, claiming Singapore to be
              first world country, it is truly much worse than the worst third world
              countries in the world, in spite of the skyscrapers at Raffles Place!<br><br>In
              a normal prison, prisoners cannot complain, since even if you did, it
              is not going to make a whole world of difference. Furthermore all
              reading material in prisons are monitored and censored. Exactly the
              same in Singapore. All newspapers and media are owned by Singapore
              Press Holdings which is fully owned and operated by Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and his government. Singaporeans have no access to independent
              news. They can purchase foreign newspapers but they usually do not
              cover domestic issues. You are left with government censored
              information, just as the prisoner in San Quentin, California serving a
              life sentence, is left with censored mail.<br><br>Most people in
              Singapore have jobs. In a normal prison, the prisoners are given jobs
              in the prison laundry, the prison bakery and other work that prisoners
              can do. This the prison administration ensures. But prisoners in a
              prison are unable to bargain for higher wages. Prisons do not have
              workers unions. A prisoner has no choice but to accept the work and the
              meager pay that is dished out. No difference at all for Singaporeans.
              Singaporeans have to work to feed their families. But just as the
              prisoners in San Quentin Penitentiary, they cannot negotiate their
              wages. On the surface, there are such things as unions in Singapore but
              they exist in name only. In fact the workers unions in Singapore
              represent the employers and the Singapore government; not the workers.
              Singaporean workers, just as any other normal prisoners, are powerless
              and unrepresented.<br><br>Prisons do not permit prisoners to exercise
              fundamental rights such as free speech and expression and the right to
              free assembly. If you protest or start making speeches that the prison
              wardens in San Quentin do not want to hear, you will probably be sent
              to solitary confinement and beaten up. Just like San Quentin, Singapore
              too does not permit the right to free speech and assembly. If you did
              you will be charged in court and a Singapore judge will fine you. If
              you do not pay, you will end up in prison. In fact this punishing
              activity is now happening as we speak. Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> Soon Juan of the Singapore Democratic Party has recently, once again
              been convicted for making a public speech. He will be sentenced on May
              30, 2008 by Judge <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Jusvinder</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kaur</span> of the Subordinate Courts. He will be sent off to jail again.<br><br>In
              prison, if you criticize the chief warden, you will be meted out
              additional punishment which usually is solitary confinement. In
              Singapore if you criticize Mr. Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, you will be sued for defamation of character and a judge will order you to pay Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew one million Singapore dollars and not being able to pay, you will
              be bankrupted. Which means you will have no money to feed yourself and
              neither will your family. You will starve.<br><br>As a prisoner in a
              normal prison, you will not be able to complain on how much the wardens
              receive in wages. If you did, you will be punished and you will be
              thrown into solitary. In Singapore just as if you were a prisoner in
              San Quentin, you are disallowed from complaining that Mr. Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew pays himself $3.7 million a year, a bribe and corruption, which is
              a fact. If you criticized, you will be again sued and another one
              million dollars will be awarded against you, and failing to pay, you
              will be bankrupted multiple times. How one bankruptcy as opposed to
              multiple bankruptcies are different I am unable to tell. In any case,
              even if Hinduism were true and you will in fact be born again, it is
              unlikely that you will ever be able to pay Mr. Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew these several millions.<br><br>In
              prison, wherever you go, you are watched. There are monitors and
              cameras all over the prison looking out at every action of yours. No
              difference in Singapore. Intelligence officers are all over the place
              keeping a lookout at whatever you do and keeping record of each
              movement. If you criticize, your ability to earn a living is
              immediately terminated.<br><br>In prison, it is best to keep a low
              profile. The less you are seen, it is better. Being an extrovert is not
              a good practice in prison. The best way to live in prison is to be
              friendly to everybody and do your work well. This will mean the
              prisoner receiving a certificate of good conduct and the jail time
              reduced for good behavior. Same in the Republic of Singapore. It is not
              a good idea to be conspicuous. A nail that is sticking out will be
              hammered in, is the correct aphorism. That is why you see most
              Singaporeans have nothing much to say about anything. They do their
              work and go home, unobtrusive and unnoticed. Just like the prisoner in
              San Quentin who just wants to be left alone.<br><br>In one sense,
              Singaporeans are even worse off than any normal prisoner. In a normal
              prison, the prison wardens are not permitted to keep all the profits
              from the wok done by their prisoners. In Singapore Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and his friends keep all the profits for themselves. And if any
              Singaporean complains, he will sue you and make you a bankrupt the next
              minute.<br><br><br>With more and more people demanding their normal
              humanity and refusing to live like prisoners, Singapore is suffering
              from a brain drain. As a result Singapore Airlines and other major
              companies are finding it increasingly difficult to operate efficiently.
              Worrying about his own future, Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_13" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew has gone to other normal countries such as Australia trying to
              persuade Singaporeans to return to the prison island of Singapore.
              Obviously they are refusing to come back. It should be no surprise to
              anyone. Why should they return to Singapore, a prison, when they have
              successfully managed to escape?<br><br><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_14" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gopalan</span> Nair</p>

              <p>I don't wish to engage your irrelevant points simply because it is a waste of time to have to prove you wrong but yet you adamantly insist you are right in your delusions. Thus i would let others read your trash and let them form their own opinions.</p>

              <p>Once again, last time, I ask:- WHEN will you and those you defend START working on solutions to solve the daily issues for the People instead of giving more excuses?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Again you ask the obvious, but have shown no ability to take up your own challenge when offered the responses - which you prefer to dismiss so quickly.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you certain of handling your own ''Point_blank'' honesty that is returned to you ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">CSJ had written quite a few books in the late 80's and through the 90's - one of which offered many alternative solutions that addressed the economic, political and education policies that he had claimed will threatened Singaporean's ability to compete in the modern globalised world. This was already written in the late 80's and with people like you in the MIW Team, it is not amazing that CSJ's writings were dismissed so quickly, and with parts of it adopted in the MIW plans during 2002 restructuring plans.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you are honest in your efforts at being ''Point_blank'' honest, can you handle the truth about politics in Singapore, or are you merely paying lip service while actually preferring to offer ''Points_that_are_blank'' - peferably for ''blank minds'' ?</span></p>

Hobbes propagated that man has to be brought under a system of laws, who otherwise would lead a singularized life driven by an egotistical psychology that renders life "nasty, brutish and short, a constant war of every man with every man." Thus, Hobbesians view the first principle of human behavior as egoism of which forms the root of all social conflict only to be avoided if man surrenders power to an absolute sovereign and freedom being relegated to the spheres not covered by laws.</span></span></p>

Therefore, should Singaporeans feel that they are unjustly manipulated, criminalized, and imprisoned; it is within their very own power by virtue of their sacred votes to remove the government of the day and set a new order that aligns to their values and functions according to their wishes. The scope of government power (or otherwise, personal liberty) is in actual fact a definition ascribed by Singaporeans themselves. It is solely the prerogative of the voters to decide and choose the form of government they want; whether a servant government or a master government; one that serves the people or one that rules the people. However, if political naïveté and immaturity is an incremental comfort, for the majority at least, then ‘the majority wins whilst the minority rules’ is to be perpetuated even if that gnaws at the heart of the minority – it has to be respected albeit distastefully.</span></span><span style="color: black;"></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you denying the fact that with each election, the electoral boundary has always shifted - seemingly for the reason that demographics have changed - that will have diluted or evaporated constituencies that are heavily supportive of the Alternative Parties ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you denying that the GRCs has been designed to make it impossible for any person to win on a one-to-one competition ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you denying that for a population that is smaller then New York State, the number of electoral seats are made to overwhelm the resources of the Alternative Parties, which are already weakened by the prevailing political rules that discourages active personal or material or financial support to the Alternative Parties ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You have already been exposed for your glorious efforts at propagating lies and half-truths to innocent minds such as the SgForummer by the nick 'webben' - and you should concentrate in redeeming yourself instead of embarking on useless adventure.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you not heard the many solutions that have been offered by so many in this Speaker's Corner ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Where have you been, or were you stuck at some intersection staring at some blank points to gain your inspiration to be 'Point_blank' ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Similarly, this Government should decide in favor of either the ERP to be used as the single and total traffic management system, or rid Singaporeans from the burdensome Import and Road Tax system to manage traffic - as presently, Singaporeans are burdened with a multiple layer of government traffic management charges that resulted in the present high cost of living made worst by global events.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will you advocate that this Government stop handing out the billion dollar refunds from Annual Budget Surplus, and to use the Billion Dollar annual payout for a National Health Insurance Plan for all Singaporeans ? Or are you doubtful that the talent of the government cannot prevent the Public Hospitals from being dishonest to cheat the insurance scheme with overcharged services ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can this government be more transparent in its costings for the hospital and medical care billings, when the strong Singapore Dollar still cannot allow the Singapore medical services to provide cheap health care cost to everyone except those in the Upper Income Group ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will this Government consider the restructuring of land pricing to help make housing more affordable to the next generation ? At the rate tthat this Government is manipulating the market prices of land for sale, it will only continue to increase the artificially high value of land for private and public housing, as well as for industrial and commercial developments - all of which increases the Cost of Living to higher levels.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can you honestly cope with these challenging alternative solutions, or are you only capable of achieving your infamous 'Point_blank' solutions of outright dismissal of such alternative solutions ?</span></p>

There are intricacies in different companies, yet you expect the opposition who has never been to this company's admin office to provide solutions. Aren't you jumping the gun, putting the carriage ahead of the horse.</p>
              <p>If you haven't been inside this company, don't know the departmental functions unique to this company, but you know this company is making a loss. Do you know where the trouble with this company lies? Do you know which department to tighten and which department to expand to bring in more profits? I tell you who to blame, the CEO in charge of running this company, for he is directly responsible for all the hiccups.</p>

              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">It seems that the huge amount of my words is in contrast to the little amount that showed your closed minded position - without anyone having the benefit of knowing how you arrive at your preferred ''Point_blank'' position.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You could start by taking the easiest or simplest of my seeming diatribe and ranting to give your ''Point_blank'' honest reply - if you are capable of achieving it ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you not interpreting the expertise of the Ruling Party in tugging at the heartstrings of Singaporeans - when they cannot or refuse to respond to the political or economic events that affect Singaporeans ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You must be in a constant state of denial, or prefer to turn a blind eye in reading the specifics in my reply to each and every one of your points, which if they are not already blank would have received a stronger counter post from you.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Unfortunately, your ''Point_blank'' approach remain ''pointless and blank''.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In a country where the Laws are interpreted differently for the governed and the government, can anyone survive in a Political Court that is more interested in upholding the interest of the Government ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even when the Privy Council was chosen to be an overseer of the standards of the implementation of the Laws by the Singapore Judiciary, it was made an irrelevant subject overnight when it pronounced a decision that was not in favor of LKY's government.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Under such a political environment, can anyone survive the Judicial Processes that is ''tightly managed'' by the Ruling Political Party ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What justice do you have to pursue when you have resorted to denial of facts, and prefer to indulge in half-truths and complete falsehood ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What more can anyone expect from one who prefer to indulge in lies and falsehood - like the shark in the water - and you will sully the good creation of the duck and its feather ?</span> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore is already a living nightmare for the Middle-income group, and paradise only for those who allow themselves their Million Dollar Wages without any consultation of the Citizens in any Referendum - and those FT earning their million dollar wages with low tax incentives.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you not heard the many solutions that have been offered by so many in this Speaker's Corner ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Where have you been, or were you stuck at some intersection staring at some blank points to gain your inspiration to be 'Point_blank' ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can you cope with solutions that have been offered before and w</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">ill you advocate a lowering of the cost of living for Singaporeans - by having a reduction in the high petroleum tax, which is no longer valid to control the car population size when COE limit the number of cars available to Singaporeans ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Similarly, this Government should decide in favor of either the ERP to be used as the single and total traffic management system, or rid Singaporeans from the burdensome Import and Road Tax system to manage traffic - as presently, Singaporeans are burdened with a multiple layer of government traffic management charges that resulted in the present high cost of living made worst by global events.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will you advocate that this Government stop handing out the billion dollar refunds from Annual Budget Surplus, and to use the Billion Dollar annual payout for a National Health Insurance Plan for all Singaporeans ? Or are you doubtful that the talent of the government cannot prevent the Public Hospitals from being dishonest to cheat the insurance scheme with overcharged services ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can this government be more transparent in its costings for the hospital and medical care billings, when the strong Singapore Dollar still cannot allow the Singapore medical services to provide cheap health care cost to everyone except those in the Upper Income Group ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will this Government consider the restructuring of land pricing to help make housing more affordable to the next generation ? At the rate tthat this Government is manipulating the market prices of land for sale, it will only continue to increase the artificially high value of land for private and public housing, as well as for industrial and commercial developments - all of which increases the Cost of Living to higher levels.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can you honestly cope with these challenging alternative solutions, or are you only capable of achieving your infamous 'Point_blank' solutions of outright dismissal of such alternative solutions ?</span></p>

              <p>At last, something new!</p>
              <p>Only thing is, you brought out the problems. Now, where are the solutions? example:-</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Can you cope with solutions that have been offered before and w</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">ill you advocate a lowering of the cost of living for Singaporeans - by having a reduction in the high petroleum tax, which is no longer valid to control the car population size when COE limit the number of cars available to Singaporeans ?"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Is one of your solution to lower cost of living is to reduce petroleum tax? Which in reality lead to more petrol consumption as it becomes cheaper, driving prices up eventually and something which governments around the world are trying to curb consumption and reliance on it?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is only one example. I will not attempt to challenge the validity of your 'alternative solutions'. I only seek that it be a well thought out proposals, challenged by acadamics and proffesionals,  before submission and not something even an Ah Beng can pluck from the air.</span></span></p>
              <p>Nor will  I attempt to play expert to comment on your 'alternative solutions'. Or even teach you what to do with such proposals when fine tuned if it can truly help the country. But one thing i will have to say is that you will not get fine tuning here in Speakers Corner. You must be nuts to think so. Ideas -yes, but fine tuning - definitely not in this annonymous zone where accountability is zero for some.</p>
              <p>There is a responsibility to society attached to opposition political parties. My question to you is:-</p>
              <p>a. Would you, assuming you are an opposition political party member, tossed a perfectly good solution peer reviewed by proffessionals, into the gutter if you will not get credit for it?</p>
              <p>Or will you instead swallow such pride, un-politicised your proposals and submit for consideration, for the greater good of society, more so in these current pressing times, in the belief that should one day you gained power, there definitely would be problems that you can use to shine your party?</p>
              <p>b. If your solutions are rejected by the administrators, will you whine and cry foul play, if such solutions had been passed through the grind mill and found wanting?</p>
              <p>You can continue to insult me. Its ok. All i care are for answers.</p>
              <p>PS. Think about it. I will be off for a long while.</p>
