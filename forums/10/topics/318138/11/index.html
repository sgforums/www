              <p>To respond to both, I took your "if your intention here is not to contribute suggestions but to turn a blind eye and support the pathetic excuses of the clueless opposition parties, then GO ROT IN HELL!" as fair indication that you assumed I supported one party or the other. And boy, ROT IN HELL sure shows the venom in your opinion. Or do you consider those words 'rational'? Didn't think so.</p>
              <p>No, I am of the belief that you are on an ego trip. Nothing venemous about that. I guess we'll have to disagree. Try not to take it personally, because that wasn't the intention.</p>
              <p>I appreciate your effort in your last response. At the end of the day it all comes down to opinion. Do you think an individual's public reputation is of greater value that the truth? Is an individual's public reputation of more value than a truly democratic state? Do you think the populace cannot tell truth from falsehood without taking it to court?</p>
              <p>I ask you, how can a democracy function without defamation suits? Is the Australian system, for example, just an illusion? How are the ministers able to maintain their reputations without going to court? It's not fantasy land, there really is another way.</p>
              <p>"But here is a darkside to democracy, and that is the dirty tactics of smearing a candidate's integrity so that he won't get elected, no matter how good in other areas he is."</p>
              <p>And here is the darksite to libel. Fear of lawsuits stifles debate, both libellous and truthful. You throw the baby out with the bathwater. You risk electing candidates, no matter how bad they are. A candidate's reputation may come at a huge cost to the country. Whether an individual's reputation is of higher value than democracy is a matter of opinion.</p>
              <p>Oh hang on, I almost missed it. "here is a darkside to democracy".. what do you mean? Isn't Singapore a democracy? Democracy causes slurring? So if we stifle the slurring through lawsuits then we're no longer a democracy? Interesting. I'm getting a better idea of your political ideals.</p>
              <p>The last issue of debate is whether the MIWs mudslinging/slurring/criticism is any better or worse, more or less truthful than the mudslinging/slurring/criticism coming the other way. That is completely up to your opinion (and for better or worse, up to the courts).</p>

              <p>I have no problem accepting that statement, except that the 'individual' is a properly elected in a free election by citizens of the nation and more critically - a head of State or high office bearer, the decider of our lives during his term. He represents the People when a decision is made either local or foriegn affairs. His standing is impeccable and of the highest regard in terms of capability and moral standing.</p>
              <p>To slur his character without ANY shred of evidence is nothing more than vile mischief to destroy his moral standing - making him look more like a common thief than a head of state, whom has the authority over us all. Thus, there is a need to bring such malicious defamation cases to the independent judiciary to decide. </p>
              <p>Democracy is more than just a lofty state of opinions. It is for the People to vote for a trusted man to administer the nation. The purpose of democracy is for the function of society, and not just free debate over cups of tea with no conclusions. Would you vote for a man if i told you he was a child molester in his youth? Would it not colour your judgement?</p>

              <p>Then again least you say i shaft my opinions down you throat, that is your opinion of which i will respect. Therefore need i debate and rebut you further, least you claim again i only want discussions my way and do not respond? To do so will only become repetitive with similar points which you and i will not see eye to eye, the way Asswipe Atobe forces others to agree with her/his views which she/he readily admitted several times in past posts.</p>

After being kicked on the leg, he went to complain to OO. The OO later reprimanded the OC for being careless in his treatment of my BMT colleauge. Anyway this is a PES C company in which care must be taken espcially the recruit are having many medical problem. U think this recruit would like to go thru the chain of command already? If OO proceed to go official n complained to CO, this will result in charge of misreatment to the OC already.</p>

              <p><br>I remember last time one of BMT colleuages got kicked in the leg by my OC cause this BMT colleuage of mine is having anxiety disorder n subsequesntly he went to company to take a rest. After being kicked on the leg, he went to complain to OO. The OO later reprimanded the OC for being careless in his treatment of my BMT colleauge. Anyway this is a PES C company in which care must be taken espcially the recruit are having many medical problem. U think this recruit would like to go thru the chain of command already? If OO proceed to go official n complained to CO, this will result in charge of misreatment to the OC already.</p>

              <p><br>U need to b specific on the problem faced by SAF servicemen on the chain of command or the problem faced by ordinary workers which resulted in complaint to Manpower ministry. BMT is right to make men out of boys but if the training goes too far resulting in bullying, then I think it is better to call the SAF hotline straight if the superior seemed to be reluctant in solving the problem.  I wonder if there are no issues, is there a need to maintain SAF hotline?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">"Is an individual's public reputation of more value than a truly democratic state?"</span></p>
              <p>I have no problem accepting that statement, except that the 'individual' is a properly elected in a free election by citizens of the nation and more critically - a head of State or high office bearer, the decider of our lives during his term. He represents the People when a decision is made either local or foriegn affairs. His standing is impeccable and of the highest regard in terms of capability and moral standing.</p>
              <p>To slur his character without ANY shred of evidence is nothing more than vile mischief to destroy his moral standing - making him look more like a common thief than a head of state, whom has the authority over us all. Thus, there is a need to bring such malicious defamation cases to the independent judiciary to decide. </p>
              <p>Democracy is more than just a lofty state of opinions. It is for the People to vote for a trusted man to administer the nation. The purpose of democracy is for the function of society, and not just free debate over cups of tea with no conclusions. Would you vote for a man if i told you he was a child molester in his youth? Would it not colour your judgement?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">"I ask you, how can a democracy function without defamation suits?"</span></p>
              <p>Is this your view or you meant to spell with?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">"Whether an individual's reputation is of higher value than democracy is a matter of opinion."</span></p>
              <p>Then again least you say i shaft my opinions down you throat, that is your opinion of which i will respect. Therefore need i debate and rebut you further, least you claim again i only want discussions my way and do not respond? To do so will only become repetitive with similar points which you and i will not see eye to eye, the way Asswipe Atobe forces others to agree with her/his views which she/he readily admitted several times in past posts.</p>

              <p><br>There is a limit to it you know...even in the US there is a word called libel....the abuse of a person right of free speech.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can say what you want about another person, but he must be held accountable for his words. That person must be able to back up his statement with evidence if he wants to critise a person. Moroever, the person who was critised have the right to sue people as well...bear that in mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once you let go for a libel law, there will be a new political entity known as the media, who can control the most power. Because this will grant the media a chance to lie about any news reports, defame as person to ensure the media corporation profits and interest alone, instead of caring for the population of the country. A media can control the population through their news reports and how the shape the view of the voters...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>THAT is a very scary scenario...you CANNOT let a news media game too much political power...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And to be frank, the opposition party in singapore just sucks, although I will vote for them just because there is a need for a check and balance...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If they are smarter, they can easily outplay the PAP, the opposition parties should not be complaining about things being unfair if they cannot outplay the PAP. Like a war, there is no such thing as fairness in politicis. They need to play smartly...way more smarter than what the current opposition is doing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Life <strong>IS</strong> unfair, so no point in saying the political climate in singapore is unfair...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a opposition party cannot outsmart or outplay the PAP, then how can they be expected to run things better than the PAP?  Like why should people be complaining about their crappy work if they cannot do well in their studies...and keep saying they can do things better than a person who can study better in all areas...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ideally, there should be 3 equally strong party running for elections...because they will ensure a check and balance system is in place, and it can ensure that politics don't become a game of me vs you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A 2 party system in the US and taiwan is really hindering anything constructive being done...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And just a side note, singapore should revamp the system of a consistuency. At times, I want a PAP party RUNNING my consistuency or area, but I want to vote for a opposition party into the parliment and have a voice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The consistuency system should be seperate from the parlimentary elections.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After all, a party that can run a town better may not run a country better, and a party that runs a country better may not run a town better...</p>

              <p>This was what i wrote to webben</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">"To do so will only become repetitive with similar points which you and i will not see eye to eye, the way Asswipe Atobe forces others to agree with her/his views which she/he readily admitted several times in past posts."</span></p>
              <p>And you wrote <span style="color: #993366;">:"how did your clueless self managed to find the clues to conclude that I had ''readily admitted several times in past posts" ?"</span></p>
              <p>And here is the evidence:-</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">If you believe that these are all repetitive, yes - and it bears repeating to counter the constant drumming of the false propaganda that is repeatedly made by dishonest people who prefer to make points that are blank.<br> -24th May 08, 6.39AM</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><span style="color: #000000;">Go on, with your usual word twisting style and wiggle out of it. You wanted no debate, you just plainly want others to accept you lies, half truths and wild allegations. May others be more discerning.</span> </span></p>

              <p>Thanks for the effort in proving my point that you are so clueless in your attempts at making yours ''Points_blank".</p>
              <p>Do I have to make any efforts to twist and wiggle out of your clueless responses ?</p>
              <p>You did write in your post on 27 May 2008 9.47 AM on Page 11 of this thread the following:-</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Then again least you say <strong>i shaft my opinions down you throat,</strong> that is your opinion of which i will respect. Therefore need i debate and rebut you further, least you claim again i only want discussions my way and do not respond? To do so will only become repetitive with similar points which you and i will not see eye to eye,<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">the way Asswipe Atobe forces others to agree with her/his views</span></span> which she/he readily admitted several times in past posts.</strong></p>

              <p>You diligence in digging up my piece written on 24 May 2008 6.39AM on Page 4 of this thread confirm your desparate clueless efforts in defending your useless position, and time again you have voluntarily proven your inability to understand anything that you read except what you want to interprete.</p>
              <p>I was expecting you to confirm with an exact quote to confirm your preferred Asswipe Atobe had said "yes, I will repeatedly force you to accept my opinion".</p>
              <p>How disappointing for me that I have to take a swipe at this foolish clueless ass pretending to be able to be ''Point_blank" .... ''honest'' ?</p>
              <p>More like - honestly ''points_blank'' made each and every time.</p>
              <p>Did you take my piece out of context that was made as a final parting word to your clueless denial and insisting to defend the MIW's position with false information in the manner that you did on Page 4 - will elicited the statement which you have dutifully extracted as :-</p>

              <p><br> U need to b specific on the problem faced by SAF servicemen on the
              chain of command or the problem faced by ordinary workers which
              resulted in complaint to Manpower ministry. BMT is right to make
              men out of boys but if the training goes too far resulting in
              bullying, then I think it is better to call the SAF hotline
              straight if the superior seemed to be reluctant in solving the
              problem.  I wonder if there are no issues, is there a need to
              maintain SAF hotline?</p>
