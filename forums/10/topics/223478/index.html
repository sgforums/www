We have to treat them as the best, we have to treat visitors well too but citizens have to be treated better," Mr Lee said.<br><br>"Right now, PRs enjoy the same subsidies as Singaporeans for education and healthcare, and in fact in healthcare, foreign workers also receive subsidised treatment. I think we should make a clear difference Â– PRs should pay more than Singaporeans but less than other foreigners, there is a distinction.<br><br>"If you are not a PR and not a citizen, you should be given good treatment but we will not give you special privileges."<br><br>For education, Mr Lee said there are plans to charge non-citizens more, but not to set fees so high that foreign students will not come.<br><br>While for healthcare, foreign workers will have to bear the full costs of their medical bills.<br><br>Halimah Yacob, Chairman of the GPC for Health, said that employers of foreign workers should do a proper costing to cover their full healthcare need so that Singaporeans would not end up paying for them. She also hopes that employers will not ignore the needs of these foreign workers.<br><br>"We got feedback from many Singaporeans and even from my own constituents that since everything's equal for Singaporeans, foreigners and PRs, what's so special about being Singaporean? To some extent, short of being nationalistic, PM's message of 'citizens first' is well overdue. It'll be much appreciated among Singaporeans who are wondering what's in it for me holding that red passport," said Zaqy Mohamad, MP of Hong Kah GRC.<br><br>More details about the review will be announced by the respective ministries over the next few months. - CNA/so<br><br>Something heartening FINALLY come out from our GOV.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Hahahaha<br><br>They just make the non-citizens pay more and let citizens pay the same.<br><br>I am not easily swayed by their sweet talk.<br><br>Just like when they initially implement the GST, they gave us $500 tax offset, slowly they take it away, so you won't notice it.<br><br>It's like I feed you poison, then give you antidote, after 1-2 years I don't give you any more antidote, but you are still taking the poison.<br><br>Hehehe</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>#1 should have done that years ago. Then he is admitting Singaporeans had been treated as 3rd class in Singapore after the elites, 'foreign talents' and etc.  Seriously, I think its a bit late to create a "singapore identity", although the kids are being brain washed.<br><br>#2 LHL do not want to offend these people. He will give something better back. To take these things away when its already been given, expect back lash. Foreigners do not give face and they can move back anytime. Besides, he needed 'foreign talents' to take the jobs of Singaporeans because we are not elites and therefore only foreigners and elites are capable.<br><br>#3 Some work permit people medical fees are paid by their employers. It will have backlash in certain industries. Ultimately, it will hit back at Singaporeans. Anyways, medical and education fees had always been rising every quarter - we have been paying more and especially after elections. So I don't know about subsidy but MRT tracks is the best option nowadays.  Never fall ill in Sg.<br><br>#4 All these are still done for his own career and his forthcoming salary increase. He claims to plan and save for the future. That is if the future will include him. What is the "disaster" to use the savings for?  WHEN will there be a time to use the savings? Future is always uncertain and unknow but all I know is that we are always always always saving for some elusive thing. But reading the papers where Termasek, GIC, Singtel and etc are losing money. Giving crap reasons to increase the cost of living. There is not one thing in our basic basket of goods where the price is not jacked up.  Then we are told to expect more rises - but not our salary nor complain about lack of jobs other than in the road sweeper segment even when you hold a MBA.<br><br>I always wonder if we are moving towards a society, a country where I want to stay in... I keep feeling the country is spiraling towards a place where I feel like running away from.<br><br></div>
