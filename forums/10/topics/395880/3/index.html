              <p>If there is no pros to curb the demand of singapore men here, i think a lot of rape, molest, or some JackNeo stuffs will appear more on the news.

              <p>so next time prc pros will also be considered as foreign talents with 'special skills' ar?? Just like our indian and bangala foreign talents in construction industry? Should we open our door bigger to PRC pro? Introduce competition in the industry??? Maybe prostitution service will be CHEAPER, BETTER,FASTER??? But i think skill of the FTs pros must be constantly upgraded to let them finish their job faster..</p>
              <p>PAPPY wil then provide free upgrading course to improve their skills???</p>

              <p><br>There are already group of licenced Pros shops along Joo chiat and geyland lorongs, most are on 2 year work permit, by granting those who had stay here long to PR status will reduce the levy on the employer and also help these pros to change their life and hopefully contribute to our society.</p>
              <p>Question, Who wants to be Pros in the first place?? it is because their own country are poor and the men are those gangster type that they have not much choice but end up being pros, in actual fact, some of them are very intelligent, can upgrade to PhD standard. By giving them a chance to educate and be a normal girl earning a decent living here is a blessing for all of us. Be compassionate and kind.</p>

              <p><br>everything takes 2 hands to clap, if the old singaporean uncles like to flirt around, maybe because of no much life left, there will be supply to cope with their demand, but these will not be a long term issue, as our older less eduacated Uncles phased out, the new ones, who are better educated to see the flaws and the cheating part, they will not patronise these places, leading to no supply.</p>
              <p>However at the moment, the earlier born 50s and 60s peoples are still around, and they simply loves to have the company of PRC gals even they knew that it is a cheating plot.</p>
              <p>It is not that i dun study all these old uncles, i did ask them when they open room with PRC gals, where they come here and waste money and time, why not with their family, they replied me, "Shut up lah! Lim pek paid money you still talk so much for what"</p>

              <p><br>everything takes 2 hands to clap, if the old singaporean uncles like to flirt around, maybe because of no much life left, there will be supply to cope with their demand, but these will not be a long term issue, as our older less eduacated Uncles phased out, the new ones, who are better educated to see the flaws and the cheating part, they will not patronise these places, leading to no supply.</p>
              <p>However at the moment, the earlier born 50s and 60s peoples are still around, and they simply loves to have the company of PRC gals even they knew that it is a cheating plot.</p>
              <p>It is not that i dun study all these old uncles, i did ask them when they open room with PRC gals, where they come here and waste money and time, why not with their family, they replied me, "Shut up lah! Lim pek paid money you still talk so much for what"</p>
