              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>A Seng Kang resident who wished to be known only as Mr Leong said he agreed with the content of the anti-PAP fliers given out to Seng Kang and Marine Parade residents lately.</p>
              <p>The state media reported yesterday that A4-sized fliers were being distributed in Pasir-Ris Punggol and Marine Parade GRCs to residents asking them to “united and take concerted action” against the PAP.</p>
              <p>A police report was made and the Singapore Police Force is now investigating the matter under the Sedition Act using taxpayers’ monies.</p>
              <p>The Temasek Review sent a team down to Compassvale Blocks 244 – 256 where the flyers were reported to be distributed yesterday evening after 6pm:</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/compassvale585.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="350"></p>
              <p>Unfortunately, despite our best efforts including searching the rubbish bins, we were unable to find the flyers.</p>
              <p>We spoke to 20 residents and 18 of them claim they did not receive the flyer at all. Of the two who did, one refused to speak to us. The other only did so after much persuasion and even then declined to have the interview video-taped.</p>
              <p>Mr Leong is a 44 year old Chinese gentleman with a family of two and he has been staying in Seng Kang for 5 years. As he is working in a government-related agency, he is afraid of revealing his identity when speaking to us. The fear of speaking out is deep-seated among Singaporeans thanks to years of repressive PAP rule.</p>
              <p>According to Mr Leong, the flyer was printed in both English and Chinese and he took a quick glance only at the Chinese side. In brief, it was about the PAP’s unfair and discriminatory policies towards native Singaporeans which created the present problems of large number of foreigners, stagnant wages and increased cost of living.</p>
              <p>Mr Leong said he dared not bring the flier home out of fear of being arrested by the police and he threw it away immediately on the spot after reading it.</p>
              <p>Below is what he told us in Chinese about the contents of the flier:</p>
              <p><em>“The language used is quite strong, but there is some truth in it. I am not an opposition supporter and I still feel the PAP has done a relatively good job in the past, but I can’t say the same in the last two years or so. Life is becoming harder for everybody. </em></p>
              <p><em>My pay has not increased. In fact, I took a pay cut last year and my boss still hasn’t restored it. The cost of living has increased in the meantime. Everything is getting more and more expensive. You go to the market and buy vegetables and fishes, you will know.</em></p>
              <p><em> My eldest son is in Secondary Two this year. He told me he feels like a stranger in school. Why? Almost half his class are foreign students, some on MOE scholarships. Why are we paying for the foreigners to study for free here when some Singaporeans are too poor to attend school?</em></p>
              <p><em>My flat’s value has increased, but what’s the use? I cannot sell my flat. If I sell it, where do I stay? And I have no savings or CPF left. Young lady, I presume you are still single? Wait till you start a family then you know how tough life is. Every month I see my money go in and out like magic, my bank account has only a few thousand dollars. Utility bills, S&amp;C charges, transport fees, children’s allowances, how much you think I can save? </em></p>
              <p><em>What can we ordinary people do? You complain they don’t listen, you protest they arrest you, you know our government – they are always right, never make any mistakes, you dare to tell them what to do? Hey, you sure you are not recording my voice?</em></p>
              <p><em>Anyway, my advice to you is – want to marry get a rich man, don’t marry a poor man like me, sure suffer, nowadays it is very tough, you look around my estate so many Indians? I don’t know where they come from. My children will have to compete with these fellows when he graduates in the future. When I first move here, there are only a few of them, now it’s like little India. You see that playground, on the weekends it will be crowded by Indian families, not Singapore Indians, overseas Indians. </em></p>
              <p><em>(Shake head) – Better don’t talk too much, sai1 hei2 (in Cantonese), talk also useless, what to do, they just do anything they like, since when they care about whether the people are dead or alive? (waves and walks away)”</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Readers who have received a copy of this flyer, please scan it and email to us at <a href="mailto:temasekreview@gmail.com"><span style="color: #a91b33;">temasekreview@gmail.com</span></a></p>
              <p>We would like to call on all Singaporeans to stand behind this brave Singaporean who dares to go against the despotic, undemocratic and paranoid regime. In the event that he/she is arrested by the PAP’s police, we will set up a fund to fight the case for him/her in court. Let the whole world knows how dictatorial, repressive and totalitarian the PAP is!</p>

              <p>what makes you think today laksa is not like those old days, i heard many Uncles and Aunties always said today foods taste are worst than last time, your road side foods. But my observation is not the food taste, tho i dunno what last time foods taste like, my senses tell me that most older people lost their tongue taste bud senses, therefore everything they eat now, they feel that it cannot compare with what they tasted during their young time, my goodness, you uncles and aunties tongue are turning black soon and you can still said foodie today are no good?? </p>
