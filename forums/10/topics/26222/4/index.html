            <div class='col-md body'>One of the reasons Singapore still exist is that we have a strong credible SAF....Firstly in terms of military, it ensures our potential agressors will not dare to do anything rash, and think twice. We will *NOT* become another Kuwait.<br><br>Secondly, in terms of investment. Our  defence spending figures to the defence spendings, even in hard times....send a strong signal to investors. It tells them we are committed to the defence of Singapore. Which investor will want to invest in Singapore if he/she feels that the country is not capable in defending itself?<br><br>Our lack of stragetic depth, forces us to utilise technology as a force multiplier. This costs quite a large sum of money to purchase, maintain and sustain.... Deployment overseas for exercises and training also costs quite a sum...We do not have space to train.....all these costs money.<br><br>Our defence spending, indirectly helps us also build up our defence industries. Is always better to reduce our dependance on other countries for our military needs. E.g. In times of conflicts, we can deploy.....without the worry we run out of ammo for our weapons.<br><br>I do not want to see our armed forces like Aussie military, do not have sufficient budget to practise live firing. - Source : Austrilian News  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>There's a old chinese saying...."maintain an army for thousand days....use only for a moment"....Defence spending should be kept the way it is. The current policy had served us well, and I see no reason to change it.<br><br>There's a 3rd sgt who had once said   in the ST forum. "What you cannot defend, does not belong to you"...not 100% sure of the exact words....but I believe in that concept.<br><br>In terms of Economy, what you expecting the goverment to do? Ask the goverment to keep on giving out SG shares....rebates? Might as well ask for free housing, free food, free money while we are it??<br><br>Basically our soceity is based on meritocracy....You work, you get paid...Don't work...no food on your table. Simple as that...We are not like US, the goverment feeds you even if you don't work. What the gov can do is develop the infrastructure, provide incentives...attractive factors...and woo the investors in. The global downturn affects us all...not something the Goverement can just spend like mad, and make the problem disappear.<br><br>Just my two cents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>American society and government not meritocratic? Singapore did not invent meritocracy and does not have a monopoly in it unlike PAP would have you think otherwise. If meritocracy was NOT the backbone of American institutions, they wouldnt have become so strong economically, (or for that matter, of  all of the current developed countries)<br><br>And all the rhetoric concerning economics 101 and the caveat "A little knowledge is dangerous" it would be appropriate to say that this arguement is certainly not based on serious academic economic discussion but rather of a socio-political nature.<br><br>My personal view is that the premise that Singapore will never be able to forge better ties with our neighbours because of political  and cultural differences. Certainly a regional arms race will not aid in the establishment of a greater ASEAN in terms of trade and mutual self-benefit. Probably it is this very fundamental idea that is the hidden white elephant that forces countries into increased defense spending, not the process itself.<br><br>The best solution for compromise between economy and military? Decrease spending on military hardware; pour more money into "middle-tech" research and development and give our professional soldiers across the board wage increases.<br><br>Btw what is $500 million these days?</div>

Call me crazy, but I am a person who believes in war for greater peace. If you put 10 persons together, there will be conflicts in 5 days. If you put 10 countries together, you have a war in 50 years. It is that simple, and it is undeniable. Honestly I think much of the Geneva Convention is bullshit. Take a moment and think. If you are in a war, your natural instinct would be to kill anything that doesn't wear the same uniform as you, by all means possible. Medics and Red Cross personnel are exempt, that I understand due to their medical(and thus, for general humanity) roles, but what? banned napalm? flamethrowers? nah... thats almost naive.<br><br>To fight a war nowadays actually involves the law, and if indeed everyone fights according to the law, UN might as well have a law to ban wars. It will definitely work.</div>

Did the Vietnamese have superior miltary technology? Granted Singapore has no area to defend, no jungles to run in.

            <div class='col-md body'>basically, the I.T. business is probably becoming saturated already, at least will soon start to become saturated as more countries junmp on the IT. bandwagon and say 'Me too!'.<br><br>The gov't is seeing bio-tech develpoment and other aspects of life sciences such as gene manipulation as an area with great potential.  And by turning Singapore into THE bio-tech hub and having many of the top brains in life sciences here, Singapore will hopefully be able to take the lead and stand out as the leader in bio/life science industry.  And I disagree that there is little economic value in life sciences.<br><br>There are countless medicines you can come up with and improve.  Also, new types of food can be developed.  We have to understand that not all types of food which have been modified genetically are for asthetic reasons or reasons to make them more appealing to the public.  Some have been develop to improve health situations in the world, for example the golden rice with beta-carotene in it to help our body create vitamin A.  This golden rice was featured in Reader's Digest not to long ago and is a very good read.<br><br>The method of using a sort of virus to insert the DNA into the rice is a very good idea, since it is much more reliable than the gene gun method.  It is probably discoveries such as these that Singapore hopes for.  Even if it isn't, I am confident that the Singapore government is not so dumb as to invest its money into something it does not think has a high chance of succeeding.<br><br>kenhor commented that we spend alot per capita compared to other countries on defence.  However, i wish to point out that other countries have a lot more capita (or people) than us.  The is this inverted exponential curve graph with the x and y axes being defence spending and population size respectively.<br><br>This means that it actually gets more economical and cost-effective to defend yourself with a large force and have a large country with many people as compared to a small force in a small country with smaller population.   Thus, Singapore's per capita defence spending will always remain among the highest in the world if we hope to maintain the current security we have and the deterrence message we are sending out.<br><br>Lastly, and perhaps related only to a few posts here (read for your own interest):<br>And recently, I have also seen some anti-PAP remarks flying around somewhere.  I only have to say this: Singaporeans confidence still lie in the PAP.  If you are wondering why you are middle age and still have NEVER voted once in your life on which is the right MP for your estate, it is due to the method the opposition parties' use during elections.<br><br>The opposition will always hope to gain some seat in parliament.  However, the confidence of the people lies in the PAP and so far this confidence has not been misplaced.  However, the people also do not want a wholly PAP government.  To ensure that their candidates stand a chance, the opposition must compete in fewer constituencies to so that people in the constituencies the opposition is competing in can be assured that even if they were to vote for the opposition, the PAP is sure to retain its majority and therefore remain in power.<br><br>This way, Singaporeans will end up with a PAP majority gov't with at least a few MPs from other political parties.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>R&amp;D is simply a very risky venture. Sky high returns or liitle/none at all, for projects with great complexity and astronomical outlays. There is no such thing as creating a research industry if you are not at the forefront and reaping the massive payoffs but is making minor improvements on current processes. Not only that, if the product in question has compartively little commerical value ie. improving vit A (!)content at a greater expense (which consumer would buy such a brand of rice? Would you?), it must be assumed that you are at least a decade ahead in technology in front of your competitors to ensure economic dominance in that particular field. by means of patents of the technology itself in question, as eventually other scientists would have come to the same discoveries. The question that comes to mind is what are Singapore's chances of becoming a leader? If taking in mind, your competitors are USA, Australia, Britain, China, then realistically the best one can hope for is second best, unless by some cosmic accident or fate, a potential Nobel prize winner is born in Singapore.<br><br>As a 14 year old, you still have secondary school, junior college, army, and college even before working life. Guns are not toys nor casualities a number in computer games. Not a single soldier in SAF (UN peacekeeper doesnt count, or medical support) has tasted war so don't BS about bravery and patriotism.<br><br>As for the PAP and politics, nowadays even PAP admits it is not simply the material aspect (even that is not a surety) of life that people desire, but other factors as well. Btw, the very nature of democracy; not a one-party country; dictates self-interest of political groups and individuals being paramount to the State appartus itself. Are the people content and happy with PAP as a whole or is the the lack of a viable altenative and the threat of instablity and its possible effect of capsizing a small boat a compelling reason?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"how can this be the best solution when we knew that decrease spending on millitary hardware actually reduces our deterrence value over time.... and effectively place the nation as a whole in a compromise position.... "<br><br>It is a matter of timing as well as anything else. Besides like I said, deterence can be built by other means, rather that the outright purchase of advanced miltary hardware.<br><br>Already Singapore has an innate economic deterrence to your phantom "predators". Does Singapore have natural resources? I only know of one: its natural port and it would take a World War to want that particular advantage as recently proven, other regional ports are starting to compete economically. And in a World War (ie superpower miltaries) boy, where are the civilians going to run?<br><br>The only reason I can think for an invasion of Singapore would be political in nature: simply put, piss somebody off so badly by taking some ill-conceived moves of tactical aggression or the preparation and the appearence of it.</div>

"<br><br>It is people like you whom I find most threatening to myself and my imaginary wife, not some phantom enemy, I brought up the point about a fictious Singaporean not as a historical precedence, but as proof that if a Singaporean if and when committing a crime, I would pursue justice at all cost and not before anybody commited a crime  and not spare him because he is Singaporean. Also, please do not presume to think for me. In your Machievillian world, to ensure that NOBODY in Singapore can rape your wife, you should go into politics and get into a position of power and become good friends with the judicary, so that the rule of fear alone would deter ANY singaporean from raping your wife or even thinking of raping your wife.

In your society too, everybody should own a gun in order for self-protection; the bigger the better.<br><br>"secondly.... the presence of the police force and the judicial system acts as a deterrence against crimes... likewise... a powerful military deters against aggressors from invading us.... surely this is simple logic...."<br><br>This is tied into my post concerning tyranny. The (just and equitable) laws and regulations are enforced and not the reverse in which a tyrant creats laws and regulations that justify the use of force against his enemies.<br><br>" does it matter? when bullet come... i would like the opportunity to return the fire then debate about clauzwiz and wat nought political disagreement the warring nations may have."<br><br>When bullet come, I would first seek cover first before even thinking of returning fire. This isnt a debate and I have used the adjective as a prelude to one. It is a description; if I have to explain this then it would be meaningless to discuss anything further.</div>
