            <div class='col-md body'>I just dun get this. Singapore buys what it needs for defence, but the cap remains at 3% of GDP. So? No big deal, because the money is spent on things that are needed. The sum largely remains similar because things have to be replaced, facilities upgraded. It is already quite amazing how the Government manages to keep the sum under a certain limit given our current capability, but that does not mean for the next 10 years we dun have to buy anything for the military. What you are suggesting is putting the money into the economy, which just doesn't make sense. The money for the military has been calculated and appropriated already, it has no connection at all to our economy. I dun understand why FTs and terrorism is brought into the topic. FTs dun affect the distribution of the money, so lets leave that out. Terrorism. Terrorism cannot be countered by military means at best. It is the role of the ISD and Police to subdue terrorism within our shores.</div>

Do a search in the internet .. we can see that the spending for our defense was 6% in the 70s, 80s and 90s. Now in 2000, its at 4.5% .. so way over your figure of 3%<br><br>While we see our neighbours spending &lt; 2%. Even if our cap was 3%, how come our neighbours spend less than 2%?<br><br>And for your information, their budget also goes to maintaining things that are needing replacement etc. Then also, our spending was so high in the past .. so how come we still have to buy so much today .. for 20+ years, we spend more than the neighbours. And we still are .. so we still will be for the next 10.. how come .. not enough to defend ourselves?<br><br>Mind you .. that means that since 1965, (37 years) we have been spending more than malaysia and add on 10 more years (close to 50 years) and we still think it not enough? 50 years of having a military budget higher than malaysia and its not enough? That is sick.<br><br>The reason I bring all the FT and Economy into the picture is that I want to show you that the economy and society needs more help presently than our military. I want an improvement in our education. I want lower transport costs. I want better healthcare. I want better local sports performance. I want lower HDB costs. etc. I don't want another submarine or another squardron of F16.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After looking at the discussion going on, I hope to give my two cents worth of opinion.<br><br>I agreed that military spending must be kept in check but this does not mean that we should reduce our military spending but rather put it at a cap to a percentage of our GDP if it is not already been done so. We should look at the efficiency of the SAF. I am sure that those who have serve NS will know that there is a lot of wastage in the SAF like stores and how many have actually waited more than 2 hours to go to the next activity. Better scheduling and efficiency could reduce the waiting time and it should not be hurry up and wait. A lot of saving could be done in these areas. But these not mean that we should reduce our spending on military equipment just because we have been spending more than our neighbours for the last few years. Due to the advancement of technology, purchasing military hardware is like buying a computer. You might pay top dollars get the state of the art pc but few years down the road, your computer may not be as good as the present low range computer and it might even be obsolete. Why are our neighbours not spending as much? It is because their economy is badly affected and they do not have much cash to go around (and who would want palm oil for weapon sale) and spend big bucks on the new weapons. Furthermore, their countries do not face many threats. Do you think that they are not jealous that we can spend so much on our defence? They will die to be in our shoe. Because of our size, we need superior weapons to deter our neighbours from harbouring any funny thoughts. Just treat this as a detrimental cost like hospitalisation insurance whereby you will not appreciate it until you are hospitalise but if you do not use it then it goes to waste.<br><br>To put more money into healthcare is not good ideas as the cost of healthcare will forever increases. We have already one of the best healthcare in the world and if the government subsides more, it will be a burden to our economy. I have spoke to Danish tourists and in their country healthcare and education are free. But they are paying taxes from 40% - 80%. Therefore the poorest will still have to pay 40% taxes. I shudder at the thought of it happening in Singapore.<br><br>Kenmore, investing in sports and art is a good idea but you must understand that we are a young nation and this sector takes time to develop. We should give it a gentle push in the correct direction but they should learn to stand on their own. You mention that Malaysian has groomed youth to become world beater but you must understand that the opportunity cost to remove a person from the labour force and divert it into these sectors are much higher as we have a smaller population and the only resources we have is human capital.<br><br>Furthermore, getting the government to pour in more money into the economy is a very bad idea. Take for example the mobile phone industry. Who do we have? Singe, M1 and Star hub are owned in one-way or the other by GLC so what competition do we have. The government should privatise the GLC and allow healthy competition because in this way our company will be battle harden and compete effectively in the global market.<br><br>Oops look like I am giving more that twenty cents of opinion. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

UNFORTUNATELY... its not possible to do that in singapore because our local economy is too small and we are afterall a trading center.... and protectionalism only results in higher prices for singaporeans as it limits foreign competition....<br><br>Lastly... any form of protectionalism would invite reprisal protectionalism.... which will affect us even more... in short... it would translate into mass unemployment.. economic implosion...<br><br>THerefore... kenhor... go home... light a candle and start reading your economics 101....</div>
