Sky high returns or liitle/none at all, for projects with great complexity and astronomical outlays. There is no such thing as creating a research industry if you are not at the forefront and reaping the massive payoffs but is making minor improvements on current processes. Not only that, if the product in question has compartively little commerical value ie. improving vit A (!)content at a greater expense (which consumer would buy such a brand of rice? Would you?)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> regarding this golden rice, it was meant to help the poor who eat a lergly rice diet and are lacking in vitamin A, not for people who already have too much food on their table. I would also like to add that much more can be developed in the life sciences field.  Pharmaceuticals and other medical related products and services are an example.  Note that the industry is called bio-TECHNOLOGY, application of tech to life, and this field is both wide and large.  Singapore is trying to capitalise on that fact.  Look at the number of IT startups and the countries attempting to go into IT or are already familiar with IT, do you think Singapore will be able to compete with the massive countries in terms of IT in future if it is unable to do so in bio-tech?  The Singapore gov't is attempting to try for a headstart in biotechnology in Singapore.  Life sciences is also not all R &amp; D, it also involves production, for example, the manufacturing and development of pharmaceuticals.  For more info on Singapore's bio-med science, visit <a href="http://www.biomed-singapore.com" rel="nofollow">www.biomed-singapore.com</a><br><br>it must be assumed that you are at least a decade ahead in technology in front of your competitors to ensure economic dominance in that particular field. by means of patents of the technology itself in question, as eventually other scientists would have come to the same discoveries. The question that comes to mind is what are Singapore's chances of becoming a leader? If taking in mind, your competitors are USA, Australia, Britain, China, then realistically the best one can hope for is second best, unless by some cosmic accident or fate, a potential Nobel prize winner is born in Singapore.<br><br>As a 14 year old, you still have secondary school, junior college, army, and college even before working life. Guns are not toys nor casualities a number in computer games. Not a single soldier in SAF (UN peacekeeper doesnt count, or medical support) has tasted war so don't BS about bravery and patriotism.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> err ..  I wonder which part of my comments hinted that I treated war, guns and violence as a game?  How interest in military information translate to a thrist for violence (i interpret that as part of your 'Guns are not for boys' statement) and which part of my post BSed about bravery and patriotism?  When did I suggest that Singapore's soldiers have experienced war?  I am wondering if my age determines the reason for these comments.  How would you react if these were posted by an older and possibly, by your standards, more mature person?<br><br>As for the PAP and politics, nowadays even PAP admits it is not simply the material aspect (even that is not a surety) of life that people desire, but other factors as well. Btw, the very nature of democracy; not a one-party country; dictates self-interest of political groups and individuals being paramount to the State appartus itself. Are the people content and happy with PAP as a whole or is the the lack of a viable altenative and the threat of instablity and its possible effect of capsizing a small boat a compelling reason?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The material aspect of life IS desired by people, and it will remain so Why do people want the condominiums and the Jaguars and BMWs?  However, yes, other factors such as suffrage and the freedom of speech and thought have grown in importance.  At the same time, we have to bear in mind Singapore's size.  How long would it take for words to start a riot and for the riot to spread throughout Singapore?  While many may also question the moral integrity of the PAP by taking the opposition t court for saying things which would be very much accepted in other countries, we must ask ourselves have the opposition indeed made a false claim of allegation?  At present, I admit that part of the reason the PAP remains in power is because it is pretty much our only choice.  As of yet, the opposition front in Singapore is still very weak and has yet produced any strong contender to seriously challenge PAP.  Blame this on the type of candidates, especially a certain opposition party leader whose surname is chee, and has 'juan' at the end of his name with a 'soon' in the middle.  How worthy is a person who has gone on hunger strike to prove his point but at the same time take glucose water?  (It is theorotically possible to for a human survive only on glucose water, except that you do not grow or have any additional vitamins, iron, etc.)   </div></blockquote></div>
