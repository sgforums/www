Steyr who produces military rifles for armies all over, is NOT a military organization is it?  Heckler and Koch is not owned by any military, nor Colt, nor Smith and wesson, no, not even lockheed martin is actually owned by the US Government.<br><br>This is how weapons are produced around the world, with joint ventures eg. Eurofighter and collaborations between companies to put out a finished product.  So whats the big problem about the SAR-21 and Bionix being produced by non-military organizations since that IS the norm.  Hell, even Kalashinikovs aren't owned by the Russian government.  Not even Sukhoi or MiG-MAPO so to speak.<br><br>And whoever that asdfg is, its not nice to call anybody names here.<br><br>Regarding Singapore's military growth.  We must maintain a strong military, not only strong in defense, but powerful in offense to achieve a swift victory.  A strong defense without an offense WILL one day give way.  Building Singapore into an expeditionary force, = potential offensive capabilities.  This is what people (potential aggressors) are afraid of.  To cause the enemy great losses in both men&amp;equipment and in loss of territory.  If this does not convince you, think logically.  If Singapore was to get into a  war, it has to be a swift one.  One that does not drag so our economy can recover quickly.  A powerful offense would ensure that.  Without it, any war will last as long as the enemy wants it, simply because, we cannot attain victory over them.<br><br>Therefore,  powerful expeditionary force :  YES<br>Increase Defense Spending :  YES (When necessary)<br>Increase spendings now :  YES, its is absolutely necessary these days.<br><br>Think about it.  Israel didn't survive til today because it sat back, turtling, waiting for her enemies to run out of supplies and ammunition.  She counter-attacked her enemies, driving them back to where they came from and beyond.  And that is only because, she had powerful tanks, a then-advanced airforce, and well-trained soldiers and precise-to-the-second artillerymen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>asdfg2<br><br>In your view, military hardware spending is not part of military spending. That I must say is a flawed view. Any military expenditure in any armed forces in the world inludes a substantial amount set aside for hardware replacement as well as for upgrading. And that's military spending for you in case you do not know.<br><br>In your argument, you said that a country with strong army might not be necessary to be an economic superpower. Let's examine an example, Japan. The reason that Japan is not strong militarily is because her constitution does not allow a strong military due to her role in WW2. Looking at her defense force, it is also not difficult to see that as of now, it possesses one of the most advanced military hardware in that region. Even China is wary of Japan. Do you think other nation is not eyeing a piece of Japan? I don't think so.<br><br>Looking back at singapore, the picture here is not as rosy as it seems. Sandwiched between 2 "relatively" hostile land mass, a less than strong military is going to attract lots of meddling in our internal affairs. Imagine, if SAF does not get this expensive hardware when sg was still a young nation, do you think you and I could enjoy the economic success we have now? Chances are we will be even worse off than malaysia. No MNCs will invest in a country which is not secure. There are countless example out there, look at some countries in the africa continent. Why are they still living in poverty? It is because of their war with other neighbours over the decades that caused it.<br><br>Projecting a an image of an aggressive army shows prospective investors that sg is secure enough and there is no worries of their investments going down the drain. Likewise,  the military in sg is meant to be a warning to any troublemakers that we will hit them hard if we have to in order to protect our economy.<br><br>Finally, I don't know what your problem is with the current defense spending and I am glad you are not any defense advisor. Should that happen, I will dread what holds for the future of Singapore.<br></div>

Is that rational? give you a moment to think whether it is  true. (I can give a full blown argument, complete with counterexamples but then I may be wasting my breath with irrational people). China is wary of Japan, because of wartime aggression in the past and China never had designs on Japan ever.<br><br>2) Israel of SEA?!! If Sg is ever like Israel, even for a day, Sg will dead or crippled. Sure we should occupy Johor now or in the future right, so that we aren't caught "turtling".<br><br>3) Just think of a war Sg's image projected by an aggressive force. Just think of Japan's image of an aggressive army and it's effect on ties with its neighbours.<br><br>As much as whoever it is is happy that I am not a defence advisor, Sg is glad that they have u ppl as diplomats or policy makers. Otherwise you ppl fall into a JI trap without a doubt.<br><br>And kudos to all the rugrats with their peashooters for not examining the need, cause and effect of war on Sg.</div>
