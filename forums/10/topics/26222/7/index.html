Is that rational? give you a moment to think whether it is  true. (I can give a full blown argument, complete with counterexamples but then I may be wasting my breath with irrational people).

Only as a "strong" military.  A powerful military does not build an economy, and nobody ever said it did.  (unless you're really into selling arms)  An military that is strong serves to safeguard the country and protect the economy from foreign military threats.  Its like a the security guard that prevents thefts in a condominium.  Like the security guard, the military does not need to go around bossing people and threatening people to serve its purpose.  It needs only to make its presence known.  Yet when push comes to shove, it must be able to handle the situation accordingly.  Of course, your arguement would be probably be, "why build an expeditionary force, when a purely defensive one is required."  The answer has been simple all this time;  It violates every textbook, rule, manual that teaches basic warfighting.<br><br>You can only win a battle by attacking.  You defend only to stall time, regain strength and retake the advantage to attack.  And when you attack, you keep on attacking and you don't stop.  If we were to have a purely defensive military, we would have no ability to carry out actions that are needed to win the war.<br><br>Finally, I wish to disclaim something.  I never did once equate Singapore as the Israel of SEA.  Singapore is Singapore, Israel is Israel.  We are just similar in terms of our situation.  That is all.</div>
