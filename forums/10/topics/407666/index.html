              <p>has called on Singaporeans to welcome foreign talent with “an open heart”.</p>
              <p>In his televised <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=PM+Lee+National+Day+message+2010&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">National Day message</span></a> on Sunday evening, the eve of Singapore’s 45th birthday, PM Lee acknowledged Singaporeans’ concerns about taking in foreign workers and immigrants.</p>
              <p>However, he stressed the critical need to reinforce the Singaporean team with talent and numbers from abroad and added that the government will control the inflow, “to ensure that it is not too fast, and not too large”.</p>
              <p>According to reports, over 150,000 foreign workers have entered Singapore per year since 2007, and they now make up about a third of the island’s 3 million work force and about a fourth of the total population of 5 million, up from 10 percent in 1990.</p>
              <p>“We will only bring in people who can contribute to Singapore, and work harder to integrate them into our society. And we will make clear that citizens come first. After all, we are doing this for the sake of Singaporeans,” PM Lee said.</p>
              <p>“Other countries are not only much larger than us, but have far deeper pools of talent than we have. We must make up for the shortage of Singaporean workers in our economy and the shortfall of babies in our population,” he added.</p>
              <p>Delivering his address from the Pinnacle@Duxton, PM Lee said the government’s goal is to ensure all Singaporeans enjoy the fruits of growth.</p>
              <p>He went on to reveal that <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Singapore+economy+2010&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Singapore’s economy</span></a> grew 17.9 per cent in the first half of 2010 from a year earlier and the government is forecasting full-year growth of between 13 and 15 per cent.</p>
              <p>He said workers can look forward to better wages, more overtime and higher bonuses this year but he cautioned that the exceptional growth this year may not be repeated year after year, even as the government continues to continue to grow the economy with sustained effort.</p>
              <p>“Let us not get carried away. Risks remain in the world economy, especially in Europe and the US. The global financial system is not fully mended. Singapore is small and open. If the world economy turns bad, we will be buffeted. We need to stay vigilant and watch the developments worldwide,” he said.</p>

              <p>Like I believe. Do it for Singaporeans. Did they ask the Singapore people whether they like it, whether they approve or not?</p>
              <p>I don't think Singaporeans gave their permission for their country to be flooded with aliens, Lee Hsien Loong.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>That's a good bill and a vision for the country. So sad to hear that it has been suggested the United States is not truly a capitalist county, but instead a "plutonomy.” Plutonomy is a portmanteau of plutocracy and economy, and it means the American economy is run and owned by the richest of the rich. <br>I found this here: &lt;a title="Economists suggest the United States has become a plutonomy" href="http://personalmoneystore.com/moneyblog/2010/08/09/plutonomy/"&gt;Economists suggest the United States has become a plutonomy&lt;/a&gt;<br>It's been argued that it was always that way. Recent figures indicate that the richest few are what have driven any relative improvements in the economy.</p></div>

              <p>If the foreigners were talents, then yes,I'd gladly do so.</p>
              <p>But in reality and practice, the foreigners are just foreigners without any more talent than locals.......</p>
              <p>And these so-called "FTs" get all the jobs at the expense od locals. WTF! And we locals are to welcome them with open arms???</p>
              <p>Wake up lah, LHL! When importing FTs only serve to iuntensify competition and stress to locals, we, Singaporeans, are supposed to produce more babies???</p>

              <p>What he said as compared to what is happening is really an insult and irony.</p>
              <p>The inflow of foreigners have only contributed to the growth of the basic necessities such as food, transport and telco which are mostly controlled by his wife.</p>
              <p>So, this is the contributions that he was refering to.</p>
              <p>Not forgetting the worker levy.</p>
              <p>The overflow of foreigners have contributed:</p>
              <p>- More job loss</p>
              <p>- More lower pay</p>
              <p>- More overcrowding</p>
              <p>- More social disparity as they are happy not to learn english</p>
              <p>- More social visitors</p>
              <p>- More crime rate</p>
              <p>- More locals migrating</p>

              <p>the govt fail to address the implication and problems brought together with the huge influx of foreign workers.</p>
              <p>1. housing problems. before we open the floodgate, they should have inticipated where to house these ppl? maybe the only person in the elite PAP that dont support foreign workers is MBT. because he dont build flats years before and only realise the foreign workers do need a place to stay too.</p>
              <p>2. crime. wong kan seng fail to address what are the crime rate with regards to foreign workers. as far as i know, fake passes, con- man cases, divorce rate hehe also go up leh.</p>

              <p>Due to FTAs signed, we have to open more job market for foreigners. In other words, these FTs are not talents but needed to come here as part of the agreement. The influx was intense the last 5 years because of the FTAs. In IT, we may see more complaints in products (erratic web sites and softwares) and service (system break down quite often). I wonder the crash of F1 sales web site, DBS ATM, YOG Webcast Server and so on are due to outsource to cheap FTs.</p>
              <p>One thing for sure, our local grads from NUS, NTU, SMU and even SIM are much much better than many FTs from third-world universities. Their top latents are either employed locally or have moved to western countries - Singapore is not top choice for many third-world country top/world class talents.</p>
              <p>PMETs are crucial in contributing to the development and growth of our econmy fundamentals (our fundamentals are not as strong as Taiwan, Korea and HK). The influx of foreinger workers can help boost GDP and but it won't enhance our econmony fundamentals (which are needed to substain long term growth) since a lot of these foreign professionals are simply cheap and not really quality ones. The import of population to boots GDP growth is not substainable.</p>
              <p>Not be racist but truth: Singapore is a modern and clean BUT getting more stinking especially in MRT.</p>

              <p>that's why they welcome so many foreign talents.</p>
              <p>they wanted talents to be new citizens or prs later converted to new citizens.</p>
