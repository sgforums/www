            <div class='col-md body'>The PAP regime is too entrenched in their ways that they have become complacent and corrupt. It is like what happened to the various empires in the course of history. When one ruling dynasty held power long enough, it became weakened from the inside and turned to despotism to try and hold on to hte last vestiges of power.<br><br>For once, I don't feel like posting +1. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we are all over-reacting here. Mrs Goh's comments are surely not the most tact and politically correct ones. But to immediately link such a statement to PAP policies as well as Government policies would be to overreact.
