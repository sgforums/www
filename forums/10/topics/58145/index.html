            <div class='col-md body'>Why Singaporeans are being wrack by local media again &amp; again? Wat worse was a few times by foreign "talents". I recalled on Sat, Sept 13, 2003 channel U, 8.00pm "Ok no problem", Taiwanese hostess at the end of a call in session at coffee shop, she said: "The government had tried to help Singaporeans look for jobs, but the FACT IS SINGAPOREANS ARE CHOOSY". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br>Sounds familiar, get used to it. Beside being called kiasi, kiasu, and so on... the media often like to paint &amp; 'blow up' Singaporeans as being ugly, complain King, self denial, uncivil and so on (those who read local newspaper or watch T.V. programmes alot will know,<br>oh ya maybe Singaporeans also bo chap, so dun care and dun know) Sori hor I can only complain lor.<br><br>Latest 27 Sept 03 Today's ads on The Straits Times for the New Paper: "My frustrating marriage to a WIMP - Why more wives are fed-up their S'pore hubbies".<br><br>wimp - a weak, cowardly, or ineffectual person<br><br>I wonder if the people in our goverment, its' ministries, and the media themselves are not Singaporeans? Isn't it like slapping one's own face? Personally I think whatever the reasons behind, entertaining it may be. We should not place Singapore's image at risks. (Singaporeans is Singapore)</div>

It means every *Singaporeans *regardless *of *their *status.<br><br>Maybe as Singaporeans we knows wats going on. But for visitors from overseas, they will just have the impression that all Singaporeans are a bunch of choosy wimps.<br><br>And it is not as simple as listening to an entertaining "bad news".  It's a nation issue and the world is watching.<br><br>Ever imagin this day... when u travel overseas, pple say to u "wah!
