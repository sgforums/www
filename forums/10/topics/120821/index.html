You hit the nail on its head!!!<br><br>It is highly plausible, logical and practicable to combine positions of speaker with president. Like many other issues affecting our small and vulnerable country, all must think out of the box.<br><br>Speaker can be a very respectable head of state too beside doubling as as part of the executive to provide for coordination with the rest of branches of government.<br><br>It will create a more cohesive government of the future. Coordination by speaker with other branches of government will ensure our continuing success. At the moment, each branch tends to work to its own confrontational objectives and people would perceive lack of accountability and transparency for the same reason.<br><br>All these disadvantages of present constitutional set-up will disappear with more coordination by speaker who knows what is going on. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Her assent is needed to pass all laws, and she has the power to dissolve parliament. She also has the power to create peers. Peers are members of the UK parliament's 2nd chamber and almost all laws will have to pass through this chamber. While the peers' approval is not strictly needed to pass a law, they can delay a bill by at least 1 year and they cab concentrate media scrutiny on a bill.<br><br>Now, even though the last time the monarch witheld consent was in the 18th century, and even though she almost invariably follows the advice of her ministers in exercising her powers, Legally, she can do as she will.  As such, she represents the last bastion of constitutional values in the UK; THe balance of powers between the monarch and Parliament is such that the government is kept in check.<br><br>King Geroge the V is an example of a monarch that was pretty active in governing his country.<br><br></div>
