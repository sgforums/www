That would give him too much de facto influence in government. Unless the president himself were a true blue party man of course.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey peeps check this out, it's from http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/ Section 21<br><br>21. Â—(1) Except as provided by this Constitution, the President shall, in the exercise of his functions under this Constitution or any other written law, act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet.<br><br>(2) The President may act in his discretion in the performance of the following functions:<br><br>(a) the appointment of the Prime Minister in accordance with Article 25;<br><br>(b) the withholding of consent to a request for a dissolution of Parliament;<br><br>(c) the withholding of assent to any Bill under Article *5A, 22E, 22H, 144 (2) or 148A;<br><br>*Article 5A was not in operation at the date of this Reprint.<br><br>(d) the withholding of concurrence under Article 144 to any guarantee or loan to be given or raised by the Government;<br><br>(e) the withholding of concurrence and approval to the appointments and budgets of the statutory boards and Government companies to which Articles 22A and 22C, respectively, apply;<br><br>(f) the disapproval of transactions referred to in Article 22B (7), 22D (6) or 148G;<br><br>(g) the withholding of concurrence under Article 151 (4) in relation to the detention or further detention of any person under any law or ordinance made or promulgated in pursuance of Part XII;<br><br>(h) the exercise of his functions under section 12 of the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (Cap. 167A); and<br><br>(i) any other function the performance of which the President is authorised by this Constitution to act in his discretion.<br><br>(3) The President shall consult the Council of Presidential Advisers before performing any of his functions under Articles 22, 22A (1), 22B (2) and (7), 22C (1), 22D (2) and (6), 144, 148A, 148B and 148G.<br><br>(4) Except as otherwise provided in clause (3), the President may, in his discretion, consult the Council of Presidential Advisers before performing any of his functions referred to in clause (2) (c) to (i).<br><br>(5) The Legislature may by law make provision to require the President to act after consultation with, or on the recommendation of, any person or body of persons other than the Cabinet in the exercise of his functions other than Â—<br><br>(a) functions exercisable in his discretion; and<br><br>(b) functions with respect to the exercise of which provision is made in any other provision of this Constitution.<br>etc..<br><br>Sec 22 and other sections have other responsibilities and/or power for the president. So I don't think out presidency is a zuo bo job. However, dont't leave out the '..in accordance to article..' at the end of many clauses, it shows how controlled and limited the president's powers are. That's legally speaking.<br><br>Politically speaking, the president may not have much choices when it comes to approving budgets, bills or appt of public servants. This is, currently, the fact of Singapore politics. I think whether that will change or not depends alot on whether there is a collective demand from the people. Right now, I don't seem to feel or see much of that, but that's not to say the people is to blame. Sometimes the Govt. may set policies or make changes that naturally will arouse people to think that it has to do with politics or keeping PAP in power.<br><br>Frankly I'm quite disappointed with PM Lee when he said that two-party system will not work in SG, think he said it at the 50th annivesary of NUSSU or smth not too sure. I thought he was quite open to political changes to allow more open-ness and inclusion, but I guess he may have other opinions to care about from within his party. Oh well, we'll see..</div>
