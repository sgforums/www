Take into account inflation money then is smaller now so my request of $1,000,000 annually as retirement benefit as an ex-president just nice. Can consider the debts that the people owe to me for being their president as written off. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>If I become president and retire I still need to keep up appearances mah, $1,000,000 a year for me barely enuf to make ends meet ler ... otherwise if I play golf with other important ppl they will laugh at me say singaporeans being petty and stingy and ungrateful, at least $,1000,000 liddat can hold my head high no need to lose face eh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After Devan Nair, I think Ong Teng Cheong was the most counterproductive president. In Singapore's political culture, unengineered policy disagreement does not result in political progress. That's what Mr Ong did.

That, for very logical reasons, ruffled quite a few feathers within the ruling party.

The institution of the presidency would on the other hand, start to strengthen if we get a guy who understands the adage that "if you can't beat them, join them." In the longterm evolution of things, this would certainly be much healthier for the presidency. And by relation, the cohesiveness of the entire political system and culture.</div>

In Singapore's political culture, which is really a single-party monopoly, progress is not made by active opposition. I mean, think about it. You pit an ant against an elephant, who's gonna win? If the ant wants to survive, it'd have a better chance by becoming allies with the elephant rather than antagonising it. One stomp from the elephant and it's finished. Kinda the same with our political culture.<br><br>If the president really wants to "make a difference," this difference has to be made from within the single-party structure rather than from external opposition. He's gotta be a person who knows how to gain the trust of the ruling party. Only then, if he disagrees with something, he has the moral platform with the people who really run the government to voice his opinions in a manner than is palettable by them. It's engineered opposition. It's not whether it's "right" or "wrong;" it's simply how things work in Singapore.</div>
