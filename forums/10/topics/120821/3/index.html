In Singapore's political culture, unengineered policy disagreement does not result in political progress. That's what Mr Ong did. He actually believed that the presidency was independant of the ruling party and started behaving and speaking accordingly. That, for very logical reasons, ruffled quite a few feathers within the ruling party. And he became sidelined as he was deemed more and more of a nuisance.<br><br>So having a guy like Tan Soo Khoon who is another outspoken character with an independant streak would not do well for the Singaporean brand of the presidency. The institution of the presidency would on the other hand, start to strengthen if we get a guy who understands the adage that "if you can't beat them, join them." In the longterm evolution of things, this would certainly be much healthier for the presidency. And by relation, the cohesiveness of the entire political system and culture.</div></blockquote>i disagree with you...<br>prez ong was a good prez... he's deemed a nuisance by te ruling party. but to many s'poreans he's a hero in his own right... he dared to speak up...<br>though i posted previouly that the s'pore prez is only a figurehead, i would like to see someone who will make a difference... someone who can check on watever the ruling party is doing...<br>someone outspoken like tan soo khoon, who is not afraid to speak out, is excatly the sort of check we need on our government now... no government is perfect, with a one party parliament like ours, if the opposition cannot be counted to provide a check on the government's powers, at least the prez should be strong enough to do so...<br>the role of the prez is to safeguard the reserves of the country... if he has the mentality of "if you can't beat them, join them.", it would defeat the purpose of having an elected prez since the prez would join in in the plundering of the country should the ruling party decide to enrich themselves with the country's reserves...</div>

The PM should downsize the present cabinet with a better arrangement for retired and displaced ministers to leave the goverment and put a better mechanism in place for the future.
