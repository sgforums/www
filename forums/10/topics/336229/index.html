              <p>TS, didn't you read what he said?  He said retirement leads to death.    If he can he will not allow retirement in singapore, as retirement is the norm internationally he can't do it.    So conclusion, and answer to your question is he will never ever retire.    There will be death for him but no retirement.     Death is a natural.</p>

              <p><br>actually whether you give a damn or not, or respect him or not, is really not the issue here.</p>
              <p>the point is also not whether he is petty or not - i think that is already proven.</p>
              <p>that said, the issue is: why give a petty old man the reason to sue you? if one is mindful of what is said and done, regardless of how petty an individual is, he has no reason to sue anyone.</p>

              <p>When you use words like "extremely petty, narrow minded, self centred, tyrannical" do you expect to be sued. I don't think so.</p>
              <p>If you are really interested in taking a shot at the ruling party, you need to do a lot of homework to make sure that what you say, where you say, to whom do you say.</p>
              <p>If anything you said doesn't hurt them, they are not likely to sue you.</p>
              <p>If anything you said hurt them and you can prove it to be true, you shouldn't be worried.</p>
              <p>If anything you said hurt them, but turned out to be untrue, then you wait for their lawyer letter.</p>
              <p>They have an organisation, besides the government services working for them, but most important of all, they are veteran politicians, they have the education and experience. You got to know who you are up against. and if you can't even convince the man on the street, thinking that we were all stupid and brainwashed, then a few of you remains just a few. If you are not careful, you are giving bullets for the ordinary people like me to shoot you.</p>

              <p>You are too polite to ask him to quit,he will quit when he is about to die.Thats why i skip the process of asking him to retire n directly ask him to go n die.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>Every dictator thought they are different from the previous "ancestors",but they all end up the same fate,get cursed by the others for times to come.</p>
              <p>So LKY is no different,he thought,in his own fantasy world,that he will live forever n forever control Singapore n his wealth.But the thing is,we are all mortal,not God,we all have to die somedays.</p>
              <p>Perhaps he has overlooked one crucial thing,and that is,death itself is not really horrible.It is to gain respect from other ppl n make contribution to the society,that is more important.</p>
              <p>Otherwise,after your death,when u report to God.And God ask u,what things have u done in your life?And u answer him,initially i was good,but later on,i screwed everyones up just becoz they disapprove of the mistakes that i have done.Then,what do you think God will response to your answer?</p>
