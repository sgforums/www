            <div class='col-md body'>Was travelling along AYE this evening from tuas in the direction of the city. It was peak hour traffic at that time and the traffic are moving really slow. From far, I coiuld see an ambulance sounding its siren and I was surprise to see that the cars infront just continue to remain in the lane without moving across to give way to the ambulance.<br><br>My question here is, Is singapore driver that inconsiderate or is it that they dont know what to do in a situation like this. From my experience when driving in the US, I know that in a situation like this, cars infront will move aside and create an additional lane for the ambulance. So why is this not happening in Singapore? Is this the TP's fault that they didnt teach singapore drivers to do that in a situation where traffic is slow moving and impossible to change lane.<br><br>I hope the TP could do something to address this problem.<br><br></div>
