            <div class='col-md body'>I feel rather sad after reading this article in littlespeck.com<br><br>Golden Village<br>An unsurprising blow<br>That its Hong Kong partner pulled out somehow doesn't shock me. Here's why. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br>May 24, 2005<br><br>Just before a recent day-show at a Junction 8 Cineplex a spectacle unfolded that grabbed the patrons as much as the movie. The episode revealed how compliant Singaporeans have become.<br><br>Just before the show started, a lady usher, in black uniform, walked among the audience row after row, checking if anyone had brought in food 'illegally' not sold by Golden Village itself. When found, confiscation.<br><br>There was a sign that proclaimed bringing in food from outside is forbidden, so it is not a legalisic issue, but an ethical one. Does it make good business?<br><br>Golden Village Cinema is the only movie chain among four in Singapore that practices this 'trade protectionism'.<br><br>The reason for it is obvious.<br><br>The foodstuffs - ranging from coke to potato chips, hotdogs to chocolates - sell for up to twice the prices outside.<br><br>They will chase most patrons to nearby shops and that's what many patrons are doing. Whenever possible, they put them inside their pockets or handbags and bring them in, which is what every practical person would do.<br><br>So how is Singapore's biggest movie chain, owned now by Australia's 'Village Roadshow' conglomerate (with Hong Kong's Golden Screen), going to enforce its protectionism?<br><br>At Junction 8 at least (probably elsewhere too), it is sending hordes of black-uniformed ushers to check on patrons. I pity these girls. they're made to do an extremely despicable chore.<br><br>They swoop down on patrons row after row just before the movie starts and confiscated the 'illegal' food, issued a number for the hapless owner to reclaim after the show.<br><br>I've witnessed several incidents and if there was a crowd, they usually produced quite a rich haul. I was surprised how meekly Singaporeans surrendered their food without protest.<br><br>More surprising was the deafening silence the whole thing had produced. Only in one case I heard someone yelled at an usher for acting like the Gestapo, and she quickly scurried away.<br><br>Many people kept going back to suffer this ignonimity.<br><br>Imagine what would happen if this had happened in Australia. There would certainly have been an angry reaction from the people, or a sit-in or even violence from a few hot-heads.<br><br>Before these searches, there was already one incident at the Bishan 8 cineplex in which the police had to be called in when the staff-workers refused to let in two elderly gentlemen who refused to surrender a packet of snacks from outside.<br><br>On the strength of the ticket they bought, they insisted on watching the film. 'Not if you bring that in," insisted a Golden Village representative.<br><br>It wasn't something you'd expect to see in the 21st Century.<br><br>This Australian-owned chain is insisting on practicing trade protectionism when Singapore (and Australia) on the road of free trade pacts.<br><br>No other cinema houses are following suit.<br><br>So when I read about the Hong Kong partner's (a subsidiary of Golden Harvest) reasons for its pullout, I wasn't too surprised.<br><br>In a writ to Hong Kong courts, Golden Screen singled out Managing-Director Kenneth Tan for criticism for unacceptable tactics.<br><br>It said Tan went ahead with the May 1, 2005 cinema ticket hikes even after the board of directors had voted unanimously NOT to go with the price hike.<br><br>Another accusation was an alleged wrongful dismissal of a senior marketing executive.<br><br>I do not know if Tan can or cannot defend against the charges, but any one who can have its staff search customers like potential criminals, well..</div>

I have never seen that in SIngapore. Yet, they are sending users to confiscate unauthorized food.
