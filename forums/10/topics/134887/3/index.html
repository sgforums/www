            <div class='col-md body'>GV got this law meh?the ps one like dun have.maybe becuz ps the theatres all too crowded they not enuff manpower.but i tink u noe why other cinema's doesn't wan to follow suit?becuz in economical terms?the number of money spent on manpower to catch patrons bringing in food illegally is much more den the money used to buy their own food.lets face this fact of human nature, nobody like rules so they always break it and force new ones.so i generally feel that after awhile gv will stop using this matter when they actually do their econmoics and statistics becuz after they start chasing people away,i wouldn't be surprised if they don't come back.so they will in my view lose much more money than those cheap tidbits.</div>

No need to be nasty. Just politely tell them they have no right to search my bag and ask them to call the police. Disrupt the screening frequent enough and they will lose customers.<br><br>See if they back down or not.</div>

So legally, they are not obliged to let you in. But if you make enough of a fuss, they might just let you through.<br><br>Let's just NOT go to GV cinemas anymore. Hit them where it hurts most!</div>
