            <div class='col-md body'>Just wanna share with you another ridiculous incident I encountered in GV Jurong Point yesterday.<br><br>My wife and i brought our 2 sons, one is 6 years old, the other is only 8 months old sitting in a stroller. We went to the counter to purchase 3 tickets.<br><br>To my surprise, the counter aunty told us that children above 1.2m need to purchase a ticket and wanted us to bring our younger son to the height chart to confirm he is not more than 1.2m. I told her that he is only 8 months old and could not even stand on his own yet, but she insisted we do so.<br><br>I was so fed up that I told her I do not want to talk to an idiot like her and asked her to get her manager to talk to me. To my surprise, she actually did and the poor manager had to apologise for the mistake the idiot made.<br><br>My point is that certain policies made by the organisation are good, but it is the method its staff carry out the policies is crucial.</div>
