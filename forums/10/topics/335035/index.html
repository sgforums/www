              <p>I saw a lady about 50++yrs old at opp Sengkang Compassvale a few hrs ago shouting and screaming at her maid saying she hated the noodles the maid bought and threw it damned hard onto the grass patch behind the bus-stop. The maid lowered her head and humbly picked them up again and  walked a few metres behind that old woman. I strongly feel that one should treat another with respect regardless of nationality, status etc. If the maid is so-called "stupid" or does something wrong, why can't we tell them nicely? Why must some of us behave in such a babaric manner? I've heard of employers complaining the maid's stupid and so on. To put in more crudely, if the maid is not "stupid" or clever enough, would she still be working as a maid? If they are not good enough for them; very simple, don't employ any maids la!</p>
              <p>I wonder if this is the reflection of typical type of treatment and behaviours local employers treat their maids? The maids got to abandon their families and go overseas to help support their families with some at young age of 20++ where most of our locals are still studying and need not worry on financial or other aspects of life. When these maids arrive in a foreign land, they face the uncertainty of how their future employers are going to treat them, got to stay with the employers, work long hours, unable to resign when they cannot tahan their employers, got despised by some people, etc etc. Imagine the tremendous stress they are facing! No wonder i read of maids killing their employers and so on. I wonder if employers treat them humanely in the first place, would our newspapers would still be flooded with news of employers got murdered by maids and so forth? And for that miserable few hundred of dollars worth of salary, the maids got to work extra hard, denied leave and benefits that we ordinary citizens would normally get from our employers?</p>
              <p>And when sporeans go abroad for study or work, i often hear people complaining of racial discrimination etc. But do we ask ourselves how some of us treat our foreign workers?</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes you are right. They are supposed to be the "leaders", you know the people that the "followers" imitate?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Look at the way they behave, so dishonorably, taking massive amounts of public money for their own pockets and persecuting dissidents and opposition; not to mention putting their relatives and cronies in positions to take even more public money.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mainly it is the fault of that old dying despot with a wife suffering an extended death and a son with cancer. Now we wait and see what happens to his grandchildren. </span></span></p>

              <p>Well said, original poster. This is one of my pet peeves, and representative of how Singaporeans have no idea how lucky they have it. It is basically a result of having no respect for the maid as an equal human. I think one of the way it starts is when they allow kiddies to address the maids on first name basis, and the kiddies treat the maids like they are the masters too. What happened to calling their elders  XX zeh zeh or Auntie XX?? I thought it was suppose to be a basic asian trait to respect our elders. </p>
              <p>And seriously, got some pathetic people on this board huh. Have been here all of a couple of weeks already can identify liao. </p>

              <p>Aiya, first hor, u must understand why the old auntie was frustrated, we cannot judge thing just by our view, there are many reason behind it, maybe she asked the maid to buy roti prata, but instead she bought the mee...and also she may had lost money in the mini bonds, or her hubby, usual old singapore uncle, is with a prc gal etc etc, so there are many problem behind each negative reaction.  Vice versa, i hv also seen maid bring man into her boss house, party with a group of people when boss went overseas, slap child under her care when parents not around, spat siliva into drinks and foods for her boss to eats...etc etc..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, it both side of the coin we are talking about here, the best is, if you can work harder, dun get a maid, it made you more angrier, poor in health, get fat and lazier due to dependency on maid.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I saw a lot of this case too, sometime it is just too much, some serious case, they don't even allow their maid to share the meal with them or share the dish. I got a maid as well, but we treat her like family, we share dishes and eat together at the same table. Both me and my brother and her are like friends. Although I don't know what other people might think like, but I think this is what each family should be.</p></div>

Yes, that's exactly how your maid wants to be treated as well. Don't abuse them just because you pay them a "salary" every month. You aren't paying them big bucks to take shit from you so please, some respect and humility there.</p></div>

              <p>Actually, I understand and can see the logic and sense in most of your points, except the one I highlighted.</p>
              <p>This point we actually have our govt to blame. It's actually not that many of us don't want to give maids leave. But if we give them leave, and they disappear, go out get pregnant etc, we have to pay $5000 to the govt coz our maid is supposed to be our responsibility. This is not a small sum and seriously, the more we let maids go out, the more they get influenced by other maids and shit may start happening. If not, I'm sure my folks wouldn't have any problems letting our maid go out every weekend.</p>
              <p>I remember some human rights group have voiced out that we as employers do not give enough welfare to our maids. However, I personally feel they are barking up the wrong tree as they do not dare to bark up the right tree :)</p>

              <p>I feel that if employers treat their maids well and as a human in the first place, would they still try all out to take revenge on their employers by spitting saliva onto their food, practice black magic etc etc? After all, i suppose they are here to make a living and not here to create trouble for anyone.</p>
              <p>If your employer were to vent his frustration on you simply because he's in bad mood, how would you feel? And imagine yourself in a foreign land all by yourself, facing your abusive employer the entire day for everyday and unable to quit your job and change employers! Worse still, the whole family treat you like dirt! How would you feel?</p>

              <p>Then i got an indonesian maid who stole my grandma jewelleries and bake it inside a cake.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She was good in bakery, we adored her, she is also hardworking, we even let her family from indonesia to stay with her for a few days and i brought them sight seeing too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After 4 years with us, she decided to go back, Dad gives her some token of money too, since she lives in Yogjakarta, we send her to changi, but before that she told me she wanted to bake a cake for her family back home, she dun hv an oven in her native house, we said, go ahead, no problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then she baked the cake, put in a box for hand carry, she bids goodbye to my grandma, me and Dad sent her to changi airport. At the airport, my grandma called and said that her jewellleries went missing, i scolded her to search throughly, then i told my Dad, my Dad asked the maid if she see those jewelleries, maid said no, but in a shaky manners, my six sense told me something was wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once reached airport, she was desparate to check in, I told her i need to check her language, she said no problem. After checking, we found nothing, so then we thot she is innocent, we should not suspect her, we hugged and say goodbye.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Luckily that time was the peak period of terrosim, at the entrance, the ICA office already start scanning all parcel, bags and hand carry stuff, and immediately they saw the jewelleries inside the cake. And we will standing outside waving her goodbye, when she was led out into the police office.</p>
