              <p><br>i like your last sentence. Some of us are good employers, but if the maid come from those rural areas with lots of crimes, I think we have to be fair to some good employers like us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agreed that bad employers reflect a bad maid action, but some of the employers are good and still maid are bad, maybe it due to the nature of their upbringing in their kampong place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, brother and me grow up liao, sent our clothing to laundry services, grandma cooks foods for us, book those cleaners agents to come and clean house thrice a week can liao. The only different is that i hv to wash my own bras and panties...damn</p>

              <p>Then i got an indonesian maid who stole my grandma jewelleries and bake it inside a cake.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She was good in bakery, we adored her, she is also hardworking, we even let her family from indonesia to stay with her for a few days and i brought them sight seeing too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After 4 years with us, she decided to go back, Dad gives her some token of money too, since she lives in Yogjakarta, we send her to changi, but before that she told me she wanted to bake a cake for her family back home, she dun hv an oven in her native house, we said, go ahead, no problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then she baked the cake, put in a box for hand carry, she bids goodbye to my grandma, me and Dad sent her to changi airport. At the airport, my grandma called and said that her jewellleries went missing, i scolded her to search throughly, then i told my Dad, my Dad asked the maid if she see those jewelleries, maid said no, but in a shaky manners, my six sense told me something was wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once reached airport, she was desparate to check in, I told her i need to check her language, she said no problem. After checking, we found nothing, so then we thot she is innocent, we should not suspect her, we hugged and say goodbye.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Luckily that time was the peak period of terrosim, at the entrance, the ICA office already start scanning all parcel, bags and hand carry stuff, and immediately they saw the jewelleries inside the cake. And we will standing outside waving her goodbye, when she was led out into the police office.</p>
