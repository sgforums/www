              <p>I think if the old dog is still alive, people will still have the fear to rise up against the PAP regime, but when he dies, slowly the fear will be gone and people will rise up against PAP regime.</p>
              <p>That is what sometimes happens to autocratic dictatorships that revolves around a cult figure.</p>
              <p>For example in Guinea, after the old autocrat dies, the military immediately launched a coup.</p>

                      was arrested. </strong></span>Hua Guofeng, who had replaced Zhou as Premier, succeeded
                      Mao as Party Chairman.  Deng returned to the good graces of the Party
