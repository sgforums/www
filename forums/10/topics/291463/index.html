            <div class='col-md body'>Reader is indignant that NTUC Fairprice executive insisted that the group of students leave the supermarket even though they did not create any disturbance or inconvenience others. -ST<br><br>Wed, Nov 14, 2007<br>The Straits Times<br><br>I WRITE with some indignation about the brusque treatment that a group of special-needs students received from an NTUC FairPrice executive on Nov 7.<br><br>The group of 14 Down's, autistic and learning-challenged students were on an outing at FairPrice's Queenstown branch, part of a routine to equip them with life skills, including doing simple tasks like going to the supermarket.<br><br>They were at the supermarket to complete a Home Economics worksheet helping them to search for basic food ingredients, and making price distinctions and purchasing decisions.<br><br>A few minutes into the visit, a woman executive approached the group and asked to speak to the teacher in charge.<br><br>She insisted that the group should not be in the supermarket because prior permission had not been obtained.<br><br>She highlighted that the group's presence might affect the level of service to other customers even though the students did not create any disturbance or inconvenience others.<br><br>The executive harped on the fact that the group was blocking an aisle even though the supermarket was relatively empty around 4pm.<br><br>Despite a gentle request to allow the students to complete their assigned task of identifying seven items, the executive refused to relent. The students were rather disturbed by the incident and asked why they had been evicted from the supermarket.<br><br>Although this was an isolated incident, it reminded me that our society still has some way to go towards being more accepting of people with special needs.<br><br>Despite their disability, they deserve basic respect and compassion, like any other person on the street.<br><br>Koh Siew Yuen (Mrs)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From what I read, I think there is a misunderstanding about this event.<br><br>The executive I think was just objecting to a group excursion.<br><br>If it is a group of normal schoolkids or teenagers, she would also be approaching the teacher and objected to the teacher.<br><br>But because these kids were special kids, some observer who saw this then concluded herself, wah discrimination against people with special needs. Wah must be because they are different, so they were chased out by a mean person.<br><br>That observer concluded that they were chased out because they were different, not because it was a group excursion. While I believe the executive objected to the fact that it was a group excursion. But the observer made her own guessing/ conclusion that it was ill-intentioned.<br><br>This is what I guess happened.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, no offense but has anybody consider the possibility that the executive might get into trouble if the students made a mess in the supermarket? Not that I am supportive of her ungracious behavior in any way. I believe that there are many who feel that safeguarding your own rice bowl is more important than giving a damn about discrimination.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually i have faced similar situation when I brought mainstream students to another supermarket HOWEVER I was simply told not to do it again or ask permission from management first rather than this very severe mishandling of the situation.<br><br>The ISSUE (stupid as it seems) appears to be that the students were taking down the PRICES. aand you can't take dpwn a list of the supermarkets' prices.<br><br>BUT i think in general supermarkets should REALLY see the difference between students learning life skills (AND becoming potential customers in future) AND competitors coming to learn abt your prices or what shit!!<br><br>AND if the supermarket is not crowded at that moment, there really isn't much rationale in doing this at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hohoho, another in topic for the day, isn't as good as being racist?<br><br>Is like thinking that students or teenages cannot stay and disturb the place while the adults won't. Now who say adult won't?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding the event that took place at the supermarket, my brother, age 11, happened to be present as he and his classmates were chased away by the hypermart's executive.<br><br>I find the incident truly appalling, that my brother, along with the rest of the special kids, are being robbed of the opportunity to learn life skills- skills that the rest of us took for granted, whereas special kids can only learn through a step-by-step approach. With the kids delighted to learn a new life skill during their fieldtrip, and I know that for a fact because by brother would hold on to the product that he purchased for hours every time he returned home form his guided shopping trip, only to be to be considered a nuisance to other shoppers and chased out of the hypermart that claims to be FAIR,.<br><br>Is there something truly wrong with our social fabrication??? I read a front-page article on TODAY paper not long ago about SingaporeanÂ’s apathetic social tolerance towards foreigners and expatriates. What I find an even larger social problem is that we cannot even tolerate, or a more subtle word, accommodate special groups of people within our own society because it is simply more convenient to detach them from the society at large.<br><br>My brother and his friends shunned away from what could be an educative and eventful experience just so that a hypermart which claims to be FAIR can uphold its pristine image to its customers when there were hardly any in the middle of the afternoon. And in return, a mere apology that truly counts for nothing constructive. And we expect to become a more accommodating society with apologies after apologies, it seems like we have a really long way to go.<br></div>
