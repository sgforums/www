              <p>Singapore says five alleged Singaporean members of the Jemaah Islamiyah militant network have been released.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Home Affairs says three of them were released in March after being held for two years under Singapore's Internal Security Act.</p>
              <p>It says the three, previously detained in Malaysia, were arrested when they were deported to Singapore and subsequently held under the Act.</p>
              <p>The Ministry says another two alleged Singaporean JI members, who were detained in September 2002, were released on Sunday.</p>
              <p>All five are under restriction orders which limit their movements and activities.</p>
              <p>Whereas the Mudland government used the ISA to arrest an opposition member of parliament and two journalists a few days ago. One of the journalists has been released, but the other two people are still being held.</p>

              <p><br>The JI Plotters is smarter then we think they are not, for their acts of either "intelligently" co-operating, signing the statements of guilt and renouncing their wrong actions, or remain in continued custody.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can they serve their cause while in custody, or would it be better to be released and be able to live to tell of their experiences in custody, and inform those who are in the "fifth column" ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The fact that Mas Selamat Kastari remains at large indicate the possible existence of a "fifth column".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, honest "local dissident" - such as Chia Thye Poh - had refused to sign any form of admissions of guilt to the verbal accusations that he was a Communist advocating the "armed overthrow of a legitimately elected government".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He had instead challenged the Government to charge him in an open court and show the evidences to back up such charges - something which the Government will not respond, but prefer to incarcerate him for 32 years, and quietly releasing him without any written guarantees.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The other "local dissidents" such as Tan Wah Piow - NUS Student Union President - was sent to jail on very flimsy evidences from a PAP Unionist Leader for committing a "one-man riot" inside a Union premises, and in a show trial presided by a Pro-Government Judge he was found guilty. On his release from prison, he was sent to the Artillery Unit to serve his NS - and it was the 120mm motar battalion with the heavy base-plate to be carried on route marches. Under those trying circumstances, the young man left Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The other "local dissidents" were the social minded lawyers active in the Catholic social outreach program, who were accused of being "Marxist in the Catholic Church". Prior to their release they had to first signed their admission of guilt. They willingly complied so as to gain their freedom and be able to protest the conditions of their arrests. They were quickly re-arrested and confined for a longer period, and prior to their second release, the ISD got their admission of guilt video taped and signed before being released again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The "local dissidents" were largely political activists challenging the political order, and the only way to demolish such a challenge is to damage or destroy their credibility.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The JI Plotters are not political activists, but religious fanatics - Singaporeans should ask this Government if they have got their focus and priorities right.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>we must get intel from terrorists first then rehabilitate. if they get a trial, they will have free publicity for their cause and might sway parts of the general public to their cause. ongoing operations against the terrorists might also be affected by the publicity of the case. for political dissidents, nowdays then tend to get sued. why bother throwing them in jail and create a ruckus when you can sue them, bankrupt them, and thus disqualifying them from elections.</p></div>
