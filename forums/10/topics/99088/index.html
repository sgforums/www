The government simply favors foreign talent and give them fat pay and good jobs. No wonder there are not enough jobs to go around. So if i have the chance,Im gonna leave.

Is that the situation for Malaysia,Thailand and other big countries? If you wanna be angry, be angry at ESPN not Starhub. Starhub has been making lots of effort trying to control and keep down the price, but as usual, singaporeans are not appreciative. No doubt there might be a bit of profitering out of this situation--but thats for the admin cost and GST. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
