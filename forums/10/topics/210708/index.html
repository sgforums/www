However, even the flap between A*STAR and Johs Hopkins is well documented. Climate forms the basic underpinning of individual thought and behavior. Granted, these scientists are here due to favorable circumstances, but is the trickle-down effect going to be effective if our local scientists do not possess the same skill sets or emotional aptitude to be more assertive in their R&amp;D than being held back unnecessarily by undelineatedd boundaries?<br><br>Perhaps not in the Life Sciences, but it is very palpable in the Social Sciences community.</div>
