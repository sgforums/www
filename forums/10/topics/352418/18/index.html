              <p>The local media can't use any dialect in their broadcasting. The radio station will be fine for playing any cantonese or hokkien song.</p>
              <p>Therefore, unless your friends speak dialect, there little chance for a person to use or listen to dialect if not use at home. That's why many people nowadays can't even understand their own dialect cause not use at home.</p>
              <p>By forbidding radio station to play dialect song, the gov is killing the little chance youngster can be exposed to dialect.</p>

              Correct, who needs to speak to the whole China population! 
              
              Anyway, it is also not necessary that one must speak excellent Mandarin in order to engage the Chinese unless it is for some kind of literary exchange.
              
              It is no good to learn anything, esp, languages purely for economic reason for we wouldn't enjoy it.

              <div><strong>Dialects add to burden</strong></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>MINISTER Mentor Lee Kuan Yew yesterday reiterated
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>his stand against
              Chinese dialects, saying that learning dialects adds to a child's
              burden.</strong></span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <p>Also, it takes away the child's time and energy from mastering
              English and Mandarin, he said In addition, English and Mandarin
              differ in their vocabulary, phonetics and syntax and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>adding on dialects will cause
              'negative interferences' in the learning of the two languages, he
              added.</strong></span></p>
              <p>In defending the decision to promote Mandarin over dialects, he
              also noted that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the value of a language is
              its usefulness.</strong></span></p>
              <p>With Mandarin, the reach is far greater than dialects: 'If you
              speak Hokkien or Cantonese, you reach some 60 million in Fujian and
              Taiwan, or about 100 million in Guangdong and Hong Kong. With
              Mandarin, you can speak to 1,300 million Chinese from all provinces
              in China,' he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee was speaking at the launch of the annual Speak Mandarin
              Campaign, which he introduced 30 years ago.</p>
              <p>Since then, most Chinese Singaporeans have adopted Mandarin over
              other dialects.</p>
              <p>However, about a fortnight ago, the acting head of Nanyang
              Technological University's (NTU) Division of Linguistics and
              Multilingual Studies, Dr Ng Bee Chin, sparked a debate when she
              reportedly said at a language seminar:</p>
              <p>'Although Singaporeans are still multilingual, 40 years ago, we
              were even more multilingual. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Young children are not
              speaking some of these languages at all any
              more.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'All it takes
              is one generation for a language to die.'</strong></span></p>

              <p>Dialect is indeed a cultural identity. However, in my humble
                  opinion, I think it is very important to think carefully whether it
                  is better to craft a wider and more common cultural identity, and
                  let some other cultural identity fade away, or not.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, Mandarin can become people's cultural identity,
                  and mother tongue, and the communication between parents and
                  children and so on within the family.</p>
              <p>I think culture is not static, and we human beings have some
                  destiny or control, and we can shape and mold our future and our
                  culture.</p>
              <p>I think now we are still in generational transition, and it is
                  important to think very carefully, is it better to go all the way
                  to mold a new, common, wider cultural characteristic, or maybe do
                  it half-way, to try forging that, while maintaining the past
                  distinctive characteristics, in other words try putting our foot on
                  both ships.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, it is better to firmly and steadily move in a
                  clear and decisive direction. Do a little sacrifice now, we are the
                  sacrificing generation.</p>
              <p>If you look at the world statistics on languages, actually a lot
                  of languages fade away, become disused, become absorbed, the users
                  use another language, and so on. Actually it is not so special or
                  unique. I think we need not fear a disuse of a certain language,
                  but try to think carefully whether it is better to adopt a certain
                  other language.</p>
              <p>With regards to the language proficiency, actually one of the
                  problems that Singapore has right now, is the low level of both
                  English and Mandarin proficiency. There are many people who speak
                  bad English, and bad Mandarin. This condition should be found a
                  remedy.</p>

              <p>If singapore is needed to learn mandarin for the sake of coming up China...why not learn Cantonese (guandong, hongkong, shenzhen, guanzhou all speak fluent cantonese) why not learn Hokkien (taiwan, fujian, xiamen etc etc on the lower provinces can speak hokkien), i will rather said we should learn to speak Beijing and Shanghai dialects...u get better chance of winning a business there.</p>

              <p>Hey, bi tch who is stepping on your tail? I was not even directed at you, even angel7030 humbly tried to pacified the situation.  I know why you so pissed because you are biten by my statement, "what's the difference with being a prostitute".</p>
              <p>You joined sgforums in 2004 and you only have 24 post.  It clearly shows the world that sexy_girl-1234 is just another clone of your many accounts and you are the ghost we can talking about and the prostitute of course.</p>
              <p>I believe you are not even a female.  Ghosts use Avatars and usernames of female to cheat sympathy and non-hostile attitude from forum users.  Nobody can hide secret, not even the government.  The truth is out there and amongst your guys there are trailors, the anti-*A*.  People with true talents will not join your dirty-business, that is why there is lack of talent up there right?</p>
