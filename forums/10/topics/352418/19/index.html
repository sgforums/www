              <p>My grandfather, who was relatively well to do insisted his children attended both Chinese and English schools. So my mom, uncle and aunts had to attend Chinese schools in the morning and ate lunch/change uniform while being ferried to the afternoon English schools.</p>

              <h1>Malaysian police fire tear gas at language protest</h1>
              <p>Riot police fired tear gas at hundreds of Malaysians who tried to march
                  to the national palace Saturday to protest the use of English to teach
                  math and science.<br> <br> The demonstrators sought to submit a petition to the country's king to
                  demand that the national Malay language be reinstated in schools for
                  the two subjects - a sensitive issue for the ethnic Malay majority.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Many Malay teachers and linguists complain that a six-year-old policy
                  of using English has hurt efforts to modernize their mother tongue and
                  to develop a scientific lexicon in Malay.</strong></span><br> <br> The protesters had marched through busy traffic for about half an hour
                  after gathering at Kuala Lumpur's main mosque when police fired tear
                  gas, causing them to scatter.<br> <br> Authorities warned people earlier this week not to attend the
                  demonstration, saying organizers had not obtained a necessary police
                  permit to hold a public rally. No injuries or arrests were immediately
                  reported.<br> <br> English was once the medium of instruction in most schools in Malaysia,
                  a former British colony. Nationalist leaders reversed the policy and
                  made Malay the main medium of instruction less than two decades after
                  independence in 1957.<br> <br> In 2003, believing that poor English-language skills were undermining
                  Malaysian students, authorities started a program to resume teaching
                  math and science in English. Other subjects continued to be taught in
                  Malay.<br> <br> The government began a review to gauge the policy's success last year.
                  But protracted discussions with teachers, parents and political
                  activists have so far achieved no clear solution.</p>

              <p>Dialects are ok to me as there are millions of Chinese in China who speak Cantonese, Hokkien, Hakka, etc.   This annual Mandarin campaign for the past 30 years has outlive its main aim.   It was relevant then but not now. Chinese in China know the important of the English Language and are keen to learn.  In 2008, China sent about 180,000 Chinese students overseas mainly to US, Australia and UK for further studies.  Even the state provide an English webpage (<a href="http://www.chinaview.cn">www.chinaview.cn</a>) and there is comprehensive details on how to invest in China, business news, cultural education, etc.  </p>
              <p>Funds for the annual campaign could be used  instead to education, health care or social activities.  Remember we are a multi-racial state and minorities should not be left out.   </p>

              <p>ya, millions of chinese speak cantonese, but only in guangdong; go to shanghai, they speak shanghainese; go to beijing, and all other provinces, they speak their own local dialects. BUT, when they meet, they speak Pu Tong Hua, mandarin; when they write, there is no written hokkien, cantonese.....</p>
              <p>All chinese embrace the chinese culture å¤§ä¸­å�Žæ–‡åŒ–, local customs and practice are minor diversities. If you don't speak mandarin or any local dialects, you can only learn about chinese culture written in english by the angmoh.</p>
              <p>All the 180,000 chinese students speak mandarin, spoken and written, and their local dialects, before they go to Australia, US and UK.</p>
              <p>Many Singaporeans are chooing between mandarin, dialects and english, it is one or the other, not one and the other, obviously they are not capable enough.</p>
              <p>Different dialect groups are not minorities in Singapore, the Chinese who don't know English are!</p>
              <p>The original aim of Speak mandarin campaign is to encourage the Chinese who speak local dialects to use Mandarin as a common language for Chinese. Now it is targetted at the 'Chinese' who don't know mandrin, or dialects. </p>
              <p>We are a multi racial society, Speak Mandarin Campaign is never targetted at the Malay, the Tamil, the baryi, the angmoh, or even the PRC immigrants.</p>

              <p><br>Uncle Chia, do u know that without English, u might not be surfing and posting here today,...dun bite the hand that trained and fed you!!!</p>
              <p>I went to shanghai, china, i noticed that in all bookstores, english books are booming, english tutors are in hot demand, everyone is trying to speak english so as to be able to get a decent jobs, able to communicate, the Chinese are so desparate on learning english that most parents send their childrens for extra english courses in private english insitutions which is also booming. But then the chinese culture is still very much intact. There is a different between culture and modernisation ya</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is of good luck that we had embraced english as one of our main language, u hv to kowtow to the man who make us what we are now, otherwise u may still be a coolie and me a pro on the street still blur blur about what is going on and get conned by Westerners and Babas.</p>

              <p>Stop acting thick. You accuse LKY of being a western dog and destroying "local culture" (when you mean Chinese culture) in your posts when the evidence suggests that he picks what serves the party's interests from both Asian and Western cultural imports.</p>
