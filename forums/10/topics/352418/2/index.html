              <p>i don't really care about lee kuan yew, you can bash him whatever, more interested in the dialect part.</p>
              <p>i see no future of dialect in singapore. The african americans are from.... africa. they don't speak like africans. the white americans don't speak like the british. are you saying they have no culture? why must dialect = culture? </p>
              <p>sure, it's cool if you can speak dialect, but for practical reasons, i don't see the value of dialects. </p>

              <p><br>Hmm is it? I dun think so. Dialects had a closely interlinked relationship but ultimately, they evolved on their own. Mandarin was just one of them. It was only in a vote in the 1920s that established mandarin as the national language with cantonese following closely behind.</p>
