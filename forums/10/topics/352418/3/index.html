              <p>Actually, the dialect is also a language, when i was in Hainan for Holiday, I saw those Hainanese reading mandarin characters in hainan dialect, for them the mandarin is not mandarin, is hainan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also remember, long ago, my late old auntie got an old tape which she likes to play, it is about someone telling a story of some kind in Cantonese, and my late told me, this guy read from a book and read it in Cantonese for his listener...so, i can conclude that dialect is also a language if it is used to read and write.</p>

              <p>I have seriously no idea how people 5000 years ago communicated too. But then again, mandarin was but just a mere dialect in the 19th century.</p>
