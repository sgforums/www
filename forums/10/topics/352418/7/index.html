              <p>In the ancient days, due to distance, and lack of technology, people from one region to another region can refer to the same words or same object but saying it differently.

              <p>Language is not really extinct, and never extinct. When you adopt Mandarin, it can become your mother tongue and you can think in it, and dream in it, and it can become part of your family tradition too.</p>
              <p>It does not mean your family heritage is erased. It means you adopt, absorb, and improve, on a new standardization language, which your ancestors all speak in the ancient days in one form or another.</p>

              <p>Well...that is one aspect of a "disadvantage" if a society have too many languages.</p>
              <p>Too many languages will create "blocks" , or like pieces of wood which is slotted into our midst, it will create obstacles.</p>
              <p>A divolution of a standardized language creates too many blocks, it impedes people's interactions with one another, and it impedes communication, trade, commerce, sense of solidarity, etc, a lot of disadvantage.</p>
              <p>It is better that we here now in the 21st century make a turn, and make a sacrifice, we have to standardize a language. We now for our generation need to be willing to do a little sacrifice, so that our children and grandchildren can have a standardized common language and mother tounge and do not experience too many blocks.</p>

              <p>We are still doing the sacrifice, until a few more generations, when our children and grandchildren can have 1 common language and 1 common mother tongue.</p>
              <p>We have to be brave and endure this little sacrifice for the benefit of our next generations.</p>
              <p>If we do not have the resolve, and cling on to half-heardted measures, there will always be language gap and generational gap, there will always be "older people who cannot understand xyz language"</p>
