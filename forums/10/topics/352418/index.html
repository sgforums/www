              <div class="top_headline"><strong> Dialects add to burden </strong></div>
              <div class="top_headline"><br></div>
              <div class="top_headline">MINISTER Mentor Lee Kuan Yew yesterday reiterated <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>his stand against
              Chinese dialects, saying that learning dialects adds to a child's
              burden.</strong></span></div>
              <div class="top_headline"><br></div>
              <p>Also, it takes away the child's time and energy from mastering English and Mandarin, he said
              In addition, English and Mandarin differ in their vocabulary, phonetics
              and syntax and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>adding on dialects will cause 'negative interferences'
              in the learning of the two languages, he added. </strong></span></p>
              <p>In defending the decision to promote Mandarin over dialects, he
              also noted that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the value of a language is its usefulness.</strong></span></p>
              <p>With Mandarin, the reach is far greater than dialects: 'If
              you speak Hokkien or Cantonese, you reach some 60 million in Fujian and
              Taiwan, or about 100 million in Guangdong and Hong Kong. With Mandarin,
              you can speak to 1,300 million Chinese from all provinces in China,' he
              said.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee was speaking at the launch of the annual Speak Mandarin Campaign, which he introduced 30 years ago.</p>
              <p>Since then, most Chinese Singaporeans have adopted Mandarin over other dialects.</p>
              <p>However, about a fortnight ago, the acting head of Nanyang
              Technological University's (NTU) Division of Linguistics and
              Multilingual Studies, Dr Ng Bee Chin, sparked a debate when she
              reportedly said at a language seminar:</p>
              <p>'Although Singaporeans are still multilingual, 40 years ago,
              we were even more multilingual. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Young children are not speaking some of
              these languages at all any more.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'All it takes is one generation for a language to die.'</strong></span></p>

              <p>For many of us, dialects may not mean a thing. But for many others, dialects refer to our way of life and it's the connection between us and our family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Honestly, quite appalled at such a decision to kill off dialects. Anyway he doesn't have to worry, dialects will die off sooner or later.....i give it 50 years. Even if you have two hokkiens or cantonese marrying each other, you can be assured they don't speak that dialect at home.</p>

              <p>not sure what you think a top leader should be... but i rather a top leader share his views, and not always say things people like to hear.</p>
              <p>that way, there will be change. and that way, people will vote against him if they think he is shitty.</p>

              <p><br>thank to vulgarities, dialects still manage to survive among we young generation. KNS.</p>

              <p>Even in China, no doubt the national language is Mandarin, but they still have dialect among them well perserve and transpire to their youngs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think learning dialect is not difficult, you dun hv to write, just speak only, it bring along culture, closeness and belonging, even with dialect, we still excel in our languages both in english and chinese, and infact dialect can be a good tool if you do business with chinese peoples from your ancestor provinces. Once, one of my friend was able to get a special discount for ordering gifts make in China, Hainan, to be distribute in Singapore. And that discount was given when he spoke hainanese to the hainan boss...and they still doing business now.</p>
