              <p>Yes.<br><br>But this goes against Mr. Lee's proposal. He advocates the complete eradication of dialect.

              <p>I dont know about this, maybe it is ok to teach it in schools, if it is feasible.</p>
              <p>I think several countries are doing it.</p>
              <p>But I think Singapore is quite disadvantaged, because English and Mandarin is quite polar opposite, so it is rather hard to teach a third language, at formal level at schools.</p>
