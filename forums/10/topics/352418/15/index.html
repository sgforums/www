              <p>Isn't the point that there isn't an outright ban of using the dialect? We can still speak it if we like and our parents can teach us if we want or learn it if we want to ?</p>
              <p>We are reacting as if we need to follow LKY's "opinion" like the Holy Gospel.</p>
              <p>We can still make individual choices not to follow, there isn't any cops going to crack down on us if we speak Teochew/Hokkien/Hakka/Cantonese on the streets. Taoist/Buddhist religious ceremonies are still conducted in dialect.</p>
              <p>If we don't want the culture to die then we should go learn it and preserve it, not expect the government to do it for us or get self righteous on an internet forum. I thought we wanted less government interference, not increased interference.  </p>

              <p>There is a difference between suppression and no encouragement. There is no punishment for us to know/speak it individually.</p>
              <p>I fail to see why it's the State's responsibility for us to learn our own culture. We are a multi racial society, i do not see why the State needs to get involved with teaching us our own heritage.</p>

              <div>Lee Kuan Yew's views on chinese dialects in Singapore:<br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>MINISTER Mentor Lee Kuan Yew yesterday reiterated
                                                      <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>his stand against
                                                      Chinese dialects, saying that learning dialects adds to a child's
                                                      burden.</strong></span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <p>Also, it takes away the child's time and energy from mastering
                                                      English and Mandarin, he said In addition, English and Mandarin
                                                      differ in their vocabulary, phonetics and syntax and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>adding on dialects will cause
                                                      'negative interferences' in the learning of the two languages, he
                                                      added.</strong></span></p>
              <p>In defending the decision to promote Mandarin over dialects, he
                                                      also noted that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the value of a language is
                                                      its usefulness.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew doesn't like the chinese in Singapore speaking dialects, so he pursues the policy of suppressing dialects in state media.</p>
              <p>If you are a chinese in Singapore and you speak dialect, Lee Kuan Yew won't approve of it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to Lee Kuan Yew, dialects should be suppressed in Singapore:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(1) learning dialects adds to a child's
                                                      burden.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(2)dialects will cause

              <p>I support you too. Ironically, in LKY's own word, our culture "stem from the mother womb"; not something cut and paste.   <br><br>Heard the friday programme from BBC? Yiddish was spoken by 10 millions Jew in America. 60 years after the war and with it's demise, see how the current generations mourn the loss of their culture? see how much effort they go to preserve their culture?<br><br>And we have 100 to 200 millions dialect speaking people in South China. Why we shouldn't be reaching out to them more than the northern Chinese? They are our kinmen, after all.<br><br> </p>
