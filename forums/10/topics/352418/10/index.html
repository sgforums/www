              <p>Lets discard about economic effect for a while.</p>
              <p>Lets just look at Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singapore has several Chinese dialect groups.</p>
              <p>If all the dialects are revived, this will bring problems in communication, but I think most importantly, it will create blocks and create obstacles, and hamper a common identity.</p>
              <p>I once visited a museum, in the ancient Singapore passports, people's nationalities are written based on their dialect group. This includes Chinese groups as well as Malay and Indian groups. Lots of small groups such as "Boyanese" whatever that is.</p>
              <p>I think it is important not to have such an environment again.</p>

              <p>No, that is wrong.</p>
              <p>Nothing to do with that.</p>
              <p>Mandarin promotion started 30 yrs ago, before China took off. Nothing to do with China, but it is a common sense policy which has to do with Singaporean Chinese.</p>
              <p>Again, why do equate Malays with learning Mandarin..?</p>
              <p>Malays should learn Malays, and if there are several different competing Malay dialects (which I think there are), it is better that they learn 1 standardization.</p>
