              <h1>Disadvantageous Mandarin</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <p>Thursday, 19 March 2009, 6:23 pm | 77 views</p>
              </div>
              <p><strong><span>A response to MM Lee</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span>KJ</span></strong></p>
              <p><span><img class="alignleft" style="border: 3px solid black; margin: 13px; float: left;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Culture/mandarin228300.jpg" alt="" width="228" height="300">There
              is a lot to be said for Singaporean-Chinese, myself included, to be
              ascribed a ‘mother tongue’ that is not really my mother’s (or for that
              matter, my father’s), one that we have to learn from scratch, in effect
              as a second-language, and one with which we have little affinity.</span></p>
              <p><span>What is more lamentable is the fact that these decisions are
              borne out of unquestioned, state-mandated economic necessity, and
              subsequently implemented with such swift ruthlessness. Cold,
              hard-headed decisions that, without our realizing, put a stopper to our
              personal relations and halt our life stories. How many times have I
              found great difficulty in conversing with my grandparents, who were by
              then too old to abandon their original tongues and acquire new ones,
              while I on the other hand had been discouraged from speaking in their
              native ones (i.e. my real mother tongue[s]), and force-fed a foreign
              language called Mandarin.</span></p>
              <p><span>Singapore prides itself on arriving from ‘Third World to
              First’ in one generation – (have we really?) – this is the same reason
              for our extraordinary ability to extinguish our rich southern Chinese
              heritage, one that is as old as centuries if not the millennia, in a
              single generation.</span></p>
              <p><span>Is this something that we, that is to say, Singaporean-Chinese, in the name of economic achievement should be proud of?</span></p>
              <p><span>I doubt that our ability to speak Mandarin has been, as MM Lee
              would have us believe, a ‘key advantage’. As academic Linda Lim
              remarked in an interview with the Straits Times last week, our
              self-appointed role as conduits to China and India is
              counter-productive, if not redundant. And after expending so much
              energies and resources into its teaching and learning, how many of us
              are truly proficient in Mandarin, beyond the rudimentary phrases needed
              to get one past the wet market?<br> </span></p>
              <p><span>Having to master both English and Mandarin without a ‘natural’
              cultural-linguistic environment that is necessary for one to be
              proficient in either language has resulted in us floundering in both.
              Drowned in this process is our chance and ability to master our true
              ‘mother-tongues’. It is well-known that the Mainlander Chinese and the
              Westerners constantly mock our lightweight grasp of Mandarin and
              English, and, for those doing business in China, they are taking
              Mandarin lessons to make up for their linguistic lack. Beneath these
              foreign mockery is the sneering at our cultural ignorance,
              superficiality, and philistinism. Further, if the ability to speak
              Mandarin is such an economic asset, why do our education policies
              prevent our non-Chinese compatriots from learning it? And should
              Singaporeans be learning Mandarin just so we can ‘bring value-add to
              China’?</span></p>
              <p><span>Such vulgar economic justifications for ‘national survival’, for learning languages, for effacing cultures.</span></p>
              <p><img class="alignright" style="border: 3px solid black; margin: 13px; float: right;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Culture/coolies3.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="172"><span>Whatever
              the material benefits I might reap by way of Singapore’s ‘economic
              usefulness’ to the rest of the world, I derive no dignity in being
              treated as a cog in a machine, as a means to an end. I would gladly
              trade, pardon the pun, GDP growth with the ability to speak my native
              language (it is neither English nor Mandarin) even if it is the most
              economically unviable language in the world. For that matter, I would
              be proud to be a Singaporean even if it is the poorest country there is
              around. What consolation does it bring, to be able to speak to 1.3
              billion Chinese all over China if I cannot even engage in a proper
              conversation with my own family?</span></p>
              <p><span>That is not to say we should not have encouraged the learning
              of Mandarin. But it certainly could have been implemented in a less
              mechanistic manner, and for less utilitarian reasons. It is for these
              very reasons that we do not want to, or we are unable to, appreciate
              the value of a language and the beauty inherent in all languages, that
              exist beyond the jargon and jarring phrases of multinational companies
              and Internet data banks and global financial-speak.</span></p>
              <p><span>The choice of languages learnt need neither be
              government-sanctioned nor mutually-exclusive. Contrary to what the
              government and the media would like us to think, we are not the only
              country that adopts a bilingual policy. But compared to other such
              countries, we are far from being as successful. Learning from them, we
              might realize that mastering Mandarin need not have come at the expense
              of our ancestral tongues. Our lack of fluency in multiple languages is
              not just due to biological limitations (which is far from being a
              fact). Ill-conceived, flip-flopping government policies and crass
              economic rationale for learning (or un-learning) languages have
              contributed to this predicament too.</span></p>
              <p><span>In two generations Mandarin would be our mother tongue,
              proclaims MM Lee proudly. But with our appalling level of proficiency
              in Mandarin, it is not hard to foresee how much and what kind of a
              ‘mother tongue’ it is going to be. It will probably not be much.</span></p>
              <p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 3px solid black; margin: 13px; float: left;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Culture/coolies_1.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="174"><span>Is
              the sole value of a language its ‘usefulness’? I don’t think so. On the
              one hand, use-value is subjective, personal, and should not be decided
              for me by, of all things, the state. On the parallel, the value of
              language is in language itself. Languages do not appear out of thin air
              – we human beings create them, keep them alive, and they live for a
              simple reason – above being basic tools of communication, they are
              expressions of our emotions, our humanness. Expressions that, like
              culture and the arts, live outside the world of money.</span></p>
              <p><span>We would have been better-off leaving our language habits
              alone, and letting our ‘adulterated Hokkien-Teochew’ languages evolve
              on their own. And why not? Languages, like cultures, are living things
              and they evolve all the time. And over time, our aesthetic
              sensibilities are honed along with our constant polishing of our
              tongues, and from where the beauty and poetry in the language emerge.
              This is true for all languages, from the first grunt in the dark cave
              eons ago, to the final stanza in the gilded library just now. And why,
              our Singlish vernacular might one day become high language too, with
              its inimitable trove of stories and sonnets. If only we would let it,
              and let our local poets light the way.</span></p>
              <p><span>But of course, such frivolous pursuits have no place in a country where economic necessity and cultural cringe <em>must</em><span> </span>prevail.
              While the sun of the British empire might have set, and the Middle
              Kingdom’s might yet arise, it seems as long as the ruling regime’s
              socio-economic ideologies persist blindingly, Singaporeans will always
              remain colonial subjects, servants to capital.</span></p>
              <p><span>The way we have gone about picking ‘winning’ languages and
              experimenting with them as one would in a laboratory, it is what kills
              language. But not only that – as fellow TOC contributor <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2009/03/a-response-to-mm-lees-private-secretary-on-dialects/">Deng Chao noted recently</a>,
              what is wiped out is more than our Teochew, Hokkien, Cantonese, and
              Hainanese languages. Gone with them would be the irreplaceable and
              age-old cultural treasures of folklore, poetry, aphorisms and
              histories, riches that are later infused with the tropical air of the
              Straits Settlement – a natural confluence of cultures. What is wiped
              out will be<span> </span><em>life</em><span> </span>itself, supplanted by the mediocre, the vulgar and the kitsch.</span></p>
              <p><span>One day I might become a grandparent too, but what would the
              world be like then? I do not want to punt on the vagaries of the market
              or the flow of global finance. I certainly do not want to be enslaved
              by them. Small as Singapore is, there nonetheless are things that do
              not and cannot have a price tag. The<span> </span><em>ability</em><span> </span>and the<span> </span><em>freedom</em><span> </span>to speak, for instance. Invaluable things. </span></p>
              <p><span>Am I romanticizing the village?</span></p>
              <p><span>But how did the village come to be something pejorative in the Singaporean imagination?</span></p>
              <p><img class="alignright" style="border: 3px solid black; margin: 13px; float: right;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/TOC%20Team/polemicb250166.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="166"><span>What kind of a city are we still<span><em> </em></span>building anyway?</span></p>
              <p><span>Looking at my grandparents, I do wonder what their Singaporean
              world has been like, for them to one morning find themselves strangers
              in their own land, unable to be understood and unable to understand,
              the foreign chatter on the streets, and recounting life stories in a
              voice whose sweetness their loved ones would never know.</span></p>
              <p><span>And how much are Singaporeans and our nation, for all our
              economic growth and material riches the poorer for it, living on
              benighted money, leaving our history behind?</span></p>

These fees are essential in helping with the production of public service programmes as they are less commercially viable and require funding support. With funding, Singaporeans will get to enjoy a wider range of TV and radio programmes that not only entertain but also serve to inform and educate. <br><br>Funded programmes on TV include current affairs, info-education, culture, minority language and children's programmes. The MDA also funds minority programmes on radio stations Oli 96.8FM, Warna 94.2FM and Ria 89.7FM.

              <p>Of course Mandarin should be promoted.</p>
              <p>First I do not agree with your sensasionalistic title, "killing dialects"</p>
              <p>This is not true, the truth is the opposite, the promotion of Mandarin.</p>
              <p>First we have to understand something.</p>
              <p>All the dialects are connected, in fact, they are basically the same words, written the same way, but pronounced differently, with some other little differences.</p>
              <p>These are basically "dialects" and not a whole new different language.</p>
              <p>Therefore, a move towards standardization is not a move to kill a language, but a move to standardize the pronounciatons, accent, and so on.</p>
              <p>It is not neccessary to be so anti about it.</p>
              <p>In the ancient days, due to distance, and lack of technology, people from one region to another region can refer to the same words or same object but saying it differently. In fact from one village to another village, or from a mountain area to coastal area, the words can be pronounced differently.</p>
              <p>Now, there is technology, there is roads, there is media. It is time to standardize everything. It makes sense, and it simplifies, clarifies, everything.</p>
              <p>I do not understand whats the big deal about it.</p>
              <p>Language is not really extinct, and never extinct. When you adopt Mandarin, it can become your mother tongue and you can think in it, and dream in it, and it can become part of your family tradition too.</p>
              <p>It does not mean your family heritage is erased. It means you adopt, absorb, and improve, on a new standardization language, which your ancestors all speak in the ancient days in one form or another.</p>
