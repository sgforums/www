              <p>The sudden revival of the "Importance of Mandarin" is nothing more then an attempt to divert public debate from the US$100 Billion loss to our National Reserves.</p>
              <p>The deafening silence - in editorial comments and public discussions in both printed and broadcast medias - is simply too embarrassing for the Political Leadership, and with nothing but daily dose of heart sinking economic and financial numbers - LKY has done nothing more then to revive an old controversy.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, LKY has achieved his goal, when discussions - in this Speaker's Corner on the US$100 Billion - have faded, and this "Mandarin" topic has spread across 17 pages in less then three days.</p>

              <p>can't be bothered to read the whole thread. i dont support what lee kuan yew has supposedly (according to the TS) said. neither do i not support. this is more complicated than just about retaining culture or whatever. 'cultures' are constantly changing. be it because 'outsiders' have interfered or not or whatever.</p>
              <p>I know of many who can speak a Chinese language, but know shit about the 'culture'. Yet i know people who can't speak any Chinese language but know more about the culture than many others who can.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, I do support the learning of Mandarin. With regards to the other languages/dialects, I feel that they are of no less importance. And i hope they will never be 'lost'. At the end of the day, the government can say whatever they want to say. But if you teach the child and the child learns, and you make sure the child speaks it, it won't be lost....at least for another generation.</p>

              <p>Dialect have already been extinguished in the media.</p>

              <p>He can't base it on anything else since he is an anglo dog.</p>
              <p>He is not malay.</p>
              <p>The malays won't passionately follow him.</p>
              <p>He is not indian.</p>
              <p>The indians won't passionately follow him.</p>

              <p>The Hokkiens won't passionately follow him.</p>
              <p>The other dialects groups also won't follow him.</p>
              <p>He is an anglo dog.</p>
              <p>So the slogan for support has to be economic.</p>
              <p>That is the only slogan left.</p>
              <p>Feel sad for him also, his base of support is so weak, so insecure.</p>
              <p>He is actually a minority figure in Singapore population without a strong following.</p>
              <p>A hakka anglo dog.</p>
              <p>He has to make use of Hokkiens like Lim Chin Siong to gather support, this shows how weak his position is in early days of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Not many can identity with an anglo dog like him.</p>
              <p>But after he secured the position of PM, Lim Chin Siong was removed.</p>

              <p>I guess culture to different people means different things..</p>
              <p>Dialects is our culture identity, its part of our culture being
              chinese singaporean, do we want to be faceless international
              citizens or uniquely Singaporean?</p>
              <p>I am sure all is for learning Mandarin but I have heard that
              other countries Mandarin speaking chinese are laughing at some of
              our fellow Singaporeans for not knowing Chinese idioms going so far
              as calling them stupid. Should idioms then be included in the
              syllables? Or just basic Mandarin in school, and if anyone wants to
              expand their business to other countries, they should take extra
              Mandarin lessons...</p>

              <p>Dialect is indeed a cultural identity. However, in my humble opinion, I think it is very important to think carefully whether it is better to craft a wider and more common cultural identity, and let some other cultural identity fade away, or not.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, Mandarin can become people's cultural identity, and mother tongue, and the communication between parents and children and so on within the family.</p>
              <p>I think culture is not static, and we human beings have some destiny or control, and we can shape and mold our future and our culture.</p>
              <p>I think now we are still in generational transition, and it is important to think very carefully, is it better to go all the way to mold a new, common, wider cultural characteristic, or maybe do it half-way, to try forging that, while maintaining the past distinctive characteristics, in other words try putting our foot on both ships.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, it is better to firmly and steadily move in a clear and decisive direction. Do a little sacrifice now, we are the sacrificing generation.</p>
              <p>If you look at the world statistics on languages, actually a lot of languages fade away, become disused, become absorbed, the users use another language, and so on. Actually it is not so special or unique. I think we need not fear a disuse of a certain language, but try to think carefully whether it is better to adopt a certain other language.</p>
              <p>With regards to the language proficiency, actually one of the problems that Singapore has right now, is the low level of both English and Mandarin proficiency. There are many people who speak bad English, and bad Mandarin. This condition should be found a remedy.</p>

              <p>You have to ask the anglo dog.</p>
              <p>I think he can only base his power on material needs of the

              <p>He can't base it on anything else since he is an anglo dog.</p>
              <p>He is not malay.</p>
              <p>The malays won't passionately follow him.</p>
              <p>He is not indian.</p>
              <p>The indians won't passionately follow him.</p>
              <p>He is not Hokkien.</p>
              <p>The Hokkiens won't passionately follow him.</p>
              <p>The other dialects groups also won't follow him.</p>
              <p>He is an anglo dog.</p>
              <p>So the slogan for support has to be economic.</p>
              <p>That is the only slogan left.</p>
              <p>Feel sad for him also, his base of support is so weak, so
                  insecure.</p>
              <p>He is actually a minority figure in Singapore population without
                  a strong following.</p>
              <p>A hakka anglo dog.</p>
              <p>He has to make use of Hokkiens like Lim Chin Siong to gather
                  support, this shows how weak his position is in early days of
                  Singapore.</p>
              <p>Not many can identity with an anglo dog like him.</p>
              <p>But after he secured the position of PM, Lim Chin Siong was
                  removed.</p>
              <p>Sad, that is the reality of politics.</p>

              <p>I regret these kinds of comments from you. Please do not attack someone so personally, and especially with an ethnic based attack like that.</p>
              <p>If I am not wrong, LKY is not pure Hakka but has some Hokkien lineage.</p>
              <p>But that is not the point. LKY is someone who is very wise on this matter, he has a long term view and understanding, both backward and forward.</p>
              <p>Just forget about him for a moment, and dont focus on him, Ok?</p>

              <p>In Singapore you get to speak English, Mandarin, and at least Hokkien and Cantonese on daily basis, so it's not difficult to maintain that dialect speaking ability.  Most younger generations have lost the ability to speak dialect and that's sad.</p>
              <p>If u do business in Fujian and you speak Mandarin, they will treat you differently compared to another person who speak Hokkien, same as in Taiwan.  Because you are not the "hia di" to them.</p>

Even with our Singapore Cantonese standard we cannot really converse in same pace.</p>

              <p>It shocks me that we actually expect the government to pamper us for something we should been doing on our own in the first place.  </p>
              <p>If we feel not learning a dialect denies us opportunities then go learn it yourself, there is absolutely no one and no laws stopping you.</p>
