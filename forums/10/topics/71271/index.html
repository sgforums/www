This is where the faithful differ.<br><br>There will be the extreme radical groups that will resort to extreme action, and we see these Radicals not only in Islam - with their Jihadis, but also in the Christian Faith too - as seen in the Shining Path guerilla groups of Peru, Ku Klax Klan in USA, and any other Religious Action Groups operating on the fringes of Society.<br><br>These Radicals are quite intelligent people, who have the intelligence to twist complex religious issues into simple reasons to justify the cause for their radical actions.<br><br>These Radicals have super-egos that society have no room to receive or accomodate them, and their only recourse is to shake the world and find space in any place that can be found.<br><br>Will 'Moderates' operate in similar fashion, when Human Reason takes precedence over the mind, and determine one's actions ?<br><br></div>

In answer to your question above, I don't think so.  The moderates' game is defensive, while the radicals' is offensive.  While the radicals go out and stir the people into a frenzy, the moderates have to work much harder to not only get to the people ahead of the radicals, but to instill the much quieter voice of reason in them so that it overrides the emotions that the radical will try to stir up.<br><br>At the end of the day, then, could the distinction be that the moderate appeals primarily to reason while the radical appeals primarily to emotion?<br><br>Hey, oldbreadstinks, it's cool - I originally thought Band of Brothers was yet another miniseries about the Jackson Five! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Besides, we've talked about the PAP smear elsewhere already! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
