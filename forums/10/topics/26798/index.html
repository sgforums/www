But if you cut down much further....it will be no point.<br><br>Troops need time to train, to build up their skills, proficency, and learn how to operate as a unit. Experience takes time to gain, is not gained overnight. Excerises need to be repeated often enough, until it becomes second nature, so that in wartime, you can do it without thought. Example unjamming your weapon.<br><br>True...nobody expects you to feel on always...and yes...training is boring....and usually no fun. But it is not meant to be an amusement theme park. I myself dun really look forward to my IPPT, but I know is necessary to force us to keep fit. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Morale of soldiers is something hard to measure in peacetime.

            <div class='col-md body'>oh no... and now we talk about the "N" word...<br><br>wouldn't be a bad direction to explore if people had an idea of WHAT it is...<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by tripwire:<br><br>heartware..... hmmm..... its kind of a difficult to generate that heartware in singapore because nationalism has been suppressed by the govt so much that it really do not exist.... so much so... people dont pretty much bother if you can sing the national athem, recite the plege or conduct watever nationalistic activities... </blockquote>nationalism has not been suppressed because there is none to begin with. there is no nationalism, no national identity here. what they are trying to do, is to implement (invent?) a civic nationalism that encompasses all "race, language and religion".<br><br>that fact that people don't bother with the rituals of nationalism just shows that the gov't initiative has not worked the way they intended  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote>In singapore... the successful implementation of a global economy plus a highly educated populations has resulted in high mobility of its citizens.... this has resulted in a trend, where these people begins to see themselves as global citizens rather than a citizen of a particular piece of land...</blockquote>social mobility is THE pre-requisite of any forms of nationalism. think: French Revolution.<br><br>when culture is used to identify the population in terms if a vertical stratum, it cannot be used at the same time to demarcate a horizontal boundary.<br><br>when u identify yourself as Lord your place is within your realm and u relate only to your patrons/clients of the same stratum. when u identify yourself a serf, your place is the land and your lord's realm. you feel only for your fellow serfs.<br><br>its not the same in a nation state. the vertical stratums are flattenned and everyone elevated to the level of "citizens".<br><br><blockquote>The govt's fear that nationalism will lead to isolationism and/or protectionalism... resulted in a govt constantly extorting singaporeans to be accepting to FT and watever gibberish... that ultimately demoralise the local population... if put to the people inappropriately and without sensitivities...</blockquote>again, accepting FT is one of the characteristics of a civic nation. u do not need to be born here, but u can join the club if u swear allegiance and contribute to it. Thomas Jefferson was offered honourary French citizenship after the French Revolution. (i don't think he even spoke the language...)<br><br>the people don't like it precisely because their conception of nationalism is beginning to move closer towards the other extreme: the ethnic nation. u're not born here, u don't belong here. they fail to see the irony of it: what makes a singaporean? aren't we all descendants of immigrants? (exception: malays)<br><br>globalization can actually reinforce national identity rather than erode it. people need roots and places to belong to. the global citizen in my opinion, is nonsense. its a self serving image. nobody else sees u as that and welcomes u as a result.<br><br>with the domination of a globalized (american) culture, people would feel the need to assert and claim that part of culture that is uniquely theirs so that it does not become part of the global mush and so that others would not be able to appropriate it. (Russel Crowe, Gladiator... isn't it interesting how americans appropriate ancient rome...)<br><br>you have no idea of the flurry of activities the italians went through after that to "reclaim" their heritage...<br><br>but its always been identity crises that leads forges identity.... so the more confused Singaporeans are, the better because it will just forge a stronger identity when they resolve the conflicts within.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After reading the above posts, I can roughly sum up the mentality of the soldiers in Singapore. There is little or no sense of belonging to our country and the people will only take SAF seriously when there is a serious external threat. Although this is not an optimum scenerio but sadly this is the real world. So is there any way to increase the nationalism of Singapore? To give the heartware which Singaporeans so badly needed.

In other words, if I say I'm proud to be a Singaporean but think the government is too sensitive and faultfinding, then many people will start thinking I'm a fool contradicting himself.<br>In America, many Americans doesn't think much of Bush, but still their sense of loyalty to the country remains unquestioned by the government.</div>
