So 1% of changes is also quite a bit on their part<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">2. PM &amp; his ministers can show leadership by initiate changes more regularly.They are paid to do political work while the ppl are not. </span><br><br>Ask them to cut their pay, as economy is no good or the investment is loosing money.

In this way we could avoid autocracy or dictatorship which is too narrow and self-centred for long-term good or stability of any country.<br><br>If PM Lee wants to change, as he has told people to do so, he should work towards decentralising the political power concentrated in a few to a larger group of ministers and professionally objective and responsible dare-to-speak-up back benchers and capable oppositions who can also contribute in polishing up policies and checking on self-centredness practices.<br><br>Good MPs, good ministers and good ex-PM should also be allowed to serve again after a lapse of one term since we are a small country where human resource is limited and should be put to good use.<br><br>If PM Lee really wants people to make demand for change and regards change as good as the old system so far is too narrow and limited in mobilizing people towards mass participation and vibrancy, then he should consider the above-stated suggestion.</div>
