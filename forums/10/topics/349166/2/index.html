              <p>he didn't like my thinking about politics saying young people nowadays each generation worse than the last. don't understand anything still want to make so much noise.</p>

              <p>people now join politics now to earn high pay, rather than the desire to serve the people. only during pre-elections then they start to do their hearts and minds crap, to show the public that they care....or bait the public with upgrading or free money to buy their votes. Hell, even the PM readily admits this</p>
              <p>Too bad, it might work for the old generation simpletons who die-die support PAP for what its supposedly did for us in the 60s,70s,80s against the so-called communist threat , yada, yada, yada. Now the younger generation who are more IT-savvy can see for themselves the propaganda and the bullshit they spew for 40 years. We might not see PAP lose power in the near future.. but they will fall eventually.</p>

              <p>In a startling and revisionist essay, Dr Greg Poulgrain of
                                          Griffiths University observes that the British Governor of
                                          Singapore and his Chief Secretary in their reports to London had
                                          admitted that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>police could find no evidence
                                          to establish that Lim was a communist.</strong></span><br> <br> Poulgrain claims it was actually Singapore's then Chief Minister,
                                          Lim Yew Hock, who had deliberately <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"provoked" the bus and other
                                          industrial workers and Chinese middle students to riot in 1956 in
                                          order to have Lim Chin Siong arrested.</strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">Indeed, Poulgrain noted that "[Public Record Office] <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>documents show these were the

                                          led to Lim Chin Siong's arrest."</strong></span><br> <br> A few weeks after Lim Chin Siong was behind bars, Lim Yew Hock
                                          visited London in December 1956 and was <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"warmly congratulated on the

              <p>a lot of people like to argue about politics while disregarding this part. even the auntie picking cardboard is proud of the fact she's picking cardboard in singapore and not in our neighbouring countries. not saying we shouldn't make life better for her. i know its not a good thing to look down on your neighbours because of your wealth but still....</p>
              <p>seriously, how many times have you heard an argument that makes you think supporting a politician would make a difference in your life?</p>
