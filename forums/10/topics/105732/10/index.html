In your sentence,<span style="font-style: italic;"> I agree that there are girls which meet his 10 pts but they are not common enough to be labelled as 'typical'</span>, you are coming from the perspective that what the statement means is that his 10 points apply to the typical girl.<br><br>What im saying is that you could interpret gazelles statement differently:<br>Asuming that that the 10points apply to singaporean girls only, it is fair to then infer that the one (male) marrying ONLY has to be wary, if he is marrying a singaporean girl.  Right?  Okay.<br><br>But take it one step further, and assume that the 10sins are most frequently noticed in THE AVERAGE (read: typical) singapore girl.  Not the upper class educated female population, or the alternative crowd or other social groups.

When I said countries want to market themselves as the THE IDEAL holiday spot. They will use whatever attraction they have to sell themselves. May it be the great wall of china in China or the Rockies in Canada. But ultimately, they hope that visitors come as tourist and spend money in their country and buy whatever speciality product they have, which in a way promotes consumerism as they have products to move and they need someone to buy and you can't just depend on the local market.<br><br>Singapore is a good example. We are being promoted as the ideal shopping spot in asia and as a starting point to visit the rest of Asia. Why are tourists needed? Because the government can't just depend on the consumerism of Singaporeans!!<br><br>Anyway, you are going out of point. I have never mentioned that my husband is so stingy that he won't bring me out on a holiday. And I'm not saying that you are stingy to not want to bring yr wife out on holiday.
