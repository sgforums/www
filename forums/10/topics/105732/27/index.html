The people who are actually there know how it all works, and because of that they don't see it as being a particularly big deal.  A nickel-and-dime player like Gazelle would make up those figures for his own perceived wow factor, and that's why I said he's impressed by his own lies.<br><br>Gazelle never got the hang of the idea that the guys who really have made it take it as a matter of course, and if anything, they don't talk much about it.  I've got a friend in Vegas who owns a credit company - when he writes a cheque, the bank bounces.  He's another Rolex nut, and we chat a lot about watches, but he very rarely talks about his wealth.  The last time he mentioned anything about it, he was asking if anybody knew anybody who wanted to buy one of his houses for US$4 million, and once it was sold, I never heard anything about it again.  What I do know about his wealth mostly comes from some of my other friends who have visited him in Vegas - that's class.</div>
