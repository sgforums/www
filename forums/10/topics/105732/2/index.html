I just have to compare the women from our parent's generation to those sg women of today. Did my dad treat my mum as a maid or slave? I dont think so.<br><br>And to tell you the truth, the reason I dare to write this list is because I do have a wife that does all the above, and unfortunately she is not a sg women. If you think that she is poor, stupid, uneducated, ugly and dream to be a housewife, than I must say that you are very wrong.<br><br>Personally, I have dated many sg women, from doctors to models, from lians and SPGs, and all I can say is that they are great companion to have fun but not as wife.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
