When did I threaten to ip his address? I only offered to buy him used panties.<br><br>Anyway, Bar threads are for all to read. We are just quoting him. Why should I pm everyone??? Pls, if I wanted to say something. I will do it in front of the person and not be some cowardly fool who stabs someone from behind.<br></div></blockquote>What I have posted in BAR stays in BAR. If you want to talk about sex and fantasy, we can always set up another thread in BAR and talk about it.<br><br>Only fools like you will think that educated and successful man dont talk about sex. If you want to know about wild sex, maybe you should try dating the CEO of some big japanese company. I am sure those 50 , 60 years japanese man will know how to make you feel good.<br><br>(I am truly honoured that you have request my personal attention.)<br><br>1)  Why are you bitc hing around asking why I didnt response to your posting. It seems to me that you have unknowingly been attracted by my 5 figure salary and the big CHIP. You seem to be depreived of sex and 5Cs? Care to share about your boring sex life?<br><br>2) i believe the main reason why you are being offended by my post is because you somehow fit into the typical singapore girl that i am talking about. It will be worsdt if you are still single and plan to remain single for the rest of your life.<br><br>3) Let me tell you something about sg women, Most sg women here, which include you, are suckers for 5Cs. The reason why i am saying this is because most sg girl I slept with have this thing in common. Like I said before, I have dated girls from different walks of life, therefore I am confident to say that what i said is at least 75% true.<br><br>I am sure there will be women who say that only Slu.ts believe in 5Cs and bla bla bla....bla bla bla..., but sad to say those who say this are usually the ugly and left over ones.<br><br>4) Do you know what is my impression of sg women? They are cheap and cannot be trusted. (maybe accept the ugly ones)<br><br>5) Beside being cheap, I think they lack character. Beside going shopping, breast enlargement and EXPRESSION, I dont think they have much things to do in life. Maybe some loner like you might prefer to hide yourself behind the computer rubbing shoulder with Gendanken and his rolexes.<br><br>6) The reason why I didnt marry a singapore women is not because I cant, it is because I know that all these nice legs, pretty face and small tits are all going to fade away when they hit their mid 30s. And I am not prepared to live another 40 years with a women that has got nothing.<br><br>Btw, Why are you to call me an idiot? Do you like it if i call you a piece of left over meat that is waiting to be sold?<br></div>

However, I would advice that donÂ’t accuse me of faking if you are not prepared to be proven wrong and end up embarrassing yourself by your own weakness.<br><br>What I have posted in Bar is something about what I have experienced in life, and I donÂ’t see a need to hide it by using another Â“nameÂ” for myself. If you girls think that my sex adventure and fetish story is shocking, then I think you aint seen nothing yet. For the benefit of those underage teenagers who are participating in this thread, I will not elaborate more. All I can say is that guys who donÂ’t talk about sex are usually those who are the most perverted ones and be careful.<br></div></blockquote>I don't find it hard to believe at all.  Your posts in this thread and at the Bar both display your contempt and utter disrespect for women.  You can stammer on about honesty all you want - your posts have already served to highlight your hypocrisy when you speak of:<br>- standards you proclaim that Singaporean women should follow<br>- the "wonderful" relationship between you and your wife<br>- your so-called concern for Singaporean women<br><br>On top of that, your fetish for soiled underwear reflects your underlying sense of powerlessness to women - all of your posturing hides a tiny, scared little boy inside, and we all see it.  Never mind, keep denying everything - it's not going to change how pitiful you really are.<br><br>Your claims of honesty therefore have no merit whatsoever.<br><br>The fact of the matter as evidenced by your posts at the Bar is that you've proven what we knew about you early on.  You're a little man with a twisted view of the world, especially with regards to women.

If it helps you sleep better at night, knock yourself out.  In the meantime, I find this all terribly entertaining, and I suspect it going to get even better.  elindra's interpretation of your 10 things in light of your perversions is spot-on - I thought you were amusing before, but now you're rip-roaringly funny. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

This forum is a place to people to talk about everthing and anything.<br>And I dont think you can say who can be qualify to post on which forum. If you dont like my posting, can i know why are you still reading it?<br><br>It is your loser friends who want to link this thread to those in Bar so dont talk as if it is me who enjoy talking about it here.<br><br>Like I have told foxwalk, if you want be to respect as a women, please show me your respect by avoiding talking about sex. As for the CHIP story I hope you know that it was only meant for Gen.<br><br>CIM is something which only guys will understand, therefore I dont think you are in the right position to comment on this. Like I have said, only foolish girls will think that most guys dont have a fetish mind. Why dont you just pop by sammyboy forum (only if you are prepared to), or check the number of singapore Kazaa user downloading sick porn from the internet. I cant blame you for the lack of understanding in man, because porn in Singapore are only enjoyed behind closed door.<br><br>Like i have said before, singapore women of today are different from women of our parent's generation. And yes, my mum is a singaporean and my dad is a happy retired man. So what are you getting at? If I were you, I will prefer that you keep your parent out of this discussion.<br><br></div>
