He certainly doesn't practice what he preaches:<br><br>1) Can't Cook - Most likely its boiled soiled underwear....which I believe none of us wanna touch<br><br>2) Don't like to have children - Maybe he can't have them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>3) Can't be trusted - Hell yeah! He can't even be left alone with his collegue<br><br>4) Costly - I forsee costly medical bills and he is soooo costly to his wife's health<br><br>5) Only interested in the 5Cs - Oh yes, his interest and character can be described in the 5Cs as well.<br>- Cad<br>- Copulation<br>- Crass<br>- Crapping and shooting off his mouth<br>- Cheap &amp; Cheesy<br>Oops ...that's 6!<br><br>6) Like to compare...sex stories!!!<br><br>7) Dont support you when you are down in trouble - Yeah with you sticking your dick into any hole you see, I won't too. Enjoy HIV<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Don't respect their man - No right to ask for respect when he is such a low-life cretin.<br><br>9) Don't do housework - Don't expect him to. He can't even clean up his own shit. In fact he is waddling in it right now<br><br>10) shallow minded - Woah and he is not! Talk about double standards! If his wife cheats on him he will divorce her but it's ok for him to share his chip with everyone else.<br><br>I don't like to get so personal in a thread but I find that I just can't help myself.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dont think there is anything to be ashamed of as long as I am being honest about what I write. Some might think it is hard to believe, but all I can say is that read what you want and choose what you want believe. However, I would advice that donÂ’t accuse me of faking if you are not prepared to be proven wrong and end up embarrassing yourself by your own weakness.<br><br>What I have posted in Bar is something about what I have experienced in life, and I donÂ’t see a need to hide it by using another Â“nameÂ” for myself. If you girls think that my sex adventure and fetish story is shocking, then I think you aint seen nothing yet. For the benefit of those underage teenagers who are participating in this thread, I will not elaborate more. All I can say is that guys who donÂ’t talk about sex are usually those who are the most perverted ones and be careful.<br></div>
