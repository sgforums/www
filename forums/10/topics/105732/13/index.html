The relationship between a nation affluence and birth rate is inversely proportional.  Once the couples move up on Maslow heirachy of Needs, he/she would wants to provide it to their off-springs.  With their limited resources, some choose not to.<br><br>I know of a lot of working ladies happily married with kids... some looking forward to getting married with kids and share the joy of family life.  There are also some whose make a conscious effort not to...<br><br>HOWEVER, nationality does not come into play in all the decisions above.</div></blockquote>I agree that nationality does not come into play, but you have to agree that most Singapore women tend to be more materialistic and idealistic than other less westernized and developed Asian countries.<br><br>I disagree with you for using Maslow hierarchy on Needs here. I feel that it is what the couple WANTs in life that is preventing them from pro-creation, rather than the Needs. When I say WANTs, I am referring to luxury items such as big cars, private apartment, fine dinning, branded stuff etc..(of you can call it the 5Cs).Does a couple NEED to provide all that 5Cs for their children? I really donÂ’t think so.<br><br>Beside pro-creation, I think it is important for us to also look into the rising divorce cases in Singapore. Sad to say, one of the most common reasons given for divorce is due to money problem. Although they did not specify if the man or women initiated the separation but my guess is that a man is less likely to leave her wife because she is not making enough money.<br><br></div>

I do apologise for the lack of precision for the birth figures, but I'm too lazy to line up at ICA to get a copy of their exact figures.<br><br>And I wouldn't go talking about divorce rates so quickly.  In 2002/3 the strongest rising trend of divorces is amongst women over 50.  These are women who played the dutiful wife the way you're suggesting, only to find years later that they've been shortchanged.  If you want to cite divorce rates, therefore, you're just working against your own argument - better watch those blindly-quoted stats, m'lad. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And once again you're acting upon assumption.
