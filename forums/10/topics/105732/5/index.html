            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fymk:</div><div class="quote_body">Easy for you to say when you have it all.<br><br>Why sg women don't want kids and are so fussy about their partners- because it is practical to do so. I had to migrate to get a higher paying job, study to get even higher pay and at least get the banks to lend me the money to buy my current apartment in Australia. Do I want a relationship and then children? No. I have too much on my plate right now . I can't, let alone , pay off my apartment in full yet ( at least I settled 60% of the loan) . After tax , bills, mortgage and basic shopping needs , I have enough to save for a comfortable retirement in 40 years.<br><br>However , when I think of those back home who don't even have a fortune of securing a job , or those who get paid meagrely - I think I am much better off in my greener pastures.  How many women are paid highly? How many singaporeans can boast that they get paid a 5 figure sum or let alone over 2k per month? Not many. Don't blame it on singaporean women's mentality . Look at the Singaporean society  - we are all about money- not for fun , but out of basic survival. Regrettably some have extended basic survival to maids - why? Because both parents need to work and they need someone to upkeep the place . This is no longer the 1960s/1970s/1980s where the mother is also a loving housekeeper. Haven't you heard of inflation and rising cost?  Parents have to both work to upkeep their children's future, pay the bills, pay off the HDB flat ( which don't come cheap), pay the medical bills , buy the necessities  .Oh I forgot you took up Masters of International Business or whatever .<br><br>Need I remind you that most singaporean parents equate education to monetary success in life too? Shallow mindedness has been inbuilt into society as a whole , not just the women. Men , being traditionally breadwinners, are expected to "succeed " in education to "succeed" in jobseeking , predominantly of managerial preference. So don't blame women for being the shallow minded ones.<br><br>My dad would object to my boyfriends if he thinks they are not "UP TO STANDARD" or have "NO FUTURE". That is  a man who breached poverty to become well-to-do now- and that is my father. By far , all my Singaporean boyfriends , rich and poor, have been rejected by him as not good enough , stupid or useless. If you want to generalise sg women like that , wait til you meet my dad generalising the modern generation of Singaporeans now as "soft and pliable". I don't even escape his scrutiny .<br><br>I cook just about any cuisine - my colleagues love my food. I housekeep my own place - and *surprise surprise * I am a typical singaporean woman.  Do I want to housekeep? Not really . It is exhausting to do so after my work. I work and pay for my postgrad education at the same time. I pay my own bills , buy my own things. MY own MONEY, not the PARENTAL type.<br><br>I wasn't pampered - I worked from 15 years old to buy my own clothing and my little creature comforts because my father said if I wanted my own things , I could buy them myself. My dad could easily get stuff for me but he refused. We could get a maid but my mom said my sis and I  have to learn to pick up after ourselves. In fact I could have gotten alot of things from my parents but I didn't. Yet I am but  a typical singaporean woman.<br><br>Don't generalise. Look at the bigger picture.<br></div></blockquote>Another example of typical sg women. Is money so important that you need to sacrific your love and family life to pay for your apartment?<br><br>What I sad story. I hope you will enjoy living by yourself.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An article that I read<br><br>Quote:<br><br>In Singapore, senior minister Lee Kuan Yew says he used to hold himself responsible for the large number of unmarried women in Singapore, but not anymore. Now he blames it on consumerism and materialism.<br><br>Yew has in the past taken the blame for Singapore's escalating divorce rate and descending birth rate, noting that he had given women equal education and job opportunities as far back as the 1960s. This, he said, has led to a growing number of unmarried women graduates.<br><br>"Singapore women are now as well educated and earning as much as men," he said in a speech. "This has altered the husband-wife relationship and affected the nature of our society. The result has been higher divorce rates, more single-generation families, less children in each family and fewer of the three-generation households."<br><br>But seeing what has happened in places like Japan, the senior minister said, regardless of what he had done, Western influences would still have set in.<br>unquote :<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow, gazelle did u get your post grad degree in some mickey mouse uni? even if u say ur from nus or ntu or some shit like tt, i wouldnt be surprised tt u fail to make your thoughts connect. after all, some fools do go on to nus/ntu. from the sound of your "international" bizness degree, i dun think u r from either of those 2.<br><br>can't believe that u did a post grad degree in bizness and doesnt seem to know the basic rules of hrm. the company "vision" statement is merely to gell employees together, lest they become restless, or in some cases, stupid, like u did. time to go back to school for u!</div>

He didn't date the whole population of stereotypical sg women to earn the right to make his comments.<br><br>Even if he did sociological research , he needs some power in his sampling to find a plausible assumption. He needs to state his methods as well - what type of girls he dated, their income group, social status ( no offence but a doctor will differ highly from a salesgirl in behaviour, a lawyer will differ from a doctor etc), how many girls he dated to base his assumptions, his current status when he was dating the girl, potential confounders , such as parents etc.<br><br>If he wants to comment based on his factual actual happenings - he could pose it as "ten things to consider when you meet the same type of girls I did".  I am not saying he didn't live through it- I sympathise with him that he met those girls who gave him those impressions.<br><br>We only heard his side of the story. Who knows he could be an obnoxious man who expects alot out of a woman? Some singaporean guys I know want their wives to be housewives - period - no discussion. Do I condemn all typical sg guys for that?Do I really want to class them as a typical sg guy?  Not really.  Who knows what went wrong? No offence gazelle  ( you could be a nice guy but I am stating a fact that no one knows two sides of your story in order to agree or disagree with you).</div>

I do not deny some sg girls can be like what he says. What I am disagreeing with is the fact that no one can generalise us like this. Every species have their black sheep. Humans tend to remember bad experiences more than good experiences because of the survival instinct.<br><br>What he is saying in his general view of sg women is akin to :<br><br>I am girl<br>I don't cook<br>Therefore all girls don't cook.<br><br></div>
