            <div class='col-md body'>And how many constitutes "typical"?  Half?  A quarter?  An eighth?  Even if you dated a different woman a day for ten years, it's still less than an eighth of the female population in Singapore.<br><br>You therefore have no grounds upon which to describe the typical Singaporean woman.  Effectively, your use of the word "typical" is tantamount to saying "all", because you have inadequate grounds upon which to base your statements.  Any differentiation between the two words is, in this case, simply academic.</div>

Now he blames it on consumerism and materialism.<br><br>Yew has in the past taken the blame for Singapore's escalating divorce rate and descending birth rate, noting that he had given women equal education and job opportunities as far back as the 1960s. This, he said, has led to a growing number of unmarried women graduates.<br><br>"Singapore women are now as well educated and earning as much as men," he said in a speech. "This has altered the husband-wife relationship and affected the nature of our society. The result has been higher divorce rates, more single-generation families, less children in each family and fewer of the three-generation households."<br><br>But seeing what has happened in places like Japan, the senior minister said, regardless of what he had done, Western influences would still have set in. </strong><br><br>Btw, what make you think that the reason I married a malaysian girl is because I have been snubbed by singaporean women?<br></div>

Unlike Patek and JLC, Rolex does not classify as haute horologie, mainly due to their production numbers.  Next to a JLC movement, a Rolex movement looks crudely machined.<br><br>Rolex's marketing has never been as subtle as that of other fine watch makers, and they tend to pick the low fruit, although they didn't stoop as afr as to jump on the quartz bandwagon like Omega did in the 70's.<br><br>Ultimately, a Rolex is a utilitarian watch - the Oyster case is built to take a lot more punishment than other high-end watches, and that's why Rolexes have been endorsed by Red Adair and COMEX.  I'd be on tenterhooks with a JLC Compressor on my wrist, but a Sea Dweller?  No worries.<br><br>It's a very good point fymk raised about pawning a Rolex, which is another utilitarian issue.  I was chatting with a film producer last month, and he said that if he ever got in trouble anywhere in the world (this fellow was ex-SAS and had been to more than a few hot spots), it was the only watch he could trade for a first-class ticket back home.

If u r looking for excellence in Swiss watch making... JLC and Patek are right there at the top.  Rolex does provide for the liquidity in times of needs.

If u r looking for excellence in Swiss watch making... JLC and Patek are right there at the top.  Rolex does provide for the liquidity in times of needs.  BTW, if you do look back to watches by Rolex in the pre-40s era, the collection is more interesting the normal Daytona/Yachtmaster/Oyster Perpetual...<br><br>Now I am looking for a reasonable rectangular/squared faced Art deco era rolex... </div></blockquote>Try Monster Time at Far East Plaza or Passions at Funan - I'm not sure that the price tag is, though.  I do rememeber a 50's vintage Oyster at $1300 with box and papers at Passions, so you that's the range may be looking at.<br><br>JLC, Patek, AP and VC all have serious drool value, but I tend to be pretty rough on watches and COSC is sufficient in terms of movement quality for me.  Submariners were issued in the Royal Navy, and COMEX insists that their divers only use Sea Dwellers on the job, and that's good enough for me.  Even the Oyster Day-Date was tough enough for Red Adair when he was putting out oil-well fires.  Panerai, with their history in the Italian Navy, also build tough watches of excellent quality, but their looks never took my interest.<br><br>When it comes to chronographs, it's pretty difficult to distinguish between the Omega Speedmaster, TAG's Carrera and Swatch's chrono at a glance.  At the end of the day, the Daytona still stands out amongst the chronos, especially the stainless steel model.  That said, the Speedmaster Broad Arrow is a nice watch.<br><br>Ultimately, TAG fits the wannabe title a lot better than Rolex - of course, a Heuer is a different matter altogether.<br><br>As for the fallacy of price, here's a perfect illiutrsation: who in their right minds would pay Â£139,000 for this?!<br><img src="http://www.thepurists.com/brandjpg/sihh2002/parmigiani/bugattidial.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.thepurists.com/brandjpg/parmigiani/wrist1.jpg"></div>
