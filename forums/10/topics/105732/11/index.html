Guys who have a bone to pick because of their own sad experiences sound petty and truly effeminate to me, with all the senseless ranting and raving.  Let people live the lives they desire, should they choose to be materialistic or otherwise.

If you want to boast - at least show some class when you do it or research something you are not sure about.<br><br>Gazelle , let this typical sg girl enlighten you on classes of watches:<br><br>Patek - established swiss watch  company- used to be owned by nobility - an "old money" (aristocracy) type of watch<br><br>Jaeger LeCoultre  - swiss and exclusive range - they handmake every single part and they are the supplier of clock movements to Cartier . Another "old money" type of watch.<br><br>Rolex is more the watch of new money, sports millionaire  who want to show they have the status. Rolex cannot be compared to the both of the above in terms of price . The difference between patek , jaeger and rolex is that rolex has a lower range for the wannabes while Patek and Jaeger don't - they only have top of the range.

The best part - I knew he is gay ( the goodlooking macho gay type) . You cannot imagine how I wanted to laugh at those sg guys who made those comments.<br><br>His comments are just like justicelegal's , except they are slightly less abrasive but nevertheless abrasive enough.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it looks like things are pretty much well-covered over here, what with points and counterpoints, with a generous serving of inane rambling by Gazelle.  I'll just address a few points:<br><br>BaByBoY, I understand and appreciate what you're saying.  Please refer to my reply to thinger on page 9 of this thread.<br><br>As for the consumerism issue, foxwalk and elindra have got Gazelle dead to rights here.  Then again, one of Gazelle's operating principles is "pot/kettle/black", although I doubt if is bright enough to appreciate the irony of it.<br><br>Rhonda's post pretty much encapsulates what's going on here.  Gazelle's had a few bad experiences, never got over them, and now instead of dealing with his insecurities, he comes up with this list of gripes that is hardly typical of Singaporean women - they're just based on his sad life.<br><br>To try and justify his case, he's claimed to be exactly what Singaporean women are after.  This is ironic since he seems to be trying to make up for things that he couldn't previously deliver to Singaporean women, thereby effectively being driven by what he perceives to be their wish list.  While he claims to be beyond Singaporean women, his life is in fact ruled by them.<br><br>On top of that, the more he writes, the more he shows the extent of his lying through his lack of knowledge of things that someone whom he claims to be ought to know as a matter of course.<br><br>To go back to the point of the original post, therefore, how much stock can one put in the words of a sad and sorry individual who can't let go of his old demons?</div>

Unlike Patek and JLC, Rolex does not classify as haute horologie, mainly due to their production numbers.  Next to a JLC movement, a Rolex movement looks crudely machined.<br><br>Rolex's marketing has never been as subtle as that of other fine watch makers, and they tend to pick the low fruit, although they didn't stoop as afr as to jump on the quartz bandwagon like Omega did in the 70's.<br><br>Ultimately, a Rolex is a utilitarian watch - the Oyster case is built to take a lot more punishment than other high-end watches, and that's why Rolexes have been endorsed by Red Adair and COMEX.  I'd be on tenterhooks with a JLC Compressor on my wrist, but a Sea Dweller?  No worries.<br><br>It's a very good point fymk raised about pawning a Rolex, which is another utilitarian issue.  I was chatting with a film producer last month, and he said that if he ever got in trouble anywhere in the world (this fellow was ex-SAS and had been to more than a few hot spots), it was the only watch he could trade for a first-class ticket back home.  It's more recognisable than the haute horologie watches, and it's very handy if you're stuck somewhere.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kids cost money but they bring priceless gifts<br><br>I WAS surprised, and a little saddened, to read about young married people in Singapore turning away from the prospect of having children ('Me? Have kids? You must be joking'; The Sunday Times, Dec 5).<br><br>What was most upsetting, however, was that some of those interviewed spoke of children in purely financial terms, saying that money spent on children could have been better spent on other things.<br>The organisation I work for, The World Bank, has spent much of the past decade learning directly from poor people that they define their poverty in much more than monetary terms. The poor want more money, certainly, but also a chance to control their lives, to have opportunity, to live free from fear and oppression.<br>In the same way, real wealth cannot be calculated in dollars; it must also be measured by one's personal feelings, peace of mind, one's experience of true love.<br>I married young, and married because I was in love. Twenty-six years later, I am still married, and still in love. We had children early in our marriage, and by the time I was 30, I had four little children and a wife to support.<br>When I was married, I earned about A$100 a week, and we were a single-income family. Many times we struggled to put food on the table, petrol in our car, to make ends meet.<br>But, even then, we had something special, something that no one could put a price on: we had a house full of love and laughter. And, for some reason, we always have had. I think it has to do with that strange truth: give and you shall receive.<br>My wife and I have been immensely fortunate. Our children have been happy, healthy and smart. The older ones have graduated from university, and the others will do so too. They love each other and, when I see them together, I just sit back and smile at the amazing sight of four young adults and the woman I love, joking, laughing, helping each other, sharing their thoughts and dreams.<br>One time, we nearly lost a child through sudden sickness. I was a 10-hour flight away on business. I cried and prayed, and, from the depth of my despair, I realised that there is nothing more precious to me than the family I have and the love we share. Ask any parent of a sick child what price they would pay for a full recovery, and you will hear the same answer.<br>That is why I was saddened by what I read. Singapore is an amazing country. As a guest here, I appreciate every day the clean air, the greenness, the way things work, the lack of corruption, the safety, the opportunities, the amazing energy of the people, and the way people from different religions and nationalities get on together. If ever there was a place to raise a family, it is Singapore.<br>Of course, children cost money, but what price can you put on the feeling you have when you hold your first child and hear the first breath, the first little cry?<br>What price can you put on the sight of your children together at Christmas (mine will be here soon), opening presents and spreading joy, as they have since Santa first visited our tiny house in Melbourne 23 years ago?<br>And for me, what price would I put on the memories of seeing the woman I love raise these children, nurture them and cherish them? I have owned houses and cars; I have thousands of books, hundreds of CDs, and more clothes than I can use. They can all wear out, be stolen, or perish, and I can buy new ones or do without.<br>But touch my family and you touch my heart. This Christmas, many people will exchange gifts, some costing a great deal of money. But the gifts I am most looking forward to giving and receiving are a few priceless smiles and hugs, from the people I know and love best: my family. Peter Stephens<br>Regional Communications<br>Manager<br>The World Bank<br><br>Just curious if our "typical" singaporean sg will think the same way? My guess is not.<br></div>

If you've found true love, well and good regardless of the lady's nationality.<br><br>On the other hand, going <strong>specifically </strong>for a foreign wife because you've been snubbed by Singaporean women is a fool's errand, because:<br>a) not all Singaporean are like what you described<br>b) some foreign women are like what you described<br><br>Nationality is therefore a false criteria for determining if someone is going to be a good mother or wife.
