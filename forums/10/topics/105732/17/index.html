Off to a better starting point.<br><br>Secondly, all the values I had ,my father, the sg man,  taught me.<br><br>Thirdly , asian values have  evolved with time. There was once a time when a woman was a property of her husband. Are you saying that your wife is your property then? There was once a time in asia where men had many wives.
