I think it is kinda dumb to ask me a question when you alredy know the answer.<br><br>Fourthly, you should consider living in shanghai, because those women there usually head the family and control the finances, while man do the cooking. But you will first have to compete with those shanghai women.<br></div></blockquote><strong> Asian values (like the hindu caste system, and our traditionalk chinese custom) dictate that you must be match made and married according to STATUS - and  you are showing us articles about women earning highly and looking down on men who cannot earn as much . Aren't you shooting yourself in the foot ? By right of the chinese custom then - the man who earn less have to marry into the girl's family and take her surname, as well as OBEYING HER. They also have maids to take care of housekeeping in those old chinese days.</strong><br><br>Unfortunately asian values to you, meant women had to be slaves only to their husbands - cook clean and obey you.<br><br>Yes I work hard - I shall also reap the seeds of the  crop I sowed  for the sake of financial security for my parents and I.  Lonely ? I am not - I have my family - far as they seem but still we do talk - I have people who care for me etc.  . Happiness can be found elsewhere other than in marriages , like in volunteer work or religious vocation. There are plenty of disadvantaged families with kids out there to help in the community too.<br><br>And it is also dumb to ask me to move to shanghai when I am doing well where I am. I don't need to compete with shanghai women and vice versa.  I am happy where I am and you make no sense at all.</div>

Is it because your wife is willing to tolerate your indiscretions while another sg girl may not? Your personal  negative experiences with sg girls probably originated from an sg girlfriend of yours who found out you were cheating.<br><br>I pity your wife. I really do. No good wife ( as you so lovingly said about her) deserves this despicable behaviour at all.
