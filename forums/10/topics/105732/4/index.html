            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">I hope you could just take a look at the statistic again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>http://www.singstat.gov.sg/ssn/feat/sep2004/pg12-16.pdf<br></div></blockquote>Yup, took a look at those figures again, and it still doesn't change that fact that in the past two census years, 45,160 women shot a big hole right through your little "life of the typical Singaporean woman" theory.<br><br>Foxwalk's right - you still have no point.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">today (I am 30 btw), I have a 5 figure monthly salary, my condo, my continental car, my lovely wife, my dog and my exciting job that allows me to travel round the world. (actually I am in paris right now and i am with my lovely wife) </div></blockquote>The very fact that you're listing those stats shows that you're more hung-up on your list of sins than Singaporean women are.  Either that or you're dissatisfied with your wife and are now using that list to try and attract a Singaporean replacement.<br><br>In any case, I'm pleased for your current success.  I've got my doctorate, easily make more than a grand a day, and I have a very comfortable life in Singapore and Australia, and so I can understand your being pleased with your current circumstances, although I've travelled so much I can never wait to get off the plane.  Of course, the postgrad years were a bugger, weren't they, watching everyone make money while you were still stuck in school?  I know that one too.<br><br>The question is, it's two years in the past for me, as opposed to your four, and those are times I can look back at fondly and laugh while enjoying my current success.  If you're really that successful, why are you still whining and displaying a dropkick mentality?  I'm a cognitive-behaviourist, not a Freudian, but even so, the underlying message of your posts screams, "INFERIORITY COMPLEX!".  My professional opinion is that you seriously need to get help before you blow a gasket.<br><br>Somehow, though, I've got a nagging feeling that you're not really a postgrad.  Your posts lack the cogency of argument that really ought to be second nature to anyone who has been exposed to the rigours of postgrad education.  A clear example of what I'm talking about is:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">You will probably find this as a joke when you are still young, but trust me, there are so many sg women out there that have given up hope on having children because they cant. Didnt you read that there are rising number of miscarriage despite falling birth rate? Why so?<br><br>As for men, if you are financially stable, you can always have children when you are 40 yr old. Can a women do the same?  </div></blockquote>Uh, let me get this straight - you're 30, and you're trying to give the impression that you're speaking from a 40-year-old's perspective.  There are so many things wrong with your posts:<br><br>1) <strong>Y</strong>ou're 30, and you assume that everybody's younger than you - given that the average Singaporean life span is in the neighbourhood of 70 years, that's a very foolish assumption to make (how the devil did you pass postgrad?  actually, did you actually pass postgrad?).<br>2) <strong>O</strong>r it could be that you're using "young" interchangably with "immature".  In that case, I've got three words for you: Pot.  Kettle.  Black.  That, mind you, is being generous to you.<br>3) <strong>U</strong>sing the phrase "trust me" is a tall order indeed, given your lack of cognizance of basic facts, as well as your tendency to use sweeping generalisations, as well as your tendency to give the impression that you're someone you're not.<br>4) <strong>A</strong>s pointed out before, if you are as successful and contented as you claim, there is absolutely no reason for you to have made that first post in the first place.  I was hesitant about calling you a liar before, but now I've got a clear case to do so.<br>5) <strong>S</strong>peaking in the most condescending manner to people you assumed (once again) to be no match for you educationally or financially was not a wise move.  Whoops - make a couple more grand, spend a few more years in school, and then come back and talk to me.<br>6) <strong>S</strong>adly, you seem to hint at the issue of miscarriages is somehow linked to your theory.  I would suggest you read up on epidemiological issues linked to miscarriages before making a bigger fool of yourself.<br><br>So, what does this all add up to?  Take the first letter of each of the six points above, and maybe you'll get a hint.  To accommodate for your lack of intellectual ability, I've highlighted the letters in question. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">Honestly speaking, I am proud to marry to my wife because I wont be who I am today without her. 4 years ago, I was jobless when I was doing my post grad studies, today (I am 30 btw), I have a 5 figure monthly salary,  my condo, my continental car, my lovely wife, my dog and my exciting job that allows me to travel round the world. (actually I am in paris right now and i am with my lovely wife)<br><br>Honest speaking, money and material stuff does not really bring me happiness. It is my family that provide me the joy in my life.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div></blockquote>Easy for you to say when you have it all.<br><br>Why sg women don't want kids and are so fussy about their partners- because it is practical to do so. I had to migrate to get a higher paying job, study to get even higher pay and at least get the banks to lend me the money to buy my current apartment in Australia. Do I want a relationship and then children? No. I have too much on my plate right now . I can't, let alone , pay off my apartment in full yet ( at least I settled 60% of the loan) . After tax , bills, mortgage and basic shopping needs , I have enough to save for a comfortable retirement in 40 years.<br><br>However , when I think of those back home who don't even have a fortune of securing a job , or those who get paid meagrely - I think I am much better off in my greener pastures.  How many women are paid highly? How many singaporeans can boast that they get paid a 5 figure sum or let alone over 2k per month? Not many. Don't blame it on singaporean women's mentality . Look at the Singaporean society  - we are all about money- not for fun , but out of basic survival. Regrettably some have extended basic survival to maids - why? Because both parents need to work and they need someone to upkeep the place . This is no longer the 1960s/1970s/1980s where the mother is also a loving housekeeper. Haven't you heard of inflation and rising cost?  Parents have to both work to upkeep their children's future, pay the bills, pay off the HDB flat ( which don't come cheap), pay the medical bills , buy the necessities  .Oh I forgot you took up Masters of International Business or whatever .<br><br>Need I remind you that most singaporean parents equate education to monetary success in life too? Shallow mindedness has been inbuilt into society as a whole , not just the women. Men , being traditionally breadwinners, are expected to "succeed " in education to "succeed" in jobseeking , predominantly of managerial preference. So don't blame women for being the shallow minded ones.<br><br>My dad would object to my boyfriends if he thinks they are not "UP TO STANDARD" or have "NO FUTURE". That is  a man who breached poverty to become well-to-do now- and that is my father. By far , all my Singaporean boyfriends , rich and poor, have been rejected by him as not good enough , stupid or useless. If you want to generalise sg women like that , wait til you meet my dad generalising the modern generation of Singaporeans now as "soft and pliable". I don't even escape his scrutiny .<br><br>I cook just about any cuisine - my colleagues love my food. I housekeep my own place - and *surprise surprise * I am a typical singaporean woman.  Do I want to housekeep? Not really . It is exhausting to do so after my work. I work and pay for my postgrad education at the same time. I pay my own bills , buy my own things. MY own MONEY, not the PARENTAL type.<br><br>I wasn't pampered - I worked from 15 years old to buy my own clothing and my little creature comforts because my father said if I wanted my own things , I could buy them myself. My dad could easily get stuff for me but he refused. We could get a maid but my mom said my sis and I  have to learn to pick up after ourselves. In fact I could have gotten alot of things from my parents but I didn't. Yet I am but  a typical singaporean woman.<br><br>Don't generalise. Look at the bigger picture.<br></div>
