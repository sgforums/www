Go do your research - it took me three minutes to dig these statistics up from Singstat.  Shouldn't take you more than a week.<br><br>Here's a more realistic progression of events:<br><br>Gazelle's first post - a list of complaints ludicrous enough to make a 70's Palestinean hijacker sound perfectly reasonable<br><br>Gazelle's second post - Gazelle really gets a case of foot-in-mouth disease by trying to brag on the basis of a series of unfounded claims, in the process achieving the impossible by making himself sound even dumber than he did in his first post<br><br>Gazelle's third post - Gazelle attempts to do a Richard Attenborough with a documentation of the Singaporean woman's experience, based on neither personal experience of being a woman (despite the uh, ethereal, nature of the nom de plume Gazelle) nor any reference that can be cited.  The two girls Gazelle chucked rocks at in kindergarten do not count as a sample.<br><br>Oh my, oh my, Gazelle, what's your next trick going to be?  Come on, everybody, let's hear it for Gazelle, SGForums' answer to Evel Knievel! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
