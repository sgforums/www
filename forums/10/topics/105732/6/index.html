Is it because she realise that she is begining to proof to me that she is just another typical sg women that cant be trusted?</div></blockquote>Nope - the deleted post just broke the flow of my post just before it.  Then again, you're barely literate, so the point would be lost on you.<br><br>When did I become a "she"?  Hey, You're the one with the, ahem, delicate nick. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">I donÂ’t think so. in fact, some of the big guns that I deal with doesnÂ’t even speak a word of English and they really donÂ’t give a damn if you write perfect English or not, what they want to know is Â“Where is the MoneyÂ” </div></blockquote>Yeah, but they're not the ones waving their postgrad about like a flag, are they?  Regardless of linguistic abilities, the poor quality of your arguments here shows clearly that you do not think things through.  I fear that your poor clients are being cheated, paying you a 5-digit salary for nonsensical babble. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">Since I have already share with you about myself, can I then know if you are married, attached or single? I must say that I am shock to learn that you are making Â“easily 1 thousand Singapore dollars per dayÂ”, can I know what kind of job pay you so much and allow you to waste your time in this forum? Since you are making about $365,000 per year, I am sure you must be a millionaire by now? How does it feel to have so much money? Do you find love in money?</div></blockquote>When did this become a case of "I'll show you mine if you show me yours"?  You're the one who started bragging, and I'm just here to let you know that you're a mid-sized fish in a very small bowl. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Well, Mr. High-Finance "Where is the Money", I think you've just shown how small you actually are if you are shocked that I make more than a grand a day, and if you can ask what I do.  Surely, being the high-roller that you claim to be, you would not need to ask this?<br><br>How can I spend so much time on this forum?  You mean you, Mister Vision Man, actually have to ask that one?  Unlike you, I have the independence to do what I need to when I want - you obviously have someone looking over your shoulder, so despite that salary, you're still a small fry.<br><br>Your posts are getting stranger by the minute.  You claim to be so successful, and you're asking me how it feels?  You ought to know - well, that is if your claims weren't fake.<br><br>Okay, okay, just to satisfy your curiosity, it's common knowledge that I'm trained as an organisational psychologist, and I run my own business.  I'm sure you'll understand that my corporate clients value their privacy, so it would be rude of me to reveal their identities and the exact nature of the work that I do for them.  Mind you, in my field, the kind of money I'm talking about is not unusual.  I know someone who makes more than I do, and she spends two days every week in the office, while the other three days are spent with her four kids at her beachside home (which incidentally has an exact replica of her city office).  Good thing I'm not like you - I might feel small next to her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>As for your other question, I'm quite happily attached, and some forumites have met my girlfriend.  Money is an issue - I want to buy her a Rolex, but she just wants a Hamilton! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Well, enough about me - back to you.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">Too good to be true in Singapore, common overseas.</div></blockquote>Did I just see you call your wife "common"?

I don't make it policy to tolerate misogyny - if you do, keep it out of my face.<br><br>If you want to talk about facts, the fact of the matter is that this loser is taking a clump of slime from his low rung on the evolutionary ladder, and trying to hit some women on a higher rung with it.

For all intents and purposes, it was meant to get a bunch of Singaporean guys to dump on Singaporean girls.<br><br>The response of Singaporean women on this forum to this nationalistic misogyny is, in light of the original post's intent, perfectly justified.  Gazelle felt entitled to act like a pig, and he's soundly gotten a reality check here.  The response is perfectly parallel to the thrust of the original argument, although the consensus appears to go in the opposite direction of what gazelle anticipated.<br><br>The "whose is bigger" debate is a corollary issue. Certainly, for the status that Gazelle is claiming, he is obliged to act with more decorum than he currently displays.  On top of that, he listed his circumstances as a bat to beat Singaporean women over the head with.  In addition, his responses to me indicate that he's nowhere near as successful as he claims he is, otherwise he wouldn't be asking those questions of me.  He's a very little person with delusions of grandeur, and he's already shown himself to be full of hot air, and his bat's now made of sponge - he can try to whack whomever he wants with it because it no longer has effect.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by diggo:</div><div class="quote_body">I thot at the end of the day, it is whether u love our partner or not... and take all the pros and cons, lock, stock and barrel.... when does nationality comes into play here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>Exactly.

He needs to state his methods as well - what type of girls he dated, their income group, social status ( no offence but a doctor will differ highly from a salesgirl in behaviour, a lawyer will differ from a doctor etc), how many girls he dated to base his assumptions, his current status when he was dating the girl, potential confounders , such as parents etc.<br><br>If he wants to comment based on his factual actual happenings - he could pose it as "ten things to consider when you meet the same type of girls I did".
