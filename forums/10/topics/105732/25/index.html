If you want to talk about sex and fantasy, we can always set up another thread in BAR and talk about it.<br><br>Only fools like you will think that educated and successful man dont talk about sex. If you want to know about wild sex, maybe you should try dating the CEO of some big japanese company. I am sure those 50 , 60 years japanese man will know how to make you feel good.<br><br>(I am truly honoured that you have request my personal attention.)<br><br>1)  Why are you bitc hing around asking why I didnt response to your posting. It seems to me that you have unknowingly been attracted by my 5 figure salary and the big CHIP. You seem to be depreived of sex and 5Cs? Care to share about your boring sex life?<br><br>[/quote]<br>Back off . So what if you earn millions - your character has lost respect the way you brag about your unfaithfulness<br><br><blockquote><br><br>2) i believe the main reason why you are being offended by my post is because you somehow fit into the typical singapore girl that i am talking about. It will be worsdt if you are still single and plan to remain single for the rest of your life.<br><br></blockquote>Some women do remain celibate the rest of their lives serving a religious vocation  helping the poor and unfortunate. Like Mother Theresa.<br><br><blockquote><br><br>3) Let me tell you something about sg women, Most sg women here, which include you, are suckers for 5Cs. The reason why i am saying this is because most sg girl I slept with have this thing in common. Like I said before, I have dated girls from different walks of life, therefore I am confident to say that what i said is at least 75% true.<br><br>I am sure there will be women who say that only Slu.ts believe in 5Cs and bla bla bla....bla bla bla..., but sad to say those who say this are usually the ugly and left over ones.<br></blockquote>Or those women have already attained 5Cs by themselves . Oh wait .... 1c could mean credit rating instead of credit card.<br><br><blockquote><br>4) Do you know what is my impression of sg women? They are cheap and cannot be trusted. (maybe accept the ugly ones)<br></blockquote>You know what I think of you. You are worse than cheap <span style="color: darkred;"> You are disgustingly selfish ....that you risk your wife's life for your own satisfaction and you will blame every one except yourself for  your mistakes</span><br><br><blockquote><br>5) Beside being cheap, I think they lack character. Beside going shopping, breast enlargement and EXPRESSION, I dont think they have much things to do in life. Maybe some loner like you might prefer to hide yourself behind the computer rubbing shoulder with Gendanken and his rolexes.<br></blockquote>Well , I think <span style="color: red;"> you lack character yourself , Mr Loss of Credibility and selfish potential STD spreader .</span><br><br><blockquote><br>6) The reason why I didnt marry a singapore women is not because I cant, it is because I know that all these nice legs, pretty face and small tits are all going to fade away when they hit their mid 30s. And I am not prepared to live another 40 years with a women that has got nothing.<br></blockquote><span style="color: green;">Or maybe you know an sg woman won't tolerate your unfaithfulness while your poor wife sits in silence . I truly sympathise with her</span><br><br>[quote]<br>Btw, Why are you to call me an idiot? Do you like it if i call you a piece of left over meat that is waiting to be sold?<br></div></blockquote>At least a piece of meat will not be as venomous as your sexual behaviour is to your wife.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Basically, we all get what we seek for.<br><br>If men step out like Gazelle, flaunting his 5-figure salary (oh! $111.11 is ALSO 5-figures!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ) and his chip, guess what kind of women would be attracted to him like bees to flowers?  That's right... those who want to get their hands on his $$ so much so that they're willing to put up with his chip and the obvious vacuum up where his cerebral matter ought to be and his utter lack of morals.<br><br>So, after attracting these loose women, who don't think twice about jumping into bed with their next big meal ticket, he starts getting myopic and starts to think that the TYPICAL (there's that word again!) sg woman is just like one of his many flings.<br><br>Guess what Gazelle, there are dozens upon dozens of us out there who are atypical by your lousy yardstick.  And that's because any one of us will just take one look at you, see you for the absolute shameless cad you are, and not give you time of day any more.  Those of us who are atypical have our standards and you rank with the scum of the earth, not even worth our second glance.<br><br>What's your problem, little man?  Our intelligence and strong characters making you feel a bit insecure?  If you want to lord it over us atypical women, show us something impressive and real, not a whole lot of hot air, which you are till now, obscenely full of.<br><br>I'm sure a lot of the other atypical women out there would make no apologies about sinking our heels into this sorry little doormat of a man.  If you want to be amongst us, show your verve.  Otherwise, get the hell outta the way and yes, attract only the typical kinda sg girl and then complain and be a sour puss about it.<br><br>Saaaaad.  You are sooooo effeminate in sooooo many ways, it's brutally sad.<br><br></div>
