Of course its not very nice that "men sit back and make sweeping statements......and expect women (would your rather i spelt this "wemyn"?) to take their orders", but honestly, its not like females dont act that way to guys.<br><br>Its ten in the bloody morning so i'll try and put this into a half-decent post, excuse me if i dont.<br><br>yeah so, the point is that, in general, females <strong>love</strong> slamming guys for not understanding them; for too much criticism; not enough understanding; blah blah blah.<br><br>but at the same time, guys come up with this bullshti about wemyn (add gazelle's 10 points here and change the grammar to make it read well),<br><br>so all hell breaks loose when guys and chicks clash and start fuckin arguing with each other.  and its a vicious cycle because girls always go "he doesnt understand - hes a guy - guys think differently" and the guys go "she doesnt understand - shes a girl - they think different to guys".<br><br>this is way off the topic now so excuse me but its not like anyone really cares innit?<br><br>so since there is not...i dont knwo how to say,  a standardized 'protocol' of commuication that exists between men and womyn - we get big arsed fuckups.  fair enough?<br><br>now back to the topic of "we should all prey on gazelle"<br>yeah okay, admittedly, some (using it loosely) of his points are a bit unfair towards womyn, and of course do not reflect what all men in singapore think, but you have to admit that it is most probably based on the truth.  think about it for a tic,<br>a statement is true, or<br>a statement is false, or<br>a statement is based on the truth.<br><br>so, gazelles statements arent totally true are they?  so his statement is untrue.<br>gazelles statements arent totally false are they?  im sure the girls here have girlfriends that fit gazelle's "mean arsed singaporean bitch" criteria, so his statement isnt false either.<br>so we're left with gazelle's statement being based on true events, because who the hell in the world would waste time on stupid boards like these typing in ridiculously retarded ideas in the hope that anyone will agree?<br><br>bah.  anyway (for this next point of mine to work you have to agree that what gazelle says holds <span style="font-style: italic;">some</span> truth),<br>because what gazelle says is based on the truth, it would also logicially mean that his points can be true for a singapore girl.  they DO NOT HAVE to be true, but they CAN be.  agreed?<br><br>So, if i dived into a pool or singapore girls, there would be a chance that i caught a girl with gazelle's "bad traits" that he mentioned right?  If you can agree that there IS a chance (even if its slim) that the girl i land up with has the potential to be a bitch, then what Gazelle says in his topic, "10 things to consider when marrying a typical singporean girl" HAS TO BE TRUE for guys.  This whole paragraph isnt based on personal thoughts if you havent realized, to follow it you need to think logically.  (hopefully im awake enough now)<br><br>so anyway, back to "10 things to consider...girl", what gazelle is saying has to be true.  He's warning guys that if you marry A TYPICAL SG GIRL (note: he didnt say "THE typical", he said "A typical") guys have got to be wary that they do not carry the 10deadly sins.  In this context, typical can mean "average", not "sterotypical" or anything else with connotations like that.<br><br>okay guess what?  i just lost my trend of thought and cant really understand what i just typed.<br><br>anyways, gazelle stop talking too much shit.<br><br>ged, stop pissing on him.  i mean, go on if you want because i think its funny(as in funny, not witty).  i just had to take a stand, you know, before i typed anything back and he seemed outgunned and outnumbered.<br><br>the rest of the girls - yes yes, i agree, singapore men are a pain in the arse sometimes.  for the record, im not singaporean.  and i dont have to do ns.  yippie.<br><br>the rest of the guys - yes yes, singapore women can be a pain in the arse too...dont fret, any sort of woman can.<br><br>im going for breakfast.  enjoy work to those that have a job.<br><br></div>
