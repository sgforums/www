            <div class='col-md body'>Ah, it's good to have the normal thinger back! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I respectfully disagree with you on the point about "typical" - like elindra said, it has a connotation of the majority, and is therefore a generalisation.  To have the grounds to make such a claim, Gazelle would have needed to take a significant sample of the female Singaporean population, and it's pretty obvious that he's extrapolated his conclusion from a series of bad personal experiences.  Those are inadequate grounds for his claims.<br><br>I had a number of obejctives in taking this line with Gazelle:<br><br>The first was to get past his thin veneer of politeness and get him to reveal his true attitudes about women.  As you can see in his posts here, he really does have a rather horrifying and crude perspective - certainly he displays no respect for women.<br><br>Second, I strongly suspected that he was being driven by an inferiority complex.  Sure enough, his responses have demonstrated that trend.  A bonus is a growing indication that his claims are false.<br><br>Third, I'll admit it - I'm just the sort of guy who loves schadenfreude.  It's been a good chortle running rings around him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Hopefully you can see the method behind my madness.  Beyond the mockery, I take a very dim view of such attatudes towards women.  If it took vicious humour to reveal the lowness of the attitude driving Gazelle's list, so be it - that omelette took a few broken eggs and I'm not going to apologise for that.<br><br>As for the "head up the arse" issue, hey, I read it as a challenge and responded as such.  No blood, no foul.<br><br>Cold turkey for five days?  Have you just quit smoking?  If so, good stuff! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
