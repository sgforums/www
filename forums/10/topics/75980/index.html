There is a high chance that some women will abuse this law to swallow up men possession and property. Times have changed where the women are longer weak and fiancially dependent. From what I see, men seems to be the victim upon divorce. Men have to give up their property, have disadvantages to their rights in children and have to provide alimony to the wife even if the cause of divorce is due to the women, even if the wife earns much more than the husband. Why ? I ask again, is it a sin to be borned as a man ? Why do we face this unequal treatment.<br><br>And don't talk about being "gentlemen" to me.
