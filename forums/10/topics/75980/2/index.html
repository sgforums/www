Just reading it literally, it just implied "I do not care what work the women had done, wat work the men has performed or why they were divorced, the men had to give 1/2 of his possession to the women". Why state such an unfair law ? Whether will it be followed closely depends on the judge himself. Some of them may follow strictly while other just close an eye. Why expose men in such an unfavourable situation ?<br><br>If you are talking about women being house wives, there are also woman who refuse to work to contribute to the household income. When they divorce, she claims to be a housewife and thus get her 50% for doing nothing. Working life is harsh while working at house is so much easier. Strictly speaking housewife work is no different for being a maid (no office working hours apply, nor does performance bonuses, sick leave, etc) . Why need to give executive pay for the job of a maid ? In fact she should get <strong>1/2 pay </strong>for being a maid since she is also taking care of <strong>herself and his husband family</strong>.

Plainly put, what I said was the maid of a wife can work herself to the bone and she still WON'T get 50% of the poor guy's hard earned assets. Yes, IN REALITY, the executive's hard cold cash gets him more than 50%. Now, if we could read and interpret these legal clauses and whatnots, who would need lawyers? One clause states this, you read alittle further on, another clause says it has to be read in conjunction with yet some other clause in dunno what Act.

Anyway, I will just give my last words.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Strictly speaking housewife work is no different for being a maid (no office working hours apply, nor does performance bonuses, sick leave, etc) . Why need to give executive pay for the job of a maid ? In fact she should get 1/2 pay for being a maid since she is also taking care of herself and his husband family. Why must they receive 1/2 of men property, who may have work OT, faced much work related stress, slog through work to finally able to afford the properties they have. </strong></blockquote>Sigh ... when you make statements like this ... Sigh. Broaden your horizons, kid. When women come across boys like you, all they <strong>can</strong> say to them is : Sorry man, the society is stuck at giving women rights and men are born to be givers. So stated by Socrates of Sgforums.<br><br>You might want to consider this. An <strong>executive</strong> is a broadly used term these days. Helping you along, some examples are:  <strong> Admin executive </strong> possibly glorified name for <strong>clerk</strong> ;  <strong> sales executive </strong> possibly pretty name for <strong>salesperson </strong>. No insults intended.<br><br>OT? What are the acceptable office hours for wives and maids before OT applies to them? It's ok, we'll generous here. We won't need to take into consideration the fact that there are executives in offices who take coffee break, lunch break, smoke break and tea break. We'll close a blind eye, too, to executives who aren't quite efficient enough to complete their work within designated work hours.<br><br><blockquote><strong>From what I have heard from friends outside and from the accounts of male victims, although female may not get 50%, they get something close to it.</strong></blockquote>In a separate Socrates of Sgforums response:<br><br><blockquote><strong>From wat I had seemed, the percentage is 70%. I know a lot of real life examples too and they lose out more than 50% to the wife. So why do women get 70% while the guy had to lose this 70%? I can give out real life examples too but I don't want.</strong></blockquote>Err ... can make up your mind or not, so what is it? Less than 50%? 50%? More than 70%? 100%? Cannot expect to be scoring As with comments like this.<br><br><blockquote><strong>So what are you trying to say ? Do you mean just because they do little work like mopping the floor once per week, or washing laundry, then they deserves the full 50% of what men had earned ? Speaking from the views after working, do yout hink this is fair ?</strong></blockquote>Sigh ... yes. <strong>In your instance</strong>, yes. Certainly the full 50% and more of what you earn (as you claim). In fact, 100% would be insufficient because here we must take into consideration the pain and suffering your girl will have to go through if you keep this up  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  There are many households whose floors are mopped more than once a week. Washing laundry, the easiest part, comes with ironing (don't be picking up 100% linen wear if you aren't going to do the ironing). There are household environments that aren't as trouble-free or maintenance free as yours, which could very well be the hard work of another person or persons other than you, whose efforts have clearly gone unnoticed and unappreciated  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>PS. Good job with the tunnel vision. And ... I did say I've seen the issue from both sides. I did say that there were good men who might have married the wrong women. I also said laws should be to protect the majority, not the minority. Not everything can be measured in dollars and cents, especially so if you can't see things from a wide enough perspective.

They just need a woman who would do the housework for them (with the special packages called 'sex' and 'childbirth') FOR FREE, and when divorced, have no need to give the ladies back anything in return (that's the best result, if it's possible.
