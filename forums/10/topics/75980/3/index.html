            <div class='col-md body'>What's wrong with NS for ladies? And why does it have to be for the military? After all, I don't see how female NS can't involve stuff like nursing or the other vocations females are strong at. Why must it be military? And since both genders undergo NS, the pay difference can now be gotten rid off, we have two million more people trained in skills that can serve the nation in an emergency, and it can really shapen up our ladies to be confident, independent individuals who know how to take care of themselves. If virtually every female has the experience of nursing and living on within their means for even three months of their training, would it not be a positive experience? Why shy from it?<br><br>Besides, my mother herself underwent BMT (yes, all the combat military training), when she signed on to SAF, it really isn't as bad as it seems. Any ordinary girl can make it through. It's not a matter of physical strength or prowless, it's all in the mind.<br><br>Making a big deal out of physical pregnancy and birth as a female issue is bizzare, considering it is a natural biological function. If pregnancy was really that hard and dangerous, as the pro-abortion folks would have you believe, then our mortality rate would be far, far higher for pregnant birth.<br><br>No. While pregnancy is an issue of great physical changes which can be distressful or painful. It is largely a very safe affair, and hardly anything in which the typical heality woman should be put in great peril over. Seems that the most complains on how difficult and painful pregnancy is comes from modern women, the older women of tradition, while considered kept by feminists, I propose, are those who are the real tough, independent and confident women, as opposed to their modern counterparts.<br><br>The one who sustains the most trauma, change and pain in birth? In reality it is the baby, being born is far, far more tramautic then pregnancy for the mother, not to mention in Singapore, great parents have no quams about murdering 13,000 babies each year.<br><br>Of course, one needs to know that bringing up a child goes far, far beyond pregnancy. As a matter of fact, the twenty or so years that follow birth, is far more important then the nine months in determining the person, if you have any at all, effect on soceity. The father's role in parenthood is equally as important as the mother's. Despite what feminists might have you believe.<br><br>The issue of birth as a trump card is ridiculus, considering it is a natural biological function and frankly real women who believe in girl power will not use it as an excuse as if it's some disability and liability.</div>

However, the other guys are not referring to these services, I believe. Otherwise I wouldn't have minded half as much.<br><br><blockquote>Besides, my mother herself underwent BMT (yes, all the combat military training), when she signed on to SAF, it really isn't as bad as it seems.

Seems that the most complains on how difficult and painful pregnancy is comes from modern women, the older women of tradition, while considered kept by feminists, I propose, are those who are the real tough, independent and confident women, as opposed to their modern counterparts.</blockquote>Please. How much, honestly, do you know about childbirth? Have you gone through it yourself? Did the men ever does? Maybe the latter is a senseless question. OF COURSE! Men doesn't have to give birth! The most they ever do is to be with their wife and watch. But even that is traumatic to them, what makes you think that the women is having it easier?<br><br>I don't deny that there are women out there who gives birth without much pain (god knows how) but the majority suffers greatly. It's not just the process of giving birth itself, but also the burden on your womb for ten whole months. Have you tried doing what Phua Chu Kang did in one of his episodes, pretending to be pregnant with a sack of beans? Real pregnancy is even more dangerous and exhausting than that.<br><br>A miscarriage could also mean that not only the baby's, but the mother's life is in danger as well. But of course you wouldn't know or understand that. It's just that a healthier woman has a higher chance to pull it through but even that isn't a 100% guarantee either.<br><br>What makes you think modern women are exaggerating things? You haven't gone through it yourself. Neither have you seen it yourself, right? What makes you think the older generation doesn't think childgiving is painful and hard? Have you ever asked them before? Just because they don't talk a thing about it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.<br><br>You are foolish when you say women of the older generation is independent. Women rights almost existed nowhere until the modern age and most of it were fought back by the women themselves while men protested against it. Do I even have to mention how women used to be treated, and seen as PROPERTIES instead of HUMANS? This view still exists even today.<br><br><blockquote>The one who sustains the most trauma, change and pain in birth? In reality it is the baby, being born is far, far more tramautic then pregnancy for the mother, not to mention in Singapore, great parents have no quams about murdering 13,000 babies each year.</blockquote>I wonder at your intelligence when you say that. Traumatic? How? I don't even remember how I was being pulled out of my mother's womb. Do you? Nobody does. If you don't remember a single thing, how much of a trauma is that?<br><br><blockquote>Of course, one needs to know that bringing up a child goes far, far beyond pregnancy.

Bringing up a child is much much more difficult than giving birth to the child but that doesn't mean it doesn't matter at all, and that it doesn't hurt.<br><br>And I do believe a father's role is as important as a mother's. I've never said otherwise but it's also common knowledge that lots of men out there, could not have enough time for his family because of work. Thumbs up for guys who could manage work and domestic affairs equally well.<br><br><blockquote>The issue of birth as a trump card is ridiculus, considering it is a natural biological function and frankly real women who believe in girl power will not use it as an excuse as if it's some disability and liability.  </blockquote>It's not ridiculous. If men could, I would have recommended guys to go through it themselves and let the ladies rest for a couple of years though I believe in less than five years after that, most guys would demand us ladies to go back to our very own special national service. Freudian slip. I mean <strong>WORLD SERVICE</strong>.<br><br>From your post, I guessed you are a guy. If you are a woman (which is not very likely), I despise you for the way you are undermining the importance and sacredness of childbirth.<br><br>Btw, the way you put it, feminists = more rights for women and less rights for men. That's <strong>WRONG</strong>. Look up the dictionary and it will tell you feminists are people who fights for equal rights for both genders and feminists aren't only women. Males could be feminist too, if they believes in equal right. I don't blame the common misunderstanding though. There are lots of anti-men women out there calling themselves feminists and so on afterall.<br><br>Good day to you.</div>

Though, to be fair, have the adulterous woman have some sort of penalty or something. and even if the woman is not finacially independent, she should not get the property at all, or perhaps only a small percentage, because if we do it your way, there will be some greedy bitches who will abuse the system, and not work, just marry, divorce, get property.<br><br>well, you are not a militant feminist. they would have screamed at you for even suggesting that men should be treated fairly...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We need to get this in perspective. The only reason that the man and woman have gotten together in the first place should have been their dedication towards each other.<br><br>It is through this dedication towards each other's welfare and well-being that they decide to marry. It is when marriages break down that a division of assets prove an extreme headache. Therefore it is important that the husband and wife both understand their commitments towards each other, and contribute accordingly. Otherwise, such a marriage would not work.<br><br>In the sad case of a division of assets, it should be in accordance with the contributions towards the marriage. Those who contribute more should get a bigger share of the assets. That way, any free-loading spouse will not be able to take advantage of the law.<br><br>I do support the abolishment of the Women's Charter, and the imposition of an Sexual Equality Charter, advocating fair and equal treatment towards both sexes, instead of a one-sided law which covers only ladies. While women are usually percieved as the weaker sex, and need protecting, there are some cases of abuses on men by women, and the law needs to protect them too. Such a law will ensure uniform coverage, and also solidify the standing of women as equals of men in the society.</div>
